	On January 25, 2017, Saratoga Resources, Inc. (the Company) entered into a new employment agreement with its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Thomas Cooke.





	The employment agreement (i) has a three-year term and automatically renews for additional one-year terms thereafter unless either party provides notice of non-renewal at least thirty days in advance of the end of the then current term; (ii) provides for a base salary of $250,000 annually, subject to periodic review and upward adjustment by the board or compensation committee; (iii) provides for discretionary bonuses from time to time as determined by the board or compensation committee; (iv) provides additional benefits, vacation pay and expense reimbursement consistent with Company policy and that of other senior officers; and (v) provides for a 5-year stock option grant to purchase 500,000 shares of common stock at fair market value on the date of grant, vesting 20% on the date of grant and 20% each six months thereafter.  The employment agreement includes a deferral and accrual provision under which base salary commenced to accrue from May 26, 2016, the date of rejection of Mr. Cookes prior employment agreement, and all base salary accruing from that date, as well as expenses remaining unreimbursed, accrue and payment of the same is deferred until such time as the Companys board determines, in its sole discretion, that the Company has adequate financial resources to pay such deferred amounts and current base salary and expenses, in part or in whole. Salary deferred under such provision bears simple interest at ten percent per annum and expense reimbursements deferred under such provision bear simple interest at thirteen percent per annum.





	Reference is made to the employment agreement of Mr. Cooke, a copy of which is filed herewith, for a full description of the terms of employment.

	(b)



	The Executive understands that the Company and its Subsidiaries will receive from third parties confidential or proprietary information (

	Third Party Information

	) subject to a duty on the part of the Company and its Subsidiaries to maintain the confidentiality of such information and to use it only for certain limited purposes.  During the Employment

	1.8




	Non-Compete; Non-Solicitation

	.




	(a)



	The Executive acknowledges and agrees with the Company that the Executives services to the Company and its Subsidiaries are unique in nature and that the Company and its Subsidiaries would be irreparably damaged if the Executive were to provide similar services to any Person competing with the Company and its Subsidiaries or engaged in a similar business.  The Executive further acknowledges that in the course of his employment with the Company he will become familiar with the Companys and its Subsidiaries trade secrets and with other Confidential Information.  During the Noncompete Period, he shall not, directly or indirectly, either for himself or for any other Person, permit his name to be used by or participate in any business or enterprise (including, without limitation, any division, group or franchise of a larger organization) that engages or proposes to engage in the Business in the Restricted Territory.  For purposes of this Agreement, the term 

	participate in

	 shall include, without limitation, having any direct or indirect interest in any Person, whether as a sole proprietor, owner, stockholder, partner, member, joint venturer, creditor or otherwise, or rendering any direct or indirect service or assistance to any Person (whether as a director, officer, supervisor, employee, agent, consultant or otherwise).  Nothing herein will prohibit the Executive from mere passive ownership of not more than two percent (2%) of the outstanding stock of any class of a publicly-held corporation whose stock is traded on a national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter market.  As used herein, the phrase 

	mere passive ownership

	1.9




	Enforcement

	.



	(a)



	Without limitation, the Parties agree and intend that the covenants contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to be a series of separate covenants and agreements, one for each and every county or political subdivision of each applicable state of the United States with respect to the Restricted Territory.  It is the desire and intent of the Parties hereto that the provisions of this Agreement be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the laws and public policies of each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought.  Accordingly, if, at the time of enforcement of Sections 1.5, 1.6, 1.7 or 1.8, a court holds that the restrictions stated herein are unreasonable under circumstances then existing, the Parties agree that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the maximum period, scope or geographical area reasonable under such circumstances will be substituted for the Noncompete Period, Nonsolicitation Period, scope or Restricted Territory.  Furthermore, such substitution will apply only with respect to the operation of such provision in the particular jurisdiction in which such adjudication is made.



	(b)



	Among other matters, because the Executives services are unique and because the Executive has access to Confidential Information and Intellectual Property, the Parties agree that money damages would be an inadequate remedy for any breach of Sections 1.5, 1.6, 1.7 or 1.8.  Therefore, in the event of a breach or threatened breach of Sections 1.5, 1.6, 1.7 or 1.8, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective successors or assigns may, in addition to other rights and remedies existing in their favor, apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for specific performance and/or injunctive or other relief in order to enforce, or prevent any violations of, the provisions hereof (without posting a bond or other security).  In addition, in the event of an alleged breach or violation by Executive of any of Sections 1.5, 1.6, 1.7 or 1.8, the restricted periods set forth in such Sections shall be tolled until such breach or violation has been cured.  The Parties hereby acknowledge and agree

	- 6 -



	 














	that (i) performance of the services of the Executive hereunder may occur in jurisdictions other than the jurisdiction whose law the Parties have agreed shall govern the construction, validity and interpretation of this Agreement, (ii) the law of the State of Texas


	shall govern construction, validity and interpretation of this Agreement to the fullest extent possible, and (iii) Sections 1.5, 1.6, 1.7 and 1.8 shall restrict the Executive only to the extent permitted by applicable law.  The Executive expressly agrees and acknowledges that the covenants of the Executive contained in Sections 1.5, 1.6, 1.7 and 1.8 are (x) reasonably necessary for the protection of the Companys interests, (y) made in consideration of (A) the terms of employment under this Agreement and other compensation provided to the Executive by the Company and its Subsidiaries and (B) the benefits derived or to be derived, directly or indirectly, by Executive from being provided access to Confidential Information, and (z) not unduly restrictive upon the Executive.
