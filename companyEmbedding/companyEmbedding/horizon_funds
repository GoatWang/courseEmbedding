Fund Description
 
Launched in January of 2012, Horizon’s Active Asset Allocation Fund provides investors with
global ETF exposure. The investment objective of the Horizon Active Asset Allocation Fund is capital appreciation. The fund is managed using a multi-disciplined global asset allocation strategy that primarily uses exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to implement its objectives. There are nearly 2,000 ETFs in over 500 different investable segments. By employing an active asset allocation strategy, the fund seeks to navigate volatile market swings, capture upside price moves in rising markets and reduce downside risk when markets decline.


aspects of this active fund

Opportunistic Strategy: A single investment in the Horizon Active Asset Allocation Fund accesses a large universe of global investment opportunities. It considers more than 2,000 ETFs composed of investments in a variety of instruments, including market, style, sector, country and currency indexes.
Flexible management: This fund is actively managed, using flexible asset allocation techniques to navigate volatile market swings.
Risk Strategy: Managing risk is just as important as investment selection to the fund managers. Assembling portfolios of diversified asset classes and having the ability to make timely adjustments in allocation weightings may help mitigate market risk.

Disclosure




Mutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. In addition to the costs, fees, and expenses involved in investing in ETFs, ETFs are subject to additional risks including the risks that the market price of the shares may trade at a discount to its net asset value ("NAV"), an active secondary trading market may not develop or be maintained, or trading may be halted by the exchange in which they trade, which may impact a Fund's ability to sell its shares. The Fund may invest in foreign securities which involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. These risks are greater in emerging markets. Investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise. This risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities. Investment by the Fund in lower-rated and non-rated securities presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher-rated securities. Small and Medium capitalization companies tend to have limited liquidity and greater price volatility than large capitalization companies. Investments in Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) involve additional risks such as declines in the value of real estate and increased susceptibility to adverse economic or regulatory developments. The Fund may also use options, which have the risks of unlimited losses of the underlying holdings due to unanticipated market movements and failure to correctly predict the direction of securities prices, interest rates and currency exchange rates. The investment in options is not suitable for all investors. Diversification does not assure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market.

FLEXIBILITY can TURN CHANGES
INTO ADVANTAGES.



 
 
 





We believe the active and unpredictable market creates opportunities for experienced and disciplined managers to capture value for portfolios.



 



















OUR SCOPE






We believe a global perspective is crucial for an active strategy. The range of possibilities is expanded when we look at global capital markets rather than domestic alone. 
























OUr NATURE






The markets evolve. The next ten years most likely will not look like the last ten years. We must meet the world where it is rather than rely on where it was or assume where it will be. We believe a flexible response is required.
























OUR PRocess 






Our team, staffed with expertise in various disciplines, meets daily to make investment decisions based on multiple sources of information. We know what we own in the portfolio, and why.





 
 
 








100% Active



 
 
 







“We introduced the Horizon Active Asset Allocation Fund to give advisors and investors a simple way to invest in our Economic, Quantitative and Fundamental strategy through an actively managed, open-end mutual fund."

FREE FUNDRAISING






YouCaring is dedicated to helping as many people as possible. This is why we will never charge anyone to raise money on our site.

Start your own fundraiser today.
It's free!
Create Fundraiser







Our Crowdfunding Platform Charges $0
Most crowdfunding sites charge 5% to 10% in fees just to use their platform. We never have and never will. This is because we believe that for people facing life’s challenges, every dollar counts. With more than $500 million in donations raised, our free fundraising platform has saved fundraisers more than $13 million in fees.

0% fee















5% – 10% fee









Donation Processor Costs

All online fundraising requires a third-party credit card processor such as PayPal, WePay or Stripe. These processors allow money to be safely collected and transferred online, but they do charge small fees for this service. Each donation processor charges 2.9% plus $0.30 per transaction.
This is not a YouCaring fee.

To learn more about our donation processors, read our blog post Which Donation Processor Is Right for Your Fundraiser. Rest assured, you can change donation processors at any time during your campaign. Simply contact us and we’ll be happy to guide you through the process.






Keep More of Your Money

When a donation is processed, the donation processor deducts their cost from the donation total. For example, if someone donates $100, the donation processor will take 2.9% plus $.30, resulting in a $3.20 fee. Other sites charge an additional 5% to 10% just to use their site.
YouCaring saves you money by charging no site fees.

How YouCaring Supports Itself

We rely on the generosity of our users to help us provide a free crowdfunding platform for those struggling with life’s challenges. At times, we do receive financial support from our amazing processors and other partners. People who give to fundraisers on YouCaring have the option of providing a voluntary contribution to support our operations and help keep fundraising free. We are incredibly grateful to those who have contributed and in doing so, chosen to participate in our mission to bring life-changing philanthropy to as many people as possible.

Flood of new fund product on horizon

Barry Fennell, Senior Research Analyst at Lipper

Monday, 31 Mar 2014 |  8:00  AM ETCNBC.com



SHARES











  With more than 12,000 different share classes of equity mutual funds and over 6,000 share classes of taxable bond funds, one might assume the fund industry has launched a sufficient number of products to adequately cover every conceivable asset class, sector or investment strategy.  
  Additionally, there are more than 1,000 equity and almost 400 taxable bond exchange-traded funds available that track everything from short-term natural gas futures to the Russian equity markets and semiconductor stocks.

  The fund industry, however, historically has liked to create products to diversify its asset base in the hope of generating additional revenue. In the future, look for new mutual funds and ETFs that focus on income solutions—to meet the thirst for income demonstrated by growing numbers of retirees—and those that address retirees' risk-aversion in the wake of equity-markets gyrations over the past 15 years.  
  Building on the risk-aversion and capital-preservation themes, also look for new funds that come with a stated goal of delivering consistent returns. Those will come in the alternative-investment space: absolute return and market-neutral products or some variation that emphasizes event-driven outcomes.

Additionally, indexing with a "twist"—so-called smart-beta strategies—will be promoted by fund companies as an alternative or middle ground to traditional indexing and active management.

  New funds focused on income solutions will be in demand, largely as a result of the macro investing environment. Following a three-decades-long bull market in bonds, the search for yield remains in full force. Yield compression and the resulting bond price appreciation have also added to the income-solution challenge by reducing the number of attractive capital appreciation opportunities available in fixed income.  









  Products that have a tactical component—which can be utilized effectively to allocate across the different segments of the fixed-income universe to those the fund manager perceives as having the most attractive relative valuations—have strong appeal, particularly for investors seeking both greater yield and total return.  
  Unconstrained and alternative-income funds have been launched to help meet this demand, and their number should continue to grow.  
Read MoreSpoiled for choice? Less is much more 
  For example, a recently launched unconstrained bond fund with this "go anywhere" philosophy is the Neuberger Berman Unconstrained Bond Fund. The driving rationale behind these alternative credit products is that in order to achieve an attractive total return in a low-yield/limited-capital-appreciation environment, a fixed income–oriented investor needs a fund manager who can rapidly take advantage of new opportunities without the constraints typically imposed on a "traditional" bond fund.  
  This unconstrained strategy has proved popular recently. Since Lipper began tracking the net flows of the alternative-credit-focused peer group in September 2013, $19.4 billion net has flowed into mutual funds and $19.3 billion into ETFs in the classification through February 2014.  









  Liquid alternative-investment funds and absolute-return funds are other strong growth segments, most of which were unavailable to fund investors until recently. Investors find these products particularly appealing for their portfolio-diversification benefits and their perceived ability to provide positive absolute returns in different market environments.  
  The number of these products will continue to increase as financial advisors find they have broad appeal in periods of heightened volatility. 
  Some investors are also concerned about the future direction of equities and the prospects for fixed income after the bond market disappointed in 2013. These uncertainties have left many investors concerned about preserving capital and prioritizing diversification.

            Making money in fixed income   
			                        Wednesday, 19 Mar 2014 | 12:04  PM ET 




  Absolute-return funds strive to achieve these goals and should remain popular as a result. Absolute-return funds aim to produce positive returns in all market conditions and are not benchmarked against a traditional index; rather, they aim to outperform a cash or risk-free benchmark.  
 Putnam Absolute Return 300 Fund falls into this category. It attempts to provide a 3 percent return over inflation by typically using an allocation of relatively conservative investments, such as investment-grade corporate bonds or Treasurys.  
  The fund, while significantly lagging the S&P 500's total return for 2013, largely accomplished this objective by returning 4.35 percent. Results such as these will continue to attract assets from those investors who are unsatisfied with fixed-income yields but who also are not comfortable with the risk associated with even conservatively positioned equity income–oriented funds.  
Read MoreIt pays to take a long view on finances
  Other similar approaches that should continue to see new funds added include hedge fundlike strategies such as market-neutral. Market-neutral funds often attempt to limit or "neutralize" the impact that market return has on the portfolio by being both long and short. This has appeal for investors who are looking for both diversification and reduced volatility.  
  Two funds following this approach are PIMCO Worldwide Fundamental Advantage Strategy Fund, which has gathered significant assets over the past two years, and Vanguard Market Neutral Fund. 




  Smart-beta approaches should also see new fund launches as this approach gains greater traction, particularly among those who favor index investing. Smart-beta approaches are designed as alternatives to traditional market capitalization-weighted index investing, which can often have significant weightings in larger names.  
  Enhanced indexing is a popular smart-beta strategy that continues to attract a lot of net inflows. Enhanced indexing strategies typically attempt to reduce overall volatility by de-emphasizing larger-capitalization names. The strategy is attractive because of its low expenses relative to those of traditional active managers and its overall simplicity.  
Read MoreInvestors fearful, frustrated in 2014
  Fidelity Large Cap Core Enhanced Index Fund is an example of a fund that tries to generate excess return compared to the S&P 500 by using quantitative screens. The expense ratios of these types of products are generally higher than those of traditional index funds. For example, the annual total expense ratio for FLCEX is 0.45 percent, while that for Vanguard 500 Index Admiral Shares is 0.05 percent. 
Some examples of smart-beta products include:—Equally weighted: Perhaps the simplest form of smart beta; each security's weight in the index mirrors the other constituents'.—Fundamentally weighted: Index constituents are ranked by metrics such as dividends, cash flow, book value or sales.—Low volatility: Constituents are ranked with an emphasis on lowest beta.—High-beta: These products place an emphasis on constructing indices with higher-beta constituents.—Enhanced indexing: These products seek to bolster passive-strategy returns with reduced volatility by typically de-emphasizing larger market-cap constituents.




  There are other variations of smart-beta strategies that attempt to emphasize a particular characteristic of an index. One straightforward smart-beta approach is to equally weight every stock in a particular index, while another is to use stock fundamentals to emphasize stocks with a "value"-oriented bias; stocks that have higher-than-average dividend yields are favored. Look for the number of fundamentally oriented smart-beta funds to also increase.

What is Crowdfunding?

noun
Crowdfunding is the practice of funding a project or cause by raising money from a large number of people, typically through the Internet. It is a form of peer-to-peer fundraising that harnesses the power of social networks to raise awareness and draw donations from around the world for online campaigns.








How is Compassionate Crowdfunding™ Different?

YouCaring is a free online fundraising platform that pioneered Compassionate Crowdfunding™—empowering people worldwide to rally support for personal and charitable causes without the fundraising fees associated with other sites. To date, the YouCaring community is 5.5 million strong and has raised more than $500 million for humanitarian causes.
Start Crowdfunding








The Rise of Crowdfunding


The flourishing sharing economy is changing the landscape of fundraising, and in recent years, crowdfunding has dominated the scene. According to research firm Massolution, donation-based crowdfunding alone grew more than 50 percent in 2015, raising nearly $3 billion. The overall crowdfunding market, including donation-based, lending-based, reward-based and equity-based funding, was expected to grow to $34.5 billion in 2015, more than double that of 2014.







Recent statistics contributing to crowdfunding’s popularity:

Annual out-of-pocket medical expenses in the U.S. have risen to $400 billion, or $1,254 per person.1
Average medical deductibles in the last eight years have increased 100 percent, from $584 to $1,217 for individuals, not including the price of co-pays, co-insurance, drugs and procedures not covered by health insurance plans.2
Forty seven percent of Americans can’t afford $2,000 in an emergency
Annual charitable giving in the U.S. has grown to $360 billion, with 72 percent coming from individuals.3
The sharing economy in 2015 is estimated to be $15 billion and projected to grow to $335 billion by 2035.4





How can you key into the trend and help yourself or someone you love overcome a hardship or challenge by launching a successful crowdfunding campaign?


How To Crowdfund













1. Create
YouCaring’s easy-to-use fundraiser template allows you to create an effective home page for your crowdfunding campaign. Show potential donors how they can help by telling a compelling story, uploading several pictures and videos, and posting updates.



2. Share
Activate your social network. With just a few clicks, spread the word of your fundraiser to friends, family and other potential donors through Facebook, Twitter, email and other channels. Each share is worth $37 on average.



3. Collect
Donations to your fundraiser can be transferred into your account as they’re received. YouCaring provides free fundraising, which means we don’t charge a thing. The donation processor does, however, take 2.9%, plus $.30 per transaction.








Best Crowdfunding Practices
The most important goal of crowdfunding is to build a community and a network that empathizes with your cause and donates.






Five Key Strategies:


Plan Ahead
Create a social presence by setting up Facebook and Twitter accounts if you haven’t already done so. Immediately start connecting with as many friends, family members, coworkers and acquaintances as possible. See our Using Social Media to Promote Your Fundraiser page. Also consider setting up a blog or website devoted to your cause to further boost your social presence. See our How to Start a Fundraising Website or Blog page.

Make It Compelling
From the title to the story to the visuals, your campaign should inspire potential donors to contribute to your cause. Take time to create a great name for your campaign and write an engaging story. Uploading several high-quality photos and one or more videos can exponentially increase donations to your campaign. For additional tips, see these YouCaring articles: Great Ideas for Naming Your Online Fundraiser, How Images Can Lead to Fundraising Success and Videos Are Powerful Fundraiser Tools.

Share and Update
Sharing your campaign often via social media channels and asking your friends, family and others to do the same is the best way to raise awareness and support for your cause. Every share can raise $37. Multiply those shares and your fundraiser may go viral. Meanwhile, well-written updates keep supporters and potential donors engaged. Fundraisers with five updates can raise 15 times more than those with one. Fundraisers with 20 or more updates on average meet their fundraising goal.

Organize Offline Events
Complementing your online campaign with an offline fundraiser can get your community personally involved and rally support from local businesses. Sports tournaments, dinners, auctions, dances and other events are great options. See our Fundraising Ideas page for other tips.

Reach Out to the Media
Getting your campaign covered by a local newspaper, T.V. station, radio station or even blogger and Facebook pages can propel your fundraiser to new heights. See our tips page, How to Get Local Media to Cover Your Fundraiser.

The Crowdfunding Platform You Choose Matters
It is vital to pick the crowdfunding platform that best suits your needs and your cause. The most important aspects include the fees charged to fundraise, the site’s customer service standards and reputation, the schedule for payment of donations, the caliber of online tools available to illustrate and share your campaign, and the quality of the site—from the visuals to the user experience.

Crowdfunding Campaign Success Stories






Help Save Matthew!





Goal: $800,000

Raised: $835,918



Matthew Schreindorfer and his wife, Katia Luciani, could not have imagined the journey they would face starting in August 2014. At age 24, Matthew was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. He had gone through every possible treatment in Canada, all of which failed to bring him into remission. According to his doctors, his only hope was to be admitted for a CART-19 clinical trial in the U.S. The couple started working with Sloan Kettering Cancer Institute in New York and started a YouCaring fundraiser with a goal of $800,000, the estimated cost for the treatment. With the help of family and friends in Canada, and newfound supporters in the U.S. and around the world, the couple was able to drum up plenty of support for the clinical trial in the U.S., which proved to be fruitful, putting Matthew in remission for more than six months.

And Luca Makes 5 – Mullen Family Adoption





Goal: $40,500

Raised: $41,259



In February 2016, the Mullen Family of Bethany, Okla., brought home their third adoptive child, Luca, a 3-year-old Eastern European boy with special needs. The joyous occasion came after nearly one year of fundraising, the majority of which included the YouCaring campaign, And Luca Makes 5: The Mullen Family Adoption. After 15 years of marriage, during which the couple was unable to have children, they embarked on an adoptive journey to grow their family, and brought Levi and Lia home in 2011. Their YouCaring fundraiser to adopt Luca raised more than $41,000. Successful strategies didn’t get any better than the Mullen’s over the course of their campaign, during which time they involved their children in many of the happy moments leading up to the last stretch to welcome little Luca.

Help Fatal Arson Survivor Safyre Terry and Family





Goal: $15,000

Raised: $432,249



The story of 7-year-old Safyre Terry stole the hearts of people around the world when a Facebook post in 2015 describing her wish to receive Christmas cards went viral. Safyre was a courageous young burn victim from Upstate New York who was the only survivor of a house fire that killed the rest of her family in 2013. At the time, Safyre was 5 years old, and through all of her medical treatments and ensuing challenges, has remained a bright, optimistic girl who loves life. Around the time of the Facebook post, a YouCaring fundraiser had also been started by friends for Safyre’s aunt and uncle, Mike and Liz Dolder, who are now raising her. The fundraiser was set up to help with the costs of medical treatments and other expenses. Nearly 10,000 people from around the world contributed to the campaign.

Bonsai: Half the Bulldog, Twice the Love





Goal: $1

It’s hard to resist a cute black and white bulldog puppy. But when you see Bonsai, born with multiple rare medical conditions that left him with only half a spine and no pelvis playing with a big pink squeaky toy, still just as rambunctious and playful as any puppy with four legs, it truly tugs at your heartstrings. A group of individuals from Friends of Emma, a rescue organization, took to crowdfunding to give Bonsai a leg up in his treatment. The fundraiser has successfully raised nearly $23,000 to help pay for Bonsai’s medical treatments and a possible mobility device to give him an even happier and healthier life.

Alpha
We are the largest provider of actively managed ETFs in Canada — investment solutions that combine portfolio management with the low-cost structure of an ETF to generate better risk-adjusted returns. Our actively managed ETFs trade like stocks, but with lower management fees than standard mutual funds and the intra-day liquidity of an ETF. We work with a number of sub-advisors such as Fiera Capital Corp. and Guardian Capital Corp. to bring you innovative portfolio management strategies in fixed income, equities and global dividends. Learn more about the Active Advantage™





Benchmark
Our Benchmark ETFs aim to provide the best possible tracking of an index by combining innovative strategies with the low-cost ETF structure. Offered in a range of asset classes — equities, fixed income, currencies and alternatives — many of our benchmark ETFs utilize a total return swap (TRS) structure to ensure that you receive the absolute value of an index’s returns, while minimizing your tax exposure to distributions and interest. Learn more about the Index Advantage





Betapro
Our BetaPro ETFs are designed for tactical and market savvy investors in a range of asset classes, and include leveraged, inverse and inverse leveraged ETFs. These investments can be volatile as they provide daily performance investment results that correspond to one times the inverse of their specified underlying index or benchmark; two times the daily performance, or two times the inverse of the daily performance of their specified underlying index or benchmark; or track the performance of market volatility.

Horizons ETFs is a Member of Mirae Asset Global Investments. Commissions, trailing commissions, management fees and expenses all may be associated with an investment in exchange traded products managed by AlphaPro Management Inc. and Horizons ETFs Management (Canada) Inc. (the "Horizons Exchange Traded Products"). The Horizons Exchange Traded Products are not guaranteed, their values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated. The prospectus contains important detailed information about the Horizons Exchange Traded Products. Please read the relevant prospectus before investing.

The Horizons Exchange Traded Products consist of the Horizons Index ETFs ("Index ETFs"), 2x Daily Bull and -2x Daily Bear ETFs ("2x Daily ETFs"), Inverse ETFs ("Inverse ETFs"), VIX ETFs (defined below) and active ETFs. The 2x Daily ETFs and certain other Horizons Exchange Traded Products use leveraged investment techniques that can magnify gains and losses and may result in greater volatility of returns. These Horizons Exchange Traded Products are subject to leverage risk and may be subject to aggressive investment risk and price volatility risk, which, where applicable, are described in their respective prospectuses. Each 2x Daily ETF seeks a return, before fees and expenses, that is either 200% or -200% of the performance of a specified underlying index, commodity or benchmark (the "Target") for a single day. Each Index ETF or Inverse ETF seeks a return that is 100% or -100%, respectively, of the performance of a Target. Due to the compounding of daily returns, a 2x Daily ETF's or Inverse ETF's returns over periods other than one day will likely differ in amount and possibly direction from the performance of their respective Target(s) for the same period. The Horizons Exchange Traded Products whose Target is the S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index™ (the "VIX ETFs"), one of which is a 2x Daily ETF and one of which is an Index ETF, as described in their prospectus, are speculative investment tools that are not conventional investments. The VIX ETFs' Target is highly volatile. As a result, the VIX ETFs are not generally viewed as stand-alone long-term investments. Historically, the VIX ETFs' Target has tended to revert to a historical mean. As a result, the performance of the VIX ETFs' Target is expected to be negative over the longer term and neither the VIX ETFs nor their Target are expected to have positive long term performance. Investors should monitor their holdings, as frequently as daily, to ensure that they remain consistent with their investment strategies.

*The indicated rates of return are the historical annual compounded total returns including changes in per unit value and reinvestment of all dividends or distributions and do not take into account sales, redemption, distribution or optional charges or income taxes payable by any securityholder that would have reduced returns. The rates of return shown in the table are not intended to reflect future values of the ETF or returns on investment in the ETF. Only the returns for periods of one year or greater are annualized returns.
