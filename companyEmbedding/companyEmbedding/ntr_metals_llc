About Us








NTR Metals Silver Bullion

NTR Metals is a global company offering precious metal refining and minting services. The company refines more than 30 million pounds of metal every year through dozens of locations throughout the U.S. and abroad, turning scrap jewelry and other products sent by jewelers and pawnbrokers into solid gold and silver bars. NTR Metals is one of the world’s largest precious metals companies, serving more than 20,000 companies as well as individual investors. Based in Dallas, NTR Metals is known for minting investment-grade bullion bars in gold and silver.
Products
The gold and silver bars minted by NTR Metals contain metals from their Commercial Refining Division, enabling the company to maintain complete control over the precious metals contained in their bullion products. NTR is one of the most fully-integrated precious metal companies in the world, managing the entire lifecycle of the metal to maintain high quality control.

NTR Metals only mints pure silver (.999 fine) and pure gold (.9999 fine) bullion. Their industry-recognized bullion includes silver bars in 1, 10, and 100 ounce sizes, as well as gold bars weighing one kilogram. All of their minted products are carefully inspected by hand for consistency and quality before being packaged. Designed for precious metal investments, the quality, purity, and weight of all NTR Metals bullion is guaranteed.
The appearance of each NTR Metals silver bar is relatively simple and generic. Each is stamped with the NHR Metals logo, the weight, and the silver purity. They are fairly recognizable by bullion traders. On the other hand, collectors expecting a beautiful design worthy of showing off would be better served by other bullion products.
Pricing
NTR Metals bullion bars are designed for investors who seek to own physical gold or silver while minimizing the risk associated with high per-ounce premiums. The premiums on NTR bars are among the lowest in the industry, typically a very small percentage above the spot price of silver. The precision and efficiency for which NTR Metals is known leads to some of the lowest per-ounce prices, making this a good option for investors who are primarily interested in assembling a large quantity of physical silver bullion.
Orders for NTR Metals bars may not be placed online, and NTR Metals locations are not open to the public. NTR Metal bars may be ordered by phone through their bullion trading desk, or purchased from a number of third-party precious metal dealers who carry NTR Metals products.
Packaging
Bars minted by NTR Metals are RF heat sealed in a unique polyvinyl chloride (PVC) casing. Ten bars are contained in one sheet; this may be cut apart, enabling the bars to be sold or stored separately. This plastic casing protects the finish of the bar from oxidation or damage due to handling. The plastic is thick yet flexible, protecting the bars while allowing for ease of storage. This packaging method allows the bars to be sold individually, or in sheets of ten, and is preferred by investors purchasing a large quantity of silver bars at once due to its ease of transport and storage.

NTR Metals
Founded in Dallas, Texas in 2004, North Texas Refinery, or NTR Metals, is a global precious metal company based in the United States. NTR produces all types of precious metal bullion in addition to providing a variety of refining, minting, and recycling services. In fact, NTR refines more than 30 million pounds of metal per year. The company maintains 75 locations worldwide, serving over 30,000 companies all over the world.
What Makes NTR Metals Different Other Mints?
NTR comprises four operating divisions. First, the commercial refining division caters to the refining needs of pawnbrokers, jewelers, and others in the precious metals market. This division prides itself on rapid turnaround times and accessible local processing centers. Second, the industrial recycling and refining division salvages precious metals from various waste streams. Third, NTR is a precious metals market maker for palladium, silver, gold, and platinum precious metal bullion. This division serves the needs of the jewelry, coin, and financial industries at the wholesale level. Fourth, the bullion minting division uses fine precious metals to produce pure bullion products.
NTR stands out from other refineries because it offers some of the lowest prices per bullion ounce in the industry. This is partly due to economies of scale, as NTR has a massive global presence. The company also runs its own minting facilities, which means it can better control quality across the production process. NTR oversees everything from melting to stamping bars and rounds.
Considering it is only ten years old, NTR’s meteoric rise in the precious metals industry is truly remarkable. The company began with owner Steve Loftus as a small operation in Dallas. NTR rapidly developed an international presence, expanding beyond minting to recycling and refining enterprises. Its recycling efforts turn hazardous and non-hazardous waste into items of value, thereby earning the company distinction for its social responsibility and environmental friendliness. Today, NTR also manages precious stones, including gemstones and diamonds.
Metal Refining and Minting
NTR refines and mints a variety of precious metals, but it is best-known for its gold and silver bullion products. The company offers 1-oz, 10-oz, and 100-oz silver bars, as well as 1-oz and kilogram gold bars. Investors can also purchase one-ounce silver rounds. One of NTR’s most unique and sought-after products is the golden triangle, which is a triangular gold bar. Because the company oversees the metal life cycle, it achieves industry-leading quality control. As a result, NTR guarantees its bullion products for weight, purity, and quality.
Security and Packaging
Every NTR-minted silver bar is RF heat sealed in a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) case that safeguards its finish from oxidation and physical wear and tear. This special packaging enables dealers to sell the bars individually or in sealed sheets of ten. These sheets are easily folded and stacked for convenient storage in a safe. Most bars bear NTR’s logo, which features the company’s name divided by a horizontal line with two arcs across it. Each bar indicates its purity and weight in troy ounces. NTR bars do not bear serial numbers.
In the case of silver rounds, investors who purchase multiples of 20 will receive them in their original sealed mint tubes. Those who purchase lesser quantities will receive their rounds in a tube with packing material or in an individual coin sleeve covered in heavy plastic bags.
Reputation, Pricing, and Availability
The level of quality control that NTR maintains is unsurpassed in the precious metals industry, with each minted bullion product inspected by hand for consistency and quality before it is packaged. Additionally, NTR offers some of the lowest prices in the business, with most bars offered at very close to silver spot value. For these reasons, investors find NTR products especially appealing. With NTR bullion, investors get more metal at lower premiums.
Investors can purchase almost all NTR products brand new, with many of them still in their original sealed packaging. For the most part, NTR bullion is widely available, but some types of bars come from limited productions that make them harder to come by. For example, in 2014, NTR released the 10-ounce Horse Silver Bar to commemorate the Chinese lunar year of the horse. These intricately designed bars will only be minted in 2014, which means investors may only find them in used condition and at higher premiums once the year is up.
For investors looking for the most bang for their buck in the world of bullion, the products of NTR Metals are the logical choice. High quality and competitively priced, NTR bullion is an affordable way to diversify your investment portfolio.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!
