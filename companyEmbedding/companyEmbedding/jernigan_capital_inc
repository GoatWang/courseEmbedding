Jernigan Capital, Inc. Closes Jacksonville Self-Storage Development Investment and Announces Opening of Three Newly-Developed Self-Storage Facilities | Business Wire
























































Jernigan Capital, Inc. Closes Jacksonville Self-Storage Development 
      Investment and Announces Opening of Three Newly-Developed Self-Storage 
      Facilities






July 28, 2017 07:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



MEMPHIS, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jernigan Capital, Inc. (NYSE:JCAP) (the “Company”) announced today that 
      it has closed an $8.0 million investment in a proposed multi-story 
      climate-controlled 749 unit facility in Jacksonville, Florida. The 
      proposed 68,700 net rentable square foot facility will be a ground-up 
      project located on Edison Ave. and will be visible from both Interstates 
      10 and 95. The proposed facility, which is approximately a half mile 
      from downtown Jacksonville, will operate less than a mile from Brooklyn 
      Station, a new Fresh Market-anchored retail destination and near several 
      new, upscale apartment communities. Construction is expected to begin in 
      the fourth quarter of 2017 and be completed in the fourth quarter of 
      2018. Structure Development LLC is the developer of the proposed 
      project, and this is the third self-storage development in which the 
      Company and Structure Development have co-invested.
    

      The company also announced today that three additional facilities in 
      which it has invested have opened for business:
    


        the 584-unit multi-story climate-controlled self-storage facility in 
        Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in which the Company holds a $5.3 million 
        investment and 49.9% profits interest;
      

        the 287-unit addition to its existing Ocoee self-storage facility in 
        Orlando, Florida, in which addition the Company holds a $5.1 million 
        investment and 49.9% profits interest; and
      

        the 787-unit multi-story climate-controlled self-storage facility in 
        Jacksonville, Florida, in which Storage Partners, LLC, the Company’s 
        joint venture with Heitman and an institutional investor, holds an 
        $8.1 million investment and a 49.9% profits interest;
      


      Each of these facilities is managed by CubeSmart (NYSE: CUBE).

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Dean Jernigan
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Dean Jernigan has more than 30 years of experience in the self storage industry. After retiring from the role of CEO of CubeSmart (NYSE:CUBE) in 2013, he founded Jernigan Capital as the only direct lender focused exclusively on the self storage industry. His experience in the self storage industry spans more than 30 years.
He began his tenure in the industry in 1984 when he founded Storage USA, a company he took public in 1994. He grew Storage USA from a single property to more than 570 properties at its peak. During its life as a public company and under his leadership as Chairman and CEO, the company returned a 17.5% compounded annual return to its investors. Following the sale of the company to GE Capital, he formed Jernigan Property Group which assembled a portfolio of 17 properties in a short 18 months seizing upon the opportunity of a short acquisition cycle that presented itself.
In 2006, Jernigan accepted the challenge of rebuilding and rebranding U-Store-It which became CubeSmart. During his tenure as CEO, the company’s market capitalization more than doubled from approximately $2B to more than $4B. With extensive experience and knowledge in more than 100 US markets as a developer, owner and manager of self storage facilities, Dean has earned his reputation as an industry innovator, leader and icon.

Dean Jernigan
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Dean Jernigan has more than 30 years of experience in the self storage industry. After retiring from the role of CEO of CubeSmart (NYSE:CUBE) in 2013, he founded Jernigan Capital as the only direct lender focused exclusively on the self storage industry. His experience in the self storage industry spans more than 30 years.
He began his tenure in the industry in 1984 when he founded Storage USA, a company he took public in 1994. He grew Storage USA from a single property to more than 570 properties at its peak. During its life as a public company and under his leadership as Chairman and CEO, the company returned a 17.5% compounded annual return to its investors. Following the sale of the company to GE Capital, he formed Jernigan Property Group which assembled a portfolio of 17 properties in a short 18 months seizing upon the opportunity of a short acquisition cycle that presented itself.
In 2006, Jernigan accepted the challenge of rebuilding and rebranding U-Store-It which became CubeSmart. During his tenure as CEO, the company’s market capitalization more than doubled from approximately $2B to more than $4B. With extensive experience and knowledge in more than 100 US markets as a developer, owner and manager of self storage facilities, Dean has earned his reputation as an industry innovator, leader and icon.

Real-time prices are provided by Bats Exchange on individual U.S. equities quote pages. During market hours, the real-time Bats price displays and new trade updates are updated on the page (as indicated by a "flash"). Volume always reflects consolidated markets. If the symbol has pre-market or post-market trades, that information will also be reflected along with the last (closing) price from the symbol's exchange. Real-time prices are available during market hours (9:30 AM to 4:00 PM EST).  Note: The Bats Exchange currently accounts for approximately 11-12% of all U.S. equity trading each day. As a result, the real-time prices displayed may have minor discrepancies when comparing the information with other sites offering real-time data, or with brokerage firms. If you require comprehensive real-time bids/asks/quotes, we offer a no-risk trial to one of our real-time products. Summary Quoteboard The Summary Quoteboard displays snapshot quote data. When available, Bid and Ask information from the Bats exchange is updated as new data is received. Volume is also updated but is the delayed consolidated Volume from the symbol's exchange. Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Bid: The last bid price and bid size. Ask: The last ask price and ask size. Volume: The total number of shares or contracts traded in the current trading session. Average Volume: The average number of shares traded over the last 20 days. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.  Chart Snapshot A thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory.

Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares. For example, a publicly held company with 10 million shares outstanding that trade at $10 each would have a market capitalization of $100 million. Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE." EPS: The basic annual EPS from total operations is the bottom line income after all expenses, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For example, if a company has $10 million in net income and 10 million in outstanding shares, then its EPS is $1. Beta: 36 Month Beta: Coefficient that measures the volatility of a stock's returns relative to the market (S&P 500). It is based on a 36-month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the S&P 500. Earnings: The amount of latest Earnings Per Share (EPS) paid out to shareholders. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share). Yield is the amount of dividends paid per share, divided by the closing price. Sectors: Links to the Industry Groups and/or SIC codes in which the stock is found.Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively. Support and Resistance points are based on end-of-day prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open, or the next trading session if the market is closed.   Pivot Point: (P) = (H + L + C) / 3 First Resistance Level: (R1) = (2 * P) - L First Support Level: (S1) = (2 * P) - H Second Resistance Level: (R2) = P + (R1 - S1) Second Support Level: (S2) = P - (R1 - S1) Related Stocks For comparison purposes, find information on other symbols contained in the same sector.Most Recent Stories View the latest top stories from the Associated Press or Canadian Press (based on your Market selection).
