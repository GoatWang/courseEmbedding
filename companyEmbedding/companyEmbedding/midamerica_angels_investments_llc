For Entrepreneurs- MAA Entrepreneur Resources






















































































		Who are the Mid-America Angels?	



 

The Mid-America Angels (MAA) are a group of more than 120 accredited angel investors. MAA members have significant experience as entrepreneurs, CEOs, business leaders and industry experts. Many have founded and successfully built companies. MAA members are located in Kansas and Missouri and seek exceptional investment opportunities with the potential for high returns.
While MAA is professionally managed by the staff of the Enterprise Center in Johnson County (ECJC), each member makes his or her own investment decisions. The staff of the ECJC processes company applications, schedules entrepreneurs to present before the angels, and conducts back-office due diligence on potential deals. 
MAA typically invests in companies in the Kansas City region, and provides early-stage funding in the seed ($250,000 – $1.5M), Series A ($1M – $3M) and Series B ($3M – $5M) rounds. Read on to learn more about MAA’s investment process and what the angels typically look for in deals.

Mid-America Angels on pace for record local investments

Mid-America Angels, a network of wealthy investors focused on early-stage companies in Missouri and Kansas, has generated $1.7 million in capital for seven businesses in the first half of this year.
The funding puts Mid-America Angels on a pace to break the record $2.8 million that the network raised for companies in all of 2015. 
“We normally do eight to 10 deals a year, and we’ve already done seven,” said Melissa Roberts, the group’s marketing director.
Companies receiving investments include JobShakers LLC, a Fairway-based company with a mobile employee referral app;  Elias Animal Health LLC, an Olathe-based company developing cancer treatments for pets; and DEW-Drink Eat Well LLC, a Lawrence-based maker of Hilary’s allergen-free foods.


Mid-America Angels researches early-stage companies and their participants, looking at financial projections and market analyses as well as working with industry experts in the area. It provides that information to individuals who make personal investment decisions.




Mid-America also regularly links investors with similarly vetted early-stage companies in nearby states and draws investments from angels in those states to area companies.
