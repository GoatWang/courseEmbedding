Our Company




Borrowing money is sometimes necessary and unavoidable. You may be trying to avoid NSF fees at the bank, need to replace a motor in your car so that you can get to work, or maybe you’ve agreed to a lump sum settlement on an outstanding medical bill. And of course there are many other instances.  In those times, borrowing between $1,000 -$10,000 with affordable monthly payments may be a solution. 
            
            If you need to borrow between $1,000 - $10,000 Eagle is a great place to go. Eagle is independently-owned and has been in business since 1994. We lend with a sense of community. We care about the well-being of our customers and strive to impart empathy at all times, in every situation. 
            Across the company our average branch manager has over 20 years of lending experience in the finance industry. We make loan decisions locally. 
            We are a TRADITIONAL finance company in an industry where the small loan rate structure has not changed significantly in the past 130 years! Typically, the best pricing and most competitive rates will come from a bank. If you choose an alternative to a traditional bank, we’d strongly suggest avoiding triple-digit APR lenders such as payday, title, and  check advance lenders. We believe we are a reasonable alternative to this type of lending institution.
            






At Eagle, we offer monthly payment terms between 8-24 months for you to payback your loan. When broken down into monthly payments, it is much more manageable for you to be able to repay a debt. Most title & cash advance lenders expect their interest plus principle back within very short windows of time… typically between 2 weeks to 30 days.











We truly strive to treat you as we would a friend. If you’re not sure… ask a friend who has borrowed from us in the past. Word of mouth is always our best source of business! If you like how you are treated, please share that with a friend.

Frequently Asked Questions






WHO IS EAGLE LOAN/ EAGLE FINANCE COMPANY (“EAGLE”)?


It may be easier to start by saying who Eagle is NOT. We are not a cash advance operation, “payday lender” or a “title” lender. Those businesses continue to be under government scrutiny currently and sometimes consumer finance companies like Eagle are incorrectly rolled into that same category. This is likely because we are both not traditional banks, but both still lend money. However, the similarities end there.
                
                Eagle is a traditional consumer finance company.  The business model (and rates) of traditional finance companies have fundamentally not changed in over 130 years. With Eagle, you avoid the typical red-tape that banks subject you to in order to get a small loan. 
                
                Our primary business is simple-  personal loans to individuals. Typically, loans are $1,000-$10,000 and paid off in 8-24 months. People use Eagle for things as necessary and immediate as paying bills, or as discretionary as taking a dream vacation. Some other examples are: repairing a vehicle, buying furniture, home repair, moving expenses, and rebuilding personal credit. 



WHO IS A “TYPICAL” EAGLE CUSTOMER?


In short, Middle America. Most of our customers have good paying jobs.  Some of our customers have a low FICO credit score because of a previous life situation: unexpected medical expense, job loss, divorce, sudden income decrease, or maybe even just simple poor financial planning. These individuals may not be able to borrow money at a traditional bank or credit card company. 
                
                Other customers simply like the ease and convenience of doing business with Eagle.  As such, many of our existing customers are repeat customers and use Eagle in the same fashion many Americans responsibly use credit cards today.
                
                Eagle makes credit available to middle America at traditional finance company rates. This does not mean we are able to help everyone with a loan. 






HOW DO I APPLY FOR A PERSONAL LOAN WITH EAGLE?


We encourage you to call or stop by your nearest Eagle office, or apply online. The majority of the time we will have a loan decision for you within 24 hours and many times, the very same day.



HOW DOES A PERSONAL LOAN WITH EAGLE WORK?


After applying online, by phone or in person, you will be informed of our loan decision and any required documentation we may need. Typical documentation includes: 
                
                    1.    Recent pay stub
                    2.    Proof of address, such as utility bill
                    3.    If pledging a vehicle as collateral, the car title
                    4.    Driver’s License
                    5.    Checking account statement or Debit Card 
                
                If you are approved for a loan with Eagle, we close the loan in one of our private closing rooms and hand you a check.

OUR CUSTOMERS
What our customers have to say about Eagle Finance.




                            I volunteer and offer financial counseling services through my church.  Many of the individuals and families I advise have low credit scores, but are committed to rebuilding their credit.  I have referred Eagle many of these families to help reestablish a good payment history.  Eagle’s terms are consistent and fair and loan history is reported to the credit bureau.  For these reasons, I trust Eagle as a good solution for many people looking to get their financial house back in order.Barbara B- Fairfield, OH





                            My oldest sister, Jenny, died unexpectedly last August.  Jenny had no money when she passed.  I wanted to give Jenny a proper burial, but I live on a fixed income.  Arrangements had to be made and paid for now.  Eagle gave us a loan, which allowed the family to say our goodbyes in a dignified manner.  I will forever be grateful to Eagle, not just for the loan, but for the way they made me feel.Judy- Dayton, OH





                            My husband Ernesto had back surgery 3 years ago.  While the surgery was successful, the medical bills were more than we ever imagined.  He was facing a potential wage garnishment when we called Eagle.  Eagle not only gave us a loan, they helped us to negotiate a lower payoff with the hospital and consolidated all our remaining bills.  Thank you Eagle!Julia & Ernesto- Lexington, KY





                            My daughter Brittney was starting college.  While she received a partial scholarship and a student loan for the remaining expenses, we needed money now to buy her textbooks and get her settled in.  Eagle was able to help us with a short term loan until Brittney’s student loan check arrived several weeks later.Lisa- Louisville, KY





                            I recently moved from Georgia to Kentucky for a new job.  Between all the moving expenses and the security deposit on my apartment, I was completely tapped out for cash.  When I had nowhere else to turn, Eagle gave me a loan the very same day I applied!  I will always be grateful and have recommended Eagle to several co-workers and friends.Nikki B- Florence, KY





                            My extended family scheduled a large reunion in Gatlinburg this past Summer.  I signed up to go when no sooner after I had some unexpected home repairs come up.  I was about to cancel the trip, when a friend told me to call Eagle.  Eagle gave me a $2,500 loan.  I was able to repair my home AND take the trip.  Boy, was I happy!Phil- Indianapolis, IN





                            If you’ve never been in a position where you needed money quickly, congratulations.  I used Eagle for a $2,800 loan to pay a property tax bill that was past due.  It was my first year in the home and I incorrectly assumed taxes were being escrowed.  Eagle was fast, professional, and is a great company to turn to if you need quick cash in a pinch.Sam M- Cleveland, OH





                            I work for a small family business and work was real slow.  To make matters worse, my truck desperately needed 4 new tires.  Going into winter, I had very few options.  A friend told me about Eagle.  I was able to get what I needed, and they even paid the tire shop directly.Wayne D- Toledo, OH

BERRYVILLE, Va., July 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Eagle Financial Services, Inc. (OTCQX: EFSI), the holding company for Bank of Clarke County, whose divisions include Eagle Investment Group, reported quarterly earnings, continued asset quality improvement and strong performance for the second quarter of 2017. Additionally, on July 19, 2017, the Board of Directors announced a quarterly common stock cash dividend of $0.22 per common share, payable on August 15, 2017, to shareholders of record on August 1, 2017. Select highlights for the second quarter include:   

Net Income of $2.0 million 
Net Interest Margin of 4.15% 
Net loan growth of $34.8 million 
Net deposit growth of $16.1 million 
Earnings per Share, Basic of $0.58









John R. Milleson, President and CEO, stated, "I am extremely pleased with our robust loan and deposit growth as well as the continued improvement in the Company's overall asset quality. The recent changes to the banking landscape in our Loudoun County market area may present us further opportunities for growth. As we stay attentive to those changes, we also remain focused on the maintenance of our net interest margin with efforts to grow the balance sheet and increase levels of net interest income while still being mindful of the importance of non-interest income and expense and the Company's general level of efficiency."
Income Statement Review
Net income of $2.0 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 was unchanged when compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Net income for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 was $1.6 million. Much of the increase from the quarter ended June 30, 2016, related to the increase in net interest income and the reversal of provision for loan losses.      
Net interest income increased $392,000 or 6.16% from $6.4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 to $6.8 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2017.  This increase in net interest income was driven mostly by increased loan volume experienced by the Bank. Net interest income increased 6.45% or $409,000 from $6.3 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 to $6.8 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2017.  This increase is also attributed to increased loan volume.   
Total loan interest income was $6.1 and $5.7 million for the quarters ended June 30 and March 31, 2017, respectively. For the quarter ended June 30, 2016, total loan interest income was $5.9 million. Average loans for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 were $534.8 million compared to $518.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.  Total average accruing loans were $528.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and $511.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.  For the second quarter of 2016, total average loans were $509.7 million and average accruing loans were $505.5 million. The tax equivalent yield on average loans for the quarters ended June 30 and March 31, 2017 was 4.51%.  The tax equivalent yield on loans for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 was 4.67%.  Interest income from the investment portfolio was $879,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 and $809,000 for the same period ended March 31, 2017.  Average investments were $132.9 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 and $125.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.  Interest income from the investment portfolio was $737,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 while average investments were $103.6 million for the same time period. 
Total interest expense was $248,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and $203,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The average cost of interest bearing liabilities remain unchanged at 0.21% for the quarter ending June 30, 2017 when compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2017.  The average balance of interest bearing liabilities increased by $14.2 million from the quarter ended March 31, 2017 with the Bank's acquisition of wholesale funding to meet the quarter's loan demand.  The net interest margin was 4.15% for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 and 4.09% for the quarter March 31, 2017.  For the quarter ended June 30, 2016, total interest expense was $297,000 and the net interest margin was 4.16%. 
The Company's net interest margin is not a measurement under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, but it is a common measure used by the financial services industry to determine how profitably earning assets are funded. The Company's net interest margin is calculated by dividing tax equivalent net interest income by total average earning assets. Tax equivalent net interest income is calculated by grossing up interest income for the amounts that are non-taxable (i.e., municipal income) then subtracting interest expense. The tax rate utilized is 34%. The table at the end of this document reconciles tax-equivalent net interest income, which is not a measurement under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), to net interest income.
Non-interest income was $1.6 million and $1.7 million for the quarters ended June 30 and March 31, 2017, respectively. When comparing the quarter ended June 30, 2017 to the quarter ended March 31, 2017, fees from fiduciary activities increased $17,000 or 5.82%.  This increase results mostly from some one-time fees collected during the quarter ended June 30, 2017.  Fees from fiduciary activities decreased $71,000 or 18.68% from the quarter ended June 30, 2017 to the same period in 2016. This decline resulted from the decline in one time fees realized during the second quarter of 2017 when compared to the same time period in 2016. Other operating income decreased by $44,000 or 51.76% when comparing the three months ended June 30, 2017 to the three months ended March 31, 2017.  During the first quarter of 2017, the Bank adjusted its ownership interest in Bankers Insurance, LLC.  The increase in ownership adjustment was $67,000 and was based upon Bankers Insurance, LLC 2016 schedule K-1. Noninterest income for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was $1.7 million.  
Noninterest expense was $5.7 million for the quarters ended June 30, 2017 and March 31, 2017.   Noninterest expense was $5.8 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2016.
Asset Quality and Provision for Loan Losses
Nonperforming assets consist of loans 90 days past due and still accruing interest, nonaccrual loans, other real estate owned (foreclosed properties), and repossessed assets.  At June 30, 2017, nonperforming assets were $5.75 million or 0.77% of total assets, a decrease of $734,000 when compared to the $6.4 million at March 31, 2017.  During the second quarter of 2017, the Bank placed one loan on non-accrual status. Management regularly evaluates the financial condition of borrowers with loans on non-accrual status and the value of any collateral on these loans.  The results of these evaluations are used to estimate the amount of losses which may be realized on the disposition of these non-accrual loans.  The majority of the non-accrual loans are secured by real estate.  One real estate asset had been foreclosed upon and subsequently sold during the second quarter of 2017.   There were no loans greater than 90 days past due and still accruing at June 30 and March 31, 2017. At June 30, 2016, there were $33,000 of loans greater than 90 days past due and still accruing.  Nonperforming assets were $4.5 million or 0.67% of total assets at June 30, 2016.
The Company may, under certain circumstances, restructure loans in troubled debt restructurings as a concession to a borrower when the borrower is experiencing financial distress.  Formal, standardized loan restructuring programs are not utilized by the Company.  Each loan considered for restructuring is evaluated based on customer circumstances and may include modifications to one or more loan provision.  Such restructured loans are included in impaired loans but may not necessarily be nonperforming loans.  At June 30, 2017, the Company had 22 troubled debt restructurings totaling $5.1 million, of which 19 loans, totaling $4.4 million, were considered performing loans.  
The Company realized $219,000 in net recoveries for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 compared to $440,000 in net recoveries for the three months ended March 31, 2017. For the quarter ended June 30, 2016, the Company realized net charge offs of $31,000. The Company continues to operate a troubled credit group to monitor past due loans, identify potential problem credits, and develop action plans to work through its troubled loans as promptly as possible.  Asset quality remains a primary focus of the Company. Necessary resources continue to be devoted to the ongoing review of the loan portfolio and the workouts of problem assets to minimize any losses to the Company. Management will continue to monitor delinquencies, risk rating changes, charge-offs, market trends and other indicators of risk in the Company's portfolio, particularly those tied to residential and commercial real estate, and adjust the allowance for loan losses accordingly. 
The Company recorded a negative provision for loan losses of $230,000 and $527,000 for the quarters ended June 30, 2017 and March 31, 2017, respectively, while no provision was recorded for the quarter ended June 30, 2016.  The allowance for loan losses was $4.4 million, or 0.80% of total outstanding loans, at June 30, 2017. At March 31, 2017, the allowance for loan losses was $4.4 million or 0.85% of total outstanding loans.  The allowance for loan losses was $5.0 million or 0.96% of total assets at June 30, 2016.  The amount of provision for loan losses during each quarter reflects the results of the Bank's analysis used to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses.  The Company is committed to maintaining an allowance at a level that adequately reflects the risk inherent in the loan portfolio.  
Total Consolidated Assets 
Total consolidated assets of the Company at June 30, 2017 were $744.0 million, which represented an increase of $38.9 million or 5.52% from total assets of $705.1 million at March 31, 2017. This increase was driven by the increased volume of the loan portfolio.  Total loans increased from $519.4 million at March 31, 2017 to $554.2 at June 30, 2017.  At June 30, 2016, total consolidated assets were $677.4 million and total loans were $517.4 million. 
Deposits and Other Borrowings
Total deposits were $632.0 million at June 30, 2017.  This reflects an increase of 2.62% or $16.1 million from $615.9 at March 31, 2017.  At June 30, 2016, total deposits were $571.2 million.  Borrowings with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta were $20.0 million at June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016.  
Equity
Shareholders' equity at June 30, 2017 was $83.2 million, reflecting an increase of $2.6 million from $80.5 million at March 31, 2017.  At June 30, 2016 shareholders' equity was $81.4 million. The book value of the Company at June 30, 2017 was $24.02 per common share. Total common shares outstanding were 3,481,946 at June 30, 2017.  On July 19, 2017, the board of directors declared a $0.22 per common share cash dividend for shareholders of record as of August 1, 2017, and payable on August 15, 2017.

 (1) 
 The net interest margin is calculated by dividing tax equivalent net interest income by total average earning assets.  Tax equivalent interest income is calculated by grossing up interest income for the amounts that are non-taxable (i.e., municipal income) then subtracting interest expense.  The rate utilized is 34%.  See the table below for the quarterly tax equivalent net interest income and the reconciliation of net interest income to tax equivalent net interest income.  The Company's net interest margin is a common measure used by the financial service industry to determine how profitable earning assets are funded.  Because the Company earns a fair amount of non-taxable interest income due to the mix of securities in its investment security portfolio, net interest income for the ratio is calculated on a tax equivalent basis as described above.  





 (2) 
 The efficiency ratio is not a measurement under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. It is calculated by dividing non-interest expense by the sum of tax equivalent net interest income and non-interest income excluding gains and losses on the investment portfolio and sales of repossessed assets. The tax rate utilized is 34%. See the table below for the quarterly tax equivalent net interest income and a reconciliation of net interest income to tax equivalent net interest income. The Company calculates this ratio in order to evaluate its overhead structure or how effectively it is operating. An increase in the ratio from period to period indicates the Company is losing a larger percentage of its income to expenses. The Company believes that the efficiency ratio is a reasonable measure of profitability.

Our Company




Borrowing money is sometimes necessary and unavoidable. You may be trying to avoid NSF fees at the bank, need to replace a motor in your car so that you can get to work, or maybe you’ve agreed to a lump sum settlement on an outstanding medical bill. And of course there are many other instances.  In those times, borrowing between $1,000 -$10,000 with affordable monthly payments may be a solution. 
            
            If you need to borrow between $1,000 - $10,000 Eagle is a great place to go. Eagle is independently-owned and has been in business since 1994. We lend with a sense of community. We care about the well-being of our customers and strive to impart empathy at all times, in every situation. 
            Across the company our average branch manager has over 20 years of lending experience in the finance industry. We make loan decisions locally. 
            We are a TRADITIONAL finance company in an industry where the small loan rate structure has not changed significantly in the past 130 years! Typically, the best pricing and most competitive rates will come from a bank. If you choose an alternative to a traditional bank, we’d strongly suggest avoiding triple-digit APR lenders such as payday, title, and  check advance lenders. We believe we are a reasonable alternative to this type of lending institution.
            






At Eagle, we offer monthly payment terms between 8-24 months for you to payback your loan. When broken down into monthly payments, it is much more manageable for you to be able to repay a debt. Most title & cash advance lenders expect their interest plus principle back within very short windows of time… typically between 2 weeks to 30 days.











We truly strive to treat you as we would a friend. If you’re not sure… ask a friend who has borrowed from us in the past. Word of mouth is always our best source of business! If you like how you are treated, please share that with a friend.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 03/10/2015
            

                BBB has determined that Eagle Financial Services, Inc. meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation

            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied.

Composite Score:





                        Eagle Financial Services, Inc. has received 4.34 out of 5 stars based on 19 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.
