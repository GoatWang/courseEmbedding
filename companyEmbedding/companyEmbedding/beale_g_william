Title: Board Member

Job Details
               We are a full service employee benefit advisory firm with a special focus on employers with fewer than 100 employees. This segment of the business community is impacted greatly by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) but has fewer choices when it comes to highly qualified employee benefit guidance. Many times these businesses have been left to go it alone when it comes to very complicated decisions by their current brokers. Our role is to simplify the employee benefit buying and management experience for our clients. This is accomplished by taking a high touch and engaged consultative approach with extremely knowledgeable staff.

Union Bankshares Corporation names John C. Asbury President; To succeed G. William Beale as CEO in 2017
Succession plan positions union for seamless leadership transition and strategic continuity
MORRISVILLE, VT (August 24, 2016) — The Board of Directors of Union Bankshares Corporation (“Union”) today announced that G. William (“Billy”) Beale, 66, will step down as Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) on January 2, 2017, and will be succeeded by John C. Asbury, 51, who will become President of Union Bankshares Corporation and President and CEO of Union Bank & Trust effective October 1, 2016.  Beale will continue to work in an executive capacity as Executive Vice Chairman of the Board for Union Bankshares Corporation and Union Bank & Trust until March 31, 2017.  He will remain on the Board of Directors of Union Bankshares Corporation and stand for reelection to the Board at the 2017 Annual Meeting.
“Today’s announcement provides for leadership continuity to deliver upon Union’s future growth plans,” said Raymond D. Smoot, Jr., Chairman of the Board of Union Bankshares Corporation.  “The Board in conjunction with Billy actively engaged in a comprehensive succession plan that included a nationwide search.  It became clear that John’s demonstrated capabilities stemming from 29 years of leadership experience at some of the most well-known and highly-regarded banking institutions ideally suited him to lead our strategy of growing the Union franchise beyond the $10 billion asset threshold.  We are confident that this leadership succession plan solidly positions Union to generate consistent top-tier financial performance and attractive long-term shareholder returns.
“Billy’s tenure at Union has been tremendous,” continued Smoot.  “Under his leadership over the last 25 years, the bank has undergone a historic transformation from a small rural community bank to the largest Virginia-based community banking institution serving multiple markets with diversified lines of business.  Billy’s vision and energy has created a durable company that has grown assets to more than $8.1 billion from $180 million and delivered to shareholders a total cumulative return of more than 850% since the company went public in 1993.  On behalf of our shareholders, the Board and entire bank, we thank Billy for his dedication and commitment to making Union the outstanding institution it is today.”
“It has been a great privilege to lead Union for over 25 years, and I am proud of what we have accomplished together,” said Beale.  “Union has never been stronger and our strategy is delivering, so now is the ideal time to execute the leadership transition plan.  John brings proven capabilities in profitably growing business lines across key banking segments, including commercial, small business, retail and wealth management, as well as partnering with mortgage teams to deliver holistic financial solutions to customers.  His recent tenure at a community bank coupled with his deep executive experience at national and regional financial institutions makes him uniquely qualified to lead Union.  John understands the importance of preserving a customer and community centric culture while driving top tier performance.  I look forward to working with John and our teammates to further our path to top-tier financial performance.  Our future is bright and I am confident Union will continue to thrive under John’s leadership.”
“I am excited to join Union as only the 6th president in the bank’s 114-year history and honored to ultimately succeed Billy as CEO,” said Asbury.  “I look forward to working with the team to execute on the growth strategy and achieve the significant milestones that the company has laid out.  Under Billy’s leadership, Union has built an incredibly strong foundation and forged promising new growth avenues.  The company’s scale, talent, resources and outstanding performance record will enable us to successfully execute our strategy of organic growth complemented by select acquisitions.  I believe we are well positioned to capitalize on our strengths to continue to create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders, teammates and customers.”

Product Description
This Interpretive Lexicon has two primary functions aimed at facilitating the exegetical and translational task, namely as a lexicon and also as an interpretive handbook. First, this book lists the vast majority of Greek prepositions, adverbs, particles, relative pronouns, conjunctions, and other connecting words that are notorious for being some of the most difficult words to translate. For each word included, page references are given for several major lexical resources where the user can quickly go to examine the nuances and parameters of the word for translation options. This book will save considerable time for students of the Greek New Testament text. For example, for the Greek preposition en (occurs 2,750 times in the New Testament) covers four pages of small print in the Bauer-Danker lexicon (BDAG). But Interpretive Lexicon digests those pages in just a few lines, with the page numbers and section references given for A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature, 3rd Edition (BDAG, 00) and 2nd Edition (BAGD, 79), Greek Grammar Beyond the Basics (Daniel B. Wallace), and Prepositions and Theology in the Greek New Testament (Murray J. Harris). Thus, the translation options can be analyzed quickly. For words with a lower frequency of occurrence and fewer translation options, this book may be sufficient in itself as a lexicon. Secondly, these prepositions, conjunctions, adverbs, and connecting words in Greek, as in every language, function as explicit discourse-level markers that are essential for ascertaining the main point(s) of a passage. Therefore, this Interpretive Lexicon also evaluates the discourse function(s) of each word that is defined and catalogued, and categorizes its semantic range into defined logical relationships. This feature of the lexiconadds an interpretiveelement, since translation must include interpretation, at least on a linguistic level. For example, en may be translated in many ways, but those ways are categorized broadly in this book into relationships such as locative (in, among, on), means-end (with, by), grounds (because, on account of), temporal (while, at), and so on. This interpretive feature of the book is tremendously helpful for the exegetical process, allowing for the translator to closely follow the logical flow of the text with greater efficiency. This Interpretive Lexicon is thus a remarkable resource for student, pastor, and scholar alike. "
