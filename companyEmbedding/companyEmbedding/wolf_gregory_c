Where Are John Piper and Rick Warren on Persecution?


English: Official Congressional portrait of Congressman Frank Wolf. (Photo credit: Wikipedia)
Thank you, Representative Frank Wolf. A long-time advocate for religious freedom, Representative Wolf (R- VA) is now crying out for Christians in America to advocate on behalf of suffering Christians around the world.
The slaughter of thousands of Christians in Syria at the hands of Sunni Muslims and the killing of thousands more Coptic Christians in Egypt has Representative Wolf calling out famous Christian pastors like John Piper and Rick Warren. Having been taught much by the former, I can vouch for Dr. Piper’s concern for the persecuted. A search of the Desiring God website will deliver hundreds of messages related to Christian persecution.
Nevertheless, Wolf’s cry rings true.  Will it be effective, or will it go the way of the tornado test siren, which gets our attention for only a second before we conclude nothing really serious is underway?  Let us pray that Piper, Warren, and many others will hear the siren call and be stirred into action on behalf of suffering Christians.
Representative Wolf made his challenge to Christian leaders on the Janet Mefferd Show: “The church in the West is relatively silent,” He then asked, “Where’s Rick Warren? Where’s John Piper? Where are the people? Why aren’t they speaking out on this? I just have a hard time wondering why more in the West are not speaking out.”
The problem is greater than one which can be solved by Rick Warren or John Piper. The entire Christian Church in America and around the world needs immediately to wake up to the suffering bride of Christ.  Cedar Grove Baptist Church founded Project 13:3 for the sole purpose of helping Christians to remember the persecuted church. It is an urgent need and high priority for Christ Himself.
Thank you, Representative Wolf, for your work. For anyone interested in being part of the growing movement on behalf of persecuted Christians, you can join us from anywhere this Sunday, November 11.
