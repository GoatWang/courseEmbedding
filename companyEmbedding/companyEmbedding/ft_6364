An Annotated List of the Mayflies, Stoneflies, and Caddisflies of the Sand Creek Basin, Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve, Colorado, 2004 and 2005. 01/09/2008In the last decade, several federal agencies have emphasized the need for developing formal biological inventory and monitoring programs. These programs document both historical and current biodiversity and assess the impacts of natural and human-induced environmental disturbance. Examples of such programs include the National Park Service Inventory and Monitoring Program, the National Water Quality Assessment (NAWQA) program of the U.S. Geological Survey, the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment program (EMAP) of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the National Forest Inventory and Analysis program of the U.S. Forest Service. Inventories of flora and fauna associated with literature reviews are typically the first phase of these programs and represent an extensive point-in-time effort to determine the spatial distribution of species. Often, based on these inventory data, a followup monitoring program is implemented where study sites of special interest are determined, and more intensive sampling is performed to detect temporal changes in biota...
