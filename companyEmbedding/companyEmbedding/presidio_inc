SMPS Soldering Recommendations
        for ceramic Stacked capacitors
        
Click for Enhanced View/Printable PDF 


The following are general recommendations for soldering of ceramic stacked capacitors. In general, Presidio Components recommends against hand soldering for this type of large ceramic device. However, if hand soldering cannot be avoided, it should be done with care to avoid thermally cracking the parts. Soldering of 
          these parts to the circuit board, if done in a careless manner, is the most likely source of reliability problems.
PREHEATING AND MOUNTING. For reflow soldering, the parts should be preheated to within 50°C - 60°C of the reflow temperature, or as close as is practical. A convection-style reflow oven with nitrogen is ideal, but other types of reflow will also work. The heat-up and cool-down rates (dT/dt) should be kept well under 4°C/sec. and preferably under 2°C/sec. After soldering, allow the parts to air cool to room temperature     before cleaning.
Note: Presidio Components parts are designed to reliably withstand reflow temperatures of 265°C maximum. If higher temperature reflow is required, consult factory.
HAND SOLDERING. If hand soldering must be used, preheat the parts as recommended above. A hot-air gun is an ideal tool for preheating. When hand soldering, avoid excessive heat, and keep the tip of the soldering iron as far away from the ceramic as possible. As an example, for through-hole leaded parts, solder from the backside of the board. This will minimize the risk of thermally cracking the ceramic. After     soldering, allow the parts to air cool to room temperature before cleaning.
PRE-TINNING LEADS. The leads do not need to be pre-tinned as they have already been tinned with Sn63 as part of our process.
In addition to the above, the following rules apply: 
• Do not dip stacked capacitors into a solder pot (to pre-tin, for example).
• Do not touch-up a solder joint with a soldering iron. If touch up is necessary follow preheating and hand soldering recommendations above.
• Do not deform leads or use excessive force to install parts.
Further, in accordance with Mil-PRF-49470, the following precaution should be followed:
"Precautionary Note: Capacitors covered by this specification sheet are very susceptible to thermal shock damage due to their large ceramic mass. Temperature profiles used should provide adequate temperature rise and cool-down time to prevent damage from thermal shock."

We estimate that the net proceeds to us from the sale of our common stock in
this Offering will be approximately $214.3 million, or approximately $247.2
million, if the underwriters elect to exercise in full their option to purchase
additional shares of common stock from us, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this Offering as follows:

(a) We intend to use approximately $124.2 million of the net proceeds from this
    Offering to repurchase all of our outstanding Subordinated Notes, of which
    $111.8 million in aggregate principal amount are currently outstanding, at a
    purchase price of 110.25% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and
    unpaid interest, if any, up to but excluding the date of such repurchase. If
    the net proceeds from this Offering are not sufficient to repurchase all of
    our outstanding Subordinated Notes at such price, we will purchase a lesser
    aggregate principal amount of Subordinated Notes with the available net
    proceeds. The Subordinated Notes accrue interest at a rate equal to 10.25%
    per annum and will mature on February 15, 2023.

(b) We intend to use approximately $108.4 million of the net proceeds from this
    Offering to redeem $97.5 million in aggregate principal amount of our Senior
    Notes at a redemption price of 110.25% of the principal amount thereof, plus
    accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to but excluding the date of such
    redemption. Net proceeds from this Offering will be applied first, to
    repurchase up to all of our Subordinated Notes, and second, to redeem up to
    $97.5 million in aggregate principal amount of our Senior Notes, as
    described above. If the net proceeds from this Offering are not sufficient
    to redeem $97.5 million in aggregate principal amount of our Senior Notes at
    such price after repurchasing all of our outstanding Subordinated Notes, as
    described above, we will redeem a lesser aggregate principal amount of
    Senior Notes with the available net proceeds. The Senior Notes accrue
    interest at a rate equal to 10.25% per annum and will mature on February 15,
    2023.

(c) To the extent any net proceeds from this Offering remain after repurchasing
    all of our Subordinated Notes and redeeming $97.5 million in aggregate
    principal amount of our Senior Notes, we intend to use such remaining net
    proceeds for working capital or general corporate purposes, including the
    repayment of amounts outstanding under our February 2015 Credit Agreement or
    our Receivables Securitization Facility. Borrowings under the February 2015
    Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate equal to either (a) a LIBOR rate
    determined by reference to the costs of funds for Eurodollar deposits for
    the interest period relevant to such borrowing, adjusted for certain
    additional costs, subject to a 1.00% floor in the case of term loans, plus a
    margin of 3.50%, or (b) a base rate plus 1.00%, in each case, plus a margin
    of 2.50%. Borrowings under the Receivables Securitization Facility bear
    interest based on a Eurodollar borrowing rate plus a utilized program fee of
    1.40%. 

To the extent that the aggregate net cash proceeds of this Offering are not
sufficient to repurchase all of our Subordinated Notes and to redeem $97.5
million in aggregate principal amount of our Senior Notes, we may elect to apply
a portion of our cash on hand towards the repurchase of our Subordinated Notes.
To the extent we do not apply cash on hand sufficient, together with net cash
proceeds from this Offering, to enable us to repurchase all of our Subordinated
Notes, and redeem $97.5 million of our Senior Notes, we intend to redeem a
lesser aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes with the available net
proceeds.

Under the terms of the indenture governing the Senior Notes, on or prior to
February 15, 2018, we may, subject to certain restrictions, redeem up to 40% of
the original aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes, with the net cash
proceeds of one or more equity offerings at a price equal to 110.25% of the
principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to but
excluding the date of redemption, provided that at least 50% of the original
aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes remain outstanding after such
redemption. As of the date of this prospectus, up to $97.5 million in aggregate
principal amount of the $250.0 million in original aggregate principal amount of
our outstanding Senior Notes (of which $222.5 million is currently outstanding)
can be redeemed pursuant to the optional redemption provision described in the
preceding sentence. 

On February 15, 2017, we entered into a Notes Purchase Agreement with Deutsche
Bank AG (the “Notes Purchase Agreement”), who is the holder of 100% of our
outstanding Subordinated Notes, pursuant to which we agreed to use the net
proceeds of this Offering to repurchase, and Deutsche Bank AG agreed to sell to
us, all of the outstanding Subordinated Notes (or, to the extent the net
proceeds are not sufficient to repurchase all Subordinated Notes, a lesser
amount) at the Subordinated Notes Repurchase Price. Following the repurchase by
us of the Subordinated Notes, we anticipate that any such Subordinated Notes
would be cancelled.

An alternative investment vehicle formed by the limited partners of the Apollo
Funds owns substantially all of the economic interests in the Subordinated Notes
pursuant to certain derivative arrangements entered into with Deutsche Bank AG.
As such, we presently anticipate that any portion of the proceeds of this
Offering used by the Company to repurchase the Subordinated Notes would be paid,
directly or indirectly, to such alternative investment vehicle (net of any
amounts owed by such alternative investment vehicle to Deutsche Bank AG pursuant
to such derivative arrangements).

An independent special committee of our Board of Directors, advised by its own
counsel and financial advisor, recommended to our Board of Directors for their
approval that the net proceeds of this Offering be used to repurchase our
Subordinated Notes. The Board of Directors subsequently approved the proposed
use of proceeds of this Offering, including the repurchase of the Subordinated
Notes and the redemption of the Senior Notes.

The expected use of proceeds from this Offering represents our intentions based
upon our current plans and business conditions. The amounts and timing of our
actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors and any
unforeseen cash needs. As a result, management will retain broad discretion over
the allocation of the net proceeds from this Offering, subject to the terms and
conditions of the Notes Purchase Agreement.


We believe we are the only national, vendor-agnostic IT Services company that
provides advanced end-to-end solutions through local high-touch relationships to
the middle market. We believe we are competitively differentiated by our broad
range of capabilities that we combine to offer best-in-class solutions to the
middle market. We incorporate high-value services including strategy and
consulting, design, implementation, optimization, and managed services, as well
as technology expertise and strong vendor relationships. Across our solutions,
we compete with companies such as Accenture, CDW, Deloitte, IBM, and Optiv. We
categorize our competitors as:

• Large Service Providers: Global service providers have scale and consulting 
  capabilities but are not middle-market focused and generally do not provide 
  all aspects of the IT value chain. We combine the scale, talent, technical 
  expertise, and high-value services of the large service providers with 
  end-to-end solution capabilities and a strategic middle-market focus.

• Local and Regional Providers: Though local and regional providers often have
  strong local relationships, many of them have historically been focused on one
  or two IT areas. As IT complexity has increased, these providers have 
  attempted to transition from a siloed approach toward a multi-technology and
  multi-vendor approach. However, the relatively small scale of local and 
  regional providers makes investments across multiple, integrated technology 
  stacks financially prohibitive and, as a result, these competitors are 
  increasingly getting left behind as they lack the professional and managed 
  services capabilities in digital infrastructure, cloud, IoT, and 
  cybersecurity. Also, lack of capability and financial scale often excludes 
  these providers from executing on larger, multi-geography projects and 
  relationships and developing advanced services.  

• Boutique Specialists: Many boutique specialists focus in one distinct solution
  area rather than developing deep capabilities across the full range of IT 
  challenges facing clients today. These firms are also typically sub-scale in 
  terms of geographic coverage limiting their abilities to service larger, 
  multi-location/multi-national customers. Our technical know-how across 
  technologies and vendors, combined with our scale and broad client base, gives
  us the ability to deliver end-to-end offerings to much larger and more diverse
  end markets. As technologies continue to grow in complexity and 
  interdependency, these providers will struggle to service client’s needs.

• Resellers: Rather than focusing principally on product resale, we focus on 
  consulting, solution delivery, and ongoing services that allow us to develop
  long-lasting client relationships. Our lifecycle engagement model focuses on a
  holistic approach that includes high-value services and end-to-end solutions.


Company Description
Presidio is a leading provider of information technology (“IT”) solutions to the
middle market in North America. We enable business transformation through our
expertise in IT solutions, with a specific focus on Digital Infrastructure,
Cloud and Security solutions. Our solutions are delivered


 through a broad suite
of professional services, including strategy, consulting, design and
implementation. We complement our professional services with project management,
technology acquisition, managed services, maintenance and support to offer a
full lifecycle model. Our services-led, lifecycle model leads to ongoing client
engagement. As of June 30, 2016, we serve approximately 7,000 middle-market,
large and government organizations across a diverse range of industries.

We have three solution areas: (i) Digital Infrastructure, (ii) Cloud and
(iii) Security. Through our increasing focus on cloud and security, we believe
we are well positioned to benefit from the rapid growth in demand for these
technologies and expect our business mix to continue shifting toward them.
Within our three solutions areas, we offer customers enterprise-class solutions
that are critical to driving digital transformation and expanding business
capabilities. Examples of our solutions include advanced networking, Internet of
Things (“IoT”), data center modernization, hybrid and multi-cloud, cyber risk
management, enterprise mobility and management of data from sensors, cameras,
wearables and machines that can be accessed and shaped to derive actionable
insights and business outcomes (“data analytics”). These solutions are enabled
by our expertise in foundational technologies, built upon our investments in
network, data center, security, collaboration and mobility.

The middle market is a highly attractive segment of the IT Services market. We
believe we are the leading middle-market provider of IT solutions and are
differentiated by our strategic focus on this attractive segment. The increasing
potential and complexity of emerging technologies and digital transformation are
creating more demand for our solutions and services. As a trusted solutions
provider, our clients rely on us for IT investment decisions. We simplify IT for
them by building solutions utilizing what we view as the best possible
technologies. Customers in the middle market are usually large enough to have
substantial technology needs but typically have fewer IT resources and lack the
broad expertise required to develop the necessary solutions as compared to
larger companies. Since many large-scale IT Services providers focus on larger
enterprises, and because many resellers are unable to provide end-to-end
solutions, we believe the middle market has remained underpenetrated and
underserved.

We develop and maintain our long-term client relationships through a localized
direct sales force of over 500 employees based in over 60 offices across the
United States as of June 30, 2016. As a strategic partner and trusted advisor to
our clients, we provide the expertise to implement new solutions, as well as
optimize and better leverage existing IT resources. We provide strategy,
consulting, design, customized deployment, integration and lifecycle management
through our team of approximately 1,600 engineers as of June 30, 2016, enabling
us to architect and manage the ideal IT solutions for our clients. Our local
delivery model, combining relationship managers and expert engineering teams,
allows us to win, retain and expand our client relationships.

Our client base is diversified across individual customers and industry
verticals. In our fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, only 19% of our revenue was
attributable to our top 25 clients by revenue and no industry vertical accounted
for more than 20% of our revenue. Among the verticals that we serve, healthcare,
professional services, financial services, governments and education are our
largest categories. We believe that our diversified business profile is a key
driver of our ability to generate growth across different economic and
technology cycles.

Our strategic focus on the middle market and high-growth solutions areas has
enabled us to achieve 11% annualized growth in our revenue from our fiscal year
ended June 30, 2012 to our fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. Over the same
period, we have significantly outpaced the overall IT market growth rate,
according to Gartner. We believe that we are well positioned for continued
success as IT becomes more transformative and complex, driving demand for our
solutions.

We were incorporated in Delaware on November 20, 2014 under the name Aegis
Holdings, Inc. On September 15, 2016, we changed our name to Presidio, Inc. Our
principal executive offices are located at One Penn Plaza, Suite 2832, New York,
New York 10119 and our telephone number is (212) 652-5700. We also maintain a

2013 and Earlier:
The IT Services group at Presidio (led by the VP of IT Services) is a small internal IT support group whose leadership is located in Conshohocken, PA. Within this group, there is a team devoted to business intelligence in which its business analysts members are working in a couple of different project areas. The Operations Director there, although not in IT, manages the administrative aspects of various internal projects and process improvement initiatives.

The main data center for the company is at its headquarters in Greenbelt, MD. The staff here, in addition to supporting this site, handles technical issues involving infrastructure for the Mid-Atlantic region. The company also has IT staff providing on site technical support in Woburn, MA.

Most of the company's technical staff, however, deals with providing technical and consulting services to customers. This side of the business has professionals working in the area of Technical Services and Engineering (Sales & Solutions). The firm's proximity to Washington DC enables it to be a service provider to government agencies. Some of the roles of these professionals include areas like network engineering and security consulting.
