By David HublerDec 01, 2008


        L-3 Communications Corp. is acquiring Chesapeake Sciences Corp., a developer and manufacturer of anti-submarine warfare technology. Financial terms were not disclosed.

The acquisition is expected to be completed by March 2009, pending standard regulatory approvals.

No. 8
 on Washington Technology's 2008
