John Morgan
Orlando, florida

Biography Overview
On March 31, 1956, John Morgan was born in Lexington, Kentucky. In 1971, he and his family moved to Orlando, Florida, where John attended high school. After graduating, John enrolled in the University of Florida and became a member of Alpha Tau Omega. In 1982, he became president of Florida Blue Key. John graduated from the University of Florida College of Law in 1983.
By 1988, John had founded Morgan & Morgan under the belief that the firm would represent the people, not the powerful. To this day, John has run the firm by that code, promising never to take a case representing an insurance carrier or large company. Through John’s guidance, leadership and vision, the firm has founded multiple locations throughout Florida, including Orlando, Tampa, Fort Myers, Fort Lauderdale, Winter Haven, Daytona, Kissimmee, Saint Petersburg, Naples, Tavares, Jacksonville, Melbourne, The Villages, Pensacola and Tallahassee. The firm has also expanded nationally, opening offices in Georgia, Mississippi, Tennessee, New York, Kentucky, New Jersey, Alabama and Philadelphia.
Morgan & Morgan employs 307 staff attorneys and over 1,400 support staff members. More than twenty-five years after the firm’s inception, “for the people” continues to be a way of life for John Morgan and the firm.
John has lectured across the country on the practice of law. He has been an active member of the Florida Academy of Trial Lawyers and served as a FLAG trustee, making a push for Florida state law that would protect families from corporations and insurance companies. John is currently on the board of trustees for the University of Florida’s Levin College of Law.
John has received Martindale-Hubbell’s esteemed “AV” rating, which recognizes lawyers with the highest ethical standards and professional ability. Based on the recommendations of his peers, John’s “AV” rating serves a testament to the fact that fellow attorneys consider him at the highest level of professional excellence. Only a select group of attorneys are ever awarded with this premier distinction.
John has reached another career milestone when he has proudly released his books titled “You Can’t Teach Hungry…Creating the Multimillion Dollar Law Firm,” and “You Can’t Teach Vision…The Twenty-First Century Law Firm” on which he frequently lectures. The books offer insight into John’s success, philosophy and business methods, and provides the groundwork for a sustainable and enduring practice. Lawyers from across the country have read the books and continue to reach out to John for further guidance and advice.
John and his wife, Ultima, proudly support the Second Harvest Food Bank of Central Florida, whose principal goal is to end the “invisible problem” of hunger throughout the state. In 2013, John and Ultima made a generous donation that helped the organization fund and open the Morgan & Morgan, P.A. Hunger Relief Center. The 100,000-square foot facility—more than double the size of its predecessor—is equipped with ample freezers, coolers, and infrastructure space to store the millions of pounds of food collected by Second Harvest each year.
In 2013, John announced his support of the campaign to legalize medical marijuana in Florida for use by the state’s seriously ill. According to John, the deeply personal cause is a step to not only provide safer pain relief and treatment methods for those with legitimate diseases, but also to help end the rampant problem of prescription drug abuse in Florida. In addition to his financial contributions, John has been the public face of the effort, openly recruiting volunteers to collect the thousands of signatures needed to place the initiative on Florida’s November 2016 general election ballot.
With all of his success, John’s personal accomplishment of raising four children with Ultima, his wife of 31 years, remains dearest to his heart.

            From the first day I talked to Jay about my case until the day my case was settled, he made me feel like he truly cared about me as a person, not just a client. I highly recommend Morgan & Morgan to anyone in need. And, I will never be able to thank them enough for what they did for me!

Biography Overview
Ultima Morgan was born in Houston, Texas on September 4, 1956. She received her undergraduate degree at the University of Florida in 1977 and earned her Juris Doctor, with honors, three years later. She is admitted to practice in Florida and handles corporate litigation and business law cases. She was named an AV-rated attorney by Martindale-Hubbell in 2011, an award signifying that her peers ranked her at the highest level of professional excellence.
More than 30 years ago, Ultima married John Morgan, who has been named among the most powerful people in Orlando. Alongside her husband, who she met in law school, Ultima supports philanthropic endeavors such as The People’s Clinic, which provides free medical and health services to uninsured children in Central Florida; the Second Harvest Food Bank of Central Florida, which in 2013 dedicated a new 100,000-square foot food storage facility in the Morgans’ name; and The Destiny Foundation of Central Florida, a nonprofit ministry that works with impoverished
Florida families. 
Prior to becoming the second Morgan in the firm’s namesake, Ultima was a successful securities attorney at another Florida law firm. While her children were young, Ultima continued to work as an attorney while her husband began to create the beginnings of what is now one of the premier plaintiffs’ personal injury and consumer protection law firms in the country.
Ultima is the mother of the Morgans’ four children, Matt, Michael, Daniel and Kate.

Not only are their agents professionally helpful, but they are generous people who care greatly about their community, supporting my organization both financially AND through volunteerism. I would highly recommend their 5-star services and would say that you would have a hard time finding people more friendly than the folks at Camargo Insurance.Hair Art Studioahartnett11 ratedI have done every horrible, damaging thing to my hair and Kat is always there to save the day & make it look beautiful again!  It is apparent that she is an expert in color as she always exceeds my high (and difficult) expectations and is able to explain it to me each step of the way.  Kat works with my budget and schedule, she is a lot of fun to be around, and her salon is super cute and modern.  I would definitely recommend Hair Art Studio to anyone in search of a salon in Cincinnati!Hettesheimer Insurance Agency IncScott H. ratedOutstanding ServiceWe have been dealing with Denise Salyers at Hettesheimer Insurance for over 10 years. She has always given us outstanding service when helping us select our company's health insurance products. She is very knowledgeable and goes out of her way to help us in any way she can. Many of our employees have called her for advice as well. We would not even consider using any other agent for our health insurance needs.-Carol H.E John Rewwer CLUPhyllis H. ratedA really great dentist with a staff to match.  He has compassion for those of us with dental phobias and makes sure to keep you comfortable during procedures.   An entirely different dental experience than my youth.  I can't say it's my favorite thing to do, but  you are in good hands with Dr. Rewwer.Statements SalonKen H. ratedThis is absolutely the best salon in Cincinnati, my wife won't go anywhere else and now I go there too. The salon is very friendly, modern, and comfortble. Customer satisfaction is their #1 concern, and they always do a professional job. Highly recommended!Paragon SalonsPhyllis H. ratedFull service salon with several locations in the area.  They are pricey , but you get what you pay for.  You can accrue  points based on the amount you spend that can be used for products they sell.  Glad they are finally accepting American Express cards.Avalon Salon & Spamichell ratedI recently went to Avalon Salo...I recently went to Avalon Salon & Spa for a facial.

When buying a policy, the person agrees to pay a premium, which is small, regular payment based on the losses that may occur. If the insurance provider determines there is a greater chance of risk as compared to the average policy, the premium is usually higher. Premiums are often paid monthly, and can add up over time up to be greater than the expense of replacing the insured item.Many types of insurance only cover a certain amount of risk on an item. The amount the policyholder must pay before an insurance policy begins covering an expense is called the deductible. In the event of damage or loss to whatever the policy covers, the policyholder is responsible for the deductible no matter what. If the cost of damage or loss is less than the deductible amount, the insurance company does not pay anything. If the cost is greater than the deductible, the policyholder only pays the deductible, while the insurance pays the rest. Generally, the deductible amount is related to your premium, with a higher deductible usually requiring a lower premium, and vice-versa.Insurance Agents
Selecting the right insurance involves careful research and evaluating many different options for coverage. This is why many people use an insurance agent to assist with making the right choice depending on their needs and financial situation. Agents often interview potential or current clients to get an idea of which insurance policies would benefit them the most. Based on their needs and individual risk, agents can often give potential customers a quote, which serves as a cost estimate for a specific policy. This is only a rough idea of what the policy will cost, because evaluating the risk associated with a given customer can take time. Insurance companies often compile an insurance score to quantify the risk an individual poses and calculate premiums accordingly. Credit scores play a major role in insurance scores, but past insurance-claim history is also taken into account.While agents often specialize in a particular category of insurance, some sell several different types of insurance. Agents can work for a larger insurance company or operate independently, selling policies from several different insurers.Insurance ProductsAlmost anything of value can be insured to protect against loss due to a variety of circumstances. Insurance policies are very specific in the items they protect and in what event the policy holders will be reimbursed. Some of the most common insurance policies cover things we all use.Automotive Insurance
Millions of Americans drive a car to get from place to place each day, so it makes sense that auto insurance is one of the most commonly used types. In most states, the law requires drivers to maintain an active insurance policy on any car, up to a certain amount. Most car owners are required at minimum to purchase liability insurance, which protects against damage for which the policyholder is at fault. Liability insurance covers damage to property as well as any injuries sustained in an accident. It's important to note liability insurance only covers damage or injuries of others, not the policyholder themselves. In addition to liability insurance, car owners can also purchase coverage for their own vehicle and medical expenses in the event of an accident. For this purpose, liability, vehicle and medical coverage are often packaged together in a single policy.Insurance can also be purchased for other vehicles, like motorcycles, ATVs, boats or RVs, and generally functions similarly to car insurance. Policies for alternative vehicles may have higher premiums if they are considered more dangerous, or might include other coverage options specific to the vehicle. Many companies that provide auto insurance will also offer coverage for motorcycles, ATVs, boats and RVs.Homeowners Insurance
Your home, condo or apartment is probably the most valuable thing you own or otherwise pay for, so it makes sense to get it insured. Homeowners insurance is important not just for the security of the house itself, but for its ability to cover possessions inside the home as well. Many mortgage lenders also require an active home insurance policy.Like auto insurance, homeowners insurance is typically bundled together with policies covering many different items or categories of items. The primary coverage type is for the dwelling, insuring the house itself and all structures attached to it. Policies may also cover property within the home, with premiums varying depending on the value of all assets. Personal liability may also be included for damage or injuries sustained on your property that you are responsible for, much like auto insurance.Property insurance also may cover certain major events outside of your control. These are known as perils, and may include fire, flooding, natural disasters and other catastrophic events. You may want to purchase insurance against one or more of these perils if you live in a high-risk area. Flood insurance is an exception, however, and can be purchased through the government-sponsored National Flood Insurance Program. Your lender may require this if you live in a flood-prone area.Health Insurance
To help pay for medical expenses, many people rely on their health insurance. With the passing of the Affordable Care Act, almost every American is required to enroll in a health care plan, or they face a penalty. Health insurance works similarly to other forms of insurance, although it is probably used to cover expenses more often, since car accidents and home damage are relatively rare compared to doctor visits and the need for medicine. Health insurance also operates on a premium-deductible model, and policyholders can choose what level of coverage works best for their lifestyle. For example, if you visit doctors very infrequently, you may consider a plan with a low premium and a higher deductible. On the other hand, people who require regular medical care may wish to pay a higher premium in exchange for more coverage from their deductible. Dental and vision care are sold as separate plans and are not required by law.Life Insurance
When someone dies unexpectedly or is injured severely enough to be unable to work, it can be a financial disaster for their family or loved ones. Many people choose to purchase a life insurance policy to support their family in the event their regular income is suddenly lost. Life insurance comes in two basic types: term and universal. With a term life insurance plan, you pay a premium for a predetermined amount of time, usually 10 years or more. If you die at any point in that timeframe, your family receives a death benefit. If you're still around when the term is over, the coverage is canceled and you receive nothing. Universal life covers your entire life, and usually delivers a minimum benefit at death.Travel insurance
Travel insurance is available for individuals who want to protect against unexpected setbacks in the course of travel, whether it's losing luggage or medical treatment abroad. Travel insurance may prove particularly useful for people who travel a lot for work or often visit remote locations. Travel insurance can take the form of either specific or blanket coverage. Specific coverage is useful for covering only certain risks, like medical emergencies or unexpected trip cancelation. Blanket coverage may cover some or all of your expenses for your entire trip.Pet insurance
Pet insurance is a relatively new product that may help cover the costs of medical care for a dog, cat or other domestic animal. Medical care for animals can be very costly, particularly because insurance for them is rare. By paying into a premium, you can help offset the cost of unexpected emergencies as well as routine checkups and medication. While virtually unheard of a few years ago, pet insurance has become more popular as the cost of veterinarian care has continued to rise.Umbrella insurance
Umbrella insurance is extra coverage from liability for other insurance policies, usually home or auto insurance. Consumers may choose to purchase an umbrella policy if their home or car is more expensive than a typical policy would be able to cover. For example, most car insurance liability policies cover at least $25,000 per person or $50,000 per accident. But if the accident involves a very valuable car, or the victim is willing to pursue legal action, insurance may not even begin to cover the full cost. You may want to hedge your risk by purchasing umbrella insurance to add extra protection to your existing policy.Insurance Claims BasicsTo receive a payout for an insurance policy, the policyholder must file a claim with the insurance company. The basics of the process are straightforward, but can vary depending on the type of insurance.Claims Adjusters and Examiners
A claims adjuster or claims examiner is an employee of an insurance company, and the person responsible for evaluating claims and determining if the company will reimburse the policyholder at the amount provided. An adjuster inspects claims related to property damage, as in the case of auto or home insurance policies. Claims examiners are typically involved in health and life insurance, and review medical records to determine the proper payout for major medical procedures.How To Make a Claim
Filing an insurance claim can be stressful and confusing, but you need to begin the process as soon as possible to make certain you can recover your losses. It's important to note that in the case of emergencies, you should always call 911 first. The safety and health of yourself and others takes precedent over insurance.Auto Insurance Claim: If you're involved in an accident, you need to call the police right away and have them document the situation. You can file a claim upon obtaining the police report. It's also a good idea, if possible, to take your own notes at the scene. The most important things to record are what happened before the accident, the date and time, traffic signs in the area and road conditions. Also be sure to get the other driver's name, address, license plate number and insurance information. Even photos taken with a cell phone camera can help the claims process. Once you have this documentation, call your insurance company right away.
Homeowners Insurance Claim: In the case of damage, take pictures of the affected area as soon as any safety or health emergencies are resolved. Take note of what happened and all the relevant circumstances and report to your insurer as soon as possible. If any of your possessions were damaged, use an inventory of your important assets and make note of this in the claim. Once an adjuster has made their own report, review it for accuracy.
Life Insurance Claim: Send your insurer a claim form for each beneficiary in the plan, as well as a certified copy of the policyholder's death certificate. With the proper information, life insurance claims are generally straightforward. Problems may arise if the policyholder has died within two years of opening the policy. In this case, an attorney may be needed to settle the claim.Finding Discounts on InsuranceInsurance is a wise investment, but it can make a dent in your monthly budget. Thankfully, there are a variety of ways to trim the fat off your premiums and make certain you are paying only as much as you need.Shop and Compare
Perhaps the best way to save on any insurance policy is to take the time to compare prices between as many companies and plans as possible. Even after you've chosen a plan and started paying into it, consider looking around again when it comes time to renew the policy. Consider using an independent agent when searching for a new insurance policy. While traditional agents can still find a good deal, independent agents can choose from a variety of providers and tailor your coverage to your specific needs. The Internet has also made comparison shopping easier than ever before. Potential customers can often get free quotes online very quickly.Buy Only What You Need
Insurance agents will often try to "upsell" on various extra products that may be useful for certain people, but are generally excessive for the average consumer. Stick with basic plans that cover as much as you need without any additional costs. For example, if the annual cost of your auto insurance is 10 percent or more of the total value of your car, drop all but the most essential coverage. This is especially applicable if the car you drive is older and could be replaced with savings. Otherwise, you are paying for insurance that will never actually benefit you in the event of a serious crash. It can help to create a budget and know exactly how much income you have to work with before making a decision on a new policy.Take Advantage of Discounts
Insurance providers offer a wide variety of discounts for all kinds of special customers or circumstances. In one of the most basic discounts, many companies will offer lower rates for customers who purchase home, auto and life insurance policies from the same provider. Car owners may get a rebate from taking a safe driving course. For those with teenagers on their plan, good grades can earn a small discount as well. Insuring multiple cars with the same provider may also lower premiums. Some providers will offer lower rates for military personnel, federal employees, teachers, first responders and their families.

About Joseph Joseph | Brilliantly Useful Design








Brilliantly Useful Design



Innovation is at the heart of everything we do at Joseph Joseph, that’s why we make it our aim to identify everyday problems and solve them by designing functional solutions.




The Story Behind the Brand
In 2003 twin brothers Antony and Richard Joseph decided to join forces and launch Joseph Joseph with the goal of creating functional, problem-solving household products.
As long as the brothers can remember, they’ve always been fascinated by design. They grew up in a family manufacturing business, which really ignited their passion for design, engineering and invention.
From an early age, the brothers were designing and building products in a workshop at home and their passion for making things continued through their university years and into their early careers as product designers.










It All Started With A Chopping Board
Joseph Joseph started life relatively small with only a few products in its early collection.
This collection included a number of kitchen items but there was one product
that stood out; a simple glass chopping board. The functional, hygienic nature
of the chopping board shifted the brothers’ focus onto designing everyday products
with a core problem-solving approach.
They looked at other areas of the kitchen and soon found that the majority of
products out there simply weren’t performing as well as they should and so started
on a path to transform household essentials.
The brand has now grown to include innovative and functional products not only
for the kitchen but areas within waste management and cleaning tools.










Joseph Joseph Worldwide
From humble beginnings, the business has grown to become an award-winning international houseware brand sold in over 100 countries across the globe with offices in London, New York, Paris, Dusseldorf and Tokyo.
The whole Joseph Joseph team share the brothers’ enthusiasm for innovation and are passionate about bringing problem-solving products to as many households as possible.
