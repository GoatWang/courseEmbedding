About Varian
Varian Medical Systems’ mission is to focus energy on saving lives. To meet this challenge, we equip the world with new tools for fighting cancer.
	Since the 1950s we have been producing tools that harness the power of X-ray energy to benefit humankind. Our history is one of pioneering developments in the fields of radiotherapy, radiosurgery, X-ray tube technology, digital image detectors, cargo screening, and non-destructive testing. Today, we have a robust product portfolio and long-standing relationships with many of the world’s leading clinicians. As Varian continues to grow, our staff of over 6,600 people in 70 sales and support offices around the globe is developing innovative, cost-effective solutions that help make the world a healthier place.

 2016 
 Varian introduced 360 Oncology™ care management platform, the first software system designed to integrate and coordinate key elements of cancer care so patients and their cancer teams can collaborate on achieving the best outcomes.
 
   

 2015 
 Varian introduces VitalBeam™ for affordable advanced radiotherapy.  The new platform leverages Varian’s best technology, incorporating many innovations developed for the TrueBeam® platform to offer clinics a cost-competitive option for image-guided cancer treatment.
 
   

 2014 
 Varian finishes installation of the company’s first complete ProBeam™ system for proton therapy at Scripps Proton Therapy Center in San Diego.  Patient treatments commence.

Varian introduces the company’s first full-field digital flat-panel X-ray image detector for use in mammography systems.
 
   

 2013 
 Marking its 65th year as a company, Varian has over 6,200 employees working together toward the goal of helping to save millions of lives around the world every year. The company has expanded globally to over 80 sites on five continents, and holds over 520 active patents worldwide.
Varian’s Oncology Systems business launches a new software initiative focused on using health informatics to create knowledge-driven solutions for the entire oncology continuum from diagnosis through survivorship. A new knowledge-based software product, RapidPlan, is introduced to expedite creation of complex IMRT treatment plans while reducing variability in the quality of plans within and across treatment centers.
Varian begins offering cone-beam CT (3-D) imaging software for use with PaxScan flat-panel X-ray image detectors. This enables equipment manufacturers to quickly develop systems for use in medical, dental, or industrial applications.

The first portable, wireless PaxScan radiographic panel is introduced.
Varian acquires InfiMed Inc., a supplier of workstations including software for processing diagnostic X-ray images.  The combination of Varian and InfiMed products make Varian a one-stop shop for X-ray tubes, flat-panel image detectors, software and workstations.

About Varian
Varian Medical Systems’ mission is to focus energy on saving lives. To meet this challenge, we equip the world with new tools for fighting cancer.
	Since the 1950s we have been producing tools that harness the power of X-ray energy to benefit humankind. Our history is one of pioneering developments in the fields of radiotherapy, radiosurgery, X-ray tube technology, digital image detectors, cargo screening, and non-destructive testing. Today, we have a robust product portfolio and long-standing relationships with many of the world’s leading clinicians. As Varian continues to grow, our staff of over 6,600 people in 70 sales and support offices around the globe is developing innovative, cost-effective solutions that help make the world a healthier place.
 









 



      Our History    



2010s 2000s 1990s 1980s 1970s 1960s 1950s 1940s 1937  


 2016 
 Varian introduced 360 Oncology™ care management platform, the first software system designed to integrate and coordinate key elements of cancer care so patients and their cancer teams can collaborate on achieving the best outcomes.
 
   

 2015 
 Varian introduces VitalBeam™ for affordable advanced radiotherapy.  The new platform leverages Varian’s best technology, incorporating many innovations developed for the TrueBeam® platform to offer clinics a cost-competitive option for image-guided cancer treatment.
 
   

 2014 
 Varian finishes installation of the company’s first complete ProBeam™ system for proton therapy at Scripps Proton Therapy Center in San Diego.  Patient treatments commence.
Varian introduces ProBeam Compact single-room proton therapy system.  
Varian acquires the assets of Velocity Medical Solutions, LLC, an Atlanta-based developer of specialized software for cancer clinics.  The Velocity software platform is designed to enable data-driven clinical decision making. 
Varian introduces the company’s first full-field digital flat-panel X-ray image detector for use in mammography systems.
 
   

 2013 
 Marking its 65th year as a company, Varian has over 6,200 employees working together toward the goal of helping to save millions of lives around the world every year. The company has expanded globally to over 80 sites on five continents, and holds over 520 active patents worldwide.
Varian’s Oncology Systems business launches a new software initiative focused on using health informatics to create knowledge-driven solutions for the entire oncology continuum from diagnosis through survivorship. A new knowledge-based software product, RapidPlan, is introduced to expedite creation of complex IMRT treatment plans while reducing variability in the quality of plans within and across treatment centers.
Varian begins offering cone-beam CT (3-D) imaging software for use with PaxScan flat-panel X-ray image detectors. This enables equipment manufacturers to quickly develop systems for use in medical, dental, or industrial applications.
Varian releases a new X-ray tube for use in digital mammography systems, as well as a lightweight wireless flat-panel digital X-ray image detector for imaging extremities and for neonatal procedures.
 
   

 2012 
 Varian launches the Edge™ radiosurgery suite, and becomes the world’s largest oncology software provider with more than 3,300 Eclipse™ and ARIA sites around the world.
The company merges its X-ray Products and Security and Inspection Products groups to create a new segment called the Imaging Components Businesses, offering customers a wide range of products from X-ray tubes and digital detectors to industrial and security solutions.
The first portable, wireless PaxScan radiographic panel is introduced.
Varian acquires InfiMed Inc., a supplier of workstations including software for processing diagnostic X-ray images.  The combination of Varian and InfiMed products make Varian a one-stop shop for X-ray tubes, flat-panel image detectors, software and workstations.
 
   

 2011 
 The TrueBeam system receives a prestigious R&D 100 Award as well as a Red Dot Product Design award.
 
   

 2010 
 Varian introduces the TrueBeam™ system for radiotherapy and radiosurgery.  Designed from the ground up to treat moving tumors with unprecedented speed and accuracy, the TrueBeam system incorporates numerous technical innovations that dynamically synchronize imaging, patient positioning, motion management, and treatment delivery during radiotherapy or radiosurgery.  
The company’s Particle Therapy group introduces the ProBeam™ proton therapy system with integrated solutions for imaging, gating, robotic patient positioning, treatment planning and information management. 
Varian’s Security and Inspection Products group introduces low dose Linatron machines for portable and mobile cargo inspection.
Varian and Stanford University win $3.6 million five-year NIH/NCI research grant to develop advanced imaging technology.
