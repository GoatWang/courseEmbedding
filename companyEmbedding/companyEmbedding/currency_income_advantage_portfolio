Overview








 





Strategic Income Advantage Opportunity, Closed-End Portfolio, Series 1
The Multi-Sector Approach
The Strategic Income Advantage Opportunity Closed-End Portfolio seeks to provide a high rate of current
monthly income and to reduce some of the volatility typically associated with high-income investments.
To accomplish this, the portfolio is diversified across a broad range of closed-end funds that invest in U.S.
and foreign common stocks and taxable bonds. Because different sectors follow different cycles and
react differently to changes in global economies and interest rates, spreading assets across this spectrum
of closed-end funds has the potential to reduce the overall risk of the portfolio. In addition, based on
current publicly available information, none of the closed-end funds selected for the portfolio are
reporting the use of structural leverage.
Closed-End Features
Portfolio Control
  Unlike open-end mutual funds, closed-end funds maintain a relatively
fixed pool of investment capital. This allows portfolio managers to better adhere to their investment
philosophies through greater flexibility and control. In addition, closed-end funds don't have to manage
fund liquidity to meet potentially large redemptions.
Diversification
  The portfolio offers investors diversification by investing in a broad range of
closed-end funds that are further diversified across hundreds of individual securities. Diversification does
not guarantee a profit or protect against loss.
Income Distributions
  Closed-end funds are structured to generally provide a more
stable income stream than other managed investment products because they are not subjected to cash
inflows and outflows, which can dilute dividends over time. However, stable income cannot be assured.
Portfolio Objectives
This unit investment trust seeks a high rate of current monthly income, with capital
appreciation as a secondary objective. There is, however, no assurance that the
objectives of the portfolio will be achieved.


 Not FDIC Insured  Not Bank Guaranteed  May Lose Value 


You should consider the portfolio's investment objectives, risks, and 
  charges and expenses carefully before investing. Contact your financial advisor 
  or call First Trust Portfolios, L.P. at 1.800.621.1675 to request a prospectus, 
  which contains this and other information about the portfolio. Read it carefully 
  before you invest. 
Risk Considerations:
An investment in this unmanaged unit investment trust should be made with an 
  understanding of the risks associated with an investment in a portfolio of closed-end 
funds. 
Closed-end funds are subject to various risks, including management’s ability to meet the fund’s investment objective, and to manage the fund’s portfolio when the underlying securities are redeemed or sold, during periods of market turmoil, and as investors’ perceptions regarding the funds or their underlying investments change. Unlike open-end funds, which trade at prices based on a current determination of the fund’s net asset value, closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount to their net asset value in the secondary market. Based on current publicly available information, none of the closedend funds selected for the portfolio are reporting the use of structural leverage. Structural leverage creates a systematic level of additional investment exposure through a closed-end fund's issuance of preferred shares or debt securities, or through borrowing money. Closed-end funds which employ structural leverage are more volatile than those that do not. However, certain or all of these closed-end funds may have utilized structural leverage in the past and may elect to utilize structural leverage in the future. 
Certain of the closed-end funds invest in common stocks. Common stocks are 
  subject to certain risks, such as an economic recession and the possible deterioration 
  of either the financial condition of the issuers of the equity securities or 
  the general condition of the stock market. 
Certain of the closed-end funds invest in investment grade
  securities. Investment grade securities are subject to numerous
  risks including higher interest rates, economic recession,
  deterioration of the investment grade bond market or
  investors' perception thereof, possible downgrades and
  defaults of interest and/or principal.
Certain of the closed-end funds invest in high-yield securities or "junk" bonds. Investing in high-yield securities should be viewed as speculative and you should review your ability to assume the risks associated with investments which utilize such securities. High-yield securities are subject to numerous risks, including higher interest rates, economic recession, deterioration of the junk bond market, possible downgrades and defaults of interest and/or principal. High-yield security prices tend to fluctuate more than higher rated securities and are affected by short-term credit developments to a greater degree.
Certain of the closed-end funds invest in options. Options are subject to various 
  risks including that their value may be adversely affected if the market for 
  the option becomes less liquid or smaller. In addition, options will be affected 
  by changes in the value and dividend rates of the stock subject to the option, 
  an increase in interest rates, a change in the actual and perceived volatility 
  of the stock market and the common stock and the remaining time to expiration.
Certain of the closed-end funds invest in convertible securities.
  Convertible securities are bonds, preferred stocks and other
  securities that pay a fixed rate of interest (or dividends) and
  will repay principal at a fixed date in the future. However,
  these securities may be converted into a specific number of
  common stocks at a specified time. As such, an investment in
  convertible securities entails some of the risks associated with
  both common stocks and bonds.
Certain of the closed-end funds invest in securities issued by foreign issuers. 
  Such securities are subject to certain risks, including currency and interest 
  rate fluctuations, nationalization or other adverse political or economic developments, 
  lack of liquidity of certain foreign markets, withholding, the lack of adequate 
  financial information, and exchange control restrictions impacting foreign issuers. 
  Risks associated with investing in foreign securities may be more pronounced 
  in emerging markets where the securities markets are substantially smaller, 
  less developed, less liquid less regulated, and more volatile than the U.S. 
  and developed foreign markets.
Certain of the closed-end funds invest in U.S. Treasury obligations which are subject to numerous
  risks including higher interest rates, economic recession and deterioration of the bond market or
  investors’ perceptions thereof.
It is important to note that an investment can be made in the underlying funds directly rather
  than through the trust. These direct investments can be made without paying the trust’s sales
  charge, operating expenses and organizational costs.
For a discussion of additional risks of investing in the trust see the “Risk Factors” section of the
  prospectus.
The value of the securities held by the trust may be subject to steep declines or increased
  volatility due to changes in performance or perception of the issuers.

Although this portfolio terminates in approximately 15 months, the strategy is long-term.
Investors should consider their ability to pursue investing in successive portfolios, if available.
There may be tax consequences unless units are purchased in an IRA or other qualified plan.



 
The information in the prospectus is not complete and may be changed. We may not sell these securities until the registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission is effective. The prospectus is not an offer to sell these securities and is not soliciting an offer to buy these securities in any state where the offer or sale is not permitted.

 At July 31, 2014, the Portfolio had sufficient cash and/or securities to cover commitments under these contracts.
 In the normal course of pursuing its investment objective and its use of derivatives, the Portfolio is subject to the following risks:
 Commodity Risk: During the fiscal year to date ended July 31, 2014, the Portfolio invested in commodity futures contracts that provided
exposure to the investment returns of certain commodities. Commodity futures contracts were used to enhance total return and/or as a substitute for the purchase or sale of commodities.  Foreign Exchange Risk: During the fiscal year to date ended July 31, 2014, the Portfolio engaged in forward foreign currency exchange contracts and total return swaps to enhance total return, to seek
to hedge against fluctuations in currency exchange rates and/or as a substitute for the purchase or sale of securities or currencies.  The
fair value of open derivative instruments (not considered to be hedging instruments for accounting disclosure purposes) and whose primary underlying risk exposure is foreign exchange risk at July 31, 2014 was as follows:

 The cost and unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investments of the Portfolio at July 31, 2014, as determined
on a federal income tax basis, were as follows:

Under generally accepted accounting principles for fair value measurements, a three-tier hierarchy to
prioritize the assumptions, referred to as inputs, is used in valuation techniques to measure fair value. The three-tier hierarchy of inputs is summarized in the three broad levels listed below. 
 


•
 
 Level 1 — quoted prices in active markets for identical investments 
 


•
 
 Level 2 — other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar investments, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk,
etc.)   


•
 
 Level 3 — significant unobservable inputs (including a fund’s own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments)
 In cases where the inputs used to measure fair value fall in different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level
disclosed is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing
in those securities.  At July 31, 2014, the hierarchy of inputs used in valuing the Portfolio’s investments and open derivative
instruments, which are carried at value, were as follows:

Exchange Traded Notes






 
















Exchange-traded products (ETPs) are subject to market volatility and the risks of their underlying securities, which may include the risks associated with investing in smaller companies, foreign securities, commodities, and fixed income investments. Foreign securities are subject to interest rate, currency exchange rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets. ETPs that target a small universe of securities, such as a specific region or market sector, are generally subject to greater market volatility, as well as to the specific risks associated with that sector, region, or other focus. ETPs that use derivatives, leverage, or complex investment strategies are subject to additional risks. The return of an index ETP is usually different from that of the index it tracks because of fees, expenses, and tracking error. An ETP may trade at a premium or discount to its net asset value (NAV) (or indicative value in the case of exchange-traded notes). The degree of liquidity can vary significantly from one ETP to another and losses may be magnified if no liquid market exists for the ETP's shares when attempting to sell them. Each ETP has a unique risk profile, detailed in its prospectus, offering circular, or similar material, which should be considered carefully when making investment decisions.



ETFs are subject to market fluctuation and the risks of their underlying investments. ETFs are subject to management fees and other expenses. Unlike mutual funds, ETF shares are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than their NAV, and are not individually redeemed from the fund.

Exchange-Traded Funds










Exchange-Traded Funds









Exchange-Traded Funds



























For nearly a century, traditional mutual funds have offered many advantages over building a portfolio one security at a time. Mutual funds provide investors broad diversification, professional management, relative low cost, and daily liquidity.
Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) take the benefits of mutual fund investing to the next level. ETFs can offer lower operating costs than traditional open-end funds, flexible trading, greater transparency, and better tax efficiency in taxable accounts. There are drawbacks, however, including trading costs and learning complexities of the product. Most informed financial experts agree that the pluses of ETFs overshadow the minuses by a sizable margin.

            Positive Aspects of ETFs
        
ETFs have several advantages over traditional open-end funds. The four most prominent advantages are trading flexibility, low cost, operational transparency, and tax benefits.

            Trading Flexibility
        
Traditional open-end mutual fund shares are traded only once per day after the markets close. All trading is done with the mutual fund company that issues the shares. Investors must wait until the end of the day when the fund net asset value (NAV) is announced before knowing what price they paid for new shares when buying that day and the price they will receive for shares they sold that day. Once-per-day trading is fine for most long-term investors, but some people require greater flexibility.
ETFs are bought and sold during the day when the markets are open. The pricing of ETF shares is continuous during normal exchange hours. Share prices vary throughout the day, based mainly on the changing intraday value of the underlying assets in the fund. ETF investors know within moments how much they paid to buy shares and how much they received after selling.
The nearly instantaneous trading of ETF shares makes intraday management of a portfolio a snap. It is easy to move money between specific asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, or commodities. Investors can efficiently get their allocation into the investments they want in an hour and then change their allocation in the next hour. That is not something I recommend, but it can be done.
Making changes to traditional open-end mutual funds is more challenging and can take several days. First, there is typically a 2:00 pm Eastern standard time cutoff for placing open-end share trades. That means you do not know what the NAV price will be at the end of the day. It is impossible to know exactly how much you will receive when selling shares of one open-end fund or know how much you should buy of another open-end fund.
The trade order flexibility of ETFs also gives investors the benefit of making timely investment decisions and placing orders in a variety of ways. Investing in ETF shares has all the trade combinations of investing in common stocks, including limit orders and stop-limit orders. ETFs can also be purchased on margin by borrowing money from a broker. Every brokerage firm has tutorials on trade order types and requirements for borrowing on margin.
Short selling is also available to ETF investors. Shorting entails borrowing securities from your brokerage firm and simultaneously selling those securities on the market. The hope is that the price of the borrowed securities will drop and you can buy them back at a lower price at a later time.

            Portfolio Diversification and Risk Management
        
Investors may wish to quickly gain portfolio exposure to specific sectors, styles, industries, or countries but do not have expertise in those areas. Given the wide variety of sector, style, industry, and country categories available, ETF shares may be able to provide an investor easy exposure to a specific desired market segment.
ETFs are now traded on virtually every major asset class, commodity, and currency in the world. Moreover, innovative new ETF structures embody a particular investment or trading strategy. For example, through ETFs an investor can buy or sell stock market volatility or invest on a continuous basis in the highest yielding currencies in the world.
In certain situations, an investor may have significant risk in a particular sector but cannot diversify that risk because of restrictions or taxes. In that case, the person can short an industry-sector ETF or buy an ETF that shorts an industry for him or her.
For example, an investor may have a large number of restricted shares in the semiconductor industry. In that situation, the person may want to short shares of the Standard & Poor’s (S&P) SPDR Semiconductor (symbol: XSD). That would reduce one’s overall risk exposure to a downturn in that sector. XSD is an equal-weighted market cap index of semiconductor stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange, NASDAQ National Market, and NASDAQ Small Cap exchanges.

            Lower Costs
        
Operating expenses are incurred by all managed funds regardless of the structure. Those costs include, but are not limited to, portfolio management fees, custody costs, administrative expenses, marketing expenses, and distribution. Costs historically have been very important in forecasting returns. In general, the lower the cost of investing in a fund, the higher the expected return for that fund.
ETF operation costs can be streamlined compared to open-end mutual funds. Lower costs are a result of client service–related expenses being passed on to the brokerage firms that hold the exchange-traded securities in customer accounts. Fund administrative costs can go down for ETFs when a firm does not have to staff a call center to answer questions from thousands of individual investors.
ETFs also have lower expenses in the area of monthly statements, notifications, and transfers. Traditional open-end fund companies are required to send statements and reports to shareholders on a regular basis. Not so with ETFs. Fund sponsors are responsible for providing that information only to authorized participants who are the direct owners of creation units. Individual investors buy and sell individual shares of like stocks through brokerage firms, and the brokerage firm becomes responsible for servicing those investors, not the ETF companies.
Brokerage companies issue monthly statements, annual tax reports, quarterly reports, and 1099s. The reduced administrative burden of service and record keeping for thousands of individual clients means ETF companies have a lower overhead, and at least part of that savings is passed on to individual investors in the form of lower fund expenses.
Another cost savings for ETF shares is the absence of mutual fund redemption fees. Shareholders in ETFs avoid the short-term redemption fees that are charged on some open-end funds. For example, the Vanguard REIT Index Fund Investor Shares (symbol: VGSIX) has a redemption fee of 1 percent if held for less than one year. The Vanguard REIT ETF (symbol: VNQ) is the exact same portfolio and has no redemption fee.

            Tax Benefits
        
ETFs have two major tax advantages compared to mutual funds. Due to structural differences, mutual funds typically incur more capital gains taxes than ETFs. Moreover, capital gains tax on an ETF is incurred only upon the sale of the ETF by the investor, whereas mutual funds pass on capital gains taxes to investors through the life of the investment. In short, ETFs have lower capital gains and they are payable only upon sales of the ETF.
The tax situation regarding dividends is less advantageous for ETFs. There are two kinds of dividends issued by ETFs, qualified and unqualified. In order for a dividend to be classified as qualified, the ETF needs to be held by an investor for at least 60 days prior to the dividend payout date. The tax rate for qualified dividends varies from 5%-15% depending on the investors income tax rate. Unqualified dividends are taxed at the investor’s income tax rate.
Exchange Traded Notes, which are thought of as a subset of exchange traded funds, are structured to avoid dividend taxation. Dividends are not issued by ETNs; however the value of dividends is reflected in the price of the ETN.
Investors may wish to quickly gain portfolio exposure to specific sectors, styles, industries, or countries but do not have expertise in those areas. Given the wide variety of sector, style, industry, and country categories available, ETF shares may be able to provide an investor easy exposure to a specific desired market segment.
ETFs are now traded on virtually every major asset class, commodity, and currency in the world. Moreover, innovative new ETF structures embody a particular investment or trading strategy. For example, through ETFs an investor can buy or sell stock market volatility or invest on a continuous basis in the highest yielding currencies in the world.
