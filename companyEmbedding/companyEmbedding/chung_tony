Married But Available 我瞒结婚了 Synopsis
Due to a life-or-death situation, lovebirds AU YEUNG TSZ-CHUNG (Tony Hung) and CHU MING-MING (Priscilla Wong) hastily get married while travelling overseas. By coincidence, they get to work in the same company after returning to Hong Kong. MING-MING’s supervisor SZE LO-KA (Alice Chan) hates marriage after her divorce from her ex-husband CHEUNG KIN-KWOK (Hugo Ng). She devotes all of her time to work, and hires MING-MING as her personal assistant by offering her a very high salary. To improve the quality of her life, MING-MING has to conceal her marital status, leaving TSZ-CHUNG no other choice but to cooperate with her while keeping his guard up. On the one hand, TSZ-CHUNG stays loyal to his supervisor/best friend, CHEUNG CHIN-POK (Raymond Wong), and is constantly against LO-KA. On the other hand, he has to remain silent even after seeing CHIN-POK pursue MING-MING. Later on, TSZ-CHUNG re-encounters his childhood best friend, KEI MAN-YEE (Kelly Fu). Just as he feels so vulnerable, MAN-YEE shows him unconditional love, therefore he cannot help falling in love with her. Everything seems like a dream until he suddenly comes to realise that MAN-YEE is actually CHIN-POK’s younger sister, which eventually escalates the tensions between the complicated relationships……
欧阳梓聪（洪永城）和朱明明（黄翠如）这对小情人因一场生关死劫，趁在外地旅行时匆匆注册结婚，但二人回港后因缘际会在同一家公司任职，明明的上司施露嘉（陈炜）和前夫张建国（吴岱融）经历情伤痛恨婚姻，令她将所有时间转移投放在工作，高薪聘明明为私人助理，
明明为理想改善生活只好选择隐婚，梓聪无奈配合之余更要步步为营，一方面为上司兼好朋友张展博（黄浩然）效忠工作，与露嘉对立，另一方面眼见展博力追明明也甘原哑忍，所以当梓聪重遇儿时好友纪文意（傅嘉莉），脆弱的心灵终敌挡不住文意无私的爱，令二人坠入如梦一般的恋爱故事中，及后才惊觉文意是展博得妹妹，令几段错综复杂的感情角力越演越烈……
