NEW YORK, May 20, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- QIC, a global diversified alternatives investment firm offering infrastructure, real estate, private equity, liquid strategies and multi-asset investments, and one of Australia's largest institutional investment managers, today announced that it had formed a US$764 million (A$1 billion) Asia-Pacific infrastructure partnership with the California Public Employees' Retirement System ("CalPERS"), one of the largest public pension funds in the United States. 
The partnership represents CalPERS' first Asia-Pacific infrastructure commitment and adds another of the world's largest pension funds to QIC's infrastructure client base. Under the terms of the arrangement, QIC will source, create and manage a portfolio of Asia-Pacific infrastructure assets for the partnership.  
Ross Israel, Head of QIC's Global Infrastructure said: "We are very pleased to have entered into this partnership with a pension fund of CalPERS' stature and for an investment mandate of this scale. CalPERS has been at the forefront of investment on many dimensions. This commitment to QIC and the Asia-Pacific infrastructure region is a validation of our infrastructure capabilities and the opportunity set to deploy capital across the core infrastructure sectors of transport, energy/utilities and PPPs.
"This milestone is the culmination of a dialogue over a number of years between QIC and CalPERS to explore a partnership approach to investing in infrastructure.
"This partnership, in combination with the launch earlier this year of the QIC Global Infrastructure Fund ("QGIF") and other separately managed account clients, increases the size, scope and level of control QIC can bring to future infrastructure opportunities for the benefit of all our clients." 
"This is a great opportunity to expand our infrastructure portfolio and to enter the Asia-Pacific market," said Paul Mouchakkaa, CalPERS Senior Investment Officer for Real Assets, which includes the Infrastructure program. "QIC has a proven track record of success and is an excellent fit for our program. We look forward to working with them."

GLOBAL SECTOR FOCUS

ACTIVE-CORE STRATEGY

GLOBAL PORTFOLIO 


View All




Global Infrastructure
We specialise by sector and seek out the right deals - with one objective, to deliver predictable outcomes.




A significant global player - A$9.7bn1 AUM including 10 direct investments2. 


Track record delivered through cycles - 10 year track-record of consistent returns1.


Stable, experienced infrastructure team - 32 experienced infrastructure professionals1 located in Brisbane, Sydney, New York and London.  Our stable team is led by founding partners.


Proven 'Active-Core 'strategy - We identify relative value across core assets.  Our deep sector focus drives value.


Active asset management - Value driven from active management, stakeholder engagement and selecting appropriate internal management teams.  We create value through leadership positions of control or strong influence.


Focused origination drives quality pipeline - Our targeted approach aims to deliver more than 100 opportunities each year. We pursue opportunities where there is the ability to differentiate.



1As at 30 June 2017. 2 The number of direct investments reflects the number of acquisitions sourced and currently managed by QIC. In July 2012 QIC assumed management rights for a small direct stake in a UK telecommunications company, but was not involved in the original acquisition for the client. This investment is not included in the calculation of 12 direct investments.  
 


what we believe
We believe client outcomes drive everything. Our clients demand predictability and capital preservation is key.
We know predictability demands discipline. We believe in the right deal, not the hot deal, invest with a long term mindset and are not driven by short term temptations. This is how we produce outcomes.

 
Approach
We are active at every stage of the investment process. We buy businesses – not assets. By deeply understanding sectors on a global basis we take a more informed view of risk, return and pricing for every asset that we acquire, manage and prepare to sell. 
We focus on infrastructure projects in OECD countries exhibiting predictable cash flows, sustainable competitive advantages and operating in well-defined regulatory environments. 
In a highly contested market, paying fair value for assets is essential for delivering optimal client outcomes. We are selective in our deal origination and leverage our global networks of co-investors (including sovereign wealth funds and pension plans), intermediaries and strategic partners.
We believe environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) factors are likely to have an increasingly material impact on the long-term returns of investment portfolios. We are committed to delivering strong, long-term investment performance to our clients and considering ESG factors is part of our investment decision-making process.
 
Solutions
Clients can access our direct infrastructure capability through segregated mandates as well as a pooled product.


QIC Global Infrastructure Fund


This fund targets attractive risk-adjusted returns primarily through equity and equity-related investments in infrastructure assets and related companies, located in developed OECD counties, predominantly in Australia.

NEW YORK and LONDON, Aug. 3, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- QIC, a global diversified alternatives investment firm offering infrastructure, real estate, private equity, liquid strategies and multi-asset investments, and one of Australia's largest institutional investment managers, today announced the first close of the QIC Global Infrastructure Fund ("QGIF" or "the Fund") at 50 per cent of target after raising more than A$1 billion (US$800 million)1 of new capital for its Global Infrastructure platform.QGIF has secured commitments from a range of institutional investors including Hostplus, one of Australia's largest pension funds, an Asian sovereign wealth fund, one of China's leading insurers and two foundation QIC clients. An additional commitment has also been made under a co-investment arrangement.Ross Israel, Head of QIC Global Infrastructure said, "I'm delighted by the level of support and fund commitments that QGIF has been able to secure in this first close as a result of our focused marketing efforts and a strong potential investment pipeline." QGIF is an unlisted investment vehicle that seeks to provide institutional investors with access to attractive, risk-adjusted returns through long-term exposure to a diversified portfolio of global infrastructure assets. The Fund will offer investors access to a large investable universe of attractive infrastructure assets in developed OECD economies with a focus towards Australia.  The Fund is targeting A$1.75 billion (US$1.34 billion) of total capital commitments.   QGIF was formally launched earlier this year, driven by investor demand to access QIC's infrastructure team and its strategy.  QGIF will be managed by the same team executing the same investment strategy that has delivered a strong track record over the last nine years across three core sectors – transport, energy utilities and Public Private Partnerships.QGIF's first close triggers the commencement of the Fund's investment period and the ability for the Fund to deploy capital.

 All the World’s a Cloud
        All of Cloud Is at Cloud Expo!

 Cloud Computing - Big Data | Analytics - Internet of Things 
          Containers - Microservices - WebRTC - DevOps 


Join Us at the Javits Center in New York, NY, June 6-8 

          Cloud computing software is eating the world, and each day is bringing new developments in this world. 

          Yesterday's debate about public vs. private has transformed into the reality of hybrid cloud: a recent survey shows that 74% of enterprises have a hybrid cloud strategy. 

          Meanwhile, 94% of enterprises are using some form of XaaS – software, platform, and Infrastructure as a Service.

          Big Data | Analytics and the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) are driving exponentially increased demands on datacenters and developers alike, as we cross the zettabyte horizon this year.

          Containers and microservices are now part of every PaaS conversation, and IaaS providers are increasingly competing for platform customers. 

          WebRTC continues to reform web communications, and DevOps is pushing its way into an enterprise IT world that is increasingly agile, lean, and continuous.

          Through all this, Cloud Expo remains the single independent event where delegates and technology vendors can meet to experience and discuss the entire world of the cloud.

        Only Cloud Expo brings together all this in a single location: 
        
          •	Cloud Computing
            •	Big Data | Analytics
            •	Internet of Things
            •	Containers | Microservices
            •	WebRTC
            •	DevOps


        Cloud computing budgets worldwide are reaching into the hundreds of billions of dollars, and no organization can survive long without some sort of cloud migration strategy. Each month brings new announcements, use cases, and success stories. 

          Cloud Expo offers the world's most comprehensive selection of technical and strategic Industry Keynotes, General Sessions, Breakout Sessions, and signature Power Panels. The exhibition floor features 100+ exhibitors offering specific solutions and comprehensive strategies. 

          The floor also features a Demo Theater that give delegates the opportunity to get even closer to the technology they want to see and the people who offer it. 

          Attend Cloud Expo. Create your own custom experience. Learn the latest from the world's best technologists. Talk to the vendors you are considering, and put them to the test.

          See you in New York!

Global Real Estate
We have a reputation for delivering predictable, long-term investment outcomes.
Real estate is traditionally part of institutional investors’ portfolios because of the underlying assets’ ability to deliver long-term value enhancement, consistent yields and protection against inflation. At QIC we seek out quality assets, not quantity of deal flow, actively managing every aspect of the investment lifecycle. We have developed a reputation for delivering predictable outcomes for clients over the long term.

Heritage as a real estate specialist - A$16.8 bn1 across pooled and segregated mandates.  
Long-term focus - 36 direct real estate assets across Australian and international retail and office assets2.  We have a long-term track record of development and redevelopment with a re-investment philosophy.
Significant and experienced team - Circa 240 experienced real estate professionals2.  We have highly experienced teams in both Australia and the United States.
Client focused - We are consistently ranked as a top performing team, through delivering predictable outcomes over the longer term3. 
Active management approach - We are known for our disciplined process to deliver consistent returns through quality assets and active management.  We provide deal origination, execution, asset management, leasing and development. 
Focus on development pipeline - 10 out of 13 of our Australia retail assets either developed ground-up or significantly expanded since acquisition.  We have a forward-looking development pipeline to enhance or expand a number of Australian retail assets over the next 5 years.

What we believe
QIC’s real estate team believes in active management and value-add over the long term by managing every aspect of the investment lifecycle. Our focus is on investment return. Although we have an acquisition mandate, we maintain a disciplined approach to identify the best opportunities. An holistic view of the life cycle of our assets allows us to identify opportunities that add maximum value. We are committed to transparency, open communication and strong governance in an asset class where it really counts.
Our development program has consistently added value and set the standard for the market. We continue to deliver solid results through our leadership team’s experience and our diversified and resilient property portfolio. 
 
approach
We are known for our discipline, consistent returns and focus. Our team of real estate professionals has developed a long-term strategic investment style that has been delivered over the years with conviction and discipline.

Our direct and hands-on approach enables us to maintain strategic control over our assets, while a strong development pipeline ensures we continue to provide strong returns to our clients.
Our strategic focus remains on dominant regional shopping centres located in town centres in growth corridors. The acquisition and/or development of CBD office buildings is a tactical focus.
 
All strategic services performed in-house
 At the heart of our philosophy to add long-term value is maintaining control of our properties by performing key functions in-house including asset management, leasing, finance and development. Non-strategic functions such as design, project management and construction are tendered out. This provides strong risk management as well as invaluable intelligence into market conditions.
