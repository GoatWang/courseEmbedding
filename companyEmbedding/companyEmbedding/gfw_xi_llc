Back then, I could access Facebook and Google without any problems. What happened that year's July? The Xinjiang riots. Right after that, we could not access Facebook, and then it became difficult to access google as well. Ever since, those websites have been blocked. Meanwhile, if we talked about the protests with the Chinese, they would say that we were influenced by the foreign media and that what we were taught was not true, but somehow what the government, the entity that had just blocked their access to information, was completely right. So why do you think the government placed the great fire wall?

Zhou Yang, Chinese, Student of USTCAnswered 120w agoNowadays, GFW is not only means political interest but also commercial interest. For example, Baidu, the biggest search engine of China, offers much more worse experience than Google, most software developed by Baidu is very hard to uninstall while you don't even know how it comes into your computer. But we have no choice. Most of the Chinese internet company live under the protection of GFW, for themselves, they don't need to compete with their foreign competitor, so they can just copy other's idea. In a world, GFW is now something like trade barrier, not only Chinese government, but also Chinese companies support it.210 Views · 3 UpvotesPromoted by AdStageAdStage paid media suite.We bring together smart design and intelligent technology to help marketers make sense of their ad data.Free Trial at adstage.io  Jacob Gadikian, Left China until government regains its sanity regarding the InternetAnswered 140w agoThey've done some bad things, and would rather not have to face the people's understandable anger upon learning of the awful things their leaders have done.*CCP leaders have also done great things!  Just...

Plz fix this or put it on line so I can use it because I use the add-on and it tells me it’s off line

Can you provide more details about the problem you’re having? I’m not seeing any “off line” issues.


Paul Says:
						
April 5th, 2013 at 6:54 pm 
Wow matrix tells me when I try to install Sorry the following Add-On could not get installed at this time (The add-on name)
The Official website for the above Add-on appears to be currently down
Should the problem persist for over 24 Hr. then something else could be causing this issue. In that case please feel fee to contact us
and this is all that is said to me I try to install is by going to wow>interface> to add-on and when I login and look at my add-on where my ton’s are listed and I see the addon is offline.
this is what happens

Seems that the an error still persists, under specific circumstances; namely – when you are at reputation with one of the Tiller NPC and you’re holding one of the reputation turn-in items (the Dark Soil ones) mouse-overing their rep will produce an error.
I have sent an email with the details.

It’s an Update planned for all your Addons?


Feldur Says:
						
July 27th, 2013 at 11:18 am 
Are there going to be updates for 5.3? If not, do you have any insight into whether just updating the TOC from 5.2 to 5.3 will be sufficient? (I’m wondering about all your addons, but just posting the once here.)

have used this for ages, and trying to get husband to install it, no download link. looked all over the site, clicked everything. what happened?


Thae Says:
						
July 27th, 2014 at 5:08 pm 
Just reporting a problem, or an apparent one.  I re-DL’d FactionFriend after a hd crash forced me to reinstall everything. /sigh.  Got it where it should go as far as it being listed with the other addons.  However, it’s not being listed on the in-game list of adds and, of course, it’s not showing up in-game.  I’m  not a coder/debugger.  If you need more info beyond this, you’ve my email.
I am currently running:  Win 7 Home Premium, with IE XI as my browser.  Am running WoW thru the new hub Blizz came out with.  Hope this helps.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year
