Moves & Appointments











Trishield Capital Management, an investment manager focused on investments in distressed and special situations, has appointed Robert L Harteveldt as chief executive officer.
 
Harteveldt joins Trishield from the global investment bank Jefferies LLC, where he was co-head of global fixed income, head of fixed income origination and was a member of the firm’s executive committee. Harteveldt joined Jefferies in July 2008. Prior to his recent roles at Jefferies, he ran the company’s leveraged finance sales, trading and capital markets businesses.
 
At Trishield, Harteveldt will be part of the investment team, managing the firm and driving its growth objectives. Harteveldt has over 25 years of experience in the distressed and high yield arena, during which time he covered some of the biggest distressed and credit hedge funds and investment managers and helped manage investments in distressed and special situations.
 
“I have known and worked with Rob for over 10 years. As I gave thought to expanding the firm, I just couldn’t imagine anyone better suited for this role than he,” says Jeff Buick, trishield’s president, founder and chief investment officer. “Rob’s extensive relationships and investment acumen will be a solid addition to the Trishield team. Given that May 1, 2013 will be Trishield’s fifth anniversary, the time is right to focus on expanding the firm.”
 
Prior to joining Jefferies in 2008, Harteveldt spent approximately 24 years at Bear Stearns, rising to the role of co-head of the high yield and distressed department, serving as head of leveraged finance sales with oversight for high yield bonds, leveraged loans and distressed sales. He was also a member of the President’s Advisory Council and the Fixed Income Management Committee. He spent the first six years of his career at Bear Stearns in the company’s M&A and corporate finance departments.
 
“I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Jefferies. It was very rewarding and exciting to be part of such a dynamic firm and to help Jefferies expand its platform and market share. It was an extraordinary place at which to work, with an entrepreneurial culture and great partners,” Harteveldt says. “I’m thrilled to be joining Jeff and the Trishield team. I have known Jeff for many years and recognise him as an extraordinarily astute and talented investor who has performed well through a variety of investment cycles. My significant experience in leveraged finance, distressed and special situations should make a positive contribution to Trishield’s continuing success. I am looking forward to the opportunities ahead as the firm looks to take the next step in its growth.”
