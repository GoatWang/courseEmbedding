University of Virginia

                  The University of Virginia (often abbreviated as UVA, UVa, or Virginia) is a public research university in Charlottesville, Virginia, United States. It was conceived and designed by U.S. President Thomas Jefferson, and established in 1819. UVA's initial Board of Visitors included former Presidents of the United States Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and James Monroe. Monroe owned the initial site of the University, which was mostly farmland. His law office and farmhouse are now the site of Brown College at Monroe Hill, a residential college at UVA.

UVA is one of the eight original Public Ivy universities, and it is the only university campus in the United States that is designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. In the 2013 edition of U.S. News and World Report's National University Rankings, the school was listed as America's 2nd best public university; tied with UCLA and surpassed only by UC Berkeley.

Portfolio Manager

                                    Current                


Folger Hill Asset Management LP


                  Folger Hill Asset Management''s investment objective is to consistently generate attractive, risk-adjusted returns in all market environments while preserving investor capital. Folger Hill seek to achieve this objective by allocating substantially all of the assets of the Master Fund to the discretionary investment authority of a number of their portfolio managers and investment teams that employ a wide range of long/short equity and related investing strategies. These strategies are not limited with regard to sector, market capitalization, geography or style. The Folder Hill Master Fund invests on both a cash and synthetic basis and takes short positions for both speculative and hedging purposes. Folger Hill may cause the Master Fund to incur significant leverage in executing the funds’ investment program through both cash and synthetic borrowings, as well as a result of any leverage embedded in any derivative that it trades. In addition to equities and equity indices, the Master Fund may invest in preferred stocks, warrants, fixed income instruments, options, futures and other derivatives and financial instruments to supplement its investment strategies.

Freedom Capital Management LLC


                  FCM is a GARP U.S. large-cap manager. Their research effort begins by using the Russell 1000 Growth, S&P 500 and S&P/Barra Growth indexes as their stock universe. The ultimate benchmark is the S&P 500.For growth stocks, they focus on stocks with industry leadership, pricing power, expanding margins, strong balance sheets and sound management. Value stocks are selected based on low p/e and price-to-book ratios, attractive cash flows and above-average ROE.Overall, the firm will sell a stock when the target price has been reached or fundamentals deteriorate.

Founders Asset Management LLC


                  Founders Asset Management looks for companies that have potential for strong earnings growth that can be sustained through market cycles and changing economic conditions, and can combine these qualitative strengths with the business savvy needed to produce the kinds of compelling quantitative strengths that look sound on a firm's balance sheet. They do not limit themselves to certain markets or sectors. The firm conducts bottom-up research with the application of an in-depth process that entails a company-by-company analysis of business models and fundamentals. They prefer to focus exclusively on uncovering growth-oriented stocks, regardless of their sectors or geographical location. Founders Asset Management's stock selection process is organic; they monitor current holdings on a daily basis. They use price targets to assess companies' contributions to portfolio performance, making adjustments if necessary. Though not limited by sector, Founders Asset management tends to invest in the stocks of US large-cap companies in the retail, technology services, electronic technology and health services sectors.

Westfield Capital Management Company LP


                  Westfield Capital Management (WCM) is a growth manager that seeks to invest in the reasonably priced stocks of companies with high earnings potential. The firm uses fundamental, bottom-up research to identify growth companies across all market-caps. They seek to identify companies capable of providing consistently high or accelerating earnings growth.

The firm also supervises investments in foreign equities that are traded on US stock exchanges and in US dollars, American Depositary Receipts (ADRs), American Depositary Shares (ADS), and Global Depositary Receipts (GDRs).WMC's investment strategies include: Large Cap Growth, Small/Mid Cap Growth, Mid Cap Growth, All Cap Growth, Dividend Growth, Sustainable Growth, Micro Cap, and Select Growth Equity. The following strategies are closed to new investors: Small Cap Growth, Fixed Income, and Life Sciences.With the exception of their Mid Cap Strategy, WMC does not generally invest in derivatives, options, or privately held securities, and does not permit short selling. The Micro-Cap Strategy permits the usage of leveraging techniques, short selling, frequent trading, investments in private securities, and investments in derivatives or options. As such, the Micro-Cap Strategy will enter into a short position in a broad market index ETF. Under normal market conditions, the firm's long-only equity products don't use a frequent trading strategy; however, in certain market conditions, trading activity within products may increase.
