Price & Performance:

Average annual total return is the annual compound return for the indicated period. It reflects the change in share price and the reinvestment of all dividends and capital gains. NAV returns do not include the effect of any applicable sales charges. POP and w/CDSC returns include the effect of maximum applicable sales charges.

Returns for periods of less than one year are cumulative total returns.

Net Asset Value (NAV) Per Share: The market worth of one share of a mutual fund. This figure is calculated by subtracting a fund's liabilities from total assets (securities, cash and any accrued earnings) and dividing by the number of shares outstanding.
Public Offering Price (POP): The price at which a fund's shares can be purchased. The offering price includes the current net asset value (NAV) per share plus any sales charges.
On each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading, the net asset value (NAV) is determined as of the close of trading (normally 4:00 pm Eastern Time). The NAV and POP for all funds are subject to change.

If you are participating in an employer sponsored retirement plan, such as a 401(k) plan, profit-sharing plan, defined benefit plan or other employer-directed plan, your company will provide you with the information you need to open an account and buy Class R6 Shares.
Morningstar Disclosures:The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.
