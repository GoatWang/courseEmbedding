Overview
Brookfield Asset Management is a leading global alternative asset manager and one of the largest investors in real assets. Our investment focus is on real estate, renewable power, infrastructure and private equity assets. Our objective is to generate attractive long-term risk-adjusted returns for the benefit of our clients and shareholders.
We manage a range of public and private investment products and services for institutional and retail clients. We earn asset management income for doing so and align our interests with our clients by investing alongside them. We have an exceptionally strong balance sheet, with over $30 billion of capital invested, primarily in our four listed partnerships: Brookfield Property Partners, Brookfield Infrastructure Partners, Brookfield Renewable Partners and Brookfield Business Partners. This access to large-scale capital enables us to make investments in sizeable, premier assets across geographies and asset classes that few managers are able to do.
We create value for BAM shareholders in the following ways:

as an asset manager – by investing both our own capital and that of our investors – this enables us to increase the scale of our operations, and enhances our financial returns through base management fees and performance-based income;
as an investor and capital allocator – we strive to invest at attractive valuations, particularly in value-oriented situations that create opportunities for superior valuation gains and cash flow returns, or by monetizing assets at appropriate times to realize value; and
as an owner-operator – we constantly work to increase the value of the assets within our operating businesses and the cash flows they produce through our operating expertise, development capabilities and effective financing.

            Careers
        







Working at Brookfield
We put as much time and care into our hiring decisions as we do into our investment decisions, and we take a long term approach to both. 
Working at Brookfield means becoming part of a global alternative asset manager that has owned and operated real-asset based businesses for more than 100 years. It means joining a global team committed to generating superior long-term investment returns and being part of a collaborative, results-oriented culture.  
Even as we continue to grow, we maintain our entrepreneurial approach. The size, scale and breadth of our business—spanning multiple continents, sectors and markets—translate into unique and varied career opportunities for our employees. Our people work on some of the largest real estate, infrastructure and renewable power transactions in the world. Both our business model and culture make it possible to build a career that is dynamic, multidisciplinary and international in scope. We have a “grow our own” talent strategy where our emphasis on developing executives is supported by our flat organizational structure and long-term focus. Personal development comes in the form of “on the job learning” and “stretch” roles to expand employees' comfort zones supported by exposure to new activities, new geographies and new teams.

"We have the unique opportunity here to take our own ideas and see them grow into a transaction, no matter what our level. It is rare to contribute in such a meaningful way, with no regard to level or title."









    “Part of the reason people are so happy here, and are able to craft successful long-term careers, is because the business growth creates extraordinary opportunities. This is the type of institution where instead of having to leave to find that next role, an  opportunity surfaces in another part of the company.”






Our Culture
Our culture is built on mutual respect, teamwork and passion, and we are proud to say that these values are ingrained in our organization. Senior leaders work side-by-side with colleagues of all levels; initiative and hard work, rather than job title, determine one’s degree of responsibility; and the intensity of collaboration among employees globally creates and maintains an entrepreneurial feeling, despite our actual size.




"Even though we are big, we act like a small firm. Senior management rolls up their sleeves with us to get the work done."

"Responsibility is given based on capabilities and contributions, not title."








"This is a hardworking, results-oriented culture. Entrepreneurial people thrive here."



How We Hire

We have a long term focus; when we hire, we look for people who can build a career at Brookfield. We are committed to a developing our employees and we invest in them by creating opportunities across our various businesses and regions. This approach enables us to build teams and cultivate leaders whose values match those of the firm and whose commitment to Brookfield is long-term.  When hiring, we place great value on referrals from Brookfield employees. If you have contacts within Brookfield, we encourage you to reach out to them to learn more about working here. 









“We look for people who are passionate and have an entrepreneurial spirit. Patience, respect, collaboration and a commitment to shared success are key attributes of success at Brookfield.”

“We look for people who are really ready to be stretched and tested in ways they wouldn’t experience on a traditional career path.”



“We invest a lot of time in our hiring process in order to find the right fit. We hire not just for the role on the table, but for future potential.”

            About Us
        







We are a leading global alternative asset manager, focused on investing in long-life, high quality assets across real estate, infrastructure, renewable power and private equity. Our investments include one of the largest portfolios of office properties in the world, an industry-leading infrastructure business spanning utilities, transport, energy, communications infrastructure and sustainable resources, and one of the largest pure-play renewable power businesses that include more than 200 hydroelectric facilities as well as several high quality business services and industrial companies. These businesses form the backbone of the global economy, supporting the endeavors of individuals, corporations and governments worldwide.  

As a global firm, we support the employment of over 70,000 people in more than 30 countries while working to create strong, profitable businesses. As these businesses grow, we commit to best-in-class corporate social responsibility practices, mindful of the important role they play in fostering long-term value creation.
Our Heritage
Our approach to investing stems from our heritage as an owner and operator of real assets. Long before we were an asset manager, we invested our own capital to develop, own and operate these assets, which means we bring deep expertise to growing the businesses we acquire. In the early 2000s, with 100 years of investing experience behind us, we began inviting other private investors to partner with us. 
This marked the start of our asset management business. Today, the scale of our global operations means we have significant access to proprietary deal flow, while the size and liquidity of our balance sheet allows us to pursue transactions few others are able to consider. To ensure our interests are aligned with our investors, we put our capital to work alongside theirs in every deal we do. 
Our History 
We got our start over a century ago, helping to launch Brazil’s first electrical and transport utility in 1899 and listing it on the Toronto Stock Exchange in 1912. Since then, we have been directing capital toward real estate, renewable power and infrastructure assets that provide the foundation for economic pursuits around the globe.












                                Beginnings in Brazil
                            

Canadian financiers William Mackenzie and Frederick Stark Pearson establish the São Paulo Railway, Light and Power Co. after introducing the first electric streetcars to São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. They used capital raised on the Toronto Stock Exchange to launch the venture, which builds and operates electricity and transport infrastructure.









                                First Public Listing
                            

Mackenzie and Pearson’s company, known as “The Light” in Brazil, is incorporated and listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange as Brazilian Traction, Light and Power Co. Ltd. By the 1940s, it employs more than 50,000 people and supplies two-thirds of the country’s electric power.









                                Peter Bronfman
                            

Peter Bronfman, with proceeds from the sale of Seagram shares, begins investing in real assets. These early investments help set the stage for Brookfield’s emergence as an international investor and asset manager. 









                                The Formation of the Partnership
                            

Peter Bronfman forms a partnership with his senior business colleagues, which eventually evolves into Partners Limited. The partnership continues today and still owns approximately 20% of Brookfield Asset Management.









                                Re-entry into Renewables
                            

Brascan re-enters the hydroelectric business, purchasing Great Lakes Power in Ontario, post its sale of the original hydroelectric investments in Brazil. 









                                Brascan
                            

Peter Bronfman and Jack Cockwell lead the partnership to acquire control of Brascan, diversifying the business and expanding the capital base. Brascan’s name will later become Brookfield Asset Management to reflect its evolution into a global operator and investor.









                                Real Estate Acquisitions in New York and Boston
                            

Brookfield acquires a group of marquee commercial properties from the distressed real estate developer Olympia & York. The 15 million square foot portfolio includes the World Financial Center, One Liberty Plaza, and 245 Park Avenue in New York City, launching Brookfield’s major U.S. expansion phase.









                                Growing Renewables Platform
                            

Brookfield embarks upon several hydroelectric acquisitions and developments in North and South America that significantly enlarge its renewables portfolio over the next decade.









                                Asset Management Business
                            

Under Bruce Flatt and the next generation of leadership in the Partnership, Brookfield launches the first third-party fund, Brookfield Capital Partners I, allowing other private institutional investors to benefit from its experience owning and operating real assets. 









                                Foothold in Europe
                            

Brookfield establishes a presence in the European commercial property market by acquiring an interest in London’s Canary Wharf development.









                                Going Global
                            

Brookfield acquires Australian property manager and construction company Multiplex, expanding its operations in Australia, the Middle East and Europe.









                                Brookfield Infrastructure Partners Launch
                            

Brookfield Infrastructure Partners is launched as a public company. 









                                Infrastructure Acquisition
                            

Brookfield acquires an $8.4 billion portfolio of ports, utilities and railroads with the purchase of a 40% interest in Australia’s Babcock & Brown Infrastructure group. Brookfield Infrastructure Partners subsequently merged with the group to become a global operator of utilities, transport, energy and communications infrastructure assets. 









                                General Growth Properties Restructuring
                            

Brookfield leads the restructuring of General Growth Properties, the second largest U.S. mall owner, and closes Brookfield Infrastructure Fund I.









                                Brookfield Renewable Partners Launch
                            

Brookfield Renewable Partners is re-launched as a listed partnership with all of Brookfield's renewable assets. It boasts one of the world’s largest pure-play renewable power platforms.









                                Brookfield Property Partners Launch
                            

Brookfield Property Partners is launched as a publicly traded global commercial property company.









                                Expansion as an Asset Manager
                            

Brookfield closes Brookfield Infrastructure Fund II and Brookfield Strategic Real Estate Partners Fund I.









                                Canary Wharf Acquisition
                            

Brookfield and Partners take full control of the Canary Wharf Group in London.









                                Brookfield Business Partners Launch
                            

                                Brookfield Business Partners is launched as the fourth flagship public company, providing investors the ability to invest directly in the businesses within Brookfield’s private equity group.









                                $27B Raised Across Funds
                            

                                Brookfield raises $27B across a number of strategies, including the final close of Brookfield Infrastructure Fund III at $14B, Brookfield Strategic Real Estate Partners II at $9B, and Brookfield Capital Partners IV at $4B.












How We Invest
First and foremost, we are value investors with a contrarian point of view. We have learned that some of the best opportunities are found in out-of-favor sectors or regions where capital is scarce.
Our investment strategy is simple: utilize our global team of investment professionals, our vast network of employees across our operating businesses, and our industry partners to identify and acquire high quality assets at favorable valuations and finance them on a long-term, low-risk basis. 
We then create value by increasing cash flows and asset values, and realizing the investment at the right time. Because the businesses we invest in form the backbone of the global economy, we are able to make operational improvements, generate steady cash flows and generally provide insulation from the extremes of market cycles. Nevertheless, we always seek downside protection, and we’re proud of our ability to generate strong risk-adjusted returns across all market conditions.

Overview
Brookfield Asset Management is a leading global alternative asset manager and one of the largest investors in real assets. Our investment focus is on real estate, renewable power, infrastructure and private equity assets. Our objective is to generate attractive long-term risk-adjusted returns for the benefit of our clients and shareholders.
We manage a range of public and private investment products and services for institutional and retail clients. We earn asset management income for doing so and align our interests with our clients by investing alongside them. We have an exceptionally strong balance sheet, with over $30 billion of capital invested, primarily in our four listed partnerships: Brookfield Property Partners, Brookfield Infrastructure Partners, Brookfield Renewable Partners and Brookfield Business Partners. This access to large-scale capital enables us to make investments in sizeable, premier assets across geographies and asset classes that few managers are able to do.
We create value for BAM shareholders in the following ways:

as an asset manager – by investing both our own capital and that of our investors – this enables us to increase the scale of our operations, and enhances our financial returns through base management fees and performance-based income;
as an investor and capital allocator – we strive to invest at attractive valuations, particularly in value-oriented situations that create opportunities for superior valuation gains and cash flow returns, or by monetizing assets at appropriate times to realize value; and
as an owner-operator – we constantly work to increase the value of the assets within our operating businesses and the cash flows they produce through our operating expertise, development capabilities and effective financing.

Assets[edit]
The company's asset management offerings for institutional investors are focused on real assets, but also include alternative-type investments, structured financial products, traditional fixed income and equities and finite-risk reinsurance.[9] In addition, Brookfield Asset Management owns a significant stake in a real estate services company offering home relocations, property appraisals, move-in services and home transaction closing services, and capital market services, including financial advisory, securities underwriting, and property brokerage.[10] Brookfield Asset Management invests through public, listed companies and through private funds. The company's institutional clients mainly include governments, sovereign wealth funds, pension plans, institutions, corporations and high-net-worth individuals.[11][12]
Brookfield has $23 billion of assets under management in Canada, $138 billion invested in the United States, $19 billion invested in Asia Pacific, $20 billion in South America and $32 billion in the UK, Western Europe and the Middle East.[7] Its major real estate investments include Brookfield Place (formerly known as the World Financial Center) in New York, Brookfield Place in Toronto, Canary Wharf in London (owned with Qatar's Sovereign Wealth Fund), Potsdamer Platz in Berlin, the Bank of America Plaza in Los Angeles, Bankers Hall in Calgary,[13] Darling Park in Sydney, and Brookfield Place in Perth.[14][15]
Brookfield's infrastructure assets include utilities: electric and gas distribution; transport: railway and coal terminals and ports; energy transmission and communications infrastructure. [16]
Brookfield's renewable power assets include hydroelectric power plants and wind power assets.[17]
Brookfield’s private equity business focuses on real assets through owning and operating in the business services, industrial operations and residential development services industries.[18]
Management[edit]
J. Bruce Flatt is senior managing partner and chief executive officer. Mr. Flatt was appointed to this position in February 2002 after having served as chief executive officer of Brookfield Properties since 2000.[19][20] He was trained as an accountant at Clarkson, Gordon and Company, which is now part of Ernst & Young.[21] As of fiscal year 2014, his basic compensation was $6.65 million.[22]
Mr. Flatt is senior managing partner and chief executive officer of the corporation, and on behalf of the corporation is the chairman and a director of GGP. Mr. Flatt previously served as a board member to Fraser Papers and Norbord Incorporated.[22] Mr. Flatt holds a business degree from the University of Manitoba.[21]
History[edit]
1899-1979[edit]
In 1899 the São Paulo Railway, Light and Power Company was founded by William Mackenzie, Frederick Stark Pearson and others. (The word "Railway" would later be changed to "Tramway.")
In 1904 the Rio de Janeiro Tramway, Light and Power Company was founded by Mackenzie's group.[23]
In 1912 Brazilian Traction, Light and Power Company Limited was incorporated in Toronto as a public company to develop hydro-electric power operations and other utility services in Brazil, becoming a holding company for the two previous companies.[24]
In 1916 Great Lakes Power Company Limited was incorporated to provide hydro-electric power in Sault Ste. Marie and the Algoma District in Ontario.[25]
In 1966 Brazilian Traction, Light and Power Company Limited changed its name to Brazilian Light and Power Company Limited.
In 1969 Brazilian Light and Power Company Limited changes its name to Brascan Limited (BL)[24]
In 1979 the company's Brazilian assets were transferred to Brazilian ownership (e.g., Eletropaulo and Light S.A. - now AES Eletropaulo), the company meanwhile having diversified to other areas.[24]
2005-2009[edit]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
In 2005, the company changed its name to Brookfield Asset Management (BAM). As part of a number of purchases in 2007, Brookfield acquired Multiplex Group construction company for $6.1 billion and renamed it Brookfield Multiplex. In 2016 the company was re-branded as Multiplex.[26] It also acquired Longview Fibre Company, expanding its timberland platform to 2.5 million acres (10,000 km²). In 2008, Brookfield Infrastructure Partners was spun out of the holding company, and subsequently merged with Australia's Prime Infrastructure in a $1 billion transaction.
Birch Mountain class action[edit]
The Birch Mountain class action lawsuit has consistently been dismissed, with judges finding in favour of Brookfield and against the plaintiffs. In a process supervised by the Alberta courts, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) was appointed receiver of Birch Mountain Resources in November 2008 after Birch Mountain had defaulted on its debts. Birch Mountain’s assets were transferred to Tricap Partners Ltd, now operating under the Hammerstone Corporation, a subsidiary of Brookfield Special Situations Group, for approximately $50 million. [27]
A group called Birch Mountain Shareholders for Justice filed a lawsuit against Brookfield Asset Management on September 22, 2010 with the Superior Court of Justice in Ontario, Canada. The lawsuit challenged the acquisition and transfer of assets from a public company, Birch Mountain Resources, to the Hammerstone Corporation.[28]
The case was dismissed in its entirety, after the judge ruled it had no legal merit in April, 2015.[29] On May 25, 2015, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal in the case, in McDonald v. Brookfield Asset Management Inc. in the Court of Appeal Alberta.[30] The appeal was heard on June 15, 2016[31] over the Hammerstone Project MegaQuarry in Alberta. On Dec. 5, 2016, the Court of Appeal of Alberta again dismissed the case, ruling that the appeal was without merit.[32]
2010-2012[edit]
Launch of Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners[edit]
In 2010, Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners was launched as an exchange-listed global renewable power company, with a portfolio of hydroelectric and wind power plants in Canada, the United States and Brazil.[33]
General Growth Properties[edit]
Also in 2010, Brookfield led a successful restructuring of General Growth Properties, the second largest owner of U.S. shopping malls, out of bankruptcy after rebuffing Simon Property Group's attempt to acquire GGP.[20] In 2011, the company increased its share of General Growth Properties to 38%.[34] By 2012, Brookfield's stake in GGP grew to 42% which prompted investor activist William Ackman to request that GGP create a special committee unaffiliated with Brookfield to consider a sale to Simon.[35] On Dec. 31, 2012, Pershing Square agreed to sell a portfolio of its stake in GGP to Brookfield and struck a four-year agreement to be a passive investor in the shopping mall company.[36] By May, 2014 Pershing Square had sold all of its shares in GGP.[37]
Kerzner lawsuit[edit]
In January 2012, two hedge fund creditors, Trilogy Portfolio Co. and Canyon Value Realization Fund LP, in a loan with Brookfield, filed a lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court in Wilmington asking that the court restrain Brookfield's attempt to acquire the Kerzner International properties from closing.[38][39] In the lawsuit, the hedge funds alleged that Brookfield engaged in "brazen self-dealing" and collusion with junior lender PCCP and servicer Wells Fargo to complete the deal in violation of the loan agreement.[40] The court granted a temporary injunction pending a hearing. Brookfield consequently cancelled its offer to acquire the property.[41] Brookfield walked away after a Delaware judge issued the injunction.[40] The two hedge funds subsequently agreed to a restructuring that allowed Brookfield to acquire the One&Only Ocean Club in the Bahamas, Atlantis Paradise Island Resort in the Bahamas, and the One&Only Palmilla Resort in Mexico.[42][43] Brookfield subsequently sold the One & Only Ocean Club to Access Industries for $140 million.[44]
São Paulo, Brazil[edit]
In 2012, Brazilian authorities announced that they were investigating allegations that an executive at Brookfield bribed São Paulo building officials to secure permits required for renovating three shopping malls.[45] The allegations were made by Daniela Gonzalez, the former chief financial officer of a Brookfield subsidiary in Brazil, who was fired by Brookfield in 2010.[46] The alleged bribes reportedly totaled $789,851. Silvio Antonio Marques, a São Paulo state prosecutor confirmed the civil and criminal investigations to the Wall Street Journal and added that the reporting individual also provided documentation of the misconduct by Brookfield employees. A former Brookfield employee, who is being sued by Brookfield for embezzlement and is being investigated by Brazilian authorities, reported the alleged bribes to both the authorities in Brazil and to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.[46] Brazilian authorities say they are questioning a company controlled by Brookfield Asset Management as part of an investigation into allegations that São Paulo officials engaged in extortion. In the continuing SEC inquiry, the agency has been looking into allegations made by a former Brookfield executive, who says she was ordered to bribe city officials to obtain permits required for shopping malls and says she was fired for refusing to do so.[47] In June, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission informed Brookfield Asset Management that it had concluded its investigation and would not be bringing charges over alleged bribery in Brazil.[48]
Brookfield Property Partners launched[edit]
In 2012, the company announced plans to spin off its global property holdings to shareholders in Brookfield Asset Management by distributing units in a new entity, Brookfield Property Partners.[49]
City of London acquisition[edit]
In June 2012, Brookfield Office Properties announced plans to acquire a portfolio of three office buildings and a development site in the City of London for $829 million from Hammerson Inc., a British real estate company focused on retail developments.
Investments in Brazil, Chile and Maine[edit]
In July 2012, Brookfield and Spanish toll road operator Abertis announced plans to acquire a toll road network in Brazil. At the same time, Brookfield acquired full control of toll road assets in Chile. In December, 2012, Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners agreed to acquire a portfolio of 19 hydroelectric power stations in Maine from Nextera Energy Resources LLC for $760 million.[50]
2013[edit]
MPG Office Trust Inc.[edit]
On April 26, 2013, Brookfield Office Properties made an offer for MPG Office Trust Inc. and announced plans to create a new $1.15 billion fund that would hold seven MPG and Brookfield office buildings in Los Angeles.[51]
Brookfield Cold Storage launched[edit]
In June 2013, a Brookfield private equity fund acquired two Canadian refrigeration facilities, in Toronto and Calgary, from Millard Refrigerated Services, launching a new national company, Brookfield Cold Storage.[52]
Longview Timber and Longview Fibre sales[edit]
In June 2013, Brookfield also announced two separate transactions totaling $3.65 billion that saw the sale of its Longview Timber unit to Weyerhauser for $2.65 billion, and the sale of Longview Fibre Paper and Packaging to Kapstone Paper and packaging for $1 billion. Brookfield purchased the companies in 2007 with $1 billion of equity.[53] In commenting on the transaction, Kapstone chairman and CEO Roger Stone said: "The Longview team orchestrated a transformation that is truly, in my experience, the most amazing that I've actually ever seen in my 55 years in the industry."[54]
Carson Block mentions Brookfield in article[edit]
In July, 2013, the New York Times ran an article by short seller Carson Block of Muddy Waters LCC that cited Brookfield as one of a number of companies that had miscalculated the risks of investing in Brazil.[55]
Acquisition of Industrial Developments International[edit]

In early 2016, Brookfield announced that it partnered with Korea Investment Corp. to purchase a major chunk of Potsdamer Platz in Berlin, acquiring a total of 17 buildings.

Assets[edit]
The company's asset management offerings for institutional investors are focused on real assets, but also include alternative-type investments, structured financial products, traditional fixed income and equities and finite-risk reinsurance.[9] In addition, Brookfield Asset Management owns a significant stake in a real estate services company offering home relocations, property appraisals, move-in services and home transaction closing services, and capital market services, including financial advisory, securities underwriting, and property brokerage.[10] Brookfield Asset Management invests through public, listed companies and through private funds. The company's institutional clients mainly include governments, sovereign wealth funds, pension plans, institutions, corporations and high-net-worth individuals.[11][12]
Brookfield has $23 billion of assets under management in Canada, $138 billion invested in the United States, $19 billion invested in Asia Pacific, $20 billion in South America and $32 billion in the UK, Western Europe and the Middle East.[7] Its major real estate investments include Brookfield Place (formerly known as the World Financial Center) in New York, Brookfield Place in Toronto, Canary Wharf in London (owned with Qatar's Sovereign Wealth Fund), Potsdamer Platz in Berlin, the Bank of America Plaza in Los Angeles, Bankers Hall in Calgary,[13] Darling Park in Sydney, and Brookfield Place in Perth.[14][15]
Brookfield's infrastructure assets include utilities: electric and gas distribution; transport: railway and coal terminals and ports; energy transmission and communications infrastructure. [16]
Brookfield's renewable power assets include hydroelectric power plants and wind power assets.[17]
Brookfield’s private equity business focuses on real assets through owning and operating in the business services, industrial operations and residential development services industries.[18]
Management[edit]
J. Bruce Flatt is senior managing partner and chief executive officer. Mr. Flatt was appointed to this position in February 2002 after having served as chief executive officer of Brookfield Properties since 2000.[19][20] He was trained as an accountant at Clarkson, Gordon and Company, which is now part of Ernst & Young.[21] As of fiscal year 2014, his basic compensation was $6.65 million.[22]

Mr. Flatt previously served as a board member to Fraser Papers and Norbord Incorporated.[22] Mr. Flatt holds a business degree from the University of Manitoba.[21]
History[edit]
1899-1979[edit]
In 1899 the São Paulo Railway, Light and Power Company was founded by William Mackenzie, Frederick Stark Pearson and others. (The word "Railway" would later be changed to "Tramway.")
In 1904 the Rio de Janeiro Tramway, Light and Power Company was founded by Mackenzie's group.[23]
In 1912 Brazilian Traction, Light and Power Company Limited was incorporated in Toronto as a public company to develop hydro-electric power operations and other utility services in Brazil, becoming a holding company for the two previous companies.[24]
In 1916 Great Lakes Power Company Limited was incorporated to provide hydro-electric power in Sault Ste. Marie and the Algoma District in Ontario.[25]
In 1966 Brazilian Traction, Light and Power Company Limited changed its name to Brazilian Light and Power Company Limited.
In 1969 Brazilian Light and Power Company Limited changes its name to Brascan Limited (BL)[24]
In 1979 the company's Brazilian assets were transferred to Brazilian ownership (e.g., Eletropaulo and Light S.A. - now AES Eletropaulo), the company meanwhile having diversified to other areas.[24]
2005-2009[edit]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
In 2005, the company changed its name to Brookfield Asset Management (BAM). As part of a number of purchases in 2007, Brookfield acquired Multiplex Group construction company for $6.1 billion and renamed it Brookfield Multiplex. In 2016 the company was re-branded as Multiplex.[26] It also acquired Longview Fibre Company, expanding its timberland platform to 2.5 million acres (10,000 km²). In 2008, Brookfield Infrastructure Partners was spun out of the holding company, and subsequently merged with Australia's Prime Infrastructure in a $1 billion transaction.
Birch Mountain class action[edit]
The Birch Mountain class action lawsuit has consistently been dismissed, with judges finding in favour of Brookfield and against the plaintiffs. In a process supervised by the Alberta courts, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) was appointed receiver of Birch Mountain Resources in November 2008 after Birch Mountain had defaulted on its debts. Birch Mountain’s assets were transferred to Tricap Partners Ltd, now operating under the Hammerstone Corporation, a subsidiary of Brookfield Special Situations Group, for approximately $50 million. [27]
A group called Birch Mountain Shareholders for Justice filed a lawsuit against Brookfield Asset Management on September 22, 2010 with the Superior Court of Justice in Ontario, Canada. The lawsuit challenged the acquisition and transfer of assets from a public company, Birch Mountain Resources, to the Hammerstone Corporation.[28]
The case was dismissed in its entirety, after the judge ruled it had no legal merit in April, 2015.[29] On May 25, 2015, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal in the case, in McDonald v. Brookfield Asset Management Inc. in the Court of Appeal Alberta.[30] The appeal was heard on June 15, 2016[31] over the Hammerstone Project MegaQuarry in Alberta. On Dec. 5, 2016, the Court of Appeal of Alberta again dismissed the case, ruling that the appeal was without merit.[32]
2010-2012[edit]
Launch of Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners[edit]
In 2010, Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners was launched as an exchange-listed global renewable power company, with a portfolio of hydroelectric and wind power plants in Canada, the United States and Brazil.[33]
General Growth Properties[edit]
Also in 2010, Brookfield led a successful restructuring of General Growth Properties, the second largest owner of U.S. shopping malls, out of bankruptcy after rebuffing Simon Property Group's attempt to acquire GGP.[20] In 2011, the company increased its share of General Growth Properties to 38%.[34] By 2012, Brookfield's stake in GGP grew to 42% which prompted investor activist William Ackman to request that GGP create a special committee unaffiliated with Brookfield to consider a sale to Simon.[35] On Dec. 31, 2012, Pershing Square agreed to sell a portfolio of its stake in GGP to Brookfield and struck a four-year agreement to be a passive investor in the shopping mall company.[36] By May, 2014 Pershing Square had sold all of its shares in GGP.[37]
Kerzner lawsuit[edit]
In January 2012, two hedge fund creditors, Trilogy Portfolio Co. and Canyon Value Realization Fund LP, in a loan with Brookfield, filed a lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court in Wilmington asking that the court restrain Brookfield's attempt to acquire the Kerzner International properties from closing.[38][39] In the lawsuit, the hedge funds alleged that Brookfield engaged in "brazen self-dealing" and collusion with junior lender PCCP and servicer Wells Fargo to complete the deal in violation of the loan agreement.[40] The court granted a temporary injunction pending a hearing. Brookfield consequently cancelled its offer to acquire the property.[41] Brookfield walked away after a Delaware judge issued the injunction.[40] The two hedge funds subsequently agreed to a restructuring that allowed Brookfield to acquire the One&Only Ocean Club in the Bahamas, Atlantis Paradise Island Resort in the Bahamas, and the One&Only Palmilla Resort in Mexico.[42][43] Brookfield subsequently sold the One & Only Ocean Club to Access Industries for $140 million.[44]
São Paulo, Brazil[edit]
In 2012, Brazilian authorities announced that they were investigating allegations that an executive at Brookfield bribed São Paulo building officials to secure permits required for renovating three shopping malls.[45] The allegations were made by Daniela Gonzalez, the former chief financial officer of a Brookfield subsidiary in Brazil, who was fired by Brookfield in 2010.[46] The alleged bribes reportedly totaled $789,851. Silvio Antonio Marques, a São Paulo state prosecutor confirmed the civil and criminal investigations to the Wall Street Journal and added that the reporting individual also provided documentation of the misconduct by Brookfield employees. A former Brookfield employee, who is being sued by Brookfield for embezzlement and is being investigated by Brazilian authorities, reported the alleged bribes to both the authorities in Brazil and to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.[46] Brazilian authorities say they are questioning a company controlled by Brookfield Asset Management as part of an investigation into allegations that São Paulo officials engaged in extortion. In the continuing SEC inquiry, the agency has been looking into allegations made by a former Brookfield executive, who says she was ordered to bribe city officials to obtain permits required for shopping malls and says she was fired for refusing to do so.[47] In June, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission informed Brookfield Asset Management that it had concluded its investigation and would not be bringing charges over alleged bribery in Brazil.[48]
Brookfield Property Partners launched[edit]
In 2012, the company announced plans to spin off its global property holdings to shareholders in Brookfield Asset Management by distributing units in a new entity, Brookfield Property Partners.[49]

In June 2013, Brookfield also announced two separate transactions totaling $3.65 billion that saw the sale of its Longview Timber unit to Weyerhauser for $2.65 billion, and the sale of Longview Fibre Paper and Packaging to Kapstone Paper and packaging for $1 billion. Brookfield purchased the companies in 2007 with $1 billion of equity.[53] In commenting on the transaction, Kapstone chairman and CEO Roger Stone said: "The Longview team orchestrated a transformation that is truly, in my experience, the most amazing that I've actually ever seen in my 55 years in the industry."[54]
Carson Block mentions Brookfield in article[edit]
In July, 2013, the New York Times ran an article by short seller Carson Block of Muddy Waters LCC that cited Brookfield as one of a number of companies that had miscalculated the risks of investing in Brazil.[55]

Assets[edit]
The company's asset management offerings for institutional investors are focused on real assets, but also include alternative-type investments, structured financial products, traditional fixed income and equities and finite-risk reinsurance.[9] In addition, Brookfield Asset Management owns a significant stake in a real estate services company offering home relocations, property appraisals, move-in services and home transaction closing services, and capital market services, including financial advisory, securities underwriting, and property brokerage.[10] Brookfield Asset Management invests through public, listed companies and through private funds. The company's institutional clients mainly include governments, sovereign wealth funds, pension plans, institutions, corporations and high-net-worth individuals.[11][12]

Brookfield's renewable power assets include hydroelectric power plants and wind power assets.[17]
Brookfield’s private equity business focuses on real assets through owning and operating in the business services, industrial operations and residential development services industries.[18]

History[edit]
1899-1979[edit]
In 1899 the São Paulo Railway, Light and Power Company was founded by William Mackenzie, Frederick Stark Pearson and others. (The word "Railway" would later be changed to "Tramway.")
In 1904 the Rio de Janeiro Tramway, Light and Power Company was founded by Mackenzie's group.[23]
In 1912 Brazilian Traction, Light and Power Company Limited was incorporated in Toronto as a public company to develop hydro-electric power operations and other utility services in Brazil, becoming a holding company for the two previous companies.[24]
In 1916 Great Lakes Power Company Limited was incorporated to provide hydro-electric power in Sault Ste. Marie and the Algoma District in Ontario.[25]
In 1966 Brazilian Traction, Light and Power Company Limited changed its name to Brazilian Light and Power Company Limited.
In 1969 Brazilian Light and Power Company Limited changes its name to Brascan Limited (BL)[24]
In 1979 the company's Brazilian assets were transferred to Brazilian ownership (e.g., Eletropaulo and Light S.A. - now AES Eletropaulo), the company meanwhile having diversified to other areas.[24]
2005-2009[edit]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
In 2005, the company changed its name to Brookfield Asset Management (BAM). As part of a number of purchases in 2007, Brookfield acquired Multiplex Group construction company for $6.1 billion and renamed it Brookfield Multiplex. In 2016 the company was re-branded as Multiplex.[26] It also acquired Longview Fibre Company, expanding its timberland platform to 2.5 million acres (10,000 km²). In 2008, Brookfield Infrastructure Partners was spun out of the holding company, and subsequently merged with Australia's Prime Infrastructure in a $1 billion transaction.
Birch Mountain class action[edit]
The Birch Mountain class action lawsuit has consistently been dismissed, with judges finding in favour of Brookfield and against the plaintiffs. In a process supervised by the Alberta courts, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) was appointed receiver of Birch Mountain Resources in November 2008 after Birch Mountain had defaulted on its debts. Birch Mountain’s assets were transferred to Tricap Partners Ltd, now operating under the Hammerstone Corporation, a subsidiary of Brookfield Special Situations Group, for approximately $50 million. [27]
A group called Birch Mountain Shareholders for Justice filed a lawsuit against Brookfield Asset Management on September 22, 2010 with the Superior Court of Justice in Ontario, Canada. The lawsuit challenged the acquisition and transfer of assets from a public company, Birch Mountain Resources, to the Hammerstone Corporation.[28]
The case was dismissed in its entirety, after the judge ruled it had no legal merit in April, 2015.[29] On May 25, 2015, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal in the case, in McDonald v. Brookfield Asset Management Inc. in the Court of Appeal Alberta.[30] The appeal was heard on June 15, 2016[31] over the Hammerstone Project MegaQuarry in Alberta. On Dec. 5, 2016, the Court of Appeal of Alberta again dismissed the case, ruling that the appeal was without merit.[32]
2010-2012[edit]
Launch of Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners[edit]
In 2010, Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners was launched as an exchange-listed global renewable power company, with a portfolio of hydroelectric and wind power plants in Canada, the United States and Brazil.[33]
General Growth Properties[edit]
Also in 2010, Brookfield led a successful restructuring of General Growth Properties, the second largest owner of U.S. shopping malls, out of bankruptcy after rebuffing Simon Property Group's attempt to acquire GGP.[20] In 2011, the company increased its share of General Growth Properties to 38%.[34] By 2012, Brookfield's stake in GGP grew to 42% which prompted investor activist William Ackman to request that GGP create a special committee unaffiliated with Brookfield to consider a sale to Simon.[35] On Dec. 31, 2012, Pershing Square agreed to sell a portfolio of its stake in GGP to Brookfield and struck a four-year agreement to be a passive investor in the shopping mall company.[36] By May, 2014 Pershing Square had sold all of its shares in GGP.[37]
Kerzner lawsuit[edit]
In January 2012, two hedge fund creditors, Trilogy Portfolio Co. and Canyon Value Realization Fund LP, in a loan with Brookfield, filed a lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court in Wilmington asking that the court restrain Brookfield's attempt to acquire the Kerzner International properties from closing.[38][39] In the lawsuit, the hedge funds alleged that Brookfield engaged in "brazen self-dealing" and collusion with junior lender PCCP and servicer Wells Fargo to complete the deal in violation of the loan agreement.[40] The court granted a temporary injunction pending a hearing. Brookfield consequently cancelled its offer to acquire the property.[41] Brookfield walked away after a Delaware judge issued the injunction.[40] The two hedge funds subsequently agreed to a restructuring that allowed Brookfield to acquire the One&Only Ocean Club in the Bahamas, Atlantis Paradise Island Resort in the Bahamas, and the One&Only Palmilla Resort in Mexico.[42][43] Brookfield subsequently sold the One & Only Ocean Club to Access Industries for $140 million.[44]
São Paulo, Brazil[edit]
In 2012, Brazilian authorities announced that they were investigating allegations that an executive at Brookfield bribed São Paulo building officials to secure permits required for renovating three shopping malls.[45] The allegations were made by Daniela Gonzalez, the former chief financial officer of a Brookfield subsidiary in Brazil, who was fired by Brookfield in 2010.[46] The alleged bribes reportedly totaled $789,851. Silvio Antonio Marques, a São Paulo state prosecutor confirmed the civil and criminal investigations to the Wall Street Journal and added that the reporting individual also provided documentation of the misconduct by Brookfield employees. A former Brookfield employee, who is being sued by Brookfield for embezzlement and is being investigated by Brazilian authorities, reported the alleged bribes to both the authorities in Brazil and to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.[46] Brazilian authorities say they are questioning a company controlled by Brookfield Asset Management as part of an investigation into allegations that São Paulo officials engaged in extortion. In the continuing SEC inquiry, the agency has been looking into allegations made by a former Brookfield executive, who says she was ordered to bribe city officials to obtain permits required for shopping malls and says she was fired for refusing to do so.[47] In June, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission informed Brookfield Asset Management that it had concluded its investigation and would not be bringing charges over alleged bribery in Brazil.[48]
Brookfield Property Partners launched[edit]
In 2012, the company announced plans to spin off its global property holdings to shareholders in Brookfield Asset Management by distributing units in a new entity, Brookfield Property Partners.[49]

Brookfield purchased the companies in 2007 with $1 billion of equity.[53] In commenting on the transaction, Kapstone chairman and CEO Roger Stone said: "The Longview team orchestrated a transformation that is truly, in my experience, the most amazing that I've actually ever seen in my 55 years in the industry."[54]
Carson Block mentions Brookfield in article[edit]

Assets[edit]
The company's asset management offerings for institutional investors are focused on real assets, but also include alternative-type investments, structured financial products, traditional fixed income and equities and finite-risk reinsurance.[9] In addition, Brookfield Asset Management owns a significant stake in a real estate services company offering home relocations, property appraisals, move-in services and home transaction closing services, and capital market services, including financial advisory, securities underwriting, and property brokerage.[10] Brookfield Asset Management invests through public, listed companies and through private funds. The company's institutional clients mainly include governments, sovereign wealth funds, pension plans, institutions, corporations and high-net-worth individuals.[11][12]
Brookfield has $23 billion of assets under management in Canada, $138 billion invested in the United States, $19 billion invested in Asia Pacific, $20 billion in South America and $32 billion in the UK, Western Europe and the Middle East.[7] Its major real estate investments include Brookfield Place (formerly known as the World Financial Center) in New York, Brookfield Place in Toronto, Canary Wharf in London (owned with Qatar's Sovereign Wealth Fund), Potsdamer Platz in Berlin, the Bank of America Plaza in Los Angeles, Bankers Hall in Calgary,[13] Darling Park in Sydney, and Brookfield Place in Perth.[14][15]
Brookfield's infrastructure assets include utilities: electric and gas distribution; transport: railway and coal terminals and ports; energy transmission and communications infrastructure. [16]
Brookfield's renewable power assets include hydroelectric power plants and wind power assets.[17]
Brookfield’s private equity business focuses on real assets through owning and operating in the business services, industrial operations and residential development services industries.[18]
Management[edit]
J. Bruce Flatt is senior managing partner and chief executive officer. Mr. Flatt was appointed to this position in February 2002 after having served as chief executive officer of Brookfield Properties since 2000.[19][20] He was trained as an accountant at Clarkson, Gordon and Company, which is now part of Ernst & Young.[21] As of fiscal year 2014, his basic compensation was $6.65 million.[22]

Mr. Flatt previously served as a board member to Fraser Papers and Norbord Incorporated.[22] Mr. Flatt holds a business degree from the University of Manitoba.[21]
History[edit]
1899-1979[edit]
In 1899 the São Paulo Railway, Light and Power Company was founded by William Mackenzie, Frederick Stark Pearson and others. (The word "Railway" would later be changed to "Tramway.")
In 1904 the Rio de Janeiro Tramway, Light and Power Company was founded by Mackenzie's group.[23]
In 1912 Brazilian Traction, Light and Power Company Limited was incorporated in Toronto as a public company to develop hydro-electric power operations and other utility services in Brazil, becoming a holding company for the two previous companies.[24]
In 1916 Great Lakes Power Company Limited was incorporated to provide hydro-electric power in Sault Ste. Marie and the Algoma District in Ontario.[25]
In 1966 Brazilian Traction, Light and Power Company Limited changed its name to Brazilian Light and Power Company Limited.
In 1969 Brazilian Light and Power Company Limited changes its name to Brascan Limited (BL)[24]
In 1979 the company's Brazilian assets were transferred to Brazilian ownership (e.g., Eletropaulo and Light S.A. - now AES Eletropaulo), the company meanwhile having diversified to other areas.[24]
2005-2009[edit]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
In 2005, the company changed its name to Brookfield Asset Management (BAM). As part of a number of purchases in 2007, Brookfield acquired Multiplex Group construction company for $6.1 billion and renamed it Brookfield Multiplex. In 2016 the company was re-branded as Multiplex.[26] It also acquired Longview Fibre Company, expanding its timberland platform to 2.5 million acres (10,000 km²). In 2008, Brookfield Infrastructure Partners was spun out of the holding company, and subsequently merged with Australia's Prime Infrastructure in a $1 billion transaction.
Birch Mountain class action[edit]
The Birch Mountain class action lawsuit has consistently been dismissed, with judges finding in favour of Brookfield and against the plaintiffs. In a process supervised by the Alberta courts, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) was appointed receiver of Birch Mountain Resources in November 2008 after Birch Mountain had defaulted on its debts. Birch Mountain’s assets were transferred to Tricap Partners Ltd, now operating under the Hammerstone Corporation, a subsidiary of Brookfield Special Situations Group, for approximately $50 million. [27]
A group called Birch Mountain Shareholders for Justice filed a lawsuit against Brookfield Asset Management on September 22, 2010 with the Superior Court of Justice in Ontario, Canada. The lawsuit challenged the acquisition and transfer of assets from a public company, Birch Mountain Resources, to the Hammerstone Corporation.[28]
The case was dismissed in its entirety, after the judge ruled it had no legal merit in April, 2015.[29] On May 25, 2015, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal in the case, in McDonald v. Brookfield Asset Management Inc. in the Court of Appeal Alberta.[30] The appeal was heard on June 15, 2016[31] over the Hammerstone Project MegaQuarry in Alberta. On Dec. 5, 2016, the Court of Appeal of Alberta again dismissed the case, ruling that the appeal was without merit.[32]
2010-2012[edit]
Launch of Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners[edit]
In 2010, Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners was launched as an exchange-listed global renewable power company, with a portfolio of hydroelectric and wind power plants in Canada, the United States and Brazil.[33]
General Growth Properties[edit]
Also in 2010, Brookfield led a successful restructuring of General Growth Properties, the second largest owner of U.S. shopping malls, out of bankruptcy after rebuffing Simon Property Group's attempt to acquire GGP.[20] In 2011, the company increased its share of General Growth Properties to 38%.[34] By 2012, Brookfield's stake in GGP grew to 42% which prompted investor activist William Ackman to request that GGP create a special committee unaffiliated with Brookfield to consider a sale to Simon.[35] On Dec. 31, 2012, Pershing Square agreed to sell a portfolio of its stake in GGP to Brookfield and struck a four-year agreement to be a passive investor in the shopping mall company.[36] By May, 2014 Pershing Square had sold all of its shares in GGP.[37]
Kerzner lawsuit[edit]
In January 2012, two hedge fund creditors, Trilogy Portfolio Co. and Canyon Value Realization Fund LP, in a loan with Brookfield, filed a lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court in Wilmington asking that the court restrain Brookfield's attempt to acquire the Kerzner International properties from closing.[38][39] In the lawsuit, the hedge funds alleged that Brookfield engaged in "brazen self-dealing" and collusion with junior lender PCCP and servicer Wells Fargo to complete the deal in violation of the loan agreement.[40] The court granted a temporary injunction pending a hearing. Brookfield consequently cancelled its offer to acquire the property.[41] Brookfield walked away after a Delaware judge issued the injunction.[40] The two hedge funds subsequently agreed to a restructuring that allowed Brookfield to acquire the One&Only Ocean Club in the Bahamas, Atlantis Paradise Island Resort in the Bahamas, and the One&Only Palmilla Resort in Mexico.[42][43] Brookfield subsequently sold the One & Only Ocean Club to Access Industries for $140 million.[44]
São Paulo, Brazil[edit]
In 2012, Brazilian authorities announced that they were investigating allegations that an executive at Brookfield bribed São Paulo building officials to secure permits required for renovating three shopping malls.[45] The allegations were made by Daniela Gonzalez, the former chief financial officer of a Brookfield subsidiary in Brazil, who was fired by Brookfield in 2010.[46] The alleged bribes reportedly totaled $789,851. Silvio Antonio Marques, a São Paulo state prosecutor confirmed the civil and criminal investigations to the Wall Street Journal and added that the reporting individual also provided documentation of the misconduct by Brookfield employees. A former Brookfield employee, who is being sued by Brookfield for embezzlement and is being investigated by Brazilian authorities, reported the alleged bribes to both the authorities in Brazil and to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.[46] Brazilian authorities say they are questioning a company controlled by Brookfield Asset Management as part of an investigation into allegations that São Paulo officials engaged in extortion. In the continuing SEC inquiry, the agency has been looking into allegations made by a former Brookfield executive, who says she was ordered to bribe city officials to obtain permits required for shopping malls and says she was fired for refusing to do so.[47] In June, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission informed Brookfield Asset Management that it had concluded its investigation and would not be bringing charges over alleged bribery in Brazil.[48]
Brookfield Property Partners launched[edit]
In 2012, the company announced plans to spin off its global property holdings to shareholders in Brookfield Asset Management by distributing units in a new entity, Brookfield Property Partners.[49]
City of London acquisition[edit]
In June 2012, Brookfield Office Properties announced plans to acquire a portfolio of three office buildings and a development site in the City of London for $829 million from Hammerson Inc., a British real estate company focused on retail developments.
Investments in Brazil, Chile and Maine[edit]
In July 2012, Brookfield and Spanish toll road operator Abertis announced plans to acquire a toll road network in Brazil. At the same time, Brookfield acquired full control of toll road assets in Chile. In December, 2012, Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners agreed to acquire a portfolio of 19 hydroelectric power stations in Maine from Nextera Energy Resources LLC for $760 million.[50]
2013[edit]

On April 26, 2013, Brookfield Office Properties made an offer for MPG Office Trust Inc. and announced plans to create a new $1.15 billion fund that would hold seven MPG and Brookfield office buildings in Los Angeles.[51]
Brookfield Cold Storage launched[edit]
In June 2013, a Brookfield private equity fund acquired two Canadian refrigeration facilities, in Toronto and Calgary, from Millard Refrigerated Services, launching a new national company, Brookfield Cold Storage.[52]
Longview Timber and Longview Fibre sales[edit]
In June 2013, Brookfield also announced two separate transactions totaling $3.65 billion that saw the sale of its Longview Timber unit to Weyerhauser for $2.65 billion, and the sale of Longview Fibre Paper and Packaging to Kapstone Paper and packaging for $1 billion. Brookfield purchased the companies in 2007 with $1 billion of equity.[53] In commenting on the transaction, Kapstone chairman and CEO Roger Stone said: "The Longview team orchestrated a transformation that is truly, in my experience, the most amazing that I've actually ever seen in my 55 years in the industry."[54]
Carson Block mentions Brookfield in article[edit]
In July, 2013, the New York Times ran an article by short seller Carson Block of Muddy Waters LCC that cited Brookfield as one of a number of companies that had miscalculated the risks of investing in Brazil.[55]

In 1904 the Rio de Janeiro Tramway, Light and Power Company was founded by Mackenzie's group.[23]
In 1912 Brazilian Traction, Light and Power Company Limited was incorporated in Toronto as a public company to develop hydro-electric power operations and other utility services in Brazil, becoming a holding company for the two previous companies.[24]
In 1916 Great Lakes Power Company Limited was incorporated to provide hydro-electric power in Sault Ste. Marie and the Algoma District in Ontario.[25]
In 1966 Brazilian Traction, Light and Power Company Limited changed its name to Brazilian Light and Power Company Limited.
In 1969 Brazilian Light and Power Company Limited changes its name to Brascan Limited (BL)[24]
In 1979 the company's Brazilian assets were transferred to Brazilian ownership (e.g., Eletropaulo and Light S.A. - now AES Eletropaulo), the company meanwhile having diversified to other areas.[24]
2005-2009[edit]

In 2016 the company was re-branded as Multiplex.[26] It also acquired Longview Fibre Company, expanding its timberland platform to 2.5 million acres (10,000 km²). In 2008, Brookfield Infrastructure Partners was spun out of the holding company, and subsequently merged with Australia's Prime Infrastructure in a $1 billion transaction.
Birch Mountain class action[edit]
The Birch Mountain class action lawsuit has consistently been dismissed, with judges finding in favour of Brookfield and against the plaintiffs. In a process supervised by the Alberta courts, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) was appointed receiver of Birch Mountain Resources in November 2008 after Birch Mountain had defaulted on its debts. Birch Mountain’s assets were transferred to Tricap Partners Ltd, now operating under the Hammerstone Corporation, a subsidiary of Brookfield Special Situations Group, for approximately $50 million. [27]
A group called Birch Mountain Shareholders for Justice filed a lawsuit against Brookfield Asset Management on September 22, 2010 with the Superior Court of Justice in Ontario, Canada. The lawsuit challenged the acquisition and transfer of assets from a public company, Birch Mountain Resources, to the Hammerstone Corporation.[28]
The case was dismissed in its entirety, after the judge ruled it had no legal merit in April, 2015.[29] On May 25, 2015, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal in the case, in McDonald v. Brookfield Asset Management Inc. in the Court of Appeal Alberta.[30] The appeal was heard on June 15, 2016[31] over the Hammerstone Project MegaQuarry in Alberta. On Dec. 5, 2016, the Court of Appeal of Alberta again dismissed the case, ruling that the appeal was without merit.[32]
2010-2012[edit]
Launch of Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners[edit]
In 2010, Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners was launched as an exchange-listed global renewable power company, with a portfolio of hydroelectric and wind power plants in Canada, the United States and Brazil.[33]
General Growth Properties[edit]
Also in 2010, Brookfield led a successful restructuring of General Growth Properties, the second largest owner of U.S. shopping malls, out of bankruptcy after rebuffing Simon Property Group's attempt to acquire GGP.[20] In 2011, the company increased its share of General Growth Properties to 38%.[34] By 2012, Brookfield's stake in GGP grew to 42% which prompted investor activist William Ackman to request that GGP create a special committee unaffiliated with Brookfield to consider a sale to Simon.[35] On Dec. 31, 2012, Pershing Square agreed to sell a portfolio of its stake in GGP to Brookfield and struck a four-year agreement to be a passive investor in the shopping mall company.[36] By May, 2014 Pershing Square had sold all of its shares in GGP.[37]
Kerzner lawsuit[edit]
In January 2012, two hedge fund creditors, Trilogy Portfolio Co. and Canyon Value Realization Fund LP, in a loan with Brookfield, filed a lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court in Wilmington asking that the court restrain Brookfield's attempt to acquire the Kerzner International properties from closing.[38][39] In the lawsuit, the hedge funds alleged that Brookfield engaged in "brazen self-dealing" and collusion with junior lender PCCP and servicer Wells Fargo to complete the deal in violation of the loan agreement.[40] The court granted a temporary injunction pending a hearing. Brookfield consequently cancelled its offer to acquire the property.[41] Brookfield walked away after a Delaware judge issued the injunction.[40] The two hedge funds subsequently agreed to a restructuring that allowed Brookfield to acquire the One&Only Ocean Club in the Bahamas, Atlantis Paradise Island Resort in the Bahamas, and the One&Only Palmilla Resort in Mexico.[42][43] Brookfield subsequently sold the One & Only Ocean Club to Access Industries for $140 million.[44]
São Paulo, Brazil[edit]
In 2012, Brazilian authorities announced that they were investigating allegations that an executive at Brookfield bribed São Paulo building officials to secure permits required for renovating three shopping malls.[45] The allegations were made by Daniela Gonzalez, the former chief financial officer of a Brookfield subsidiary in Brazil, who was fired by Brookfield in 2010.[46] The alleged bribes reportedly totaled $789,851. Silvio Antonio Marques, a São Paulo state prosecutor confirmed the civil and criminal investigations to the Wall Street Journal and added that the reporting individual also provided documentation of the misconduct by Brookfield employees. A former Brookfield employee, who is being sued by Brookfield for embezzlement and is being investigated by Brazilian authorities, reported the alleged bribes to both the authorities in Brazil and to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.[46] Brazilian authorities say they are questioning a company controlled by Brookfield Asset Management as part of an investigation into allegations that São Paulo officials engaged in extortion. In the continuing SEC inquiry, the agency has been looking into allegations made by a former Brookfield executive, who says she was ordered to bribe city officials to obtain permits required for shopping malls and says she was fired for refusing to do so.[47] In June, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission informed Brookfield Asset Management that it had concluded its investigation and would not be bringing charges over alleged bribery in Brazil.[48]

Brookfield purchased the companies in 2007 with $1 billion of equity.[53] In commenting on the transaction, Kapstone chairman and CEO Roger Stone said: "The Longview team orchestrated a transformation that is truly, in my experience, the most amazing that I've actually ever seen in my 55 years in the industry."[54]
Carson Block mentions Brookfield in article[edit]

In 1899 the São Paulo Railway, Light and Power Company was founded by William Mackenzie, Frederick Stark Pearson and others. (The word "Railway" would later be changed to "Tramway.")
In 1904 the Rio de Janeiro Tramway, Light and Power Company was founded by Mackenzie's group.[23]
In 1912 Brazilian Traction, Light and Power Company Limited was incorporated in Toronto as a public company to develop hydro-electric power operations and other utility services in Brazil, becoming a holding company for the two previous companies.[24]
In 1916 Great Lakes Power Company Limited was incorporated to provide hydro-electric power in Sault Ste. Marie and the Algoma District in Ontario.[25]
In 1966 Brazilian Traction, Light and Power Company Limited changed its name to Brazilian Light and Power Company Limited.
In 1969 Brazilian Light and Power Company Limited changes its name to Brascan Limited (BL)[24]
In 1979 the company's Brazilian assets were transferred to Brazilian ownership (e.g., Eletropaulo and Light S.A. - now AES Eletropaulo), the company meanwhile having diversified to other areas.[24]
2005-2009[edit]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
In 2005, the company changed its name to Brookfield Asset Management (BAM). As part of a number of purchases in 2007, Brookfield acquired Multiplex Group construction company for $6.1 billion and renamed it Brookfield Multiplex. In 2016 the company was re-branded as Multiplex.[26] It also acquired Longview Fibre Company, expanding its timberland platform to 2.5 million acres (10,000 km²). In 2008, Brookfield Infrastructure Partners was spun out of the holding company, and subsequently merged with Australia's Prime Infrastructure in a $1 billion transaction.
Birch Mountain class action[edit]
The Birch Mountain class action lawsuit has consistently been dismissed, with judges finding in favour of Brookfield and against the plaintiffs. In a process supervised by the Alberta courts, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) was appointed receiver of Birch Mountain Resources in November 2008 after Birch Mountain had defaulted on its debts. Birch Mountain’s assets were transferred to Tricap Partners Ltd, now operating under the Hammerstone Corporation, a subsidiary of Brookfield Special Situations Group, for approximately $50 million. [27]
A group called Birch Mountain Shareholders for Justice filed a lawsuit against Brookfield Asset Management on September 22, 2010 with the Superior Court of Justice in Ontario, Canada. The lawsuit challenged the acquisition and transfer of assets from a public company, Birch Mountain Resources, to the Hammerstone Corporation.[28]
The case was dismissed in its entirety, after the judge ruled it had no legal merit in April, 2015.[29] On May 25, 2015, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal in the case, in McDonald v. Brookfield Asset Management Inc. in the Court of Appeal Alberta.[30] The appeal was heard on June 15, 2016[31] over the Hammerstone Project MegaQuarry in Alberta. On Dec. 5, 2016, the Court of Appeal of Alberta again dismissed the case, ruling that the appeal was without merit.[32]
2010-2012[edit]
Launch of Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners[edit]
In 2010, Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners was launched as an exchange-listed global renewable power company, with a portfolio of hydroelectric and wind power plants in Canada, the United States and Brazil.[33]
General Growth Properties[edit]
Also in 2010, Brookfield led a successful restructuring of General Growth Properties, the second largest owner of U.S. shopping malls, out of bankruptcy after rebuffing Simon Property Group's attempt to acquire GGP.[20] In 2011, the company increased its share of General Growth Properties to 38%.[34] By 2012, Brookfield's stake in GGP grew to 42% which prompted investor activist William Ackman to request that GGP create a special committee unaffiliated with Brookfield to consider a sale to Simon.[35] On Dec. 31, 2012, Pershing Square agreed to sell a portfolio of its stake in GGP to Brookfield and struck a four-year agreement to be a passive investor in the shopping mall company.[36] By May, 2014 Pershing Square had sold all of its shares in GGP.[37]
Kerzner lawsuit[edit]
In January 2012, two hedge fund creditors, Trilogy Portfolio Co. and Canyon Value Realization Fund LP, in a loan with Brookfield, filed a lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court in Wilmington asking that the court restrain Brookfield's attempt to acquire the Kerzner International properties from closing.[38][39] In the lawsuit, the hedge funds alleged that Brookfield engaged in "brazen self-dealing" and collusion with junior lender PCCP and servicer Wells Fargo to complete the deal in violation of the loan agreement.[40] The court granted a temporary injunction pending a hearing. Brookfield consequently cancelled its offer to acquire the property.[41] Brookfield walked away after a Delaware judge issued the injunction.[40] The two hedge funds subsequently agreed to a restructuring that allowed Brookfield to acquire the One&Only Ocean Club in the Bahamas, Atlantis Paradise Island Resort in the Bahamas, and the One&Only Palmilla Resort in Mexico.[42][43] Brookfield subsequently sold the One & Only Ocean Club to Access Industries for $140 million.[44]
São Paulo, Brazil[edit]
In 2012, Brazilian authorities announced that they were investigating allegations that an executive at Brookfield bribed São Paulo building officials to secure permits required for renovating three shopping malls.[45] The allegations were made by Daniela Gonzalez, the former chief financial officer of a Brookfield subsidiary in Brazil, who was fired by Brookfield in 2010.[46] The alleged bribes reportedly totaled $789,851. Silvio Antonio Marques, a São Paulo state prosecutor confirmed the civil and criminal investigations to the Wall Street Journal and added that the reporting individual also provided documentation of the misconduct by Brookfield employees. A former Brookfield employee, who is being sued by Brookfield for embezzlement and is being investigated by Brazilian authorities, reported the alleged bribes to both the authorities in Brazil and to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.[46] Brazilian authorities say they are questioning a company controlled by Brookfield Asset Management as part of an investigation into allegations that São Paulo officials engaged in extortion. In the continuing SEC inquiry, the agency has been looking into allegations made by a former Brookfield executive, who says she was ordered to bribe city officials to obtain permits required for shopping malls and says she was fired for refusing to do so.[47] In June, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission informed Brookfield Asset Management that it had concluded its investigation and would not be bringing charges over alleged bribery in Brazil.[48]
Brookfield Property Partners launched[edit]
In 2012, the company announced plans to spin off its global property holdings to shareholders in Brookfield Asset Management by distributing units in a new entity, Brookfield Property Partners.[49]
City of London acquisition[edit]
In June 2012, Brookfield Office Properties announced plans to acquire a portfolio of three office buildings and a development site in the City of London for $829 million from Hammerson Inc., a British real estate company focused on retail developments.

In July 2012, Brookfield and Spanish toll road operator Abertis announced plans to acquire a toll road network in Brazil. At the same time, Brookfield acquired full control of toll road assets in Chile. In December, 2012, Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners agreed to acquire a portfolio of 19 hydroelectric power stations in Maine from Nextera Energy Resources LLC for $760 million.[50]
2013[edit]
MPG Office Trust Inc.[edit]
On April 26, 2013, Brookfield Office Properties made an offer for MPG Office Trust Inc. and announced plans to create a new $1.15 billion fund that would hold seven MPG and Brookfield office buildings in Los Angeles.[51]
Brookfield Cold Storage launched[edit]
In June 2013, a Brookfield private equity fund acquired two Canadian refrigeration facilities, in Toronto and Calgary, from Millard Refrigerated Services, launching a new national company, Brookfield Cold Storage.[52]
Longview Timber and Longview Fibre sales[edit]
In June 2013, Brookfield also announced two separate transactions totaling $3.65 billion that saw the sale of its Longview Timber unit to Weyerhauser for $2.65 billion, and the sale of Longview Fibre Paper and Packaging to Kapstone Paper and packaging for $1 billion. Brookfield purchased the companies in 2007 with $1 billion of equity.[53] In commenting on the transaction, Kapstone chairman and CEO Roger Stone said: "The Longview team orchestrated a transformation that is truly, in my experience, the most amazing that I've actually ever seen in my 55 years in the industry."[54]
Carson Block mentions Brookfield in article[edit]
In July, 2013, the New York Times ran an article by short seller Carson Block of Muddy Waters LCC that cited Brookfield as one of a number of companies that had miscalculated the risks of investing in Brazil.[55]
Acquisition of Industrial Developments International[edit]

History[edit]
1899-1979[edit]
In 1899 the São Paulo Railway, Light and Power Company was founded by William Mackenzie, Frederick Stark Pearson and others. (The word "Railway" would later be changed to "Tramway.")
In 1904 the Rio de Janeiro Tramway, Light and Power Company was founded by Mackenzie's group.[23]
In 1912 Brazilian Traction, Light and Power Company Limited was incorporated in Toronto as a public company to develop hydro-electric power operations and other utility services in Brazil, becoming a holding company for the two previous companies.[24]
In 1916 Great Lakes Power Company Limited was incorporated to provide hydro-electric power in Sault Ste. Marie and the Algoma District in Ontario.[25]
In 1966 Brazilian Traction, Light and Power Company Limited changed its name to Brazilian Light and Power Company Limited.
In 1969 Brazilian Light and Power Company Limited changes its name to Brascan Limited (BL)[24]
In 1979 the company's Brazilian assets were transferred to Brazilian ownership (e.g., Eletropaulo and Light S.A. - now AES Eletropaulo), the company meanwhile having diversified to other areas.[24]
2005-2009[edit]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
In 2005, the company changed its name to Brookfield Asset Management (BAM). As part of a number of purchases in 2007, Brookfield acquired Multiplex Group construction company for $6.1 billion and renamed it Brookfield Multiplex. In 2016 the company was re-branded as Multiplex.[26] It also acquired Longview Fibre Company, expanding its timberland platform to 2.5 million acres (10,000 km²). In 2008, Brookfield Infrastructure Partners was spun out of the holding company, and subsequently merged with Australia's Prime Infrastructure in a $1 billion transaction.
Birch Mountain class action[edit]
The Birch Mountain class action lawsuit has consistently been dismissed, with judges finding in favour of Brookfield and against the plaintiffs. In a process supervised by the Alberta courts, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) was appointed receiver of Birch Mountain Resources in November 2008 after Birch Mountain had defaulted on its debts. Birch Mountain’s assets were transferred to Tricap Partners Ltd, now operating under the Hammerstone Corporation, a subsidiary of Brookfield Special Situations Group, for approximately $50 million. [27]
A group called Birch Mountain Shareholders for Justice filed a lawsuit against Brookfield Asset Management on September 22, 2010 with the Superior Court of Justice in Ontario, Canada. The lawsuit challenged the acquisition and transfer of assets from a public company, Birch Mountain Resources, to the Hammerstone Corporation.[28]
The case was dismissed in its entirety, after the judge ruled it had no legal merit in April, 2015.[29] On May 25, 2015, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal in the case, in McDonald v. Brookfield Asset Management Inc. in the Court of Appeal Alberta.[30] The appeal was heard on June 15, 2016[31] over the Hammerstone Project MegaQuarry in Alberta. On Dec. 5, 2016, the Court of Appeal of Alberta again dismissed the case, ruling that the appeal was without merit.[32]
2010-2012[edit]
Launch of Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners[edit]
In 2010, Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners was launched as an exchange-listed global renewable power company, with a portfolio of hydroelectric and wind power plants in Canada, the United States and Brazil.[33]
General Growth Properties[edit]
Also in 2010, Brookfield led a successful restructuring of General Growth Properties, the second largest owner of U.S. shopping malls, out of bankruptcy after rebuffing Simon Property Group's attempt to acquire GGP.[20] In 2011, the company increased its share of General Growth Properties to 38%.[34] By 2012, Brookfield's stake in GGP grew to 42% which prompted investor activist William Ackman to request that GGP create a special committee unaffiliated with Brookfield to consider a sale to Simon.[35] On Dec. 31, 2012, Pershing Square agreed to sell a portfolio of its stake in GGP to Brookfield and struck a four-year agreement to be a passive investor in the shopping mall company.[36] By May, 2014 Pershing Square had sold all of its shares in GGP.[37]
Kerzner lawsuit[edit]
In January 2012, two hedge fund creditors, Trilogy Portfolio Co. and Canyon Value Realization Fund LP, in a loan with Brookfield, filed a lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court in Wilmington asking that the court restrain Brookfield's attempt to acquire the Kerzner International properties from closing.[38][39] In the lawsuit, the hedge funds alleged that Brookfield engaged in "brazen self-dealing" and collusion with junior lender PCCP and servicer Wells Fargo to complete the deal in violation of the loan agreement.[40] The court granted a temporary injunction pending a hearing. Brookfield consequently cancelled its offer to acquire the property.[41] Brookfield walked away after a Delaware judge issued the injunction.[40] The two hedge funds subsequently agreed to a restructuring that allowed Brookfield to acquire the One&Only Ocean Club in the Bahamas, Atlantis Paradise Island Resort in the Bahamas, and the One&Only Palmilla Resort in Mexico.[42][43] Brookfield subsequently sold the One & Only Ocean Club to Access Industries for $140 million.[44]
São Paulo, Brazil[edit]
In 2012, Brazilian authorities announced that they were investigating allegations that an executive at Brookfield bribed São Paulo building officials to secure permits required for renovating three shopping malls.[45] The allegations were made by Daniela Gonzalez, the former chief financial officer of a Brookfield subsidiary in Brazil, who was fired by Brookfield in 2010.[46] The alleged bribes reportedly totaled $789,851. Silvio Antonio Marques, a São Paulo state prosecutor confirmed the civil and criminal investigations to the Wall Street Journal and added that the reporting individual also provided documentation of the misconduct by Brookfield employees. A former Brookfield employee, who is being sued by Brookfield for embezzlement and is being investigated by Brazilian authorities, reported the alleged bribes to both the authorities in Brazil and to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.[46] Brazilian authorities say they are questioning a company controlled by Brookfield Asset Management as part of an investigation into allegations that São Paulo officials engaged in extortion. In the continuing SEC inquiry, the agency has been looking into allegations made by a former Brookfield executive, who says she was ordered to bribe city officials to obtain permits required for shopping malls and says she was fired for refusing to do so.[47] In June, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission informed Brookfield Asset Management that it had concluded its investigation and would not be bringing charges over alleged bribery in Brazil.[48]
Brookfield Property Partners launched[edit]
In 2012, the company announced plans to spin off its global property holdings to shareholders in Brookfield Asset Management by distributing units in a new entity, Brookfield Property Partners.[49]

In June 2013, a Brookfield private equity fund acquired two Canadian refrigeration facilities, in Toronto and Calgary, from Millard Refrigerated Services, launching a new national company, Brookfield Cold Storage.[52]
Longview Timber and Longview Fibre sales[edit]
In June 2013, Brookfield also announced two separate transactions totaling $3.65 billion that saw the sale of its Longview Timber unit to Weyerhauser for $2.65 billion, and the sale of Longview Fibre Paper and Packaging to Kapstone Paper and packaging for $1 billion. Brookfield purchased the companies in 2007 with $1 billion of equity.[53] In commenting on the transaction, Kapstone chairman and CEO Roger Stone said: "The Longview team orchestrated a transformation that is truly, in my experience, the most amazing that I've actually ever seen in my 55 years in the industry."[54]
Carson Block mentions Brookfield in article[edit]
In July, 2013, the New York Times ran an article by short seller Carson Block of Muddy Waters LCC that cited Brookfield as one of a number of companies that had miscalculated the risks of investing in Brazil.[55]

History[edit]
1899-1979[edit]
In 1899 the São Paulo Railway, Light and Power Company was founded by William Mackenzie, Frederick Stark Pearson and others. (The word "Railway" would later be changed to "Tramway.")
In 1904 the Rio de Janeiro Tramway, Light and Power Company was founded by Mackenzie's group.[23]
In 1912 Brazilian Traction, Light and Power Company Limited was incorporated in Toronto as a public company to develop hydro-electric power operations and other utility services in Brazil, becoming a holding company for the two previous companies.[24]
In 1916 Great Lakes Power Company Limited was incorporated to provide hydro-electric power in Sault Ste. Marie and the Algoma District in Ontario.[25]
In 1966 Brazilian Traction, Light and Power Company Limited changed its name to Brazilian Light and Power Company Limited.
In 1969 Brazilian Light and Power Company Limited changes its name to Brascan Limited (BL)[24]
In 1979 the company's Brazilian assets were transferred to Brazilian ownership (e.g., Eletropaulo and Light S.A. - now AES Eletropaulo), the company meanwhile having diversified to other areas.[24]
2005-2009[edit]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
In 2005, the company changed its name to Brookfield Asset Management (BAM). As part of a number of purchases in 2007, Brookfield acquired Multiplex Group construction company for $6.1 billion and renamed it Brookfield Multiplex. In 2016 the company was re-branded as Multiplex.[26] It also acquired Longview Fibre Company, expanding its timberland platform to 2.5 million acres (10,000 km²). In 2008, Brookfield Infrastructure Partners was spun out of the holding company, and subsequently merged with Australia's Prime Infrastructure in a $1 billion transaction.
Birch Mountain class action[edit]
The Birch Mountain class action lawsuit has consistently been dismissed, with judges finding in favour of Brookfield and against the plaintiffs. In a process supervised by the Alberta courts, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) was appointed receiver of Birch Mountain Resources in November 2008 after Birch Mountain had defaulted on its debts. Birch Mountain’s assets were transferred to Tricap Partners Ltd, now operating under the Hammerstone Corporation, a subsidiary of Brookfield Special Situations Group, for approximately $50 million. [27]
A group called Birch Mountain Shareholders for Justice filed a lawsuit against Brookfield Asset Management on September 22, 2010 with the Superior Court of Justice in Ontario, Canada. The lawsuit challenged the acquisition and transfer of assets from a public company, Birch Mountain Resources, to the Hammerstone Corporation.[28]
The case was dismissed in its entirety, after the judge ruled it had no legal merit in April, 2015.[29] On May 25, 2015, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal in the case, in McDonald v. Brookfield Asset Management Inc. in the Court of Appeal Alberta.[30] The appeal was heard on June 15, 2016[31] over the Hammerstone Project MegaQuarry in Alberta. On Dec. 5, 2016, the Court of Appeal of Alberta again dismissed the case, ruling that the appeal was without merit.[32]
2010-2012[edit]
Launch of Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners[edit]
In 2010, Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners was launched as an exchange-listed global renewable power company, with a portfolio of hydroelectric and wind power plants in Canada, the United States and Brazil.[33]
General Growth Properties[edit]
Also in 2010, Brookfield led a successful restructuring of General Growth Properties, the second largest owner of U.S. shopping malls, out of bankruptcy after rebuffing Simon Property Group's attempt to acquire GGP.[20] In 2011, the company increased its share of General Growth Properties to 38%.[34] By 2012, Brookfield's stake in GGP grew to 42% which prompted investor activist William Ackman to request that GGP create a special committee unaffiliated with Brookfield to consider a sale to Simon.[35] On Dec. 31, 2012, Pershing Square agreed to sell a portfolio of its stake in GGP to Brookfield and struck a four-year agreement to be a passive investor in the shopping mall company.[36] By May, 2014 Pershing Square had sold all of its shares in GGP.[37]
Kerzner lawsuit[edit]
In January 2012, two hedge fund creditors, Trilogy Portfolio Co. and Canyon Value Realization Fund LP, in a loan with Brookfield, filed a lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court in Wilmington asking that the court restrain Brookfield's attempt to acquire the Kerzner International properties from closing.[38][39] In the lawsuit, the hedge funds alleged that Brookfield engaged in "brazen self-dealing" and collusion with junior lender PCCP and servicer Wells Fargo to complete the deal in violation of the loan agreement.[40] The court granted a temporary injunction pending a hearing. Brookfield consequently cancelled its offer to acquire the property.[41] Brookfield walked away after a Delaware judge issued the injunction.[40] The two hedge funds subsequently agreed to a restructuring that allowed Brookfield to acquire the One&Only Ocean Club in the Bahamas, Atlantis Paradise Island Resort in the Bahamas, and the One&Only Palmilla Resort in Mexico.[42][43] Brookfield subsequently sold the One & Only Ocean Club to Access Industries for $140 million.[44]
São Paulo, Brazil[edit]
In 2012, Brazilian authorities announced that they were investigating allegations that an executive at Brookfield bribed São Paulo building officials to secure permits required for renovating three shopping malls.[45] The allegations were made by Daniela Gonzalez, the former chief financial officer of a Brookfield subsidiary in Brazil, who was fired by Brookfield in 2010.[46] The alleged bribes reportedly totaled $789,851. Silvio Antonio Marques, a São Paulo state prosecutor confirmed the civil and criminal investigations to the Wall Street Journal and added that the reporting individual also provided documentation of the misconduct by Brookfield employees. A former Brookfield employee, who is being sued by Brookfield for embezzlement and is being investigated by Brazilian authorities, reported the alleged bribes to both the authorities in Brazil and to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.[46] Brazilian authorities say they are questioning a company controlled by Brookfield Asset Management as part of an investigation into allegations that São Paulo officials engaged in extortion. In the continuing SEC inquiry, the agency has been looking into allegations made by a former Brookfield executive, who says she was ordered to bribe city officials to obtain permits required for shopping malls and says she was fired for refusing to do so.[47] In June, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission informed Brookfield Asset Management that it had concluded its investigation and would not be bringing charges over alleged bribery in Brazil.[48]
Brookfield Property Partners launched[edit]
In 2012, the company announced plans to spin off its global property holdings to shareholders in Brookfield Asset Management by distributing units in a new entity, Brookfield Property Partners.[49]

Brookfield purchased the companies in 2007 with $1 billion of equity.[53] In commenting on the transaction, Kapstone chairman and CEO Roger Stone said: "The Longview team orchestrated a transformation that is truly, in my experience, the most amazing that I've actually ever seen in my 55 years in the industry."[54]
Carson Block mentions Brookfield in article[edit]
In July, 2013, the New York Times ran an article by short seller Carson Block of Muddy Waters LCC that cited Brookfield as one of a number of companies that had miscalculated the risks of investing in Brazil.[55]

Brookfield Asset Management Reports 2016 Results

BROOKFIELD, NEWS--(Marketwired - Feb. 9, 2017) - Brookfield Asset Management Inc. (NYSE:BAM)(TSX:BAM.A)(EURONEXT AMSTERDAM:BAMA), a leading global alternative asset manager, today announced financial results for the year ended December 31, 2016. 
Bruce Flatt, CEO of Brookfield, stated, "We had a strong year in 2016 across our businesses. We closed $30 billion of private funds, including what are among the largest infrastructure and real estate funds globally. We also deployed nearly $20 billion of capital on behalf of our investors in several high-quality assets, including a major pipeline system in Brazil, a premier mixed-use complex in South Korea, and the tower assets of a leading cellular carrier in India, among others."

See Basis of Presentation on page 3 

Net income for 2016 totalled $3.3 billion or $1.55 per Brookfield share, compared to $4.7 billion or $2.26 per Brookfield share in the prior year. Funds from operations ("FFO") increased by 26% due to strong growth in asset management revenues and carried interests, although fair value changes declined relative to the prior year which led to an overall reduction in net income. Refer to page 10 of this release for a reconciliation of net income to FFO.
The increase in FFO includes a 64% increase from our asset management business, which is a result of the continued growth in our fee bearing capital, including capital raised in our private funds and the increased capitalization of our listed issuers. We also recorded carried interests relating to the monetization of investments in our private funds. Operating FFO from invested capital increased by 22% as a result of the contribution from acquisitions and operational improvements throughout our businesses, including the commencement of leases and commissioning of development projects. Current year FFO also included realized disposition gains of $923 million, compared to $842 million in the prior year, as we continued to monetize assets as part of our ongoing capital recycling program. 
Appraisal gains within our property portfolio totalled $1.0 billion in 2016, compared to gains of $2.3 billion in the prior year. Most of the current year gains occurred in our opportunistic property portfolios and were a result of increasing cash flows while appraisal gains in our core office portfolios were flat overall. Fair value changes also included the impact of lower values for certain investments that are determined by stock market prices. As a result, consolidated fair value changes were essentially flat in 2016.
Dividend Declaration
The Board declared a quarterly dividend of US$0.14 per share (representing US$0.56 per annum), payable on March 31, 2017 to shareholders of record as at the close of business on February 28, 2017. This represents an 8% increase over the prior year. The Board also declared all of the regular monthly and quarterly dividends on its preferred shares.
Operating Highlights
Fundraising of $30 billion in private funds has driven significant growth in our fee base and scale of our asset management business.
Fee bearing capital increased by 16% to $110 billion during 2016, driven largely by an increase of 44% in private funds. During the year we closed our latest series of our flagship fund strategies in real estate, infrastructure and private equity, as well as credit strategies and our first open-ended core real estate fund, which held its first close of $1 billion in the fourth quarter. These results demonstrate strong demand from clients for existing products and new offerings that we are actively pursuing.
As a result, our annualized fee revenues increased by 26% to $1.2 billion from capital that is primarily very long-term or perpetual in nature and are backed by long-term contracted fee arrangements. In addition, carry eligible capital expanded by 62%, increasing our annualized target carried interest to $865 million compared to $560 million at the end of 2015. This represents a significant increase in the earning potential of our asset management franchise.
We made solid progress in capital deployment, investing or committing $18 billion, putting capital to work for our clients and progressing towards the next series of funds.
We continue to invest significant amounts of capital into new investments, diversified by both asset class and geography. Our latest flagship real estate opportunity fund, BSREP II, is now approximately 75% invested. Our most recent flagship funds in infrastructure (BIF III) and private equity (BCP IV), closed earlier this year, and are both advancing well at approximately 35% and 50% invested or committed, respectively.
Our property group agreed to buy a 4.2 million square foot office portfolio in Mumbai, a mixed-use office, retail and hospitality complex in South Korea, and completed the acquisition of a prime mixed-use estate in the centre of Berlin. We also completed the privatization of our U.S. regional mall business, and continued to build out our hospitality, self-storage, and student housing operations with strategic add-on acquisitions.
Our renewable power business completed the acquisition of Isagen, which is a premier 3,000 megawatt Colombian hydroelectric portfolio, as well as other hydro assets in North America and Brazil. We continued to advance our development pipeline, including wind projects in Europe and hydroelectric projects in Brazil. Over the last year, we acquired, with our partners, a 34% interest in the public float of TerraForm Power, as its sponsor SunEdison filed for bankruptcy protection. TerraForm Power and its sister company TerraForm Global collectively own and operate 4,000 megawatts of solar and wind assets. We are working to acquire the companies under an exclusivity arrangement, which, if successful, will position them as a growing, viable business.
Our infrastructure group made first investments in India and Peru, building out our global toll road business. We also recently reached an agreement to acquire the tower assets of a leading cellular carrier in India. In Brazil, we made a commitment to acquire a high-quality natural gas transmission system and secured a number of electricity transmission projects. We also closed the previously announced acquisitions of an Australian ports business and a North American gas storage business. 
Our private equity operations announced the acquisition of a 70% stake in Brazil's largest private water distribution, collection and treatment business. This positions us well to invest in a growing share of the water and sewage improvements planned in Brazil over the next two decades. Subsequent to year end, we agreed to acquire an approximate 85% controlling stake in Greenergy Fuels Holdings Ltd., a leading provider of road fuels in the UK, expanding our footprint in the European market.
We further focused our business and simplified our structure, providing improved transparency for investors.
In June, we spun off Brookfield Business Partners, our fourth listed partnership. This completes the process of separating our operating businesses into four distinct business groups, each with private and public funding entities, furthering our asset management strategy. Following this spin-off, approximately 85% of our invested capital is now in listed assets. These listed partnerships provide us with perpetual capital as well as providing additional investment options and increased transparency for investors.
Brookfield Property Partners ("BPY") recently made a proposal to Brookfield Canada Office Properties ("BOX") to acquire the remaining equity interest in BOX not owned by it or its affiliates. Acquiring full ownership of BOX will allow BPY to fully integrate its North American office operations and further simplifies our structure.
Finally, we have been able to take advantage of the historically low interest rate environment over the last couple of years, including raising proceeds from asset sales and refinanced a significant portion of our debt.
We continued to recycle capital by selling mature assets and redeploying it for higher returns in our opportunistic funds. Sales have been in sectors and geographies where we felt we could achieve attractive valuations and either redeploy that capital or return it to investors. In total we realized proceeds of approximately $6 billion in the last two years, including $3.5 billion in 2016, predominately from core office assets, where capitalization rates were favourable, as well as assets in our retail and hotel, utility and renewable power business. In January, our private equity group entered into an agreement to sell one of the remaining businesses in one of our early private equity funds for a sizable gain, which also resulted in the realization of accumulated carried interest in this fund.
During this time, we also completed a significant number of financings throughout our operating businesses and listed entities at attractive rates. We completed more than $35 billion of financings over the last two years, including over $20 billion in 2016, locking in low rates and extending overall term to an average of seven years on a proportionate basis. Although rates have risen over the past months, we continue to view these to be at attractive levels and therefore intend to continue to execute on refinancing opportunities throughout our business.
As a result of the foregoing, as well as our fundraising activities, we finished the year with substantial financial resources with which to pursue future transactions. Dry powder in our private funds at the end of the quarter was $20 billion. In addition to this we have core liquidity of over $9 billion, of which $3 billion is at the corporate level with the balance within our listed partnerships.
Trisura Group
For the past 10 years, we have owned a property and casualty insurance business called Trisura Guarantee Insurance Company ("Trisura Guarantee"), which has consistently and profitably grown its operations. This business is no longer strategic to Brookfield as we focus on our asset management operations, and we believe Trisura Guarantee could benefit from being a standalone company with direct access to the capital markets. We are planning to combine Trisura Guarantee with the rest of our small specialty insurance operations and spin them off by way of a special dividend to holders of Brookfield's Class A and B Limited Voting Shares. The dividend, estimated to be worth US$0.10 per Brookfield share, or approximately US$100 million, will take the form of common shares of Trisura Group Ltd., an Ontario corporation, and should occur in the first half of 2017, subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals.
Basis of Presentation
This news release and accompanying financial statements are based on International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS"), as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB"), unless otherwise noted.
We also make reference to Funds From Operations ("FFO"). We define FFO as net income attributable to shareholders prior to fair value changes, depreciation and amortization, and deferred income taxes, and include realized disposition gains that are not recorded in net income as determined under IFRS. FFO also includes the company's share of equity accounted investments' FFO on a fully diluted basis. FFO consists of the following components:

FFO from Operating Activities represents the company's share of revenues less direct costs and interest expenses; excludes realized carried interest and disposition gains, fair value changes, depreciation and amortization and deferred income taxes; and includes our proportionate share of FFO from operating activities recorded by equity accounted investments on a fully diluted basis. We present this measure as we believe it assists in describing our results and variances within FFO. 


Realized Carried Interest represents our contractual share of investment gains generated within a private fund after considering our clients minimum return requirements. Realized carried interest is determined on third-party capital that is no longer subject to future investment performance. 


Realized Disposition Gains are included in FFO because we consider the purchase and sale of assets to be a normal part of the company's business. Realized disposition gains include gains and losses recorded in net income and equity in the current period, and are adjusted to include fair value changes and revaluation surplus balances recorded in prior periods which were not included in prior period FFO. 

We use FFO to assess our operating results and the value of Brookfield's business and believe that many shareholders and analysts also find this measure of value to them.
We note that FFO, its components, and its per share equivalent are non-IFRS measures which do not have any standard meaning prescribed by IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.
We provide additional information on the determination of FFO and reconciliation between FFO and net income attributable to Brookfield shareholders in our quarterly Supplemental Information and filings available at www.brookfield.com.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Assets[edit]
The company's asset management offerings for institutional investors are focused on real assets, but also include alternative-type investments, structured financial products, traditional fixed income and equities and finite-risk reinsurance.[9] In addition, Brookfield Asset Management owns a significant stake in a real estate services company offering home relocations, property appraisals, move-in services and home transaction closing services, and capital market services, including financial advisory, securities underwriting, and property brokerage.[10] Brookfield Asset Management invests through public, listed companies and through private funds. The company's institutional clients mainly include governments, sovereign wealth funds, pension plans, institutions, corporations and high-net-worth individuals.[11][12]

Brookfield's renewable power assets include hydroelectric power plants and wind power assets.[17]
Brookfield’s private equity business focuses on real assets through owning and operating in the business services, industrial operations and residential development services industries.[18]
Management[edit]
J. Bruce Flatt is senior managing partner and chief executive officer. Mr. Flatt was appointed to this position in February 2002 after having served as chief executive officer of Brookfield Properties since 2000.[19][20] He was trained as an accountant at Clarkson, Gordon and Company, which is now part of Ernst & Young.[21] As of fiscal year 2014, his basic compensation was $6.65 million.[22]

History[edit]
1899-1979[edit]
In 1899 the São Paulo Railway, Light and Power Company was founded by William Mackenzie, Frederick Stark Pearson and others. (The word "Railway" would later be changed to "Tramway.")
In 1904 the Rio de Janeiro Tramway, Light and Power Company was founded by Mackenzie's group.[23]
In 1912 Brazilian Traction, Light and Power Company Limited was incorporated in Toronto as a public company to develop hydro-electric power operations and other utility services in Brazil, becoming a holding company for the two previous companies.[24]
In 1916 Great Lakes Power Company Limited was incorporated to provide hydro-electric power in Sault Ste. Marie and the Algoma District in Ontario.[25]
In 1966 Brazilian Traction, Light and Power Company Limited changed its name to Brazilian Light and Power Company Limited.
In 1969 Brazilian Light and Power Company Limited changes its name to Brascan Limited (BL)[24]
In 1979 the company's Brazilian assets were transferred to Brazilian ownership (e.g., Eletropaulo and Light S.A. - now AES Eletropaulo), the company meanwhile having diversified to other areas.[24]
2005-2009[edit]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
In 2005, the company changed its name to Brookfield Asset Management (BAM). As part of a number of purchases in 2007, Brookfield acquired Multiplex Group construction company for $6.1 billion and renamed it Brookfield Multiplex. In 2016 the company was re-branded as Multiplex.[26] It also acquired Longview Fibre Company, expanding its timberland platform to 2.5 million acres (10,000 km²). In 2008, Brookfield Infrastructure Partners was spun out of the holding company, and subsequently merged with Australia's Prime Infrastructure in a $1 billion transaction.
Birch Mountain class action[edit]
The Birch Mountain class action lawsuit has consistently been dismissed, with judges finding in favour of Brookfield and against the plaintiffs. In a process supervised by the Alberta courts, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) was appointed receiver of Birch Mountain Resources in November 2008 after Birch Mountain had defaulted on its debts. Birch Mountain’s assets were transferred to Tricap Partners Ltd, now operating under the Hammerstone Corporation, a subsidiary of Brookfield Special Situations Group, for approximately $50 million. [27]
A group called Birch Mountain Shareholders for Justice filed a lawsuit against Brookfield Asset Management on September 22, 2010 with the Superior Court of Justice in Ontario, Canada. The lawsuit challenged the acquisition and transfer of assets from a public company, Birch Mountain Resources, to the Hammerstone Corporation.[28]
The case was dismissed in its entirety, after the judge ruled it had no legal merit in April, 2015.[29] On May 25, 2015, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal in the case, in McDonald v. Brookfield Asset Management Inc. in the Court of Appeal Alberta.[30] The appeal was heard on June 15, 2016[31] over the Hammerstone Project MegaQuarry in Alberta. On Dec. 5, 2016, the Court of Appeal of Alberta again dismissed the case, ruling that the appeal was without merit.[32]
2010-2012[edit]
Launch of Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners[edit]
In 2010, Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners was launched as an exchange-listed global renewable power company, with a portfolio of hydroelectric and wind power plants in Canada, the United States and Brazil.[33]
General Growth Properties[edit]
Also in 2010, Brookfield led a successful restructuring of General Growth Properties, the second largest owner of U.S. shopping malls, out of bankruptcy after rebuffing Simon Property Group's attempt to acquire GGP.[20] In 2011, the company increased its share of General Growth Properties to 38%.[34] By 2012, Brookfield's stake in GGP grew to 42% which prompted investor activist William Ackman to request that GGP create a special committee unaffiliated with Brookfield to consider a sale to Simon.[35] On Dec. 31, 2012, Pershing Square agreed to sell a portfolio of its stake in GGP to Brookfield and struck a four-year agreement to be a passive investor in the shopping mall company.[36] By May, 2014 Pershing Square had sold all of its shares in GGP.[37]
Kerzner lawsuit[edit]
In January 2012, two hedge fund creditors, Trilogy Portfolio Co. and Canyon Value Realization Fund LP, in a loan with Brookfield, filed a lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court in Wilmington asking that the court restrain Brookfield's attempt to acquire the Kerzner International properties from closing.[38][39] In the lawsuit, the hedge funds alleged that Brookfield engaged in "brazen self-dealing" and collusion with junior lender PCCP and servicer Wells Fargo to complete the deal in violation of the loan agreement.[40] The court granted a temporary injunction pending a hearing. Brookfield consequently cancelled its offer to acquire the property.[41] Brookfield walked away after a Delaware judge issued the injunction.[40] The two hedge funds subsequently agreed to a restructuring that allowed Brookfield to acquire the One&Only Ocean Club in the Bahamas, Atlantis Paradise Island Resort in the Bahamas, and the One&Only Palmilla Resort in Mexico.[42][43] Brookfield subsequently sold the One & Only Ocean Club to Access Industries for $140 million.[44]
São Paulo, Brazil[edit]
In 2012, Brazilian authorities announced that they were investigating allegations that an executive at Brookfield bribed São Paulo building officials to secure permits required for renovating three shopping malls.[45] The allegations were made by Daniela Gonzalez, the former chief financial officer of a Brookfield subsidiary in Brazil, who was fired by Brookfield in 2010.[46] The alleged bribes reportedly totaled $789,851. Silvio Antonio Marques, a São Paulo state prosecutor confirmed the civil and criminal investigations to the Wall Street Journal and added that the reporting individual also provided documentation of the misconduct by Brookfield employees. A former Brookfield employee, who is being sued by Brookfield for embezzlement and is being investigated by Brazilian authorities, reported the alleged bribes to both the authorities in Brazil and to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.[46] Brazilian authorities say they are questioning a company controlled by Brookfield Asset Management as part of an investigation into allegations that São Paulo officials engaged in extortion. In the continuing SEC inquiry, the agency has been looking into allegations made by a former Brookfield executive, who says she was ordered to bribe city officials to obtain permits required for shopping malls and says she was fired for refusing to do so.[47] In June, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission informed Brookfield Asset Management that it had concluded its investigation and would not be bringing charges over alleged bribery in Brazil.[48]
Brookfield Property Partners launched[edit]
In 2012, the company announced plans to spin off its global property holdings to shareholders in Brookfield Asset Management by distributing units in a new entity, Brookfield Property Partners.[49]

In June 2013, Brookfield also announced two separate transactions totaling $3.65 billion that saw the sale of its Longview Timber unit to Weyerhauser for $2.65 billion, and the sale of Longview Fibre Paper and Packaging to Kapstone Paper and packaging for $1 billion. Brookfield purchased the companies in 2007 with $1 billion of equity.[53] In commenting on the transaction, Kapstone chairman and CEO Roger Stone said: "The Longview team orchestrated a transformation that is truly, in my experience, the most amazing that I've actually ever seen in my 55 years in the industry."[54]
Carson Block mentions Brookfield in article[edit]
In July, 2013, the New York Times ran an article by short seller Carson Block of Muddy Waters LCC that cited Brookfield as one of a number of companies that had miscalculated the risks of investing in Brazil.[55]

Ltd.[6] Over the next century, the company expanded and is now an investor in and operator of approximately $220 billion of real assets, with 70,000 employees in over 100 offices in 30 different countries.[7] Its major public subsidiaries include Brookfield Infrastructure Partners, Brookfield Renewable Partners, Brookfield Property Partners, and Brookfield Business Partners.[8]

Assets[edit]
The company's asset management offerings for institutional investors are focused on real assets, but also include alternative-type investments, structured financial products, traditional fixed income and equities and finite-risk reinsurance.[9] In addition, Brookfield Asset Management owns a significant stake in a real estate services company offering home relocations, property appraisals, move-in services and home transaction closing services, and capital market services, including financial advisory, securities underwriting, and property brokerage.[10] Brookfield Asset Management invests through public, listed companies and through private funds. The company's institutional clients mainly include governments, sovereign wealth funds, pension plans, institutions, corporations and high-net-worth individuals.[11][12]
Brookfield has $23 billion of assets under management in Canada, $138 billion invested in the United States, $19 billion invested in Asia Pacific, $20 billion in South America and $32 billion in the UK, Western Europe and the Middle East.[7] Its major real estate investments include Brookfield Place (formerly known as the World Financial Center) in New York, Brookfield Place in Toronto, Canary Wharf in London (owned with Qatar's Sovereign Wealth Fund), Potsdamer Platz in Berlin, the Bank of America Plaza in Los Angeles, Bankers Hall in Calgary,[13] Darling Park in Sydney, and Brookfield Place in Perth.[14][15]
Brookfield's infrastructure assets include utilities: electric and gas distribution; transport: railway and coal terminals and ports; energy transmission and communications infrastructure. [16]
Brookfield's renewable power assets include hydroelectric power plants and wind power assets.[17]
Brookfield’s private equity business focuses on real assets through owning and operating in the business services, industrial operations and residential development services industries.[18]
Management[edit]
J. Bruce Flatt is senior managing partner and chief executive officer. Mr. Flatt was appointed to this position in February 2002 after having served as chief executive officer of Brookfield Properties since 2000.[19][20] He was trained as an accountant at Clarkson, Gordon and Company, which is now part of Ernst & Young.[21] As of fiscal year 2014, his basic compensation was $6.65 million.[22]
Mr. Flatt is senior managing partner and chief executive officer of the corporation, and on behalf of the corporation is the chairman and a director of GGP. Mr. Flatt previously served as a board member to Fraser Papers and Norbord Incorporated.[22] Mr. Flatt holds a business degree from the University of Manitoba.[21]
History[edit]
1899-1979[edit]
In 1899 the São Paulo Railway, Light and Power Company was founded by William Mackenzie, Frederick Stark Pearson and others. (The word "Railway" would later be changed to "Tramway.")
In 1904 the Rio de Janeiro Tramway, Light and Power Company was founded by Mackenzie's group.[23]
In 1912 Brazilian Traction, Light and Power Company Limited was incorporated in Toronto as a public company to develop hydro-electric power operations and other utility services in Brazil, becoming a holding company for the two previous companies.[24]
In 1916 Great Lakes Power Company Limited was incorporated to provide hydro-electric power in Sault Ste. Marie and the Algoma District in Ontario.[25]
In 1966 Brazilian Traction, Light and Power Company Limited changed its name to Brazilian Light and Power Company Limited.
In 1969 Brazilian Light and Power Company Limited changes its name to Brascan Limited (BL)[24]
In 1979 the company's Brazilian assets were transferred to Brazilian ownership (e.g., Eletropaulo and Light S.A. - now AES Eletropaulo), the company meanwhile having diversified to other areas.[24]
2005-2009[edit]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
In 2005, the company changed its name to Brookfield Asset Management (BAM). As part of a number of purchases in 2007, Brookfield acquired Multiplex Group construction company for $6.1 billion and renamed it Brookfield Multiplex. In 2016 the company was re-branded as Multiplex.[26] It also acquired Longview Fibre Company, expanding its timberland platform to 2.5 million acres (10,000 km²). In 2008, Brookfield Infrastructure Partners was spun out of the holding company, and subsequently merged with Australia's Prime Infrastructure in a $1 billion transaction.
Birch Mountain class action[edit]
The Birch Mountain class action lawsuit has consistently been dismissed, with judges finding in favour of Brookfield and against the plaintiffs. In a process supervised by the Alberta courts, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) was appointed receiver of Birch Mountain Resources in November 2008 after Birch Mountain had defaulted on its debts. Birch Mountain’s assets were transferred to Tricap Partners Ltd, now operating under the Hammerstone Corporation, a subsidiary of Brookfield Special Situations Group, for approximately $50 million. [27]
A group called Birch Mountain Shareholders for Justice filed a lawsuit against Brookfield Asset Management on September 22, 2010 with the Superior Court of Justice in Ontario, Canada. The lawsuit challenged the acquisition and transfer of assets from a public company, Birch Mountain Resources, to the Hammerstone Corporation.[28]
The case was dismissed in its entirety, after the judge ruled it had no legal merit in April, 2015.[29] On May 25, 2015, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal in the case, in McDonald v. Brookfield Asset Management Inc. in the Court of Appeal Alberta.[30] The appeal was heard on June 15, 2016[31] over the Hammerstone Project MegaQuarry in Alberta. On Dec. 5, 2016, the Court of Appeal of Alberta again dismissed the case, ruling that the appeal was without merit.[32]
2010-2012[edit]
Launch of Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners[edit]
In 2010, Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners was launched as an exchange-listed global renewable power company, with a portfolio of hydroelectric and wind power plants in Canada, the United States and Brazil.[33]
General Growth Properties[edit]
Also in 2010, Brookfield led a successful restructuring of General Growth Properties, the second largest owner of U.S. shopping malls, out of bankruptcy after rebuffing Simon Property Group's attempt to acquire GGP.[20] In 2011, the company increased its share of General Growth Properties to 38%.[34] By 2012, Brookfield's stake in GGP grew to 42% which prompted investor activist William Ackman to request that GGP create a special committee unaffiliated with Brookfield to consider a sale to Simon.[35] On Dec. 31, 2012, Pershing Square agreed to sell a portfolio of its stake in GGP to Brookfield and struck a four-year agreement to be a passive investor in the shopping mall company.[36] By May, 2014 Pershing Square had sold all of its shares in GGP.[37]
Kerzner lawsuit[edit]
In January 2012, two hedge fund creditors, Trilogy Portfolio Co. and Canyon Value Realization Fund LP, in a loan with Brookfield, filed a lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court in Wilmington asking that the court restrain Brookfield's attempt to acquire the Kerzner International properties from closing.[38][39] In the lawsuit, the hedge funds alleged that Brookfield engaged in "brazen self-dealing" and collusion with junior lender PCCP and servicer Wells Fargo to complete the deal in violation of the loan agreement.[40] The court granted a temporary injunction pending a hearing. Brookfield consequently cancelled its offer to acquire the property.[41] Brookfield walked away after a Delaware judge issued the injunction.[40] The two hedge funds subsequently agreed to a restructuring that allowed Brookfield to acquire the One&Only Ocean Club in the Bahamas, Atlantis Paradise Island Resort in the Bahamas, and the One&Only Palmilla Resort in Mexico.[42][43] Brookfield subsequently sold the One & Only Ocean Club to Access Industries for $140 million.[44]
São Paulo, Brazil[edit]
In 2012, Brazilian authorities announced that they were investigating allegations that an executive at Brookfield bribed São Paulo building officials to secure permits required for renovating three shopping malls.[45] The allegations were made by Daniela Gonzalez, the former chief financial officer of a Brookfield subsidiary in Brazil, who was fired by Brookfield in 2010.[46] The alleged bribes reportedly totaled $789,851. Silvio Antonio Marques, a São Paulo state prosecutor confirmed the civil and criminal investigations to the Wall Street Journal and added that the reporting individual also provided documentation of the misconduct by Brookfield employees. A former Brookfield employee, who is being sued by Brookfield for embezzlement and is being investigated by Brazilian authorities, reported the alleged bribes to both the authorities in Brazil and to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.[46] Brazilian authorities say they are questioning a company controlled by Brookfield Asset Management as part of an investigation into allegations that São Paulo officials engaged in extortion. In the continuing SEC inquiry, the agency has been looking into allegations made by a former Brookfield executive, who says she was ordered to bribe city officials to obtain permits required for shopping malls and says she was fired for refusing to do so.[47] In June, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission informed Brookfield Asset Management that it had concluded its investigation and would not be bringing charges over alleged bribery in Brazil.[48]
Brookfield Property Partners launched[edit]
In 2012, the company announced plans to spin off its global property holdings to shareholders in Brookfield Asset Management by distributing units in a new entity, Brookfield Property Partners.[49]
City of London acquisition[edit]
In June 2012, Brookfield Office Properties announced plans to acquire a portfolio of three office buildings and a development site in the City of London for $829 million from Hammerson Inc., a British real estate company focused on retail developments.
Investments in Brazil, Chile and Maine[edit]
In July 2012, Brookfield and Spanish toll road operator Abertis announced plans to acquire a toll road network in Brazil. At the same time, Brookfield acquired full control of toll road assets in Chile. In December, 2012, Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners agreed to acquire a portfolio of 19 hydroelectric power stations in Maine from Nextera Energy Resources LLC for $760 million.[50]
2013[edit]
MPG Office Trust Inc.[edit]
On April 26, 2013, Brookfield Office Properties made an offer for MPG Office Trust Inc. and announced plans to create a new $1.15 billion fund that would hold seven MPG and Brookfield office buildings in Los Angeles.[51]
Brookfield Cold Storage launched[edit]
In June 2013, a Brookfield private equity fund acquired two Canadian refrigeration facilities, in Toronto and Calgary, from Millard Refrigerated Services, launching a new national company, Brookfield Cold Storage.[52]
Longview Timber and Longview Fibre sales[edit]
In June 2013, Brookfield also announced two separate transactions totaling $3.65 billion that saw the sale of its Longview Timber unit to Weyerhauser for $2.65 billion, and the sale of Longview Fibre Paper and Packaging to Kapstone Paper and packaging for $1 billion. Brookfield purchased the companies in 2007 with $1 billion of equity.[53] In commenting on the transaction, Kapstone chairman and CEO Roger Stone said: "The Longview team orchestrated a transformation that is truly, in my experience, the most amazing that I've actually ever seen in my 55 years in the industry."[54]
Carson Block mentions Brookfield in article[edit]
In July, 2013, the New York Times ran an article by short seller Carson Block of Muddy Waters LCC that cited Brookfield as one of a number of companies that had miscalculated the risks of investing in Brazil.[55]

In early 2016, Brookfield announced that it partnered with Korea Investment Corp. to purchase a major chunk of Potsdamer Platz in Berlin, acquiring a total of 17 buildings.

Assets[edit]
The company's asset management offerings for institutional investors are focused on real assets, but also include alternative-type investments, structured financial products, traditional fixed income and equities and finite-risk reinsurance.[9] In addition, Brookfield Asset Management owns a significant stake in a real estate services company offering home relocations, property appraisals, move-in services and home transaction closing services, and capital market services, including financial advisory, securities underwriting, and property brokerage.[10] Brookfield Asset Management invests through public, listed companies and through private funds. The company's institutional clients mainly include governments, sovereign wealth funds, pension plans, institutions, corporations and high-net-worth individuals.[11][12]
Brookfield has $23 billion of assets under management in Canada, $138 billion invested in the United States, $19 billion invested in Asia Pacific, $20 billion in South America and $32 billion in the UK, Western Europe and the Middle East.[7] Its major real estate investments include Brookfield Place (formerly known as the World Financial Center) in New York, Brookfield Place in Toronto, Canary Wharf in London (owned with Qatar's Sovereign Wealth Fund), Potsdamer Platz in Berlin, the Bank of America Plaza in Los Angeles, Bankers Hall in Calgary,[13] Darling Park in Sydney, and Brookfield Place in Perth.[14][15]
Brookfield's infrastructure assets include utilities: electric and gas distribution; transport: railway and coal terminals and ports; energy transmission and communications infrastructure. [16]
Brookfield's renewable power assets include hydroelectric power plants and wind power assets.[17]
Brookfield’s private equity business focuses on real assets through owning and operating in the business services, industrial operations and residential development services industries.[18]
Management[edit]
J. Bruce Flatt is senior managing partner and chief executive officer. Mr. Flatt was appointed to this position in February 2002 after having served as chief executive officer of Brookfield Properties since 2000.[19][20] He was trained as an accountant at Clarkson, Gordon and Company, which is now part of Ernst & Young.[21] As of fiscal year 2014, his basic compensation was $6.65 million.[22]

Mr. Flatt previously served as a board member to Fraser Papers and Norbord Incorporated.[22] Mr. Flatt holds a business degree from the University of Manitoba.[21]
History[edit]
1899-1979[edit]
In 1899 the São Paulo Railway, Light and Power Company was founded by William Mackenzie, Frederick Stark Pearson and others. (The word "Railway" would later be changed to "Tramway.")
In 1904 the Rio de Janeiro Tramway, Light and Power Company was founded by Mackenzie's group.[23]
In 1912 Brazilian Traction, Light and Power Company Limited was incorporated in Toronto as a public company to develop hydro-electric power operations and other utility services in Brazil, becoming a holding company for the two previous companies.[24]
In 1916 Great Lakes Power Company Limited was incorporated to provide hydro-electric power in Sault Ste. Marie and the Algoma District in Ontario.[25]
In 1966 Brazilian Traction, Light and Power Company Limited changed its name to Brazilian Light and Power Company Limited.
In 1969 Brazilian Light and Power Company Limited changes its name to Brascan Limited (BL)[24]
In 1979 the company's Brazilian assets were transferred to Brazilian ownership (e.g., Eletropaulo and Light S.A. - now AES Eletropaulo), the company meanwhile having diversified to other areas.[24]
2005-2009[edit]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
In 2005, the company changed its name to Brookfield Asset Management (BAM). As part of a number of purchases in 2007, Brookfield acquired Multiplex Group construction company for $6.1 billion and renamed it Brookfield Multiplex. In 2016 the company was re-branded as Multiplex.[26] It also acquired Longview Fibre Company, expanding its timberland platform to 2.5 million acres (10,000 km²). In 2008, Brookfield Infrastructure Partners was spun out of the holding company, and subsequently merged with Australia's Prime Infrastructure in a $1 billion transaction.
Birch Mountain class action[edit]
The Birch Mountain class action lawsuit has consistently been dismissed, with judges finding in favour of Brookfield and against the plaintiffs. In a process supervised by the Alberta courts, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) was appointed receiver of Birch Mountain Resources in November 2008 after Birch Mountain had defaulted on its debts. Birch Mountain’s assets were transferred to Tricap Partners Ltd, now operating under the Hammerstone Corporation, a subsidiary of Brookfield Special Situations Group, for approximately $50 million. [27]
A group called Birch Mountain Shareholders for Justice filed a lawsuit against Brookfield Asset Management on September 22, 2010 with the Superior Court of Justice in Ontario, Canada. The lawsuit challenged the acquisition and transfer of assets from a public company, Birch Mountain Resources, to the Hammerstone Corporation.[28]
The case was dismissed in its entirety, after the judge ruled it had no legal merit in April, 2015.[29] On May 25, 2015, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal in the case, in McDonald v. Brookfield Asset Management Inc. in the Court of Appeal Alberta.[30] The appeal was heard on June 15, 2016[31] over the Hammerstone Project MegaQuarry in Alberta. On Dec. 5, 2016, the Court of Appeal of Alberta again dismissed the case, ruling that the appeal was without merit.[32]
2010-2012[edit]
Launch of Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners[edit]
In 2010, Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners was launched as an exchange-listed global renewable power company, with a portfolio of hydroelectric and wind power plants in Canada, the United States and Brazil.[33]
General Growth Properties[edit]
Also in 2010, Brookfield led a successful restructuring of General Growth Properties, the second largest owner of U.S. shopping malls, out of bankruptcy after rebuffing Simon Property Group's attempt to acquire GGP.[20] In 2011, the company increased its share of General Growth Properties to 38%.[34] By 2012, Brookfield's stake in GGP grew to 42% which prompted investor activist William Ackman to request that GGP create a special committee unaffiliated with Brookfield to consider a sale to Simon.[35] On Dec. 31, 2012, Pershing Square agreed to sell a portfolio of its stake in GGP to Brookfield and struck a four-year agreement to be a passive investor in the shopping mall company.[36] By May, 2014 Pershing Square had sold all of its shares in GGP.[37]
Kerzner lawsuit[edit]
In January 2012, two hedge fund creditors, Trilogy Portfolio Co. and Canyon Value Realization Fund LP, in a loan with Brookfield, filed a lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court in Wilmington asking that the court restrain Brookfield's attempt to acquire the Kerzner International properties from closing.[38][39] In the lawsuit, the hedge funds alleged that Brookfield engaged in "brazen self-dealing" and collusion with junior lender PCCP and servicer Wells Fargo to complete the deal in violation of the loan agreement.[40] The court granted a temporary injunction pending a hearing. Brookfield consequently cancelled its offer to acquire the property.[41] Brookfield walked away after a Delaware judge issued the injunction.[40] The two hedge funds subsequently agreed to a restructuring that allowed Brookfield to acquire the One&Only Ocean Club in the Bahamas, Atlantis Paradise Island Resort in the Bahamas, and the One&Only Palmilla Resort in Mexico.[42][43] Brookfield subsequently sold the One & Only Ocean Club to Access Industries for $140 million.[44]
São Paulo, Brazil[edit]
In 2012, Brazilian authorities announced that they were investigating allegations that an executive at Brookfield bribed São Paulo building officials to secure permits required for renovating three shopping malls.[45] The allegations were made by Daniela Gonzalez, the former chief financial officer of a Brookfield subsidiary in Brazil, who was fired by Brookfield in 2010.[46] The alleged bribes reportedly totaled $789,851. Silvio Antonio Marques, a São Paulo state prosecutor confirmed the civil and criminal investigations to the Wall Street Journal and added that the reporting individual also provided documentation of the misconduct by Brookfield employees. A former Brookfield employee, who is being sued by Brookfield for embezzlement and is being investigated by Brazilian authorities, reported the alleged bribes to both the authorities in Brazil and to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.[46] Brazilian authorities say they are questioning a company controlled by Brookfield Asset Management as part of an investigation into allegations that São Paulo officials engaged in extortion. In the continuing SEC inquiry, the agency has been looking into allegations made by a former Brookfield executive, who says she was ordered to bribe city officials to obtain permits required for shopping malls and says she was fired for refusing to do so.[47] In June, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission informed Brookfield Asset Management that it had concluded its investigation and would not be bringing charges over alleged bribery in Brazil.[48]
Brookfield Property Partners launched[edit]
In 2012, the company announced plans to spin off its global property holdings to shareholders in Brookfield Asset Management by distributing units in a new entity, Brookfield Property Partners.[49]

In June 2013, Brookfield also announced two separate transactions totaling $3.65 billion that saw the sale of its Longview Timber unit to Weyerhauser for $2.65 billion, and the sale of Longview Fibre Paper and Packaging to Kapstone Paper and packaging for $1 billion. Brookfield purchased the companies in 2007 with $1 billion of equity.[53] In commenting on the transaction, Kapstone chairman and CEO Roger Stone said: "The Longview team orchestrated a transformation that is truly, in my experience, the most amazing that I've actually ever seen in my 55 years in the industry."[54]
Carson Block mentions Brookfield in article[edit]
In July, 2013, the New York Times ran an article by short seller Carson Block of Muddy Waters LCC that cited Brookfield as one of a number of companies that had miscalculated the risks of investing in Brazil.[55]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
