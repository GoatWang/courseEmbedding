Agriculture

For over a century, propane gas has been used as an alternative fuel source to heat homes and businesses, fuel transportation vehicles both domestically and commercially, and has played a big role in the agricultural industry. Propane takes up very little space when stored as a liquid in pressurized tanks, providing significant amounts of usable energy.


CROP DRYING



TOBACCO CURING



METERED DELIVERY



LARGE VOLUME


Naturally colorless and odorless, an odor is added as a safety measure against any seepage that may occur. Liquid Propane Gas (LPG) is often called the portable gas because it’s easy to store and when the liquid is released it instantly vaporizes into a gas to fuel everything from kitchen appliances to farm equipment.
Listed in the Clean Air Act of 1990, propane is considered a clean fuel. Propane gas leaves little ecological impact on the environment, and it is safe, abundant, and increasingly cost effective compared to other fuel types. It is utilized heavily within the agricultural industry for things such as crop drying, hog/poultry house and barn heating, tobacco curing. To keep America running, Diversified Energy offers metered transport deliveries so farms and agribusiness can continue to run their operations smoothly. 
Crop Drying
By using propane to dry their crops, not only are farmers wasting less and lowering their costs, they also may have more flexibility when harvest time comes. Propane powered crop dryers keep fungal and bacterial growth down ensuring more harvestable crops. Additionally, propane fueled crop dryers are portable and readily accessible, particularly when working with Diversified Energy’s delivery drivers who provide farmers with the fuel they need when they need it.
Hog/Poultry House and Barn Heating
Before propane, farmers often used oil-fueled furnaces to heat their hog and poultry barns and houses, but these types of heating elements would break down and not be reliable. The marketability of hogs and poultry depends on the livestock surviving the winter, especially if they are raised in a particularly cold climate, so propane has become the dominant fuel for heating swine/poultry houses and barns because of its reliability and better performance.
Tobacco Curing
Since the early 1970s, nearly all of the tobacco-curing barns have been equipped with propane. Though propane use is prevalent, tobacco producers are being asked to retrofit all flue-curing barns to indirect mixing by passing combustion gases to take place outside the barn with the heat passing through the system back into the barn and turning into hot water or steam. Because propane gas and air mix better during combustion than oil and air, this system renders the use of propane for tobacco-curing more efficient. 
Metered Transport Delivery
Commodity prices often fluctuate, challenging farmers and business owners. At Diversified Energy, we can you help manage the fluctuations by offering the option to buy propane gallons for future consumption at pre-determined price levels. 
Over 800,000 farms use propane for their agricultural needs such as irrigation pumps, dryers, generators, and any farm equipment that can be run on oil can be run using propane. The propane services offered by Diversified Energy keeps America running. 
For our larger volume customers, we offer discounted pricing on our propane services available in both our southern and northern regions. Whether you need propane gas delivery for your house and barn heating needs, incinerators, generators, dryers, or fuel for your farm vehicles, we have a delivery option for you. 
Our drivers and technicians are licensed and trained to assist you with the services we provide and our equipment. We can also fill up tanks you already own regardless of whether or not they were provided by Diversified Energy. 
Contact Us
Although we are the 31st largest propane retailer in the United States, we hold fast to small-town ethics and focus on providing great customer service.  Since our founding, in 2000 we have been offering propane delivery services, installation services and more for our commercial, residential and agricultural customers. 
Our professional technicians and drivers are available to answer any questions you may have and to make sure your order is done right and delivered to you on time.

		Safety
 Propane is a safe, economical fuel, but like other forms of energy it can be hazardous if not handled properly.  Propane has an unusual odor, sort of like decayed cabbage, a dead mouse, garlic, or rotten eggs. Ask your delivery man to let you smell the gas. Learn to identify this odor now.
Leaking propane is heavier than air and without proper ventilation can collect in low places like basements, pits, on the floor, etc. If ignited, propane will burn or explode.
IF YOU SMELL GAS…

DON’T TOUCH electrical switches, light matches, or use the phone.
GET EVERYONE OUT of the building.
SHUT OFF the gas valve at the outside tank, meter, or service entrance.
CALL your gas supplier and/or the fire department from a neighbor’s phone.

IF PILOT LIGHT WON’T LIGHT…
(Read appliance operating instructions before attempting to light pilot).
Your pilot light is designed not to light if there is a problem. If you have trouble lighting the pilot or keeping it lit, there’s normally a safety feature preventing it from working. If it won’t light, shut off the gas and call your gas supplier.
TAMPERING IS DANGEROUS…
Do not force the gas control knob. Never use tools. Use only your hand to turn the control know. Forcing the gas control knob may override the safety features and allow gas to leak. This could result in a fire or explosion. 
If the gas control knob becomes difficult to operate by hand, the control should be serviced by a trained gas service person.
GAS HAS BEEN ODORIZED…
Before lighting, sniff all around the appliance area far a gas odor. Be sure to sniff next to the floor because propane gas is heavier than air and may temporarily exist at floor level.
ABSORPTION…
LP Gas leaking from buried lines can lose its odor passing through soil; however, this depends on two factors. One is the type of soil and the second is the distance the gas travels through the soil.
If a leak is suspected, contact you gas supplier.
WATER DAMAGE…
If your gas control has been subjected to flooding or wetting, it must be replaced immediately by a trained gas service person.

										I purchased 5 qts of a cleaning product called Eliminator from a door-to-door salesman on January 7, 2000.  The cancellation policy was to return the products within 3 days (excluding Sunday) with your original receipt.  My return shipment was postmarked January 10, 2000.  It was received by ADP on January 19.  I spoke with their secretary on January 20 and was told it would take 6 weeks to process my return and refund my money.  On March 9, 2000 I called and spoke with Tony who informed me that he would check with his CPA who issues the refunds and see what the hold up was.  He would call me back.  I called him on March 10 and he told me his CPA in Louisiana would cut my check that day and send it out.  On March 24, 2000 I still had not received my check and called Tony again.  He said he would check into it with his CPAs and get back to me.  On March 27, 2000 I called and spoke with Tressa who said she would call the CPA and call me back.  She actually did call back and said she left a message with the CPA, but that he lives in Louisiana in the "boonies" and only has mail delivery and pickup every other day (yeah, right!)  I left messages for Tony and Tress on the 28th.  On the 29th of March I spoke with Tony who again said he would check with his CPA, but that when he contacted him 2 or 3 days ago the CPA said he would mail the check.  Meanwhile, I'm still waiting for my $84 refund.									    This report was posted on Ripoff Report on 03/29/2000 12:00 AM and is a permanent record located here:

										 0Author 1Consumer 0Employee/Owner    Updates & Rebuttals     #1 UPDATE EX-employee responds  American Diversified Products is company that not only defrauds consumers, but mistreats employees. AUTHOR: Christina -  (U.S.A.) SUBMITTED: Tuesday, February 24, 2004 POSTED: Tuesday, February 24, 2004  
														in July,2000, i was an employee of American Diversified Products. i was on a sales crew of about 20 people, only one other was female. We had to live in hotels, and had inadequate pay, no healthcare, and were forced to try to sell this product in cities where we did not have a valid permit to do so. We had to work (door to dorr) from 8 am until about 8 pm. Our pay was meager. We were given $10 per day. With that $10, we had to eat, buy supplies for work, and other personal items. Being a female(and only 20 at the time) I was forced to endure sexual harassment, and even a sexual assault by a coworker. The only thing that was done was making the person that assaulted me(his name was Ray) my ROOMMATE.
When I requested a bus ticket home(I had been told that I could request one at any time,and I would be granted my request)It was refused. 
We were not allowed any long distance phone calls, thus ensuring that we could not reach family members. I finally scrounged together enough money for a phone card, and had a  friend fedex me some money for a bus ticket. The day before i was to go home, I was raped. The company did absolutely NOTHING about the individual. This company still disgusts me, and i hope and pray that someone will shut them down.													   Respond to this report!  What's this?
