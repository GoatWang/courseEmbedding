									Who We Are					 

Who We Are
 
 



Parthenon LLC is an independent, employee-owned investment advisory firm providing investment management services for high net worth families, trusts, individuals and institutions.
Founded in 1999 by four seasoned investment professionals and an equally experienced administrative team, Parthenon was formed with the goal of providing logical and rational investment management through diligent research conducted in-house. By limiting the number of client relationships we accept, we further seek to provide the highest level of client service possible.
Each portfolio we manage is individually structured based on the client’s specific situation and needs. We utilize individual securities rather than funds, which gives us greater control over our portfolios’ quality and timing related to tax realization.
Our portfolio managers each average over twenty five years investment experience in the investment management industry. Our administrative team has equal experience working with the most complex accounts.

We have excellent relationships with many accounting and estate planning professionals, and we will work closely with yours (or provide a referral to an appropriate professional) for your future. 
We construct portfolios and manage assets in a very tax efficient manner. By using only individual stocks and bonds rather than commingled funds, we have control over the realizations of gains or losses, and pay strict attention to the after-tax returns of your portfolio. 
Due to our many years of experience, we have significant familiarity in working with multi-generational families. We understand the issues surrounding wealth that is to be passed from one generation to the next, as well as the need to educate the recipients of such wealth. 
Multi-generational families often employ trusts, family foundations and other estate planning techniques to accomplish their objectives. We are well experienced in the nuances of such planning tools, and are capable of managing these instruments based on your specific needs. 
The custodians with whom we work closely allow nearly all client-directed activity, such as gifts or disbursements, to be communicated through your administrator. We eliminate the need for you to make multiple telephone calls to affect administrative issues. 
Through our in-house software systems we are able to generate concise quarterly appraisals, as well as construct custom reports that you may wish to see occasionally or regularly. 
Your portfolio manager and administrator are available to meet with you as often as you wish. We typically conduct quarterly portfolio reviews, but are readily available at any time for consultation.

About Us





Discount Ostomy Supplies For Over 50 Years!
Ostomy Supplies Delivered To Your Door Step
Parthenon is a family company with family values.  You are our highest priority and we take every measure we can to ensure you have an enjoyable experience with us.
Parthenon produces the largest ostomy catalog in the United States serving customers in-store, on-line and via catalog.  We were one of the first companies to offer ostomy and other medical supplies online in the 1990's. However you choose to buy your medical supplies, we maintain a rock solid commitment to provide superior personalized service and the lowest prices in the country.  Parthenon was created by three pharmacists in 1961 when they developed our first product, Devrom® (internal deodorant).  With continued success and a wide network of distribution grew until Parthenon was providing ostomy supplies nationwide.  Parthenon celebrates over 50 successful years serving its customers!   Although focus is on ostomy supplies, Parthenon sells wound care, urologicals, skin care and incontinence products too. 
There are over 20,000 brick-and-mortar durable medical equipment shops in the United States, and quite a few on-line medical supply stores to note.  So why shop at www.Parthenoninc.com ?  It’s because we make no sacrifices in our service or product and this is demonstrated by our thousands and thousands of satisfied customers and success as a company that has been in business since 1961 and on the web since 1997.  Parthenon began as a small mail order based company with a catalog of ostomy supplies with its early beginnings in Connecticut.  Over the years we've had a few location moves and have finally settled in Salt Lake City, UTAH at our present location for over 35 years.  

Do you want more focus on customer service?  We are 100% about our customers!  Our focus is completely on customer service.  As a family owned/operated company  we owe our success to our customers and recognized that it never would have happened without their complete satisfaction with our products and service.  
What about low prices? Great service is always a plus, but price is just as if not more important.  We publish an ostomy catalog every year with prices listed so you have some stability as you plan your spending.  Only in circumstances where manufacturers have increased prices beyond our control are we forced to change our prices before our next publication.  Moreover, you will save money everytime you buy from Parthenon.  We price our products competitively and in the rare case you find a lower price, just tell us and we will beat that price by 5%!  Everytime.    
Would you like to buy your ostomy supplies from a company that can help you make decisions about which product(s) to get?  We don’t like to steer you away from the products you love, but when you have a question about an item either we already know the answer or know how to find the answer fast.  In addition, we have published the largest ostomy catalog in the country for decades.  It is completely focused on ostomy supplies featuring all of the manufacturers such as Coloplast, ConvaTec, Genairex, Hollister, Nu-Hope Labs, Smith & Nephew, Torbot and more!  We provide it free every year and also stuff it full of useful information too!
Are you sick of talking to namless and heartless customer service reps?  Would you like a more personalized order experience? This is a tough one for most companies, but believe it or not, we have some customers who specifically request the same person to take their order.  If you feel more comfortable placing an order with someone specific at our company, just ask and they will be happy to help you! 
Would you like to know about new products?  With 50 over years in the business, we try to be the first to know when a new ostomy appliance or accessory hits the market!  Some companies let insurance dictate what products they offer their customers.  Not us!  We will get you whatever product you want in whatever size you want.  Whether it’s brand new or from 20 years ago, if its available, we will exhaust our network of suppliers to get you what you need.  

When you buy from Parthenon you can be assured that we will process and ship your order with the greatest attention to detail.  We constantly receive feedback praising us for our high customer service standards, efficiency, prices, and personal touch.  Also, we will pack your order professionally and ship it promptly by the carrier and service of your choice.  In the end, our focus is to give you world-class service in an effort to give you total satisfaction with every purchase. 
While we stock some products, our inventory changes daily.  It is next to impossible to maintain a stock of all items.  Some of the brands we are most familiar with include: Coloplast, ConvaTec, Hollister, Nu-Hope Laboratories, Cymed, Marlen, Torbot, Smith & Nephew, Genariex and Urocare. 
Next time you prepare to order your wound care, ostomy, or any specialty medical product consider Parthenon, we’ll gladly prove to you that we are the source for discount medical products.  Please call or e-mail us if you don’t see what you’re looking for.
Get The Supplies You Want, Delivered When You Want Them! FOR LESS!
Sincerely,
Nick Mihalopoulos, R.Ph., Ph.D., Founder & CEO   Jason Mihalopoulos, MPH, MBA, MS Nutrition Science, President

									updated: Jun 22, 2017							

 





			LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY, 
			June 22, 2017			(Newswire.com) -
	​​Parthenon LLC has been named to the 2017 Financial Times list of the “Top 300 Registered Investment Advisers” in the United States. This is the fourth annual FT 300 list, produced independently by the Financial Times in collaboration with Ignites Research, a subsidiary of the FT that provides business intelligence on the investment management industry. Parthenon first made the list in 2015.
RIA firms applied for consideration, having met a minimum set of criteria. Applicants were then graded on six factors: assets under management (AUM); AUM growth rate; years in existence; advanced industry credentials of the firm’s advisers; online accessibility; and compliance records. There are no fees or other considerations required of RIAs that apply for the FT 300. The FT 300 Top RIAs hail from 37 states and Washington, D.C.
Founded in 1999, Parthenon LLC provides core investment management strategies for high net worth families, trusts, individuals and institutions. Each portfolio is customized based on the client’s specific needs and utilizes individual securities rather than funds, offering greater control over portfolio quality and timing related to tax realization. Parthenon’s portfolio managers average more than 25 years of experience in the investment management industry. The company also serves as the general partner and investment adviser to Fort Nelson Partners LP. 
“It’s an honor to be named again as a top advisor in the industry by the Financial Times,” said Todd P. Lowe, president of Parthenon LLC. “We’ve always been committed to providing our clients the highest standard of service to complement our proven investment strategy, and we’re proud to know the Times considers us among the best at what we do.”
About Parthenon LLC
Based in Louisville, Parthenon LLC was founded in 1999 by four seasoned investment professionals and an equally experienced administrative team. Parthenon’s goal is to provide logical and rational investment management through diligent in-house research. Each portfolio under management is individually structured based on the client’s specific situation and needs.
Parthenon utilizes individual securities rather than funds, which offer greater control over the portfolios’ quality and timing related to tax realization. The firm also serves as general partner/advisor for Fort Nelson Partners LP, a private fund. For more information, visit www.parthenonllc.com.​
About the Financial Times
The Financial Times, one of the world’s leading business news organizations, is recognized internationally for its authority, integrity and accuracy. Providing essential news, comment, data and analysis for the global business community, the FT has a combined paid print and digital circulation of nearly 744,000.
