Recycling Revolution


Share Facebook
Tweet







After surviving prohibition, the Coors family got innovative. In 1959, Coors introduced the industry’s first all-aluminum can, scraping the traditional steel. Not only did the beer taste better, the new can also sparked a recycling movement. Within the next ten years or so, the practice would become standard issue for the industry.

 Molson Coors: Brewing Up A Comeback? - Molson Coors Brewing Company (NYSE:TAP) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Molson Coors: Brewing Up A Comeback?Jul.18.17 | About: Molson Coors (TAP) Benjamin Handler Value, growth at reasonable price, long/short equity, portfolio strategySummaryMolson Coors, the maker of Coors Light, Miller Lite, Blue Moon, and more looks to be trading at an attractive price under $90.The company's complete buyout of MillerCoors in October 2016 will pay off in the long run.With a P/E ratio of 9.5x and an industry-leading position in net margin, ROA, and ROE, Molson Coors seems to be undervalued compared to the industry averages.Analysts have a median price target of $101.50, which is an upside of over 15%.Molson Coors Brewing Company (NYSE:TAP) still looks strong despite the fact that it is trading near 52-week lows. Therefore, it may be a good time to start a long position or to lower your average cost if you are already an investor in TAP. I think Molson Coors will be on the rise heading into its second-quarter earnings, which will be announced on August 2nd. It may be a good idea to jump on board the company's comeback now, as it is trading near 52-week lows, hovering around $87-88 per share, as the stock price is down almost 15% year to date. Recently, on June 7th, the stock price plunged 6% after Molson Coors announced it was lowering its EBITDA guidance. This comes after it rose about 5.5% after the company's first-quarter earnings report. So, what should we make of this recent price movement, and what can we expect in the future? Purchase of MillerCoors It is important to remember that Molson Coors acquired the remaining 58% stake in MillerCoors during the middle of October 2016 for $12 billion from SABmiller. MillerCoors was a joint venture between Molson Coors and SABmiller that was formed in 2008. By becoming the sole owner of MillerCoors, Molson Coors has established itself as one of the largest brewers in the US and Canada. This is the main reason to like the company long term. CEO Mark Hunter explains the value of this acquisition when he stated: "As one company with an expanded portfolio of iconic brands and a highly focused leadership team, we intend to leverage our increased scale, resources and combined commercial experience to accelerate our First Choice agenda and deliver long term shareholder value."
 The company doubled in size as a result of this deal, giving it the capacity and control needed to compete in a globalized industry. The purchase of MillerCoors gave Molson Coors the right to sell the Miller Lite, Miller High Life, and Miller legacy brands. Its staple products now include Coors Light, Molson Canadian, Miller Lite, Blue Moon, Henry's Hard Soda, Redd's Hard Ciders, Keystone, Leinenkugels, and more. Past Annual Performance 2015: The company did not show great numbers in its 2015 annual earnings report. This was Mark Hunter's first year at the helm, and sales globally were flat in comparison to 2014. The margin between net sales and cost of goods sold was also significantly tighter than in the year prior. Another contributor to the sales drop in 2015 was the emergence of regional brewers and microbreweries, especially in Canada. The beer industry as whole had a weak 2015 as well. By the end of 2015, worldwide beer volume decreased 1.5% and net sales per hectoliter decreased 13%. Net income from continuing operations decreased 30% and underlying after-tax income decreased 8.9% from the previous year. Underlying EBITDA also decreased 17% from the previous year. The company suspended its $1 billion stock repurchase program in the fourth quarter of 2015 as well. Pertaining to these losses in 2015, it said: "Underlying full year results were lower than prior year primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency movements, increased brand investments and the impact of terminated business contracts" Management did not seem too concerned with the company's performance or future prospects, because they were already in talks to acquire the remainder of MillerCoors. At this point, MolsonCoors was the fourth-largest brewer behind Anheuser-Busch (NYSE:BUD), SABmiller, and Heineken (OTCQX:HEINY). Anheuser-Busch flexed its muscles in 2015 by acquiring SABmiller. This transformed it into an even bigger conglomerate and ate away at some market share in the beer industry. I think it is safe to say the Molson Coors had a less than desirable year in 2015.
 2016: The company saw large improvements through 2016. Sales increased by over $1 billion in just one year, and its operating income more than tripled. This, of course, was mostly due to the purchase of MillerCoors from SABmiller, but the company also saw growth in domestic and international volume. Its operating income also grew substantially because Molson Coors could now consolidate the supply chain. This enabled the company to completely control costs and become more efficient. 

 At the end of 2016, TAP reported a net income of $1.9 billion, after reporting only $359 million in net income in 2015. Side by side, it seems that Molson Coors had an extraordinary 2016 in comparison to years past. This is obviously deceiving, as the insanely high income came at a $12 billion price tag to buy MillerCoors. It is important to realize that TAP did not have an amazing year in 2016, it simply became a larger company. It has $12 billion debt, and it will take the company quite a few years to pay off that debt, making around $1.9 billion a year in net income. The reason why the company's sales and net income grew by so much in 2016 was because of its acquisition of MillerCoors, which gave it the ability to sell all of the Miller brands. This increased TAP's brand volume and cut costs tremendously, while the company as a whole received much more exposure in the beer industry. TAP increased its market share in Canada to 34%, and its market share in the U.S. grew to 25%. Molson Coors International also grew by almost 100% year to date. The 10-K form from the end 2016 also reported that the company had $785 million in free cash flow, which can be useful for growth initiatives for 2017 and beyond. The free cash flow may be key to keeping up with its large competitors. EPS also grew from $1.93 in 2015 to $9.26 in 2016 - again, this was due to the purchase of the Miller brands. Therefore, you should not expect EPS for the end of 2017 to be anywhere near those levels. Current EPS estimates for the end of the year are about $4 per share.
 2017 First-Quarter Earnings Report Molson Coors' first-quarter earnings report in 2017 showed a 2.1% increase in brand volume. Sales in Canada increased $291.1 million, or 8.6%, and sales in the United States rose 3.4% to $315.6 million. However, the company saw a 3.6% EBITDA decline to $514.9 million, and it just lowered EBITDA guidance as well. The CEO made this forward-looking statement during the first-quarter conference call: "Despite the softer start to the year, volume trends have improved recently, we are making great progress with our First Choice agenda in all of our businesses, and we are confident of our full-year business plans. Additionally, we are generating cash ahead of our original expectations. With the completion of the MillerCoors transaction late last year and the changes we are making to align and enhance our organization, 2017 will be a transition year as we build a larger, stronger company. Consistent with this, our results today reflect increased investments in the building blocks that will drive top-line growth, profit, cash generation, debt pay-down, and total shareholder returns in the years ahead." The CEO also seems confident that company is poised for growth. The better-than-expected generation of cash is certainly positive news and will help the company continue to increase its market share. The description of 2017 as a "transition year" could have a negative connotation, but I believe it is an indicator that Molson Coors is becoming flexible and adapting to market changes. For a long-term investor, this should be a good sign, because Molson Coors is active in a de facto arms race against the oligopoly of Anheuser-Busch. 

TAP data by YCharts If you look at Molson Coors' three-year chart, it seems like the company is reverting back to levels from about a year and a half ago before its big expenditure, making this a decent buying opportunity.
 Key Figures and Financial Ratios Molson Coors has a market cap of $20.9 billion, which is the third largest in the industry. Heineken's $43.2 billion market cap and the massive $213.5 billion market cap of Anheuser-Busch lead the way. In relation to its peers, Molson Coors has a low P/E ratio at about 9.5x. That being said, it does have a forward P/E of around 13x. This is an interesting statistic because this is its lowest P/E ratio in 13 years. The reason why this number can be misleading is because it is based on the trailing twelve-month EPS of $9.26. For the first quarter of 2017, Molson Coors reported EPS of $0.93. It is therefore a probability that its EPS at the end of 2017 will drop to around $4 or $5 per share. It is also likely that the P/E number will grow by the end of the year. If its share price goes up and the EPS goes down - which is something I expect to happen - their P/E will go up. This alone should look attractive for investors, because they should look to enter at these levels where the P/E is too low. An EPS drop from last year should be expected as the company adjusts to its larger size. Therefore, I think the share price will rise even with an EPS drop. The P/E ratio seems misleading at these levels, and it could very well be a sign of a further decline in growth. Though, I believe that argument is convoluted, because I see Molson Coors' P/E as signal that the company is undervalued. It does look relatively undervalued in the industry right now because the industry average P/E ratio is around 18x. Molson Coors also has a PEG ratio of 1.98, which not too far off of the ideal PEG ratio of 1. The PEG ratio says that the company is valued at a relatively fair price. 


 

 (Source: Investopedia) These charts can be interpreted in several different ways. One being that Molson Coors is somewhat lagging in the industry with a notably low EBITDA. I see it as the company being undervalued because it is an industry leader in net margin, return on assets, and return on equity. Yet, it still has a low P/E ratio. This makes the share price seem low at the level it is trading at right now. Company Health When it comes to financial health, Molson Coors may be less liquid than competitors. The company has a lower quick and current ratio than a conservative investor is probably looking for. Its financial leverage is not too risky, but it has increased due to the recent acquisition. 

 (Source: Investopedia) At these prices, TAP may be a good stock to own for the long run, as it currently has a 0.89 beta, making it not too risky in theory. The company also has $1.64 dividend, which it has been raising every two years. The company's purchase of MillerCoors will benefit it in the long run and eventually increase its EBITDA numbers to go along with the continued sales increases. Molson Coors is already generating more cash than expected, which should ease the nerves at least a little bit. Risk Factors  Scathing competition can force the company to lose sales volume (which is the main reason it lowered EBITDA guidance at the beginning of June). Molson Coors' debt levels significantly rose in 2016 due to the acquisition of SABmiller, and failure to realize debt obligations could result in significant losses. Overall beer consumption in the U.S. has been declining since 2009 and may well continue on that path. 
 The company does need to focus more on taking away market share from its biggest competitors, Anheuser-Busch, Boston Beer Co. (NYSE:SAM), Heineken and more. The competitive landscape is my biggest concern when it comes to investing in TAP, and I am sure other investors would probably agree. The over $200 billion market cap of BUD and its purchase of SABmiller is concerning. It is the clear powerhouse in the beer industry, and that will probably hold true for years to come. That being said, Molson Coors has shown that it refuses to back down. If these risk factors become more prevalent, it could have a trickle-down effect, because losing sales to competitors or the decline in beer consumption could cause the company to default on its debt, leading to a smaller EBITDA number and continued losses for investors. As seen from the 6% drop in June, EBITDA guidance is strong mover of this stock. However, that is the worst-case scenario and probably will not happen. Future Expectations Twelve analysts have predicted TAP's 12-month future: 

 I agree with the median price consensus, and it may be realistic to see Molson Coors back over $100 per share assuming strong earnings reports, and at least back into the $95 range assuming average financial reports. Institutional investors are confident too, as Molson Coors is also owned by 45 hedge funds with $1.88 billion in positions. Analysts expect EPS of $2-2.50 per share during the second quarter of 2017, with a consensus of $2.15 earnings per share. These estimates have been raised from three months ago, and I still would not be surprised if TAP beats these numbers on August 2nd. Trading below $90 per share, TAP looks attractive. In addition, the global beer market is projected to see nearly $700 billion in sales and a 6% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) by 2020. International sales will hopefully offset the domestic decline in beer consumption and keep Molson Coors on track for continued growth.
 Conclusion   I believe Molson Coors and its investors will be rewarded in the future by its purchase of MillerCoors. The company already came out and said it is generating more cash than expected. I also believe that the possibilities of this deal are immeasurable at the moment, and therefore, are not factored into the share price. Competition in the beer industry is a major cause for concern, as Anheuser-Busch and Heineken are currently much larger players than Molson Coors and have the capacity to suppress it. That being said, I think that Molson Coors will be able to compete and show solid growth in the future. Right now, it seems to be undervalued and looks like a good buying opportunity. It may be a good idea to start a small position now, with additions to that position once the company proves it can boost its EBITDA numbers and grow in a competitive industry.

History[edit]
Founding[edit]
In 1873, German immigrants Adolph Coors and Jacob Schueler from Prussia emigrated and established a brewery in Golden, Colorado, after buying a recipe for a Pilsner-style beer from a Czech immigrant William Silhan.[4]
Coors invested $2,000 in the operation, and Schueler invested $18,000.
In 1880, Coors bought out his partner and became sole owner of the brewery.
Prohibition[edit]




Ad for Coors Malted Milk, produced in 1918.


The Coors Brewing Company managed to survive Prohibition relatively intact. Years before the Volstead Act went into effect nationwide, Adolph Coors with sons Adolph Jr., Grover, and Herman established the Adolph Coors Brewing and Manufacturing Company, which included Herold Porcelain and other ventures. The brewery itself was converted into a malted milk and near beer production facility. Coors sold much of the malted milk to the Mars candy company for the production of sweets. Manna, the company's non-alcoholic beer replacement, was a near beer similar to current non-alcoholic beverages. However, Coors and his sons relied heavily on the porcelain company as well as a cement and real estate company to keep the Coors Brewing Company afloat. By 1933, after the end of Prohibition, the Coors brewery was one of only a handful of breweries that had survived.
All of the non-brewery assets of the Adolph Coors Company were spun off between 1989 and 1992. The descendant of the original Herold Porcelain ceramics business continues to operate as CoorsTek.[5]
Products[edit]
For much of its history, Coors beer was a regional product and its marketing area was confined to the American West.[6][7][8] While California and Texas were part of the 11-state distribution area, Washington and Montana were not added until 1976[6][9] (& Oregon did not approve sales in grocery stores until 1985).[10][11][12][13] This gave it mystique and made it a novelty, particularly on the East Coast,[14][15] and visitors returning from the western states often brought back a case.[16] This iconic status was reflected in the 1977 movie Smokey and the Bandit, which centered around an illegal shipment of Coors from Texas to Georgia. The company finally established nationwide distribution in the United States in the mid-1980s.[17]
In 1959, Coors became the first American brewer to use an all-aluminum two-piece beverage can.[3] Also in 1959, the company abandoned pasteurization and began to use sterile filtration to stabilize its beer.[3][14] Coors currently operates the largest aluminum can producing plant in the world, known as the Rocky Mountain Metal Container (RMMC), in Golden. RMMC is a joint venture between Ball Metal and Coors, having been founded in 2003.
In the 1970s, Coors invented the litter-free push tab can,[14] in place of the ring pull-tab.[18][19] However, consumers disliked the top and it was discontinued soon afterward.
Coors Light was introduced in 1978.[3] The longtime slogan of "Silver Bullet" to describe it does not describe the beer, but rather the silver-colored can in which the beer is packaged. Coors Light was once produced in "yellow-bellied" cans like the full-strength Coors, but when the yellow coloring was removed and the can was left mostly silver, many dubbed the beer the "Silver Bullet".

Mergers[edit]
In 2005, Coors was rated the third largest producer of beer in the United States, and the second largest brewer in the United Kingdom through its subsidiary, Coors Brewers Limited.[21]
On July 22, 2004, the company announced it would be merging with Canadian brewer Molson. The merger was completed February 9, 2005, with the merged company being named Molson Coors Brewing Company.
Shenandoah expansion[edit]
In August 2004, the Coors Brewing Company announced plans to add brewing capacity to the Shenandoah beer packaging facility in Elkton, Virginia, by early 2007.[22] Coors officials stated that this would "bring brewing capacity much closer to our important East Coast markets and distributors."
Labor issues[edit]
In April 1977, the brewery workers union at Coors, representing 1,472 employees, went on strike. The brewery kept operating with supervisors and 250 to 300 union members, including one member of the union executive board who ignored the strike. Soon after, Coors announced that it would hire replacements for the striking workers.[23] About 700 workers quit the picket line to go back to work, and Coors replaced the remaining 500 workers, keeping the beer production process uninterrupted.[24] In December 1978, the workers at Coors voted by greater than a two-to-one ratio to decertify the union, ending 44 years of union representation at Coors. Because the strike was by then more than a year old, striking workers could not vote in the election.[25]
Labor unions organized a boycott to punish Coors for its labor practices.[26] One tactic employed by the unions was a push for states to pass laws banning the sale of unpasteurized canned and bottled beer.[27] Because Coors was the only major brewer at the time not pasteurizing its canned and bottled beer, such laws would hurt only Coors.[28] Sales of Coors suffered during the decade-long labor union boycott, although Coors stated that declining sales were also due to an industry-wide downturn in beer sales, and to increased competition. To maintain production, Coors expanded its sales area from the 18 western states to which it had marketed for years, to nationwide distribution.[29] This was completed in 1991 with Indiana being the last state for the brand to appear.[30]
The AFL-CIO ended its boycott of Coors in August 1987, after negotiations with Pete Coors, head of brewery operations. The details of the settlement were not divulged, but were said to include an early union representation election in Colorado and use of union workers to build the new Coors brewery in Virginia.[31]
In 1988, the Teamsters Union, which represented brewery workers at the top three US beer makers at the time (Anheuser-Busch, Miller, and Stroh), gained enough signatures to trigger a union representation election inside the Coors company. Coors workers again rejected union representation by more than a two-to-one ratio.[32]
Minority issues[edit]
Mexican Americans charged Coors with discriminatory hiring practices following the passage of the Civil Rights Act, and launched a boycott of the company's products beginning in the late 1960s. Labor unions and gay rights activists joined the boycott, which lasted into the 1980s.[33] A federal lawsuit in 1975 by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission[34] ended in a settlement with Coors agreeing not to discriminate against blacks, Hispanics, and women.[35]
In 1977, Coors was accused of firing gay and lesbian employees.[36] Coors encouraged the organization of its gay and lesbian employees into the Lesbian and Gay Employee Resource (LAGER) in 1993.[37] In May 1995, Coors became the 21st publicly traded corporation in the United States to extend employee benefits to same-sex partners.[38] When company chairman Pete Coors was criticized for the company's gay-friendly policy during his 2004 Republican primary campaign for a United States Senate seat from Colorado, he defended the policy as a basic good business practice.[39]
Political influence[edit]
According to Russ Bellant Coors family members have played a prominent role in American politics and public policy, supporting many conservative causes. Such causes included providing a $250,000 grant in 1973 to found The Heritage Foundation,[40] an influential conservative think tank, and, via its parent company, the right-leaning think tank American Enterprise Institute.
Chairman Pete Coors ran unsuccessfully for the United States Senate from Colorado in 2004 on the Republican ticket.

Main article: Molson Coors brands
Coors is responsible for over twenty different brands of beer[41] in North America. The most notable of those brands are Coors, Killian's, Caffrey's, and Blue Moon.
Joint venture with SABMiller[edit]
On 9 October 2007, SABMiller and Molson Coors Brewing Company announced a joint venture to be known as MillerCoors for their US operations that will market all of their products.[2]
Change of ownership[edit]
In September 2015 Anheuser-Busch Inbev announced that it had reached a full agreement to acquire competitor SABMiller for $107 Billion dollars. During the merger discussions between the two companies in 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) had agreed to proposed deal only on the basis that SABMiller "spins off all its MillerCoors holdings in the U.S. — which include both Miller- and Coors-held brands — along with its Miller brands outside the U.S." The entire ownership situation was complicated: "In the United States, Coors is majority owned by MillerCoors (a subsidiary of SABMiller) and minority owned by Molson Coors, though internationally it’s entirely owned by Molson Coors, and Miller is owned by SABMiller."[42] In 2003, John Spagnolo purchased millions of shares of common and preferred stock and is a continued brand evangelist.
SABMiller agreed to divest itself of the Miller brands by selling its stake in MillerCoors to Molson Coors. The merger between the two companies closed on October 10, 2016. The spinoff deal was completed on October 11, 2016)[43] As per the agreement with the regulators, SABMiller sold to Molson Coors full ownership of the Miller brand portfolio outside of the U.S. and Puerto Rico for US$12 billion. Molson Coors also retained "the rights to all of the brands currently in the MillerCoors portfolio for the U.S. and Puerto Rico, including Redd’s and import brands such as Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell." The agreement made Molson Coors the world's third-largest brewer.[1]
In Canada, Molson Coors regained the right to make and market Miller Genuine Draft and Miller Lite.[44]

History[edit]
Founding[edit]
In 1873, German immigrants Adolph Coors and Jacob Schueler from Prussia emigrated and established a brewery in Golden, Colorado, after buying a recipe for a Pilsner-style beer from a Czech immigrant William Silhan.[4]
Coors invested $2,000 in the operation, and Schueler invested $18,000.
In 1880, Coors bought out his partner and became sole owner of the brewery.
Prohibition[edit]




Ad for Coors Malted Milk, produced in 1918.


The Coors Brewing Company managed to survive Prohibition relatively intact. Years before the Volstead Act went into effect nationwide, Adolph Coors with sons Adolph Jr., Grover, and Herman established the Adolph Coors Brewing and Manufacturing Company, which included Herold Porcelain and other ventures. The brewery itself was converted into a malted milk and near beer production facility. Coors sold much of the malted milk to the Mars candy company for the production of sweets. Manna, the company's non-alcoholic beer replacement, was a near beer similar to current non-alcoholic beverages. However, Coors and his sons relied heavily on the porcelain company as well as a cement and real estate company to keep the Coors Brewing Company afloat. By 1933, after the end of Prohibition, the Coors brewery was one of only a handful of breweries that had survived.
All of the non-brewery assets of the Adolph Coors Company were spun off between 1989 and 1992. The descendant of the original Herold Porcelain ceramics business continues to operate as CoorsTek.[5]
Products[edit]
For much of its history, Coors beer was a regional product and its marketing area was confined to the American West.[6][7][8] While California and Texas were part of the 11-state distribution area, Washington and Montana were not added until 1976[6][9] (& Oregon did not approve sales in grocery stores until 1985).[10][11][12][13] This gave it mystique and made it a novelty, particularly on the East Coast,[14][15] and visitors returning from the western states often brought back a case.[16] This iconic status was reflected in the 1977 movie Smokey and the Bandit, which centered around an illegal shipment of Coors from Texas to Georgia. The company finally established nationwide distribution in the United States in the mid-1980s.[17]
In 1959, Coors became the first American brewer to use an all-aluminum two-piece beverage can.[3] Also in 1959, the company abandoned pasteurization and began to use sterile filtration to stabilize its beer.[3][14] Coors currently operates the largest aluminum can producing plant in the world, known as the Rocky Mountain Metal Container (RMMC), in Golden. RMMC is a joint venture between Ball Metal and Coors, having been founded in 2003.
In the 1970s, Coors invented the litter-free push tab can,[14] in place of the ring pull-tab.[18][19] However, consumers disliked the top and it was discontinued soon afterward.
Coors Light was introduced in 1978.[3] The longtime slogan of "Silver Bullet" to describe it does not describe the beer, but rather the silver-colored can in which the beer is packaged. Coors Light was once produced in "yellow-bellied" cans like the full-strength Coors, but when the yellow coloring was removed and the can was left mostly silver, many dubbed the beer the "Silver Bullet".

Mergers[edit]
In 2005, Coors was rated the third largest producer of beer in the United States, and the second largest brewer in the United Kingdom through its subsidiary, Coors Brewers Limited.[21]
On July 22, 2004, the company announced it would be merging with Canadian brewer Molson. The merger was completed February 9, 2005, with the merged company being named Molson Coors Brewing Company.
Shenandoah expansion[edit]
In August 2004, the Coors Brewing Company announced plans to add brewing capacity to the Shenandoah beer packaging facility in Elkton, Virginia, by early 2007.[22] Coors officials stated that this would "bring brewing capacity much closer to our important East Coast markets and distributors."
Labor issues[edit]
In April 1977, the brewery workers union at Coors, representing 1,472 employees, went on strike. The brewery kept operating with supervisors and 250 to 300 union members, including one member of the union executive board who ignored the strike. Soon after, Coors announced that it would hire replacements for the striking workers.[23] About 700 workers quit the picket line to go back to work, and Coors replaced the remaining 500 workers, keeping the beer production process uninterrupted.[24] In December 1978, the workers at Coors voted by greater than a two-to-one ratio to decertify the union, ending 44 years of union representation at Coors. Because the strike was by then more than a year old, striking workers could not vote in the election.[25]
Labor unions organized a boycott to punish Coors for its labor practices.[26] One tactic employed by the unions was a push for states to pass laws banning the sale of unpasteurized canned and bottled beer.[27] Because Coors was the only major brewer at the time not pasteurizing its canned and bottled beer, such laws would hurt only Coors.[28] Sales of Coors suffered during the decade-long labor union boycott, although Coors stated that declining sales were also due to an industry-wide downturn in beer sales, and to increased competition. To maintain production, Coors expanded its sales area from the 18 western states to which it had marketed for years, to nationwide distribution.[29] This was completed in 1991 with Indiana being the last state for the brand to appear.[30]
The AFL-CIO ended its boycott of Coors in August 1987, after negotiations with Pete Coors, head of brewery operations. The details of the settlement were not divulged, but were said to include an early union representation election in Colorado and use of union workers to build the new Coors brewery in Virginia.[31]
In 1988, the Teamsters Union, which represented brewery workers at the top three US beer makers at the time (Anheuser-Busch, Miller, and Stroh), gained enough signatures to trigger a union representation election inside the Coors company. Coors workers again rejected union representation by more than a two-to-one ratio.[32]
Minority issues[edit]
Mexican Americans charged Coors with discriminatory hiring practices following the passage of the Civil Rights Act, and launched a boycott of the company's products beginning in the late 1960s. Labor unions and gay rights activists joined the boycott, which lasted into the 1980s.[33] A federal lawsuit in 1975 by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission[34] ended in a settlement with Coors agreeing not to discriminate against blacks, Hispanics, and women.[35]
In 1977, Coors was accused of firing gay and lesbian employees.[36] Coors encouraged the organization of its gay and lesbian employees into the Lesbian and Gay Employee Resource (LAGER) in 1993.[37] In May 1995, Coors became the 21st publicly traded corporation in the United States to extend employee benefits to same-sex partners.[38] When company chairman Pete Coors was criticized for the company's gay-friendly policy during his 2004 Republican primary campaign for a United States Senate seat from Colorado, he defended the policy as a basic good business practice.[39]
Political influence[edit]
According to Russ Bellant Coors family members have played a prominent role in American politics and public policy, supporting many conservative causes. Such causes included providing a $250,000 grant in 1973 to found The Heritage Foundation,[40] an influential conservative think tank, and, via its parent company, the right-leaning think tank American Enterprise Institute.
Chairman Pete Coors ran unsuccessfully for the United States Senate from Colorado in 2004 on the Republican ticket.

Main article: Molson Coors brands
Coors is responsible for over twenty different brands of beer[41] in North America. The most notable of those brands are Coors, Killian's, Caffrey's, and Blue Moon.
Joint venture with SABMiller[edit]
On 9 October 2007, SABMiller and Molson Coors Brewing Company announced a joint venture to be known as MillerCoors for their US operations that will market all of their products.[2]
Change of ownership[edit]
In September 2015 Anheuser-Busch Inbev announced that it had reached a full agreement to acquire competitor SABMiller for $107 Billion dollars. During the merger discussions between the two companies in 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) had agreed to proposed deal only on the basis that SABMiller "spins off all its MillerCoors holdings in the U.S. — which include both Miller- and Coors-held brands — along with its Miller brands outside the U.S." The entire ownership situation was complicated: "In the United States, Coors is majority owned by MillerCoors (a subsidiary of SABMiller) and minority owned by Molson Coors, though internationally it’s entirely owned by Molson Coors, and Miller is owned by SABMiller."[42] In 2003, John Spagnolo purchased millions of shares of common and preferred stock and is a continued brand evangelist.
SABMiller agreed to divest itself of the Miller brands by selling its stake in MillerCoors to Molson Coors. The merger between the two companies closed on October 10, 2016. The spinoff deal was completed on October 11, 2016)[43] As per the agreement with the regulators, SABMiller sold to Molson Coors full ownership of the Miller brand portfolio outside of the U.S. and Puerto Rico for US$12 billion. Molson Coors also retained "the rights to all of the brands currently in the MillerCoors portfolio for the U.S. and Puerto Rico, including Redd’s and import brands such as Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell." The agreement made Molson Coors the world's third-largest brewer.[1]
In Canada, Molson Coors regained the right to make and market Miller Genuine Draft and Miller Lite.[44]

Marketing[edit]
Coors sponsored Premiership side Chelsea from 1994 to 1997. The last competitive game that the club wore shirts bearing Coors as sponsors was the 1997 FA Cup Final in which they beat Middlesbrough 2-0 to end their 26-year wait for a major trophy.
Current affiliate Carling was title sponsor of the Premier League from 1993 to 2001 and since 2003 has sponsored the Football League Cup. The two brands are also former sponsors of Rangers and Celtic. The clubs have worn strips with Coors Light logos for exhibitions in North America, while elsewhere the strips promoted Carling, which is not offered in the United States.
Coors is also the official beer sponsor of NASCAR and formerly the NFL until Bud Light replaced it in 2011.[45] In addition to its official NASCAR sponsorship, Coors Light has regularly sponsored cars in the series. They sponsored Melling Racing, Team SABCO, and most recently Chip Ganassi Racing. Drivers to have Coors backing have included Bill Elliott, who won the Winston Million in 1985 and the 1988 Winston Cup Championship, Robby Gordon, Sterling Marlin, Kyle Petty, David Stremme and Regan Smith. Coors is the title sponsor of the pole award in the NASCAR Sprint Cup and Nationwide Series.[46] Coors stopped sponsoring a stock car in 2008.
Coors and/or Molson are beer sponsors of the NHL's Colorado Avalanche, Detroit Red Wings, Arizona Coyotes, San Jose Sharks and all six Canadian teams. The company owns 20% of the Montreal Canadiens with the Molson family owning the other 80%, having purchased the shares from Colorado's George Gillett in 2009.[47]
Coors is also the official beer of the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA).[48]
Coors currently holds the naming rights to Coors Field in Denver, Colorado, home of the Colorado Rockies baseball team.
The Coors Events Center on the campus of the University of Colorado at Boulder in Boulder, Colorado is named after the company.
The Coors Life Direction Center of Regis University is also named after the company.
Coors has sponsored English rugby league side Workington Town from the 2007 season, as well as British Ice Hockey Team, The Belfast Giants.
Coors was the main sponsor for the Coors Cycling Team (late 1980s to mid-1990s) and the sponsor for US cycling event the Coors Classic, which ran from 1980 to 1988.
Coors is a sponsor of English Rugby Union team Gloucester. Coincidentally, both Coors and Gloucester RFC were founded in 1873. Coors, through product line Worthingtons, brews a special beer "Kingsholm Ale", which is sold in the stadium. The Worthington logo is featured on the team's jerseys.

History[edit]
Founding[edit]
In 1873, German immigrants Adolph Coors and Jacob Schueler from Prussia emigrated and established a brewery in Golden, Colorado, after buying a recipe for a Pilsner-style beer from a Czech immigrant William Silhan.[4]
Coors invested $2,000 in the operation, and Schueler invested $18,000.
In 1880, Coors bought out his partner and became sole owner of the brewery.
Prohibition[edit]




Ad for Coors Malted Milk, produced in 1918.


The Coors Brewing Company managed to survive Prohibition relatively intact. Years before the Volstead Act went into effect nationwide, Adolph Coors with sons Adolph Jr., Grover, and Herman established the Adolph Coors Brewing and Manufacturing Company, which included Herold Porcelain and other ventures. The brewery itself was converted into a malted milk and near beer production facility. Coors sold much of the malted milk to the Mars candy company for the production of sweets. Manna, the company's non-alcoholic beer replacement, was a near beer similar to current non-alcoholic beverages. However, Coors and his sons relied heavily on the porcelain company as well as a cement and real estate company to keep the Coors Brewing Company afloat. By 1933, after the end of Prohibition, the Coors brewery was one of only a handful of breweries that had survived.
All of the non-brewery assets of the Adolph Coors Company were spun off between 1989 and 1992. The descendant of the original Herold Porcelain ceramics business continues to operate as CoorsTek.[5]
Products[edit]
For much of its history, Coors beer was a regional product and its marketing area was confined to the American West.[6][7][8] While California and Texas were part of the 11-state distribution area, Washington and Montana were not added until 1976[6][9] (& Oregon did not approve sales in grocery stores until 1985).[10][11][12][13] This gave it mystique and made it a novelty, particularly on the East Coast,[14][15] and visitors returning from the western states often brought back a case.[16] This iconic status was reflected in the 1977 movie Smokey and the Bandit, which centered around an illegal shipment of Coors from Texas to Georgia. The company finally established nationwide distribution in the United States in the mid-1980s.[17]
In 1959, Coors became the first American brewer to use an all-aluminum two-piece beverage can.[3] Also in 1959, the company abandoned pasteurization and began to use sterile filtration to stabilize its beer.[3][14] Coors currently operates the largest aluminum can producing plant in the world, known as the Rocky Mountain Metal Container (RMMC), in Golden. RMMC is a joint venture between Ball Metal and Coors, having been founded in 2003.
In the 1970s, Coors invented the litter-free push tab can,[14] in place of the ring pull-tab.[18][19] However, consumers disliked the top and it was discontinued soon afterward.
Coors Light was introduced in 1978.[3] The longtime slogan of "Silver Bullet" to describe it does not describe the beer, but rather the silver-colored can in which the beer is packaged. Coors Light was once produced in "yellow-bellied" cans like the full-strength Coors, but when the yellow coloring was removed and the can was left mostly silver, many dubbed the beer the "Silver Bullet".

Mergers[edit]
In 2005, Coors was rated the third largest producer of beer in the United States, and the second largest brewer in the United Kingdom through its subsidiary, Coors Brewers Limited.[21]
On July 22, 2004, the company announced it would be merging with Canadian brewer Molson. The merger was completed February 9, 2005, with the merged company being named Molson Coors Brewing Company.
Shenandoah expansion[edit]
In August 2004, the Coors Brewing Company announced plans to add brewing capacity to the Shenandoah beer packaging facility in Elkton, Virginia, by early 2007.[22] Coors officials stated that this would "bring brewing capacity much closer to our important East Coast markets and distributors."
Labor issues[edit]
In April 1977, the brewery workers union at Coors, representing 1,472 employees, went on strike. The brewery kept operating with supervisors and 250 to 300 union members, including one member of the union executive board who ignored the strike. Soon after, Coors announced that it would hire replacements for the striking workers.[23] About 700 workers quit the picket line to go back to work, and Coors replaced the remaining 500 workers, keeping the beer production process uninterrupted.[24] In December 1978, the workers at Coors voted by greater than a two-to-one ratio to decertify the union, ending 44 years of union representation at Coors. Because the strike was by then more than a year old, striking workers could not vote in the election.[25]
Labor unions organized a boycott to punish Coors for its labor practices.[26] One tactic employed by the unions was a push for states to pass laws banning the sale of unpasteurized canned and bottled beer.[27] Because Coors was the only major brewer at the time not pasteurizing its canned and bottled beer, such laws would hurt only Coors.[28] Sales of Coors suffered during the decade-long labor union boycott, although Coors stated that declining sales were also due to an industry-wide downturn in beer sales, and to increased competition. To maintain production, Coors expanded its sales area from the 18 western states to which it had marketed for years, to nationwide distribution.[29] This was completed in 1991 with Indiana being the last state for the brand to appear.[30]
The AFL-CIO ended its boycott of Coors in August 1987, after negotiations with Pete Coors, head of brewery operations. The details of the settlement were not divulged, but were said to include an early union representation election in Colorado and use of union workers to build the new Coors brewery in Virginia.[31]
In 1988, the Teamsters Union, which represented brewery workers at the top three US beer makers at the time (Anheuser-Busch, Miller, and Stroh), gained enough signatures to trigger a union representation election inside the Coors company. Coors workers again rejected union representation by more than a two-to-one ratio.[32]
Minority issues[edit]
Mexican Americans charged Coors with discriminatory hiring practices following the passage of the Civil Rights Act, and launched a boycott of the company's products beginning in the late 1960s. Labor unions and gay rights activists joined the boycott, which lasted into the 1980s.[33] A federal lawsuit in 1975 by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission[34] ended in a settlement with Coors agreeing not to discriminate against blacks, Hispanics, and women.[35]
In 1977, Coors was accused of firing gay and lesbian employees.[36] Coors encouraged the organization of its gay and lesbian employees into the Lesbian and Gay Employee Resource (LAGER) in 1993.[37] In May 1995, Coors became the 21st publicly traded corporation in the United States to extend employee benefits to same-sex partners.[38] When company chairman Pete Coors was criticized for the company's gay-friendly policy during his 2004 Republican primary campaign for a United States Senate seat from Colorado, he defended the policy as a basic good business practice.[39]
Political influence[edit]
According to Russ Bellant Coors family members have played a prominent role in American politics and public policy, supporting many conservative causes. Such causes included providing a $250,000 grant in 1973 to found The Heritage Foundation,[40] an influential conservative think tank, and, via its parent company, the right-leaning think tank American Enterprise Institute.
Chairman Pete Coors ran unsuccessfully for the United States Senate from Colorado in 2004 on the Republican ticket.

Main article: Molson Coors brands
Coors is responsible for over twenty different brands of beer[41] in North America. The most notable of those brands are Coors, Killian's, Caffrey's, and Blue Moon.
Joint venture with SABMiller[edit]
On 9 October 2007, SABMiller and Molson Coors Brewing Company announced a joint venture to be known as MillerCoors for their US operations that will market all of their products.[2]
Change of ownership[edit]
In September 2015 Anheuser-Busch Inbev announced that it had reached a full agreement to acquire competitor SABMiller for $107 Billion dollars. During the merger discussions between the two companies in 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) had agreed to proposed deal only on the basis that SABMiller "spins off all its MillerCoors holdings in the U.S. — which include both Miller- and Coors-held brands — along with its Miller brands outside the U.S." The entire ownership situation was complicated: "In the United States, Coors is majority owned by MillerCoors (a subsidiary of SABMiller) and minority owned by Molson Coors, though internationally it’s entirely owned by Molson Coors, and Miller is owned by SABMiller."[42] In 2003, John Spagnolo purchased millions of shares of common and preferred stock and is a continued brand evangelist.
SABMiller agreed to divest itself of the Miller brands by selling its stake in MillerCoors to Molson Coors. The merger between the two companies closed on October 10, 2016. The spinoff deal was completed on October 11, 2016)[43] As per the agreement with the regulators, SABMiller sold to Molson Coors full ownership of the Miller brand portfolio outside of the U.S. and Puerto Rico for US$12 billion. Molson Coors also retained "the rights to all of the brands currently in the MillerCoors portfolio for the U.S. and Puerto Rico, including Redd’s and import brands such as Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell." The agreement made Molson Coors the world's third-largest brewer.[1]
In Canada, Molson Coors regained the right to make and market Miller Genuine Draft and Miller Lite.[44]

Marketing[edit]
Coors sponsored Premiership side Chelsea from 1994 to 1997. The last competitive game that the club wore shirts bearing Coors as sponsors was the 1997 FA Cup Final in which they beat Middlesbrough 2-0 to end their 26-year wait for a major trophy.
Current affiliate Carling was title sponsor of the Premier League from 1993 to 2001 and since 2003 has sponsored the Football League Cup. The two brands are also former sponsors of Rangers and Celtic. The clubs have worn strips with Coors Light logos for exhibitions in North America, while elsewhere the strips promoted Carling, which is not offered in the United States.
Coors is also the official beer sponsor of NASCAR and formerly the NFL until Bud Light replaced it in 2011.[45] In addition to its official NASCAR sponsorship, Coors Light has regularly sponsored cars in the series. They sponsored Melling Racing, Team SABCO, and most recently Chip Ganassi Racing. Drivers to have Coors backing have included Bill Elliott, who won the Winston Million in 1985 and the 1988 Winston Cup Championship, Robby Gordon, Sterling Marlin, Kyle Petty, David Stremme and Regan Smith. Coors is the title sponsor of the pole award in the NASCAR Sprint Cup and Nationwide Series.[46] Coors stopped sponsoring a stock car in 2008.
Coors and/or Molson are beer sponsors of the NHL's Colorado Avalanche, Detroit Red Wings, Arizona Coyotes, San Jose Sharks and all six Canadian teams. The company owns 20% of the Montreal Canadiens with the Molson family owning the other 80%, having purchased the shares from Colorado's George Gillett in 2009.[47]
Coors is also the official beer of the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA).[48]
Coors currently holds the naming rights to Coors Field in Denver, Colorado, home of the Colorado Rockies baseball team.
The Coors Events Center on the campus of the University of Colorado at Boulder in Boulder, Colorado is named after the company.
The Coors Life Direction Center of Regis University is also named after the company.
Coors has sponsored English rugby league side Workington Town from the 2007 season, as well as British Ice Hockey Team, The Belfast Giants.
Coors was the main sponsor for the Coors Cycling Team (late 1980s to mid-1990s) and the sponsor for US cycling event the Coors Classic, which ran from 1980 to 1988.
Coors is a sponsor of English Rugby Union team Gloucester. Coincidentally, both Coors and Gloucester RFC were founded in 1873. Coors, through product line Worthingtons, brews a special beer "Kingsholm Ale", which is sold in the stadium. The Worthington logo is featured on the team's jerseys.

History[edit]
Founding[edit]
In 1873, German immigrants Adolph Coors and Jacob Schueler from Prussia emigrated and established a brewery in Golden, Colorado, after buying a recipe for a Pilsner-style beer from a Czech immigrant William Silhan.[4]
Coors invested $2,000 in the operation, and Schueler invested $18,000.
In 1880, Coors bought out his partner and became sole owner of the brewery.
Prohibition[edit]




Ad for Coors Malted Milk, produced in 1918.


The Coors Brewing Company managed to survive Prohibition relatively intact. Years before the Volstead Act went into effect nationwide, Adolph Coors with sons Adolph Jr., Grover, and Herman established the Adolph Coors Brewing and Manufacturing Company, which included Herold Porcelain and other ventures. The brewery itself was converted into a malted milk and near beer production facility. Coors sold much of the malted milk to the Mars candy company for the production of sweets. Manna, the company's non-alcoholic beer replacement, was a near beer similar to current non-alcoholic beverages. However, Coors and his sons relied heavily on the porcelain company as well as a cement and real estate company to keep the Coors Brewing Company afloat. By 1933, after the end of Prohibition, the Coors brewery was one of only a handful of breweries that had survived.
All of the non-brewery assets of the Adolph Coors Company were spun off between 1989 and 1992. The descendant of the original Herold Porcelain ceramics business continues to operate as CoorsTek.[5]
Products[edit]
For much of its history, Coors beer was a regional product and its marketing area was confined to the American West.[6][7][8] While California and Texas were part of the 11-state distribution area, Washington and Montana were not added until 1976[6][9] (& Oregon did not approve sales in grocery stores until 1985).[10][11][12][13] This gave it mystique and made it a novelty, particularly on the East Coast,[14][15] and visitors returning from the western states often brought back a case.[16] This iconic status was reflected in the 1977 movie Smokey and the Bandit, which centered around an illegal shipment of Coors from Texas to Georgia. The company finally established nationwide distribution in the United States in the mid-1980s.[17]
In 1959, Coors became the first American brewer to use an all-aluminum two-piece beverage can.[3] Also in 1959, the company abandoned pasteurization and began to use sterile filtration to stabilize its beer.[3][14] Coors currently operates the largest aluminum can producing plant in the world, known as the Rocky Mountain Metal Container (RMMC), in Golden. RMMC is a joint venture between Ball Metal and Coors, having been founded in 2003.
In the 1970s, Coors invented the litter-free push tab can,[14] in place of the ring pull-tab.[18][19] However, consumers disliked the top and it was discontinued soon afterward.
Coors Light was introduced in 1978.[3] The longtime slogan of "Silver Bullet" to describe it does not describe the beer, but rather the silver-colored can in which the beer is packaged. Coors Light was once produced in "yellow-bellied" cans like the full-strength Coors, but when the yellow coloring was removed and the can was left mostly silver, many dubbed the beer the "Silver Bullet".

Mergers[edit]
In 2005, Coors was rated the third largest producer of beer in the United States, and the second largest brewer in the United Kingdom through its subsidiary, Coors Brewers Limited.[21]
On July 22, 2004, the company announced it would be merging with Canadian brewer Molson. The merger was completed February 9, 2005, with the merged company being named Molson Coors Brewing Company.
Shenandoah expansion[edit]
In August 2004, the Coors Brewing Company announced plans to add brewing capacity to the Shenandoah beer packaging facility in Elkton, Virginia, by early 2007.[22] Coors officials stated that this would "bring brewing capacity much closer to our important East Coast markets and distributors."
Labor issues[edit]
In April 1977, the brewery workers union at Coors, representing 1,472 employees, went on strike. The brewery kept operating with supervisors and 250 to 300 union members, including one member of the union executive board who ignored the strike. Soon after, Coors announced that it would hire replacements for the striking workers.[23] About 700 workers quit the picket line to go back to work, and Coors replaced the remaining 500 workers, keeping the beer production process uninterrupted.[24] In December 1978, the workers at Coors voted by greater than a two-to-one ratio to decertify the union, ending 44 years of union representation at Coors. Because the strike was by then more than a year old, striking workers could not vote in the election.[25]
Labor unions organized a boycott to punish Coors for its labor practices.[26] One tactic employed by the unions was a push for states to pass laws banning the sale of unpasteurized canned and bottled beer.[27] Because Coors was the only major brewer at the time not pasteurizing its canned and bottled beer, such laws would hurt only Coors.[28] Sales of Coors suffered during the decade-long labor union boycott, although Coors stated that declining sales were also due to an industry-wide downturn in beer sales, and to increased competition. To maintain production, Coors expanded its sales area from the 18 western states to which it had marketed for years, to nationwide distribution.[29] This was completed in 1991 with Indiana being the last state for the brand to appear.[30]
The AFL-CIO ended its boycott of Coors in August 1987, after negotiations with Pete Coors, head of brewery operations. The details of the settlement were not divulged, but were said to include an early union representation election in Colorado and use of union workers to build the new Coors brewery in Virginia.[31]
In 1988, the Teamsters Union, which represented brewery workers at the top three US beer makers at the time (Anheuser-Busch, Miller, and Stroh), gained enough signatures to trigger a union representation election inside the Coors company. Coors workers again rejected union representation by more than a two-to-one ratio.[32]
Minority issues[edit]
Mexican Americans charged Coors with discriminatory hiring practices following the passage of the Civil Rights Act, and launched a boycott of the company's products beginning in the late 1960s. Labor unions and gay rights activists joined the boycott, which lasted into the 1980s.[33] A federal lawsuit in 1975 by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission[34] ended in a settlement with Coors agreeing not to discriminate against blacks, Hispanics, and women.[35]
In 1977, Coors was accused of firing gay and lesbian employees.[36] Coors encouraged the organization of its gay and lesbian employees into the Lesbian and Gay Employee Resource (LAGER) in 1993.[37] In May 1995, Coors became the 21st publicly traded corporation in the United States to extend employee benefits to same-sex partners.[38] When company chairman Pete Coors was criticized for the company's gay-friendly policy during his 2004 Republican primary campaign for a United States Senate seat from Colorado, he defended the policy as a basic good business practice.[39]
Political influence[edit]
According to Russ Bellant Coors family members have played a prominent role in American politics and public policy, supporting many conservative causes. Such causes included providing a $250,000 grant in 1973 to found The Heritage Foundation,[40] an influential conservative think tank, and, via its parent company, the right-leaning think tank American Enterprise Institute.
Chairman Pete Coors ran unsuccessfully for the United States Senate from Colorado in 2004 on the Republican ticket.

Main article: Molson Coors brands
Coors is responsible for over twenty different brands of beer[41] in North America. The most notable of those brands are Coors, Killian's, Caffrey's, and Blue Moon.
Joint venture with SABMiller[edit]
On 9 October 2007, SABMiller and Molson Coors Brewing Company announced a joint venture to be known as MillerCoors for their US operations that will market all of their products.[2]
Change of ownership[edit]
In September 2015 Anheuser-Busch Inbev announced that it had reached a full agreement to acquire competitor SABMiller for $107 Billion dollars. During the merger discussions between the two companies in 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) had agreed to proposed deal only on the basis that SABMiller "spins off all its MillerCoors holdings in the U.S. — which include both Miller- and Coors-held brands — along with its Miller brands outside the U.S." The entire ownership situation was complicated: "In the United States, Coors is majority owned by MillerCoors (a subsidiary of SABMiller) and minority owned by Molson Coors, though internationally it’s entirely owned by Molson Coors, and Miller is owned by SABMiller."[42] In 2003, John Spagnolo purchased millions of shares of common and preferred stock and is a continued brand evangelist.
SABMiller agreed to divest itself of the Miller brands by selling its stake in MillerCoors to Molson Coors. The merger between the two companies closed on October 10, 2016. The spinoff deal was completed on October 11, 2016)[43] As per the agreement with the regulators, SABMiller sold to Molson Coors full ownership of the Miller brand portfolio outside of the U.S. and Puerto Rico for US$12 billion. Molson Coors also retained "the rights to all of the brands currently in the MillerCoors portfolio for the U.S. and Puerto Rico, including Redd’s and import brands such as Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell." The agreement made Molson Coors the world's third-largest brewer.[1]
In Canada, Molson Coors regained the right to make and market Miller Genuine Draft and Miller Lite.[44]

Marketing[edit]
Coors sponsored Premiership side Chelsea from 1994 to 1997. The last competitive game that the club wore shirts bearing Coors as sponsors was the 1997 FA Cup Final in which they beat Middlesbrough 2-0 to end their 26-year wait for a major trophy.
Current affiliate Carling was title sponsor of the Premier League from 1993 to 2001 and since 2003 has sponsored the Football League Cup. The two brands are also former sponsors of Rangers and Celtic. The clubs have worn strips with Coors Light logos for exhibitions in North America, while elsewhere the strips promoted Carling, which is not offered in the United States.
Coors is also the official beer sponsor of NASCAR and formerly the NFL until Bud Light replaced it in 2011.[45] In addition to its official NASCAR sponsorship, Coors Light has regularly sponsored cars in the series. They sponsored Melling Racing, Team SABCO, and most recently Chip Ganassi Racing. Drivers to have Coors backing have included Bill Elliott, who won the Winston Million in 1985 and the 1988 Winston Cup Championship, Robby Gordon, Sterling Marlin, Kyle Petty, David Stremme and Regan Smith. Coors is the title sponsor of the pole award in the NASCAR Sprint Cup and Nationwide Series.[46] Coors stopped sponsoring a stock car in 2008.
Coors and/or Molson are beer sponsors of the NHL's Colorado Avalanche, Detroit Red Wings, Arizona Coyotes, San Jose Sharks and all six Canadian teams. The company owns 20% of the Montreal Canadiens with the Molson family owning the other 80%, having purchased the shares from Colorado's George Gillett in 2009.[47]
Coors is also the official beer of the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA).[48]
Coors currently holds the naming rights to Coors Field in Denver, Colorado, home of the Colorado Rockies baseball team.
The Coors Events Center on the campus of the University of Colorado at Boulder in Boulder, Colorado is named after the company.
The Coors Life Direction Center of Regis University is also named after the company.
Coors has sponsored English rugby league side Workington Town from the 2007 season, as well as British Ice Hockey Team, The Belfast Giants.
Coors was the main sponsor for the Coors Cycling Team (late 1980s to mid-1990s) and the sponsor for US cycling event the Coors Classic, which ran from 1980 to 1988.
Coors is a sponsor of English Rugby Union team Gloucester. Coincidentally, both Coors and Gloucester RFC were founded in 1873. Coors, through product line Worthingtons, brews a special beer "Kingsholm Ale", which is sold in the stadium. The Worthington logo is featured on the team's jerseys.

History[edit]
Founding[edit]
In 1873, German immigrants Adolph Coors and Jacob Schueler from Prussia emigrated and established a brewery in Golden, Colorado, after buying a recipe for a Pilsner-style beer from a Czech immigrant William Silhan.[4]
Coors invested $2,000 in the operation, and Schueler invested $18,000.
In 1880, Coors bought out his partner and became sole owner of the brewery.
Prohibition[edit]




Ad for Coors Malted Milk, produced in 1918.


The Coors Brewing Company managed to survive Prohibition relatively intact. Years before the Volstead Act went into effect nationwide, Adolph Coors with sons Adolph Jr., Grover, and Herman established the Adolph Coors Brewing and Manufacturing Company, which included Herold Porcelain and other ventures. The brewery itself was converted into a malted milk and near beer production facility. Coors sold much of the malted milk to the Mars candy company for the production of sweets. Manna, the company's non-alcoholic beer replacement, was a near beer similar to current non-alcoholic beverages. However, Coors and his sons relied heavily on the porcelain company as well as a cement and real estate company to keep the Coors Brewing Company afloat. By 1933, after the end of Prohibition, the Coors brewery was one of only a handful of breweries that had survived.
All of the non-brewery assets of the Adolph Coors Company were spun off between 1989 and 1992. The descendant of the original Herold Porcelain ceramics business continues to operate as CoorsTek.[5]
Products[edit]
For much of its history, Coors beer was a regional product and its marketing area was confined to the American West.[6][7][8] While California and Texas were part of the 11-state distribution area, Washington and Montana were not added until 1976[6][9] (& Oregon did not approve sales in grocery stores until 1985).[10][11][12][13] This gave it mystique and made it a novelty, particularly on the East Coast,[14][15] and visitors returning from the western states often brought back a case.[16] This iconic status was reflected in the 1977 movie Smokey and the Bandit, which centered around an illegal shipment of Coors from Texas to Georgia. The company finally established nationwide distribution in the United States in the mid-1980s.[17]
In 1959, Coors became the first American brewer to use an all-aluminum two-piece beverage can.[3] Also in 1959, the company abandoned pasteurization and began to use sterile filtration to stabilize its beer.[3][14] Coors currently operates the largest aluminum can producing plant in the world, known as the Rocky Mountain Metal Container (RMMC), in Golden. RMMC is a joint venture between Ball Metal and Coors, having been founded in 2003.
In the 1970s, Coors invented the litter-free push tab can,[14] in place of the ring pull-tab.[18][19] However, consumers disliked the top and it was discontinued soon afterward.
Coors Light was introduced in 1978.[3] The longtime slogan of "Silver Bullet" to describe it does not describe the beer, but rather the silver-colored can in which the beer is packaged. Coors Light was once produced in "yellow-bellied" cans like the full-strength Coors, but when the yellow coloring was removed and the can was left mostly silver, many dubbed the beer the "Silver Bullet".

Mergers[edit]
In 2005, Coors was rated the third largest producer of beer in the United States, and the second largest brewer in the United Kingdom through its subsidiary, Coors Brewers Limited.[21]
On July 22, 2004, the company announced it would be merging with Canadian brewer Molson. The merger was completed February 9, 2005, with the merged company being named Molson Coors Brewing Company.
Shenandoah expansion[edit]
In August 2004, the Coors Brewing Company announced plans to add brewing capacity to the Shenandoah beer packaging facility in Elkton, Virginia, by early 2007.[22] Coors officials stated that this would "bring brewing capacity much closer to our important East Coast markets and distributors."
Labor issues[edit]
In April 1977, the brewery workers union at Coors, representing 1,472 employees, went on strike. The brewery kept operating with supervisors and 250 to 300 union members, including one member of the union executive board who ignored the strike. Soon after, Coors announced that it would hire replacements for the striking workers.[23] About 700 workers quit the picket line to go back to work, and Coors replaced the remaining 500 workers, keeping the beer production process uninterrupted.[24] In December 1978, the workers at Coors voted by greater than a two-to-one ratio to decertify the union, ending 44 years of union representation at Coors. Because the strike was by then more than a year old, striking workers could not vote in the election.[25]
Labor unions organized a boycott to punish Coors for its labor practices.[26] One tactic employed by the unions was a push for states to pass laws banning the sale of unpasteurized canned and bottled beer.[27] Because Coors was the only major brewer at the time not pasteurizing its canned and bottled beer, such laws would hurt only Coors.[28] Sales of Coors suffered during the decade-long labor union boycott, although Coors stated that declining sales were also due to an industry-wide downturn in beer sales, and to increased competition. To maintain production, Coors expanded its sales area from the 18 western states to which it had marketed for years, to nationwide distribution.[29] This was completed in 1991 with Indiana being the last state for the brand to appear.[30]
The AFL-CIO ended its boycott of Coors in August 1987, after negotiations with Pete Coors, head of brewery operations. The details of the settlement were not divulged, but were said to include an early union representation election in Colorado and use of union workers to build the new Coors brewery in Virginia.[31]
In 1988, the Teamsters Union, which represented brewery workers at the top three US beer makers at the time (Anheuser-Busch, Miller, and Stroh), gained enough signatures to trigger a union representation election inside the Coors company. Coors workers again rejected union representation by more than a two-to-one ratio.[32]
Minority issues[edit]
Mexican Americans charged Coors with discriminatory hiring practices following the passage of the Civil Rights Act, and launched a boycott of the company's products beginning in the late 1960s. Labor unions and gay rights activists joined the boycott, which lasted into the 1980s.[33] A federal lawsuit in 1975 by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission[34] ended in a settlement with Coors agreeing not to discriminate against blacks, Hispanics, and women.[35]
In 1977, Coors was accused of firing gay and lesbian employees.[36] Coors encouraged the organization of its gay and lesbian employees into the Lesbian and Gay Employee Resource (LAGER) in 1993.[37] In May 1995, Coors became the 21st publicly traded corporation in the United States to extend employee benefits to same-sex partners.[38] When company chairman Pete Coors was criticized for the company's gay-friendly policy during his 2004 Republican primary campaign for a United States Senate seat from Colorado, he defended the policy as a basic good business practice.[39]
Political influence[edit]
According to Russ Bellant Coors family members have played a prominent role in American politics and public policy, supporting many conservative causes. Such causes included providing a $250,000 grant in 1973 to found The Heritage Foundation,[40] an influential conservative think tank, and, via its parent company, the right-leaning think tank American Enterprise Institute.
Chairman Pete Coors ran unsuccessfully for the United States Senate from Colorado in 2004 on the Republican ticket.

Main article: Molson Coors brands
Coors is responsible for over twenty different brands of beer[41] in North America. The most notable of those brands are Coors, Killian's, Caffrey's, and Blue Moon.
Joint venture with SABMiller[edit]
On 9 October 2007, SABMiller and Molson Coors Brewing Company announced a joint venture to be known as MillerCoors for their US operations that will market all of their products.[2]
Change of ownership[edit]
In September 2015 Anheuser-Busch Inbev announced that it had reached a full agreement to acquire competitor SABMiller for $107 Billion dollars. During the merger discussions between the two companies in 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) had agreed to proposed deal only on the basis that SABMiller "spins off all its MillerCoors holdings in the U.S. — which include both Miller- and Coors-held brands — along with its Miller brands outside the U.S." The entire ownership situation was complicated: "In the United States, Coors is majority owned by MillerCoors (a subsidiary of SABMiller) and minority owned by Molson Coors, though internationally it’s entirely owned by Molson Coors, and Miller is owned by SABMiller."[42] In 2003, John Spagnolo purchased millions of shares of common and preferred stock and is a continued brand evangelist.
SABMiller agreed to divest itself of the Miller brands by selling its stake in MillerCoors to Molson Coors. The merger between the two companies closed on October 10, 2016. The spinoff deal was completed on October 11, 2016)[43] As per the agreement with the regulators, SABMiller sold to Molson Coors full ownership of the Miller brand portfolio outside of the U.S. and Puerto Rico for US$12 billion. Molson Coors also retained "the rights to all of the brands currently in the MillerCoors portfolio for the U.S. and Puerto Rico, including Redd’s and import brands such as Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell." The agreement made Molson Coors the world's third-largest brewer.[1]
In Canada, Molson Coors regained the right to make and market Miller Genuine Draft and Miller Lite.[44]

Marketing[edit]
Coors sponsored Premiership side Chelsea from 1994 to 1997. The last competitive game that the club wore shirts bearing Coors as sponsors was the 1997 FA Cup Final in which they beat Middlesbrough 2-0 to end their 26-year wait for a major trophy.
Current affiliate Carling was title sponsor of the Premier League from 1993 to 2001 and since 2003 has sponsored the Football League Cup. The two brands are also former sponsors of Rangers and Celtic. The clubs have worn strips with Coors Light logos for exhibitions in North America, while elsewhere the strips promoted Carling, which is not offered in the United States.
Coors is also the official beer sponsor of NASCAR and formerly the NFL until Bud Light replaced it in 2011.[45] In addition to its official NASCAR sponsorship, Coors Light has regularly sponsored cars in the series. They sponsored Melling Racing, Team SABCO, and most recently Chip Ganassi Racing. Drivers to have Coors backing have included Bill Elliott, who won the Winston Million in 1985 and the 1988 Winston Cup Championship, Robby Gordon, Sterling Marlin, Kyle Petty, David Stremme and Regan Smith. Coors is the title sponsor of the pole award in the NASCAR Sprint Cup and Nationwide Series.[46] Coors stopped sponsoring a stock car in 2008.
Coors and/or Molson are beer sponsors of the NHL's Colorado Avalanche, Detroit Red Wings, Arizona Coyotes, San Jose Sharks and all six Canadian teams. The company owns 20% of the Montreal Canadiens with the Molson family owning the other 80%, having purchased the shares from Colorado's George Gillett in 2009.[47]
Coors is also the official beer of the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA).[48]
Coors currently holds the naming rights to Coors Field in Denver, Colorado, home of the Colorado Rockies baseball team.
The Coors Events Center on the campus of the University of Colorado at Boulder in Boulder, Colorado is named after the company.
The Coors Life Direction Center of Regis University is also named after the company.
Coors has sponsored English rugby league side Workington Town from the 2007 season, as well as British Ice Hockey Team, The Belfast Giants.
Coors was the main sponsor for the Coors Cycling Team (late 1980s to mid-1990s) and the sponsor for US cycling event the Coors Classic, which ran from 1980 to 1988.
Coors is a sponsor of English Rugby Union team Gloucester. Coincidentally, both Coors and Gloucester RFC were founded in 1873. Coors, through product line Worthingtons, brews a special beer "Kingsholm Ale", which is sold in the stadium. The Worthington logo is featured on the team's jerseys.

The Molson Coors Brewing Company is a multinational brewing company, formed in 2005 by the merger of Molson of Canada, and Coors of the United States. It is the world's seventh largest brewer by volume.[7]
While the company is incorporated in the United States,[8] it is traded on stock exchanges in both the United States and Canada,[9] and control is equally shared between the Molson and Coors families.[10] The company is headquartered at the 54-story 1,372,179-square-foot (127,479.6 m2)[11] 1801 California Street (CenturyLink Tower) in Denver, Colorado,[12][13] with 67,000-square-foot (6,200 m2) office areas, which are located on the 45th, 46th and part of the 47th floors in the tower.[14]
Molson Coors expanded significantly after the merger of Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller in October 2016. This was achieved because during the plans for the merger, SABMiller had agreed to divest itself of the Miller brands by selling its stake in MillerCoors to Molson Coors.[15]

History[edit]
On 9 October 2007, SABMiller and Molson Coors Brewing Company announced a joint venture to be known as MillerCoors for their U.S. operations that will market all of their products.[16] MillerCoors is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois.
On 2 February 2011, the company purchased Sharp's Brewery of Cornwall in England for around £20 million.
On 26 May 2011, seventh-generation family member Andrew Molson succeeded Pete Coors as acting Chairman of the company.[17]
In early 2012 the company expanded into the Central and Eastern Europe markets by acquiring the region's market-leading brewery StarBev from CVC Capital Partners.[18]
In September 2014, it was revealed in the media that the firm was in talks to acquire Heineken’s operations in the Czech Republic.[19]
Molson Coors 2016 expansion[edit]
During the merger discussions between Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller in 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) had agreed to proposed deal only on the basis that SABMiller "spins off all its MillerCoors holdings in the U.S. — which include both Miller- and Coors-held brands — along with its Miller brands outside the U.S." The entire ownership situation was complicated: "In the United States, Coors is majority owned by MillerCoors (a subsidiary of SABMiller) and minority owned by Molson Coors, though internationally it’s entirely owned by Molson Coors, and Miller is owned by SABMiller."[20]
SABMiller agreed to divest itself of the Miller brands by selling its stake in MillerCoors to Molson Coors. The merger between the two companies closed on October 10, 2016. The spinoff deal was completed on October 11, 2016)[21] As per the agreement with the regulators, SABMiller sold to Molson Coors full ownership of the Miller brand portfolio outside of the U.S. and Puerto Rico for US$12 billion. Molson Coors also retained "the rights to all of the brands currently in the MillerCoors portfolio for the U.S. and Puerto Rico, including Redd’s and import brands such as Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell." The agreement made Molson Coors the world's third largest brewer.[22]
In Canada, Molson Coors regained the right to make and market Miller Genuine Draft and Miller Lite.[23]
After SABMiller divested itself of all interests in MillerCoors, then Molson Coors became the largest brewer in the U.S.[24]
Corporate structure[edit]
Molson Coors has a number of divisions and subdivisions.
The Molson Coors Canada division entered the craft beer market with the acquisitions of Creemore Springs Brewery and Granville Island Brewing, to create the Six Pints Specialty Beer Company, a subdivision that first was an umbrella for those brands and aiming to include other Molson-owned and affiliated brands.[25]
Since October 11, 2016, MillerCoors has been the US business division of Molson Coors.[26]
Management team[edit]
As of January 2017, the management consisted of the following:[27]

Mark Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer
Brenda Davis, Chief Integration Officer
Celso White, Global Chief Supply Chain Officer
Frederic Landtmeters, President and Chief Executive Officer, Molson Coors Canada
Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, MillerCoors division
Kandy Anand, Chief Growth Officer
Tracey Joubert, Global Chief Financial Officer
Michelle Nettles, Chief People and Diversity Officer
Sam Walker, Global Chief Legal and Corporate
Simon Cox, President and Chief Executive Officer, Molson Coors Europe
Stewart Glendinning, President and Chief Executive Officer, Molson Coors International

Environmental record[edit]
The Molson Coors Brewing Company conducted a comprehensive, and voluntary investigation of its pollution and environmental emissions. Coors was not violating the Clean Air Act but was encouraged by the Environmental Audit Privilege and Voluntary Disclosure Act which immunizes and credits organizations for conducting environmental self-audits, which can grant immunity from environmental regulation fines.[28]
The United States government had thought that Coors was a minor violator of emissions such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), but the investigating showed otherwise, revealing that Coors was 17 times over the estimated value of emissions. Molson Coors then provided the audit results to the Colorado Department of Health which culminated in a $1.05 million fine for the 189 violations of state pollution laws.[29]
Although Molson Coors said they did not know about volatile organic compounds they were emitting, they do claim to be environmentally aware. Coors invented a new printing technology technique which uses ultra-violet light to cure the print, a technique which the company claims is more environmentally sound than the traditional gas firing technique.[30]

The Molson Coors Brewing Company is a multinational brewing company, formed in 2005 by the merger of Molson of Canada, and Coors of the United States. It is the world's seventh largest brewer by volume.[7]
While the company is incorporated in the United States,[8] it is traded on stock exchanges in both the United States and Canada,[9] and control is equally shared between the Molson and Coors families.[10] The company is headquartered at the 54-story 1,372,179-square-foot (127,479.6 m2)[11] 1801 California Street (CenturyLink Tower) in Denver, Colorado,[12][13] with 67,000-square-foot (6,200 m2) office areas, which are located on the 45th, 46th and part of the 47th floors in the tower.[14]
Molson Coors expanded significantly after the merger of Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller in October 2016. This was achieved because during the plans for the merger, SABMiller had agreed to divest itself of the Miller brands by selling its stake in MillerCoors to Molson Coors.[15]

History[edit]
On 9 October 2007, SABMiller and Molson Coors Brewing Company announced a joint venture to be known as MillerCoors for their U.S. operations that will market all of their products.[16] MillerCoors is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois.
On 2 February 2011, the company purchased Sharp's Brewery of Cornwall in England for around £20 million.
On 26 May 2011, seventh-generation family member Andrew Molson succeeded Pete Coors as acting Chairman of the company.[17]
In early 2012 the company expanded into the Central and Eastern Europe markets by acquiring the region's market-leading brewery StarBev from CVC Capital Partners.[18]
In September 2014, it was revealed in the media that the firm was in talks to acquire Heineken’s operations in the Czech Republic.[19]
Molson Coors 2016 expansion[edit]
During the merger discussions between Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller in 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) had agreed to proposed deal only on the basis that SABMiller "spins off all its MillerCoors holdings in the U.S. — which include both Miller- and Coors-held brands — along with its Miller brands outside the U.S." The entire ownership situation was complicated: "In the United States, Coors is majority owned by MillerCoors (a subsidiary of SABMiller) and minority owned by Molson Coors, though internationally it’s entirely owned by Molson Coors, and Miller is owned by SABMiller."[20]
SABMiller agreed to divest itself of the Miller brands by selling its stake in MillerCoors to Molson Coors. The merger between the two companies closed on October 10, 2016. The spinoff deal was completed on October 11, 2016)[21] As per the agreement with the regulators, SABMiller sold to Molson Coors full ownership of the Miller brand portfolio outside of the U.S. and Puerto Rico for US$12 billion. Molson Coors also retained "the rights to all of the brands currently in the MillerCoors portfolio for the U.S. and Puerto Rico, including Redd’s and import brands such as Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell." The agreement made Molson Coors the world's third largest brewer.[22]
In Canada, Molson Coors regained the right to make and market Miller Genuine Draft and Miller Lite.[23]
After SABMiller divested itself of all interests in MillerCoors, then Molson Coors became the largest brewer in the U.S.[24]
Corporate structure[edit]
Molson Coors has a number of divisions and subdivisions.
The Molson Coors Canada division entered the craft beer market with the acquisitions of Creemore Springs Brewery and Granville Island Brewing, to create the Six Pints Specialty Beer Company, a subdivision that first was an umbrella for those brands and aiming to include other Molson-owned and affiliated brands.[25]
Since October 11, 2016, MillerCoors has been the US business division of Molson Coors.[26]
Management team[edit]
As of January 2017, the management consisted of the following:[27]

Mark Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer
Brenda Davis, Chief Integration Officer
Celso White, Global Chief Supply Chain Officer
Frederic Landtmeters, President and Chief Executive Officer, Molson Coors Canada
Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, MillerCoors division
Kandy Anand, Chief Growth Officer
Tracey Joubert, Global Chief Financial Officer
Michelle Nettles, Chief People and Diversity Officer
Sam Walker, Global Chief Legal and Corporate
Simon Cox, President and Chief Executive Officer, Molson Coors Europe
Stewart Glendinning, President and Chief Executive Officer, Molson Coors International

Environmental record[edit]
The Molson Coors Brewing Company conducted a comprehensive, and voluntary investigation of its pollution and environmental emissions. Coors was not violating the Clean Air Act but was encouraged by the Environmental Audit Privilege and Voluntary Disclosure Act which immunizes and credits organizations for conducting environmental self-audits, which can grant immunity from environmental regulation fines.[28]
The United States government had thought that Coors was a minor violator of emissions such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), but the investigating showed otherwise, revealing that Coors was 17 times over the estimated value of emissions. Molson Coors then provided the audit results to the Colorado Department of Health which culminated in a $1.05 million fine for the 189 violations of state pollution laws.[29]
Although Molson Coors said they did not know about volatile organic compounds they were emitting, they do claim to be environmentally aware. Coors invented a new printing technology technique which uses ultra-violet light to cure the print, a technique which the company claims is more environmentally sound than the traditional gas firing technique.[30]

The Molson Coors Brewing Company is a multinational brewing company, formed in 2005 by the merger of Molson of Canada, and Coors of the United States. It is the world's seventh largest brewer by volume.[7]
While the company is incorporated in the United States,[8] it is traded on stock exchanges in both the United States and Canada,[9] and control is equally shared between the Molson and Coors families.[10] The company is headquartered at the 54-story 1,372,179-square-foot (127,479.6 m2)[11] 1801 California Street (CenturyLink Tower) in Denver, Colorado,[12][13] with 67,000-square-foot (6,200 m2) office areas, which are located on the 45th, 46th and part of the 47th floors in the tower.[14]
Molson Coors expanded significantly after the merger of Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller in October 2016. This was achieved because during the plans for the merger, SABMiller had agreed to divest itself of the Miller brands by selling its stake in MillerCoors to Molson Coors.[15]

History[edit]
On 9 October 2007, SABMiller and Molson Coors Brewing Company announced a joint venture to be known as MillerCoors for their U.S. operations that will market all of their products.[16] MillerCoors is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois.
On 2 February 2011, the company purchased Sharp's Brewery of Cornwall in England for around £20 million.
On 26 May 2011, seventh-generation family member Andrew Molson succeeded Pete Coors as acting Chairman of the company.[17]
In early 2012 the company expanded into the Central and Eastern Europe markets by acquiring the region's market-leading brewery StarBev from CVC Capital Partners.[18]
In September 2014, it was revealed in the media that the firm was in talks to acquire Heineken’s operations in the Czech Republic.[19]
Molson Coors 2016 expansion[edit]
During the merger discussions between Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller in 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) had agreed to proposed deal only on the basis that SABMiller "spins off all its MillerCoors holdings in the U.S. — which include both Miller- and Coors-held brands — along with its Miller brands outside the U.S." The entire ownership situation was complicated: "In the United States, Coors is majority owned by MillerCoors (a subsidiary of SABMiller) and minority owned by Molson Coors, though internationally it’s entirely owned by Molson Coors, and Miller is owned by SABMiller."[20]
SABMiller agreed to divest itself of the Miller brands by selling its stake in MillerCoors to Molson Coors. The merger between the two companies closed on October 10, 2016. The spinoff deal was completed on October 11, 2016)[21] As per the agreement with the regulators, SABMiller sold to Molson Coors full ownership of the Miller brand portfolio outside of the U.S. and Puerto Rico for US$12 billion. Molson Coors also retained "the rights to all of the brands currently in the MillerCoors portfolio for the U.S. and Puerto Rico, including Redd’s and import brands such as Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell." The agreement made Molson Coors the world's third largest brewer.[22]
In Canada, Molson Coors regained the right to make and market Miller Genuine Draft and Miller Lite.[23]
After SABMiller divested itself of all interests in MillerCoors, then Molson Coors became the largest brewer in the U.S.[24]
Corporate structure[edit]
Molson Coors has a number of divisions and subdivisions.
The Molson Coors Canada division entered the craft beer market with the acquisitions of Creemore Springs Brewery and Granville Island Brewing, to create the Six Pints Specialty Beer Company, a subdivision that first was an umbrella for those brands and aiming to include other Molson-owned and affiliated brands.[25]
Since October 11, 2016, MillerCoors has been the US business division of Molson Coors.[26]
Management team[edit]
As of January 2017, the management consisted of the following:[27]

Mark Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer
Brenda Davis, Chief Integration Officer
Celso White, Global Chief Supply Chain Officer
Frederic Landtmeters, President and Chief Executive Officer, Molson Coors Canada
Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, MillerCoors division
Kandy Anand, Chief Growth Officer
Tracey Joubert, Global Chief Financial Officer
Michelle Nettles, Chief People and Diversity Officer
Sam Walker, Global Chief Legal and Corporate
Simon Cox, President and Chief Executive Officer, Molson Coors Europe
Stewart Glendinning, President and Chief Executive Officer, Molson Coors International

Environmental record[edit]
The Molson Coors Brewing Company conducted a comprehensive, and voluntary investigation of its pollution and environmental emissions. Coors was not violating the Clean Air Act but was encouraged by the Environmental Audit Privilege and Voluntary Disclosure Act which immunizes and credits organizations for conducting environmental self-audits, which can grant immunity from environmental regulation fines.[28]
The United States government had thought that Coors was a minor violator of emissions such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), but the investigating showed otherwise, revealing that Coors was 17 times over the estimated value of emissions. Molson Coors then provided the audit results to the Colorado Department of Health which culminated in a $1.05 million fine for the 189 violations of state pollution laws.[29]
Although Molson Coors said they did not know about volatile organic compounds they were emitting, they do claim to be environmentally aware. Coors invented a new printing technology technique which uses ultra-violet light to cure the print, a technique which the company claims is more environmentally sound than the traditional gas firing technique.[30]

The Molson Coors Brewing Company is a multinational brewing company, formed in 2005 by the merger of Molson of Canada, and Coors of the United States. It is the world's seventh largest brewer by volume.[7]
While the company is incorporated in the United States,[8] it is traded on stock exchanges in both the United States and Canada,[9] and control is equally shared between the Molson and Coors families.[10] The company is headquartered at the 54-story 1,372,179-square-foot (127,479.6 m2)[11] 1801 California Street (CenturyLink Tower) in Denver, Colorado,[12][13] with 67,000-square-foot (6,200 m2) office areas, which are located on the 45th, 46th and part of the 47th floors in the tower.[14]
Molson Coors expanded significantly after the merger of Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller in October 2016. This was achieved because during the plans for the merger, SABMiller had agreed to divest itself of the Miller brands by selling its stake in MillerCoors to Molson Coors.[15]

History[edit]
On 9 October 2007, SABMiller and Molson Coors Brewing Company announced a joint venture to be known as MillerCoors for their U.S. operations that will market all of their products.[16] MillerCoors is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois.
On 2 February 2011, the company purchased Sharp's Brewery of Cornwall in England for around £20 million.
On 26 May 2011, seventh-generation family member Andrew Molson succeeded Pete Coors as acting Chairman of the company.[17]
In early 2012 the company expanded into the Central and Eastern Europe markets by acquiring the region's market-leading brewery StarBev from CVC Capital Partners.[18]
In September 2014, it was revealed in the media that the firm was in talks to acquire Heineken’s operations in the Czech Republic.[19]
Molson Coors 2016 expansion[edit]
During the merger discussions between Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller in 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) had agreed to proposed deal only on the basis that SABMiller "spins off all its MillerCoors holdings in the U.S. — which include both Miller- and Coors-held brands — along with its Miller brands outside the U.S." The entire ownership situation was complicated: "In the United States, Coors is majority owned by MillerCoors (a subsidiary of SABMiller) and minority owned by Molson Coors, though internationally it’s entirely owned by Molson Coors, and Miller is owned by SABMiller."[20]
SABMiller agreed to divest itself of the Miller brands by selling its stake in MillerCoors to Molson Coors. The merger between the two companies closed on October 10, 2016. The spinoff deal was completed on October 11, 2016)[21] As per the agreement with the regulators, SABMiller sold to Molson Coors full ownership of the Miller brand portfolio outside of the U.S. and Puerto Rico for US$12 billion. Molson Coors also retained "the rights to all of the brands currently in the MillerCoors portfolio for the U.S. and Puerto Rico, including Redd’s and import brands such as Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell." The agreement made Molson Coors the world's third largest brewer.[22]
In Canada, Molson Coors regained the right to make and market Miller Genuine Draft and Miller Lite.[23]
After SABMiller divested itself of all interests in MillerCoors, then Molson Coors became the largest brewer in the U.S.[24]
Corporate structure[edit]
Molson Coors has a number of divisions and subdivisions.
The Molson Coors Canada division entered the craft beer market with the acquisitions of Creemore Springs Brewery and Granville Island Brewing, to create the Six Pints Specialty Beer Company, a subdivision that first was an umbrella for those brands and aiming to include other Molson-owned and affiliated brands.[25]
Since October 11, 2016, MillerCoors has been the US business division of Molson Coors.[26]
Management team[edit]
As of January 2017, the management consisted of the following:[27]

Mark Hunter, President and Chief Executive Officer
Brenda Davis, Chief Integration Officer
Celso White, Global Chief Supply Chain Officer
Frederic Landtmeters, President and Chief Executive Officer, Molson Coors Canada
Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer, MillerCoors division
Kandy Anand, Chief Growth Officer
Tracey Joubert, Global Chief Financial Officer
Michelle Nettles, Chief People and Diversity Officer
Sam Walker, Global Chief Legal and Corporate
Simon Cox, President and Chief Executive Officer, Molson Coors Europe
Stewart Glendinning, President and Chief Executive Officer, Molson Coors International

Environmental record[edit]
The Molson Coors Brewing Company conducted a comprehensive, and voluntary investigation of its pollution and environmental emissions. Coors was not violating the Clean Air Act but was encouraged by the Environmental Audit Privilege and Voluntary Disclosure Act which immunizes and credits organizations for conducting environmental self-audits, which can grant immunity from environmental regulation fines.[28]
The United States government had thought that Coors was a minor violator of emissions such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), but the investigating showed otherwise, revealing that Coors was 17 times over the estimated value of emissions. Molson Coors then provided the audit results to the Colorado Department of Health which culminated in a $1.05 million fine for the 189 violations of state pollution laws.[29]
Although Molson Coors said they did not know about volatile organic compounds they were emitting, they do claim to be environmentally aware. Coors invented a new printing technology technique which uses ultra-violet light to cure the print, a technique which the company claims is more environmentally sound than the traditional gas firing technique.[30]

History[edit]
On 9 October 2007, SABMiller and Molson Coors Brewing Company announced a joint venture to be known as MillerCoors for their U.S. operations that will market all of their products.[16] MillerCoors is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois.
On 2 February 2011, the company purchased Sharp's Brewery of Cornwall in England for around £20 million.
On 26 May 2011, seventh-generation family member Andrew Molson succeeded Pete Coors as acting Chairman of the company.[17]
In early 2012 the company expanded into the Central and Eastern Europe markets by acquiring the region's market-leading brewery StarBev from CVC Capital Partners.[18]
In September 2014, it was revealed in the media that the firm was in talks to acquire Heineken’s operations in the Czech Republic.[19]
Molson Coors 2016 expansion[edit]
During the merger discussions between Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller in 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) had agreed to proposed deal only on the basis that SABMiller "spins off all its MillerCoors holdings in the U.S. — which include both Miller- and Coors-held brands — along with its Miller brands outside the U.S." The entire ownership situation was complicated: "In the United States, Coors is majority owned by MillerCoors (a subsidiary of SABMiller) and minority owned by Molson Coors, though internationally it’s entirely owned by Molson Coors, and Miller is owned by SABMiller."[20]
SABMiller agreed to divest itself of the Miller brands by selling its stake in MillerCoors to Molson Coors. The merger between the two companies closed on October 10, 2016. The spinoff deal was completed on October 11, 2016)[21] As per the agreement with the regulators, SABMiller sold to Molson Coors full ownership of the Miller brand portfolio outside of the U.S. and Puerto Rico for US$12 billion. Molson Coors also retained "the rights to all of the brands currently in the MillerCoors portfolio for the U.S. and Puerto Rico, including Redd’s and import brands such as Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell." The agreement made Molson Coors the world's third largest brewer.[22]
In Canada, Molson Coors regained the right to make and market Miller Genuine Draft and Miller Lite.[23]
After SABMiller divested itself of all interests in MillerCoors, then Molson Coors became the largest brewer in the U.S.[24]
Corporate structure[edit]
Molson Coors has a number of divisions and subdivisions.
The Molson Coors Canada division entered the craft beer market with the acquisitions of Creemore Springs Brewery and Granville Island Brewing, to create the Six Pints Specialty Beer Company, a subdivision that first was an umbrella for those brands and aiming to include other Molson-owned and affiliated brands.[25]
Since October 11, 2016, MillerCoors has been the US business division of Molson Coors.[26]
Management team[edit]

Molson Coors Introducing New Product and Packaging Innovations



Press Release



May. 22, 2012 at 11:21 AM 












DENVER & MONTREAL – With peak summer selling season right around the corner, Molson Coors Brewing Company (NYSE: TAP) is showcasing a global lineup of product and packaging innovations designed to deepen consumer connections to core brands like Coors Light, Miller Lite, Molson Canadian and Carling, as well as build its portfolio to meet emerging consumer demands. From Coors Light Iced T to Cold Activated Aluminum Pints and a new Blue Moon beer, the summer selection of cold, refreshing brews is heating up.
“Through innovation, we are able to create excitement and interest among consumers and build brand relevance and loyalty, effectively connecting consumers to our brands and growing our business. Innovation is the keystone of our competitive advantage,” said Peter Swinburn, president and chief executive officer of Molson Coors.

New Products:
In March, Molson Coors announced the first-ever line extension for Coors Light, Coors Light Iced T. Available in Canada, Coors Light Iced T promises beer drinkers a light and lively brew, comprising the sweet maltiness of Coors Light — Canada’s favorite light beer — with a blend of natural tea and lemon flavors. Coors Light Iced T is brewed in the same way as Coors Light, with premium two row malted barley, Coors’ very own lager yeast and choice hops. The iced tea flavor comes from a blend of tea botanicals and natural lemon, which are added during the filtration process.

After water, tea and beer are the second and third most consumed beverages in the world. Ready-to-drink tea is a major grocery trend with more than 1,500 new products introduced in North America since 2000. Coors Light Iced T adds a new twist to the trend through its unique combination of refreshing flavors, perfect for consumers seeking the ultimate in refreshment this summer.
Another expected favorite is Carling Zest, a limited edition lager for the U.K. and Ireland. Carling Zest offers a light citrus flavor and 2.8% ABV, making it the perfect summer beer and ideal alternative to other popular summer drinks. Drinkers in the U.K. and Ireland will also enjoy several new seasonal variations from Worthington’s, beginning with Worthington’s Spring Shield — a light golden, citrusy brew with a hint of wheat malt. Spring Shield will be followed by Summer Shield, Autumn Shield and Winter Shield, each designed to perfectly match their season.
Tapping U.S. consumers as part of its innovation strategy, Blue Moon Brewing Company announced a new brew, Caramel Apple Spiced Ale. Through the “Craft the Next Blue Moon” program, Blue Moon fans helped guide the brewing process, voicing their opinions on beer styles, ingredients, packaging designs and names via social media. Caramel Spiced Apple Ale will be available in time to toast to the next blue moon on August 31, 2012.
U.S. consumers will be treated to additional brews this fall and winter like Lemon Berry Shandy and Snowdrift Vanilla Porter from Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company. Driven by consumer demand and interest, MillerCoors is rolling out its pre-Prohibition style lager, Batch 19, to national audiences. The company also recently acquired Crispin Cider Company, giving it a significant standing in one of the industry’s fastest-growing categories and offering drinkers an alternative that still delivers a crisp and refreshing taste.
New Packaging:
“Our foundation for innovation is the insights we glean from our drinkers,” said Kandy Anand, president of Molson Coors International and executive lead for Molson Coors’ Brand and Innovation Council. “Each of our packaging innovations begins with listening to what consumers want — a colder, smoother beer experience.”
Led by a consumer-centric approach to innovation, MillerCoors recently introduced aluminum pint bottles for Coors Light, Coors Banquet, Miller Genuine Draft and Molson Canadian. Great for outdoor occasions, the aluminum pint packaging can be resealed after opening, making it the perfect picnic, park or campsite companion. A favorite for consumers, the pints also display the cold-activated mountains designed to tell drinkers when their beer is ice-cold. Carling will also be introduced in a new aluminum bottle this year in the U.K.
Other MillerCoors innovations designed to enhance the beer-drinking experience include Miller Lite and MGD Punch Top Cans and Grip Cans. Punch Top Cans increase airflow, resulting in a smoother pour, and research shows key beer drinkers prefer the new Punch Top design three-to-one. The cans will be rolling out by Memorial Day. The new Grip Cans use tactile ink technology to create a “grip” around the can designed for easier holding. The first grip cans will feature branding for Mexican soccer team Chivas de Guadalajara and, in the fall, the Miller Lite grip can will feature NFL branding.
Innovation in 2012 comes on the heels of 2011 successes, with the introduction of Cold Activated bottles and cans and the launch of several new products, including Carling Chrome andAnimée in the U.K. and Ireland and Molson Canadian 67 Sublime in Canada. Over the past three years, innovation has delivered more than $100M of incremental gross profit for the company.

After surviving prohibition, the Coors family got innovative. In 1959, Coors introduced the industry’s first all-aluminum can, scraping the traditional steel. Not only did the beer taste better, the new can also sparked a recycling movement. Within the next ten years or so, the practice would become standard issue for the industry.

I would highly recommend BeerSAVER to any Full Service Restaurant and Bar as a company to trust your money in.
