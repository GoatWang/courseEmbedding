Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan
The Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, Ltd. (株式会社日本長期信用銀行 Kabushiki-kaisha  Nippon Chōki Shin’yō Ginkō?), abbreviated LTCB in English and Chōgin  (長銀?) in Japanese, was founded in 1952 under the direction of the  Shigeru Yoshida government to provide long-term financing to various  industries in Japan. Along with the Industrial Bank of Japan and the  Nippon Kangyo Bank, it was one of the major financiers of the postwar  economic development of Japan. After extensive problems with bad debt in  the 1990s, the bank was nationalized in 1998 and finally sold in 2000  to a group led by US-based Ripplewood Holdings. Ripplewood restructured  LTCB as a commercial bank, Shinsei Bank.
LTCB headquarters in Uchisaiwaicho, Tokyo, completed in 1993 and now occupied by Shinsei Bank, LTCB’s successor.
In 1988, LTCB acquired Greenwich Capital Markets, a Connecticut-based  securities firm, thus giving LTCB a US-based securities business as  well. By the early 1990s, it was the largest handler of yen-denominated  foreign debt (samurai bonds).
The Asian financial crisis of 1997, which bankrupted several major  Japanese financial services companies (most notably Hokkaido Takushoku  Bank), exacerbated the situation. The Diet injected an additional ¥176  billion into LTCB in March 1998, but a study commissioned later that  year showed that at least ¥920 billion was needed to handle the bad  debts. SBC (now part of UBS AG) began a joint venture with LTCB during  this period, which collapsed once the poor financial state of LTCB  became apparent.
LTCB briefly sought to merge with Sumitomo Trust and Banking, one of the  few stable Japanese banks at the time, but the latter discarded these  plans after its investors reacted strongly to the proposal. The Keizo  Obuchi government, which had helped to broker the talks between the  banks, then investigated the nationalization of LTCB, which became  effective by an act of the Diet on October 23, 1998.
Prosecutors opened criminal investigations of several LTCB executives,  owing to illegal payments of dividends in 1998 while the company was  insolvent. Corporate planning head Takashi Uehara committed suicide in  May 1999 shortly after his indictment was leaked to the public; Osaka  branch manager Kazunori Fukuda followed suit days later. The company  president Katsunobu Onogi and two others were arrested in June 1999: on  appeal, Onogi was sentenced to three years in prison and four years’  probation. The other two executives were sentenced to two years in  prison and three years’ probation. The executives were also sued for  damages, but an initial judgment in the creditors’ favor was overturned  on appeal
LTCB was purchased for ¥1 billion (US$9.5 million) in March 2000 by an  investment partnership, New LTCB Partners CV, consisting of a consortium  of foreign banks led by Ripplewood Holdings, which had bid against The  Chuo Mitsui Trust and Banking Co. for the acquisition of LTCB. The  company was renamed Shinsei Bank in June 2000. Although LTCB was  delisted from the TSE upon its purchase, Shinsei, which was relieved of  the bad debts of its predecessor, had a successful initial public  offering at 2004 and remains in operation today as a commercial bank.

North American operations were sold to Fleet Bank and Hongkong Bank of Canada respectively.
1987-1997 Thereafter the bank concentrated on its core domestic business as the restyled NatWest Group.
Then, in 1997, NatWest Markets, the corporate and investment banking arm  formed in 1992, revealed a £50m loss had been discovered, escalating to  £90.5m after further investigations. Investor and shareholder  confidence was so badly shaken that the Bank of England had to instruct  the board of directors to resist calls for the resignation of its most  senior executives in an effort to draw a line under the affair.[16]
National Westminster Bank Plc, commonly known as NatWest, is the  largest retail and commercial bank in the United Kingdom and has been  part of The Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc since 2000. The Royal Bank  of Scotland Group (RBS) is ranked as the second largest bank in the  world by assets.

-Sanwa Bank CA (and currency exchange agreement) (Japan Sanwa Bank, LTD)  long-term goal is to become the leading universal bank in the world.  …The bank entered a new phase of development in the United States in  1972 when it established the Sanwa Bank of California
•In 1953 Sanwa adopted a green clover-like symbol as its logo and  opened its first overseas office, in San Francisco, in anticipation of  the needs of Japanese exporters.
Sanwa redoubled its effort to expand in international banking and,  studying the Bank of America as a model, mapped out a strategy for  growth in the retail sector. It also moved its center of activity from  Osaka to the more dynamic Tokyo. Of the three “Osaka banks” (the others  being Sumitomo and Daiwa), Sanwa was most successful in exploiting the  growth of the Tokyo market.
The Sanwa Bank, Ltd. is the world’s most profitable bank and second only  to Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd. in terms of total assets. Its surge to  the top of the banking world during the mid-1990s has been based on the  serious efforts it has made in Japan to contain costs and expand its  retail base; expansion into North America in the 1980s; and an early  entry into and continued growth of its operations in the nascent  economies of Asia. The company’s long-term goal is to become the leading  universal bank in the world.
The bank entered a new phase of development in the United States in  1972 when it established the Sanwa Bank of California. This subsidiary  later acquired the Charter Bank and the Golden State Bank, both in  southern California, and in 1978 changed its name to Golden State Sanwa  Bank. Continuing its expansion in California–the world’s sixth-largest  economy–the bank acquired the First City Bank of Rosemead in 1981.  Sanwa’s 1980s activities in the United States peaked in 1986 with the  acquisition of Lloyds Bank California for US$263 million. With the deal,  Sanwa became the first Japanese bank to acquire a major U.S. bank.  Sanwa, meanwhile, opened offices in New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Dallas,  Boston, Los Angeles, Toronto, and Vancouver.
As lending and other traditional banking operations became less  profitable during the 1980s, Sanwa moved even further into predominantly  fee-based near-banking services, notably leasing. In 1984 it acquired a  leasing subsidiary from Continental Illinois Bank for US$500 million,  one of the largest Japanese takeovers to that date. Within the first  four years following the takeover, the renamed Sanwa Business Credit  Corporation–which was involved in vendor leasing and corporate,  commercial, and direct finance–doubled its business volume to US$1.2  billion. Also in 1984, Sanwa entered into a joint venture with Germany’s  Dresdner Bank and the Bank of China to form China Universal Leasing  Co., Ltd., which became the largest bank-affiliated leasing company in  China. Additional leasing operations were subsequently established in  Jakarta, Bangkok, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, and other Asian cities.
The year 1984 was also a key one for Sanwa in terms of its overall  management philosophy. That year the bank shifted its primary emphasis  from asset growth to increased profits, in fact setting a goal of  becoming the world’s most profitable bank. In addition to tightening  controls on costs, through cuts in the work force and other strategies,  Sanwa shifted its lending practices even more in the favor of small and  medium-sized businesses, generally considered less risky than large  corporations. By 1988, 73 percent of the bank’s loans went to smaller  corporations.
In 1988 Sanwa’s president, Hiroshi Watanabe, initiated another major  philosophical change when he scrapped what he considered the wishy-washy  aim of becoming known as “the people’s bank” of Japan. Rather, Watanabe  preferred a more concrete goal and settled on becoming “the global  leader in universal banking.”
In Sanwa’s initial efforts at reaching this lofty goal, its most  important actions occurred in Japan and elsewhere in Asia. In its home  market, Sanwa had a relatively weak standing in retail banking, with,  for example, only 79 branches and subbranches in Tokyo in 1988 compared  with at least 140 each for its major rivals. Rather than acquiring  smaller banks–as some of Sanwa’s competitors did to their later regret  after purchasing troubled banks–Sanwa concentrated on setting up an  extensive automated teller machine (ATM) network, which grew to number  653 by 1994. At the same time that this filled the bank’s need for  retail banking outlets, it also meshed nicely with Sanwa’s emphasis on  profits since 20 ATMs could be set up for the same cost as just one  branch, and the employeeless ATMs were much cheaper to operate. Sanwa  also pioneered in such profit-smart areas as electronic banking. And,  although its desire to expand into financial services was frustrated by  the slow pace of deregulation in Japan, Sanwa established a securities  operation there in 1994 and a trust business in 1995.
Perhaps even more important for Sanwa in the long run was the bank’s  aggressive moves into other Asian markets during the late 1980s and  early 1990s. Always the innovator, Sanwa established a branch in  Shenzhen in 1986, becoming the first Japanese commercial bank to enter  China. True to its roots, Sanwa’s overall strategy in China and  elsewhere in Asia was to focus on banking services for small and  medium-sized companies, which proved particularly successful in Hong  Kong. By 1994, Sanwa’s Asian operations included 18 offices in China and  Hong Kong; 18 more elsewhere in Asia; the Shanghai International  Finance Company Limited, a joint venture in merchant banking; and its  various leasing operations.
Sanwa’s aggressive international expansion had decreased its dependence  on the domestic market to a level below that of any of its rivals. In  1994, 32 percent of its revenues and 27 percent of its profits  originated outside Japan. Sanwa also weathered Japan’s lending crisis  and economic recession of the early 1990s much better than other  Japanese banks, and moved briefly to the top spot in worldwide banking  in 1995 in terms of assets (the 1996 merger of Bank of Tokyo and  Mitsubishi Bank pushed Sanwa down to number two). More important to  Sanwa’s overall goal, however, the bank was also able to achieve the top  spot in banking profitability in 1995, posting pretax profits of US$572  million.
Heading into the end of the 1990s, Sanwa was not yet the world leader in  universal banking, and observers noted weaknesses particularly in  Europe. Still, with rapid growth projected throughout Asia for the  foreseeable future and Sanwa far ahead of its rivals in these markets,  Sanwa was well-positioned to maintain a position near the top of world  banking into the 21st century.
