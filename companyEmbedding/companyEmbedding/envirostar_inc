FOR INFORMATION: 305.754.8676 Search for:  Menu Our HistoryHome → Company Overview → Our History Our history dates back to 1959, when William “Bill” Steiner founded Steiner Atlantic Corp. to distribute commercial laundry and dry cleaning products. While building his distribution business, Mr. Steiner’s entrepreneurial and inventive capabilities led him to create patented dry cleaning equipment that resulted in more efficient and environmentally friendly dry cleaning processes. In 1977, Mr. Steiner co-founded Dryclean USA®, which ultimately became the nation’s largest and most recognizable dry cleaning franchisor. Continuing the family history, in 1987, his son, Michael S. Steiner, joined Mr. Steiner and together they spent the next twenty-five years building, what became known as EnviroStar in 2009, into one of the most well respected distributors in the industry.In March 2015, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Henry M. Nahmad, joined EnviroStar when he acquired a controlling interest in EnviroStar from the Steiner family. Together, Henry M. Nahmad and Michael S. Steiner, Executive Vice President of the Company, are spearheading EnviroStar’s efforts to build a market leader through the execution of its buy-and-build strategy.Company OverviewOur HistoryOur Business StrategyOur Management TeamOur Board of Directors ©  EnviroStar, Inc., All Rights Reserved.

The cash portion of the purchase price will be funded in part by the private sale of 1,290,323 shares of EVI’s common stock to Symmetric Capital II LLC, a company controlled by EVI’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, at $4.65 per share, which was the closing price of EVI’s common stock on the NYSE MKT on September 6, 2016.
