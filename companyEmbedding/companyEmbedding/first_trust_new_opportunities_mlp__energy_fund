First Trust New Opportunities MLP & Energy Fund Declares its Monthly 
      Common Share Distribution of $0.105 Per Share for August






July 20, 2017 04:38 PM Eastern Daylight Time



WHEATON, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--First Trust New Opportunities MLP & Energy Fund (the "Fund") (NYSE: FPL) 
      has declared the Fund’s regularly scheduled monthly common share 
      distribution in the amount of $0.105 per share payable on August 15, 
      2017, to shareholders of record as of August 3, 2017. The ex-dividend 
      date is expected to be August 1, 2017. The monthly distribution 
      information for the Fund appears below.
    




First Trust New Opportunities MLP & Energy 
            Fund (FPL):





          Distribution per share:
        

           
        

           
        

          $0.105
        



          Distribution Rate based on the July 19, 2017 NAV of $12.95:
        





          9.73%
        



          Distribution Rate based on the July 19, 2017 closing market price of 
          $13.12:
        





          9.60%
        









           
        



      It is anticipated that, due to the tax treatment of cash distributions 
      made by master limited partnerships ("MLPs") in which the Fund invests, 
      a portion of the distributions the Fund makes to Common Shareholders may 
      consist of a tax-deferred return of capital. The final determination of 
      the source and tax status of all 2017 distributions will be made after 
      the end of 2017 and will be provided on Form 1099- DIV.
    

      The Fund is a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company 
      that seeks a high level of total return with an emphasis on current 
      distributions paid to common shareholders. The Fund will seek to provide 
      its common shareholders with a vehicle to invest in a portfolio of 
      cash-generating securities, with a focus on investing in publicly traded 
      MLPs and MLP-related entities in the energy sector and energy utilities 
      industries that are weighted towards non-cyclical, fee-for-service 
      revenues. Under normal market conditions, the Fund will invest at least 
      85% of its Managed Assets in equity and debt securities of MLPs, 
      MLP-related entities and other energy sector and energy utilities 
      companies that the Fund's Sub-Advisor believes offer opportunities for 
      growth and income. Under normal circumstances, the Fund will invest at 
      least 65% of its managed assets in equity securities issued by energy 
      sector MLPs and energy sector and energy utilities MLP-related entities. 
      To generate additional income, the Fund currently expects to write (or 
      sell) covered call options on up to 35% of its managed assets.
    

      First Trust Advisors L.P., the Fund's investment advisor, along with its 
      affiliate, First Trust Portfolios L.P., are privately-held companies 
      which provide a variety of investment services, including asset 
      management and financial advisory services, with collective assets under 
      management or supervision of approximately $107 billion as of June 30, 
      2017 through unit investment trusts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end 
      funds, mutual funds and separate managed accounts.
    

      Energy Income Partners, LLC ("EIP") serves as the Fund's investment 
      sub-advisor and provides advisory services to a number of investment 
      companies and partnerships for the purpose of investing in MLPs and 
      other energy infrastructure securities. EIP is one of the early 
      investment advisors specializing in this area. As of June 30, 2017, EIP 
      managed or supervised approximately $5.7 billion in client assets.
    

      Past performance is no assurance of future results. Investment return 
      and market value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate. Shares, 
      when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
    

      Principal Risk Factors: The Fund is subject to risks, including the fact 
      that it is a non-diversified closed-end management investment company.
    

      Because the Fund is concentrated in securities issued by MLPs, 
      MLP-related entities, and other energy and utilities companies, it will 
      be more susceptible to adverse economic or regulatory occurrences 
      affecting those industries, including high interest costs, high leverage 
      costs, the effects of economic slowdown, surplus capacity, increased 
      competition, uncertainties concerning the availability of fuel at 
      reasonable prices, the effects of energy conservation policies and other 
      factors.
    

      The Fund's use of derivatives may result in losses greater than if they 
      had not been used, may require the Fund to sell or purchase portfolio 
      securities at inopportune times, may limit the amount of appreciation 
      the Fund can realize on an investment, or may cause the Fund to hold a 
      security that it might otherwise sell.
    

      The Fund invests in securities of non-U.S. issuers which are subject to 
      higher volatility than securities of U.S. issuers. Because the Fund 
      invests in non-U.S. securities, you may lose money if the local currency 
      of a non-U.S. market depreciates against the U.S. dollar.
    

      Use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost, and can magnify 
      the effect of any losses.
    

      The risks of investing in the Fund are spelled out in the shareholder 
      reports and other regulatory filings.

      value per share as well as other information can be found at www.ftportfolios.com

  First Trust New Opportunities MLP & Energy Fund (the "Fund") (NYSE: FPL) has declared the Fund's regularly scheduled monthly common share distribution in the amount of $0.105 per share payable on July 17, 2017, to shareholders of record as of July 6, 2017. The ex-dividend date is expected to be July 3, 2017. The monthly distribution information for the Fund appears below.      First Trust New Opportunities MLP & Energy Fund (FPL):           Distribution per share:     $0.105     Distribution Rate based on the June 19, 2017 NAV of $12.31:     10.24%     Distribution Rate based on the June 19, 2017 closing market price of $12.28:     10.26%      It is anticipated that, due to the tax treatment of cash distributions made by master limited partnerships ("MLPs") in which the Fund invests, a portion of the distributions the Fund makes to Common Shareholders may consist of a tax-deferred return of capital. The final determination of the source and tax status of all 2017 distributions will be made after the end of 2017 and will be provided on Form 1099- DIV.  The Fund is a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that seeks a high level of total return with an emphasis on current distributions paid to common shareholders. The Fund will seek to provide its common shareholders with a vehicle to invest in a portfolio of cash-generating securities, with a focus on investing in publicly traded MLPs and MLP-related entities in the energy sector and energy utilities industries that are weighted towards non-cyclical, fee-for-service revenues. Under normal market conditions, the Fund will invest at least 85% of its Managed Assets in equity and debt securities of MLPs, MLP-related entities and other energy sector and energy utilities companies that the Fund's Sub-Advisor believes offer opportunities for growth and income. Under normal circumstances, the Fund will invest at least 65% of its managed assets in equity securities issued by energy sector MLPs and energy sector and energy utilities MLP-related entities. To generate additional income, the Fund currently expects to write (or sell) covered call options on up to 35% of its managed assets.

Fact Sheet







First Trust New Opportunities MLP & Energy Fund (FPL)




Fund Summary|News & Literature|Historical Pricing|Distribution History|Contact Fund











Investment Objective/Strategy - First Trust New Opportunities MLP & Energy Fund (the "Fund") is a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company. The Fund's investment objective is to seek a high level of total return with an emphasis on current distributions paid to common shareholders. The Fund seeks to provide its shareholders with a vehicle to invest in a portfolio of cash-generating securities, with a focus on investing in publicly traded master limited partnerships ("MLPs") and MLP-related entities in the energy sector and energy utilities industries. Under normal market conditions, the Fund will invest at least 85% of its managed assets in equity and debt securities of MLPs, MLP-related entities and other energy sector and energy utilities companies that the Fund's sub-advisor believes offer opportunities for growth and income. Under normal circumstances, the Fund will invest at least 65% of its managed assets in equity securities issued by energy sector MLPs and energy sector and energy utilities MLP-related entities. To generate additional income, the Fund currently expects to write (or sell) covered call options on up to 35% of its managed assets.


        There can be no assurance that the Fund's investment objectives will be achieved.

Footnotes


1
The NAV represents the fund's net assets (assets less liabilities) divided by the fund's common shares outstanding.


2
Fund shares are purchased and sold on an exchange at their share price rather than net asset value (NAV), which may cause the shares to trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount).


3
Most recent distribution paid or declared to today's date. Subject to change in the future. There is no guarantee that the fund will declare dividends.


4
Distribution rates are calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution paid or declared through today's date and then dividing by the most recent market price. The distribution consists of the sum of net investment income, net realized short-term capital gains, net realized long-term capital gains, and return of capital.  Distribution rates may vary. Any distribution adjustment will not be reflected until after the declaration date for the next distribution.  See the fund's 19a-1 Notices, if any, located under the "News & Literature" section of the website for estimates of distribution sources. Final determination of the source and tax status of all distributions paid in the current year will be made after year-end.


5
Total return is the combination of reinvested dividend income and reinvested capital gains distributions, at prices obtained by the Dividend Reinvestment Plan, if any, and changes in the NAV and Share Price.  The NAV total return takes into account the fund's total annual expenses and does not reflect sales load.  Past performance is not indicative of future results.


6
Leverage is a technique where a closed-end fund's manager borrows assets at one rate and invests the proceeds from the borrowed assets at another rate, seeking to increase yield and total return. Use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost, and can magnify the effect of any losses.


7
Market value information used in calculating the percentages is based upon trade date plus one recording of transactions, which can differ from regulatory financial reports (Forms N-CSR and N-Q) that are based on trade date recording of security transactions. Holdings are subject to change.













Risk Considerations


    The fund is subject to risks, including the fact that it is a non-diversified closed-end management investment company. Investment return and market value of an investment in the fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
    

    Because the fund is concentrated in securities issued by MLPs, MLP-related entities, and other energy and utilities companies, it will be more susceptible to adverse economic or regulatory occurrences affecting those industries, including high interest costs, high leverage costs, the effects of economic slowdown, surplus capacity, increased competition, uncertainties concerning the availability of fuel at reasonable prices, the effects of energy conservation policies and other factors.


    The fund's use of derivatives may result in losses greater than if they had not been used, may require the fund to sell or purchase portfolio securities at inopportune times, may limit the amount of appreciation the fund can realize on an investment, or may cause the fund to hold a security that it might otherwise sell.


    The fund invests in securities of non-U.S. issuers which are subject to higher volatility than securities of U.S. issuers. Because the fund invests in non-U.S. securities, you may lose money if the local currency of a non-U.S. market depreciates against the U.S. dollar.


    Use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost, and can magnify the effect of any losses.


    The risks of investing in the fund are spelled out in the prospectus, shareholder report and other regulatory filings.

VanEck Vectors Global Alternative Energy ETF
















Fund Description
VanEck Vectors® Global Alternative Energy ETF (GEX®) seeks to replicate as closely as possible, before fees and expenses, the price and yield performance of the Ardour Global IndexSM Extra Liquid (AGIXLT), which is intended to track the overall performance of companies involved in the business of alternative energy. Alternative energy includes power derived principally from bio-fuels (such as ethanol), bio mass, wind, solar, hydro and geothermal sources, and also includes various technologies that support the production, use and storage of these sources.

Returns reflect temporary contractual fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements. Had the ETF incurred all expenses and fees, investment returns would have been reduced. Investment returns and ETF share values will fluctuate so that investors' shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. ETF returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV.The "Net Asset Value" (NAV) of a VanEck Vectors Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is determined at the close of each business day, and represents the dollar value of one share of the fund; it is calculated by taking the total assets of the fund, subtracting total liabilities, and dividing by the total number of shares outstanding. The NAV is not necessarily the same as the ETF 's intraday trading value. VanEck Vectors ETF investors should not expect to buy or sell shares at NAV.
