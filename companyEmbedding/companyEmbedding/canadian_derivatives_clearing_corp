BREAKING DOWN 'Canadian Derivatives Clearing Corporation - CDCC'
The organization was first referred to as Trans Canada Options (TCO), which was established in 1977 through the merger of the Montreal and Toronto options clearinghouses. Trans Canada Options changed its name to Canadian Derivatives Clearing Corporation in 1996. In 2000, CDCC became entirely owned by the Montreal Exchange. In 2008, the Montreal exchange and the TSX group merged to become the TMX group, the current owner and operator of the CDCC.

Clearing Agencies
A clearing agency is a  person or company that facilitates the clearing and settlement of trades. Its  function is to:

act as an intermediary in paying funds or  delivering securities; 
provide centralized facilities for the  clearing and settlement of trades; or 
provide centralized facilities as a  depository of securities. 

For the full definition,  please see Section 1(1) of the Securities Act (Ontario). 
Recognition  Process 
Section 21.2 of the Securities Act (Ontario) prohibits clearing agencies from carrying on business in Ontario unless they  are recognized by the Commission as a clearing agency or are exempt from the  requirement to be recognized by order of the Commission. An application for  recognition as a clearing agency should be filed through the OSC's electronic filing portal. National Instrument 24-102 Clearing Agency Requirements (NI 24-102) sets out the  framework for the recognition or exemption of all clearing agencies seeking to  carry on business in a Canadian jurisdiction. As described in the NI 24-102, the  OSC will assess an application for recognition or exemption based on a variety  of factors, including but not limited to: 

governance 
rules and rulemaking; 
systems and technology; 
access standards; 
fees; 
financial viability and reporting; 
risk management; 
operational reliability; 
protection of assets; 
outsourcing; and 
information sharing and regulatory  cooperation. 

The OSC may also impose  terms and conditions on the recognition or exemption of the clearing agency. 
Ongoing  Requirements 
A clearing agency is  required to comply with the relevant requirements of NI 24-102, as well as terms  and conditions imposed by the OSC resulting from recognition or exemption from  recognition. In particular, NI 24-102 adopts international standards set out in  the April 2012 report Principles for  financial market infrastructures published by the Bank for International  Settlements’ Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) and the  International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO). 
Depending on the functions  performed by a clearing agency, it may also be subject to various requirements  of Ontario securities law, including National Instrument 24-101 Institutional Trade Matching and Settlement (NI 24-101) and National Instrument  54-101 Communication with Beneficial Owners of  Securities of a Reporting Issuer (NI 54-101). Some of these requirements include: 

Delivering to the OSC aggregate and  individual institutional trade matching statistics on Form 24-101F2 no later  than 30 days after the end of a calendar quarter. 
Implementing rules, instruments and  procedures that are consistent with the institutional trade matching and  settlement requirements of NI 24-101. 
Facilitating the process for reporting  issuers to communicate with, and send materials to, beneficial owners of  securities under NI 54-101. 

The OSC oversees the  compliance of a clearing agency with regulatory requirements. As part of its  oversight, the OSC may review required filings and proposals for amendments to  by-laws, rules and policies of the clearing agency, and may perform on-site oversight  reviews. The OSC also oversees a recognized clearing agency’s compliance with  the automation review program.
The OSC coordinates its  oversight of regulated clearing agencies with regulatory partners in the CSA  and the Bank of Canada. The OSC has entered into a memorandum of  understanding with the Bank of Canada, Autorité des marchés financiers du  Québec, and the British Columbia Securities Commission (the BOC MOU). The main  objective of the BOC MOU is to promote the safety and efficiency of clearing  and settlement systems in a consistent and coordinated fashion. Specifically,  the BOC MOU will enhance and formalize the cooperation and coordination among  regulators to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their oversight of  commonly regulated clearing and settlement systems and to ensure consistency in  their regulation to reduce regulatory burden; the BOC MOU will also promote  information sharing. The BOC MOU came into effect on June 9,  2014. 
Clearing agencies either  recognized or exempted from recognition by the OSC for operation in Ontario: 

Canadian Depository for  Securities Limited (CDS) (recognized) 
Canadian Derivatives Clearing  Corporation (recognized) 
Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. (exempted) 
CLS Bank International (exempted)

CFTC Issues Open-Ended Relief for Fixing Swaps

In other FinTech news, FINCAD targets the buy side as ESMA Approves Two Third Country CCPs
 




CFTC Blesses Eurex Clearing 
U.S. regulator CFTC has authorized Eurex Clearing’s registration as a derivatives clearing organization (DCO), which will allow Eurex Clearing to provide clearing services for swaps for U.S. clearing members, officials say.
The authorization makes Eurex Clearing the 16th DCO registered with the CFTC and the sixth registered DCO based outside the United States, say CFTC officials.
Eurex Clearing will be able to function under the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), section 5b, and this endorsement helps the CFTC facilitate working across borders to promote central clearing, officials say.
“The registration will become effective after Eurex Clearing meets CFTC’s ‘straight-through processing’ requirements,” say CFTC officials. Eurex Clearing officials requested that CFTC issue a conditional registration, “as it preferred to comply with those requirements in the future, at the same time as it complies with the expected European requirements for straight-through processing. Those requirements have not been issued due to the delay in the implementation of the European Commission’s Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II).”
In light of the delay, CFTC officials extended previously provided relief to permit Eurex Clearing to continue to clear proprietary positions in interest rate swaps for U.S. clearing members, officials say. CFTC’s Division of Clearing and Risk (Division) has provided Eurex Clearing this relief since July 2013.
“After Eurex Clearing complies with the straight through processing requirement and its order of registration becomes effective, Eurex Clearing may begin clearing FCM [futures commission merchant] customer positions, as well as continue clearing proprietary positions for U.S. clearing members,” CFTC officials say.
The Division also offered no-action relief that permits Eurex Clearing to use a modified version of the acknowledgment letter required under CFTC Regulations 1.20(g)(4) and 22.5 for customer accounts maintained at the Deutsche Bundesbank, the central bank of Germany, officials say.
“Last week, the CFTC signed a memorandum of understanding with Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin) and Deutsche Bundesbank, the domestic regulators of Eurex Clearing, to facilitate information sharing and cooperative oversight,” according to the CFTC.
FINCAD Targets Buy Side via System Enhancements
FINCAD, a vendor of valuation and risk analytics for multi- asset, multi-currency portfolios, has enhanced F3, its object-oriented valuation and risk platform, officials say.
“These enhancements benefit buy-side firms searching for alpha in a low-yield environment and pursuing multi-asset, multi-currency strategies,” argues FINCAD officials. The streamlined workflow is intended to help the front office trade new instruments and asset classes.
The vendor also released application programming interfaces (APIs) and compatibility support for clients’ proprietary models so that they can “plug in their own valuation algorithms and ensure consistent models, data and fixings are used across the enterprise,” officials say.
The pre-built modeling components in F3 encompass coverage for multi-currency, multi-asset strategies, including MBS with static prepayment and LPI swaps, officials say. The enhancements include a diagnostics tool for model validation in real-time through visualization and error tracing functions.
In addition, FINCAD has announced a strategic partnership with derivatives experts John Hull, PhD, and Alan White, PhD, professors of derivatives and risk management at the University of Toronto’s Rotman School of Management, officials say. This partnership will include regular commentary on key issues in derivatives, valuation and risk management, made available exclusively via blog of FINCAD.
ESMA Approves CDCC and NGX as Third Country CCPs 
The European Securities and Markets Authorities (ESMA) has recognized NGX, a North American energy exchange and central clearing counterparty (CCP), and the Canadian Derivatives Clearing Corp. (CDCC), as third country CCPs under European Market Infrastructure (EMIR) rules.
NGX and CDCC, Canada’s national CCP for exchange-traded derivative products, can now provide clearing for some over-the-counter (OTC) products and repos. The EMIR rules govern CCPs from outside of the E.U. to provide clearing services to clearing members or trading venues established in the E.U.
The EMIR E.U. capital requirements regulation also gives CCPs “the status of being qualifying CCPs (QCCPs) in the E.U.,” officials say. “‎Clearing members are subject to lower capital requirements with respect to exposures to QCCPs relative to non-QCCPs.”
“Third country CCP recognition is an important achievement for CDCC and MX as we continue to work to efficiently serve our existing European client base and attract additional clients to our market,” said Alain Miquelon , president and CEO, Montréal Exchange and Group Head of Derivatives, TMX Group, which owns NGX.
CDCC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Montréal Exchange (MX), part of the TMX Group, and acts as the central clearing counterparty for exchange-traded derivative products in Canada.
