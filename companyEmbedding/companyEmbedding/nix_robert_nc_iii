Early life[edit]
Born in Orangeburg, South Carolina, he attended Townsend Harris High School in New York City and graduated from Lincoln University (Pennsylvania) in 1921. He received his law degree from the University of Pennsylvania and began practicing in Philadelphia. After entering private practice, Nix became active in the Democratic Party as a committeeman from the fourth ward in 1932. He became a special assistant deputy attorney general of Pennsylvania in 1934 and delegate to the 1956 Democratic National Convention.
United States House of Representatives[edit]
In 1958, he defeated two opponents in a special election to fill a congressional vacancy left by Earl Chudoff in the House of Representatives. An elected official who rarely wanted or attracted widespread publicity, he supported mostly liberal legislation. He was reelected 10 times. He worked for the passage of the landmark legislation promoting the American Civil Rights Movement and privately sought to prevent the House from denying Rep. Adam Clayton Powell his seat in 1967. In 1975, he introduced an amendment to the Foreign Military Sales Act requiring the Defense Department to provide the U.S. Congress with information on identities of agents who negotiate arms sales for American firms.
Committee service[edit]
Congressman Nix served on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries. He was the chairman of the Committee on the Post Office and Civil Service and the chairman of the Subcommittee on International Economic Policy. Congressman Nix served 20 years before losing to William H. Gray III in the primary in 1978.
Family[edit]
Congressman Nix's son, Robert N. C. Nix Jr., became the first African American to be elected to statewide office in Pennsylvania when he was elected to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.
Legacy[edit]
In 1985, the United States court house and post office building in Philadelphia was renamed the Robert N. C. Nix, Sr. Federal Building and United States Post Office in honor of Nix.
Famous quote[edit]

"Be prepared, be sharp, be careful, and use the King's English well. And you can forget all the [other rules] unless you remember one more: Get paid."

Early life[edit]
Born in Orangeburg, South Carolina, he attended Townsend Harris High School in New York City and graduated from Lincoln University (Pennsylvania) in 1921. He received his law degree from the University of Pennsylvania and began practicing in Philadelphia. After entering private practice, Nix became active in the Democratic Party as a committeeman from the fourth ward in 1932. He became a special assistant deputy attorney general of Pennsylvania in 1934 and delegate to the 1956 Democratic National Convention.
United States House of Representatives[edit]
In 1958, he defeated two opponents in a special election to fill a congressional vacancy left by Earl Chudoff in the House of Representatives. An elected official who rarely wanted or attracted widespread publicity, he supported mostly liberal legislation. He was reelected 10 times. He worked for the passage of the landmark legislation promoting the American Civil Rights Movement and privately sought to prevent the House from denying Rep. Adam Clayton Powell his seat in 1967. In 1975, he introduced an amendment to the Foreign Military Sales Act requiring the Defense Department to provide the U.S. Congress with information on identities of agents who negotiate arms sales for American firms.
Committee service[edit]
Congressman Nix served on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries. He was the chairman of the Committee on the Post Office and Civil Service and the chairman of the Subcommittee on International Economic Policy. Congressman Nix served 20 years before losing to William H. Gray III in the primary in 1978.
Family[edit]
Congressman Nix's son, Robert N. C. Nix Jr., became the first African American to be elected to statewide office in Pennsylvania when he was elected to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.
Legacy[edit]
In 1985, the United States court house and post office building in Philadelphia was renamed the Robert N. C. Nix, Sr. Federal Building and United States Post Office in honor of Nix.
Famous quote[edit]

"Be prepared, be sharp, be careful, and use the King's English well. And you can forget all the [other rules] unless you remember one more: Get paid."

Biography



After gaining experience in Philadelphia politics, Robert N. C. Nix  earned a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in a special election in  1958. Nix served in Congress for more than two decades. As the first African  American to represent the state of Pennsylvania  and only the third black Member to chair a standing committee in the House, he  dedicated himself “to ending the oppression of black people.”1 However, critics claimed Nix fell short of  this goal, placing party politics before the national black agenda. Loyal to  the local Democratic machine that helped begin his career on the Hill, Nix was  disinclined to demand radical change for minorities, an approach that  conflicted with many of his African–American colleagues’ more militant politics  during the 1960s and 1970s. Robert  Nelson Cornelius (N. C.) Nix, Sr. was born on August 9, 1898, in Orangeburg, South    Carolina.2 The  third of four children of Nelson Nix—a former slave and future dean of South  Carolina State College—and Sylvia Nix, Robert Nix later moved to New York City to live with  relatives.3 Nix graduated from Townsend Harris  High School in New   York City (also attended by Nix’s future African–American House colleague  Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., of New York), before  enrolling in Lincoln University in Oxford,   Pennsylvania.4 After earning a B.A. in 1921, Nix continued  his education at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, from which he  graduated three years later. In 1925, Nix began practicing law in Philadelphia. He first  became active in politics when he was elected a Democratic committeeman from  the 44th Ward in 1932. He retained this position for 26 years, serving as  chairman for the final eight.5 From 1934  to 1938, Nix worked for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as a special deputy  attorney general in the revenue department and as a special assistant deputy  attorney general. Nix and his wife, the former Ethel Lanier, had one son,  Robert N. C. Nix, Jr.When  five–term Democratic Representative Earl Chudoff resigned in 1958 to become a Philadelphia judge, Nix entered the special election to  fill the vacant congressional seat encompassing sections of Philadelphia  on both sides of the Schuylkill   River.6 With solid backing from the local Democratic  machine, Nix won the unexpired term, defeating Republican Cecil B. Moore, an  African–American attorney, with 64 percent of the vote.7 House colleagues applauded as Nix was sworn  in as a Member of the 85th Congress (1957–1959) on May 20, 1958, joining black  Representatives William Dawson of Illinois;  Adam Clayton Powell; and Charles Diggs, Jr., of Michigan.8  That same year, Nix was chosen unanimously as chairman of Philadelphia’s 32nd Ward, a position he held  until his death in 1987.9During  his first two terms in the House, Nix served on the Merchant Marine and  Fisheries and Veterans’Affairs committees. In the 87th Congress  (1961–1963) Nix relinquished his initial assignments for a spot on Foreign  Affairs (later named International Relations); he remained on this committee  for the rest of his tenure in the House and chaired the Foreign Economic Policy  and Asian and Pacific Affairs subcommittees.10  After 14 years as a member of the Committee on the Post Office and Civil  Service, Nix became the chairman. A  landmark study of House committees during the 1960s described the Post Office  and Civil Service Committee as a “low–energy, low–influence, low–prestige”  assignment. Though considered a valuable assignment by Members who sought to  improve their chances of re–election by concentrating on constituency–service  goals—particularly those related to the many postal carriers—the committee was  also characterized by turnover.11 Nix  may have decided to remain on the committee partially because it allowed him to  influence the working conditions of the numerous African Americans employed by  the U.S. Postal Service. First named head of the committee for the 95th  Congress (1977–1979), Nix faced opposition instead of congratulations. A group  of young Representatives contended that Nix’s “record of inactivity” and age  (68) disqualified him from the leadership position. The Congressional Black  Caucus (CBC)—an organization of African–American Members formed in 1971 to  promote legislation that concerned blacks—thwarted the move to block his  appointment, promising Nix would be a competent and committed chair.12 During his two years as chairman, Nix led a  movement to “require congressional approval of major policy changes” by the  U.S. Postal System in an effort to improve service.13 He also backed a controversial bill put  forth by President James Earl (Jimmy) Carter to restructure the civil service  system.14 Portrayed as a plan to improve  the efficiency of the federal government, the proposed reform was criticized by  many veterans’ groups and federal unions that feared the legislation would  undermine the rights of civil service workers.15A  politician who rarely sought publicity, Nix usually followed the Democratic  Party line by supporting the liberal legislation of the John F. Kennedy and  Lyndon B. Johnson administrations. Although some of his Democratic colleagues  criticized America’s  involvement in the Vietnam War, Nix, a senior member of the Foreign Affairs  Committee, consistently backed executive foreign policy initiatives.16 As chairman of the Subcommittee on Foreign  Economic Policy, Nix led an investigation of the use of funds by defense  contractors to pay foreign consultants, agents, governmental officials, and  political parties. He later introduced an amendment to the Foreign Military  Sales Act requiring the Defense Department to provide Congress with information  on the identities of and fees received by agents who negotiated arms sales for  American firms.Throughout  his tenure on the Hill, Nix remained connected to the political machine that  helped him earn a spot in Congress. Accordingly, he promoted legislation that  reflected the concerns of his urban constituents, sponsoring bills to preserve  the Philadelphia Navy Yard and to establish a “senior service corps” to employ  workers older than 60. He also dedicated considerable effort to lowering  unemployment, arguing, “This is the richest and most technically advanced  country in the world. Every citizen should enjoy the opportunity to make a  living consistent with his abilities and skills.”17 In line with the practices of the machine  organization, Nix held regular Saturday hours in his district office to listen  to his constituents’ concerns.18As  one of the few black Members in the House and the Representative of many  African Americans living in Philadelphia,  Nix backed a national civil rights agenda. In 1959, early in his congressional  career, Nix introduced a measure to end racial discrimination in the armed  forces. “To treat a man who wears that uniform with [contempt] merely because  of the color of his skin is an insult to America and to everything for which  our country stands,” Nix said on the House Floor.19 He supported passage of the landmark civil  rights bills of the 1960s, with a focus on protecting of voting rights for  Black Americans. In 1963, seeking to enforce the second section of the 14th  Amendment, Nix authored a bill to decrease a state’s representation when  voters’ rights were violated—echoing previous measures introduced  unsuccessfully in the House for six decades.20  During the House debate on the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Nix countered critics  who maintained that African Americans from his native state of South Carolina had ample  opportunity to register to vote. He highlighted the many levels of intimidation  and the barriers that hindered significant black representation in the southern  state.21 Disturbed by rumors that the  March on Washington  to secure equal rights for minorities, scheduled for August 1963, might result  in rioting and violence, Nix made an impassioned speech to his House colleagues  expressing his hope that the marchers’ campaign would be peaceful. “The  promised land is here,” he proclaimed, “now, awaiting only the complete and  immediate removal, by our fellow Americans, of the racial fence which has  surrounded it and kept Negroes out for 300 years.”22 The Pennsylvania Representative also sought  to prevent the House from denying Representative Powell, his seat in the 90th  Congress (1967–1969). Declaring “justice will prevail,” Nix argued that Powell  “did not receive the fair and impartial trial guaranteed to every American  citizen.” He added, “The Congress of the United States is honor bound to  admit its error, and to correct its wrong.”23Despite  his work to pursue equal rights for African Americans, many black leaders,  including some fellow House Members, denounced Nix for failing to use his  political position to secure significant gains for minorities. A reserved man  who preferred to avoid controversy, Nix increasingly found himself in the  minority among other black Members, whose approach to race relations was more  militant. By 1974, Nix was the second–most–senior black Representative, behind  Charles Diggs. However, Nix never emerged as a leader of the CBC, the symbolic  power source of African–American legislators, but deferred to less senior  Members of the House.Another  source of concern for the Philadelphia Representative was his high rate of  absenteeism. Dubbed the “phantom” legislator by some of his congressional  opponents, Nix appeared rarely at high–profile events, and his unwillingness to  make himself available to the press magnified his image as an ambivalent  Representative. This experience was not wholly without precedent for a machine  politician like Nix who spent his final years in Congress contending with the  decline of the local political network that brought him to power.24 Throughout his career Nix also dealt with  age–related concerns. After Nix’s death in 1987, his son Robert, a former chief  justice of the Pennsylvania  supreme court, released a statement that his father was seven years older than  the age he indicated upon entering the special election in 1958; aware that his  age could impede his congressional career, Nix misled his constituents and  colleagues in the House.25Redistricting  necessitated by Philadelphia’s declining population modified the House district  Nix represented, which came to encompass portions of northern and western  Philadelphia that included poor areas populated mainly by African Americans in  addition to some middle–class black areas and affluent white neighborhoods.26 Although the constituency remained  overwhelmingly Democratic, Nix did not possess a safe seat, facing frequent  primary challenges from younger African Americans who criticized his close  relationship with the Philadelphia  Democratic machine. By the mid–1970s, with the local political establishment  waning, Nix was politically vulnerable. In 1976, the Representative barely  survived a primary challenge from a young African–American minister, William H.  Gray III, capturing only 48 percent of the vote.27 Two years later, Nix and Gray squared off  in a Democratic primary rematch. The incumbent emphasized his congressional  experience, contending that his chairmanship of a House standing committee was  “the best weapon for helping this district.”28  Nix performed poorly at the polls, with only 40 percent of the vote versus  Gray’s 58 percent.29After  leaving the House in January 1979, Nix remained active in politics as the  leader of Philadelphia’s 32nd Ward until his  death in Philadelphia  on June 22, 1987. Representative Gray praised his predecessor, observing,  “Because of him, I feel as if I’m standing on the shoulders of the congressmen  who opened the doors so the next generation of black elected officials, like  Bill Gray, can do the things they are doing now.”30
