 PAX WORLD FUNDS SERIES TRUST I (Form: 497, Received: 03/14/2014 16:34:42) 














	 






	Pax World Global Womens Equality Fund (GWEF), a series of






	Pax World Funds Series Trust I





	 




	Supplement Dated March 14, 2014




	to the




	Prospectus




	Dated May 1, 2013




	 




	On March 13, 2014, the Trustees of Pax World Funds Series Trust I approved, subject to approval by shareholders of GWEF, the merger of GWEF into Pax Global Womens Index Fund (the New Global Womens Index Fund), a newly-formed series of Pax World Funds Series Trust III that will be advised by Pax/Newco Management LLC (Pax/Newco), a majority-owned subsidiary of Pax World Management LLC.  The New Global Womens Index Fund will seek investment returns that closely correspond to or exceed the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Pax Global Womens Equality Index* (the Index).  The Index is a customized market-weighted index consisting of equity securities of issuers organized or operating in countries around the world that demonstrate a commitment to advancing and empowering women through gender diversity on their board, in management and through other policies and programs, and an understanding of the potential business advantages associated with greater gender diversity.  In addition, the companies comprising the Index meet certain environmental, social and governance (ESG) or sustainability thresholds, as rated by MSCI ESG Research.  The New Global Womens Index Fund will generally invest in all of the companies included in the Index but may use an optimized or enhanced strategy to achieve its investment objective, weighting companies with more favorable characteristics (e.g., number of women on the board of directors) more heavily, rather than using market weights exclusively.  As a result, the New Global Womens Index Fund may not always hold the same securities or may not hold such securities in the same proportions or weightings as the Index.




	 







	*a custom index calculated by MSCI




	 






	The foregoing is not an offer to sell, nor a solicitation of an offer to buy, shares of any fund, nor is it a solicitation of any proxy. For information regarding the New Global Womens Index Fund, or to receive a free copy of a proxy statement/prospectus relating to the proposed merger once a registration statement relating to the proposed merger has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and become effective, please call the proxy solicitor or visit its website. The telephone number and website for the proxy solicitor may be obtained, when available, by visiting www.paxworld.com.  The proxy statement/prospectus (when available) will contain important information about fund objectives, strategies, fees, expenses and risk considerations.  The proxy statement/prospectus will also be available for free on the SECs website (www.sec.gov).  Please read the proxy statement/prospectus carefully before making any decision to invest or when considering the merger proposal.






	 




	Shareholders should retain this Supplement for future reference.

	The section entitled

	Principal Investment Strategies

	is replaced in its entirety with the following:


	 


	Under normal market conditions, the Fund invests primarily in large-capitalization domestic equity securities that the Adviser believes have strong Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) profiles and that exhibit higher “quality” characteristics and reasonable valuations. Specifically, the strategy favors securities with stronger ESG scores (as determined by the Adviser), higher profitability, higher earnings quality (based on a quantitative assessment of operating fundamentals and accruals), lower risk (i.e., the historic volatility of a security relative to the overall market) and lower valuations relative to the Russell 1000 Index.


	 


	The Adviser utilizes a quantitative process, optimizing ESG, quality factors and valuation factors relative to benchmark constraints.


	 


	ESG scores are calculated based on the Adviser’s assessment of an issuer’s ESG profile. The scores emphasize management of ESG-related risks, incorporate ESG trends (taking into account progress or regression in a company’s ESG profile) and adjust for involvement in significant ESG-related controversies.


	 


	Quality factors include but are not limited to quantitative determinations of profitability, earnings quality and risk. Valuation scores reflect a combination of earnings-based valuation measures.


	 


	The Fund may invest a portion of its assets in securities of non-U.S. issuers, including emerging market investments and American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”), but may invest no more than 25% of its assets in securities of non-U.S. issuers other than ADRs.


	 


	The Fund may utilize derivatives for hedging and for investment purposes.


	 



	Page 9



	 


	Under the section entitled


	Principal Risks


	, the risk description subtitled

	Small- and Medium Sized Capitalization Company Risk

	is deleted in its entirety. The following risk descriptions are added:


	 



	Equity Securities Risk

	The market price of equity securities may fluctuate significantly, rapidly and unpredictably, causing the Fund to experience losses. The prices of equity securities generally are more volatile than the prices of debt securities.


	 



	Value Securities Risk

	The Fund may invest in companies that may not be expected to experience significant earnings growth, but whose securities the investment adviser believes are selling at a price lower than their true value. Companies that issue value securities may have experienced adverse business developments or may be subject to special risks that have caused their securities to be out of favor. If the investment adviser’s assessment of a company’s prospects is wrong, or if the market does not recognize the value of the company, the price of its securities may decline or may not approach the value that the investment adviser anticipates.


	 



	Quantitative Models Risk

	Aperio uses quantitative analyses and models as part of its investment process, and any imperfections, errors, or limitations in those analyses and models could affect the Fund’s performance. By necessity, these analyses and models make simplifying assumptions that limit their efficacy. Models that appear


	 








	to explain prior market data can fail to predict future market events. Further, the data used in models may be inaccurate or subjective and may not include the most recent information about a company or a security. The Fund also runs the risk that PWM’s or Aperio’s assessment of an investment or its attributes may be wrong or that deficiencies in their internal systems or controls will cause losses for the Fund or impair Fund operations.

	Under normal market conditions, the Fund invests primarily in large-capitalization domestic equity securities that the Adviser believes have strong Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) profiles and that exhibit higher quality characteristics and reasonable valuations. Specifically, the strategy favors securities with stronger ESG scores (as determined by the Adviser), higher profitability, higher earnings quality (based on a quantitative assessment of operating fundamentals and accruals), lower risk (i.e., the historic volatility of a security relative to the overall market) and lower valuations relative to the Russell 1000 Index.


	 


	The Adviser utilizes a quantitative process, optimizing ESG, quality and valuation factors relative to carefully selected benchmark constraints.


	 


	ESG scores are calculated based on the Adviser’s assessment of an issuer’s ESG profile. The scores emphasize management of ESG-related risks, incorporate ESG trends (taking into account progress or regression in a company’s ESG profile) and adjust for involvement in significant ESG-related controversies.

	With respect to the ESG Beta Quality Fund the Adviser determines an ESG score for each company, based on the Adviser’s assessment of key ESG issues by industry, and calculating ESG scores based on companies’ performance on these key issues. The scores emphasize management of ESG-related risks, incorporate ESG trends (taking into account progress or regression in a company’s ESG profile) and adjust for involvement in significant ESG-related controversies.

	The following two paragraphs replace the first full paragraph:


	 


	For the ESG Beta Quality Fund and the Global Environmental Markets Fund, PWM has engaged investment management firms (the “Sub-Advisers”) to manage each respective Fund’s investments. The Sub-Advisers have full investment discretion and make all determinations with respect to the investment of the Fund which they sub-advise, subject to the general supervision of PWM and the Board of Trustees. PWM (and not the ESG Beta Quality Fund or the Global Environmental Markets Fund) pays a portion of the advisory fees it receives to the Sub-Advisers in return for their services. The following provides summary information about each Sub-Adviser:


	 


	Aperio Group, LLC (“Aperio”) is the Sub-Adviser of the ESG Beta Quality Fund. Aperio has its principal offices at 3 Harbor Drive, Sausalito, CA. Aperio, as of December 31, 2015, had approximately $11.7 billion of funds under management.

	The table at the top of page 66 (which begins on page 65) in the section

	Advisory Agreements

	is amended with respect to the ESG Quality Beta Fund to provide that fees are payable at the annual rate (expressed as a percentage of the Fund’s average daily net assets) of 0.65%.


	 


	The three paragraphs beginning with the penultimate paragraph on page 66, in the section entitled

	Advisory Agreements

	(which begins on Page 65) are replaced with the following:


	 


	Pursuant to sub-advisory agreements (the “Sub-Advisory Agreements”), IAM assists in the management of the Global Environmental Markets Fund’s portfolio of securities and Aperio assists in the management of the ESG Beta Quality Fund’s portfolio of securities. The sub-advisers make decisions with respect to the purchase and sale of investments, subject to the general control of the Board of the Fund and the determination of PWM that the contemplated investments satisfy the sustainable investing criteria applied to the Funds.


	 


	The Sub-Advisory Agreements are terminable without penalty by the Fund on sixty days written notice when authorized either by majority vote of the Fund’s outstanding voting shares or by a vote of a majority of its Disinterested Trustees, or by the sub-advisers on sixty days written notice, and will automatically terminate in the event of their assignment. The Sub-Advisory Agreements provide that in the absence of willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on the part of either of the sub-advisers, or of reckless disregard of its obligations thereunder, the sub-adviser shall not be liable for any action or failure to act in accordance with its duties thereunder.


	 


	For its services under the Sub-Advisory Agreement, Impax receives from PWM a fee equal to 0.40% per annum of the Global Environmental Fund’s average daily net assets and Aperio receives from PWM a fee equal to 0.08% per annum of the ESG Beta Quality Fund’s average daily net assets. The fees are accrued daily and paid monthly. The sub-advisers, at their discretion, may voluntarily waive all or a portion of the sub-advisory fee. Investment advisory fees and operating expenses which are attributable to each Class of the Fund will be allocated daily to each Class based on the relative values of net assets at the end of the day. Additional expenses for shareholder services and distribution services provided by participating organizations to Fund shareholders may be compensated by ALPS Distributors, Inc. from its own resources which includes the shareholder servicing fees and past profits, or by PWM and/or the sub-advisers from their own resources which includes the Advisory or sub-advisory fee and administrative services fee. Expenses incurred in the distribution and the servicing of Institutional Class shares shall be paid by PWM. (See “Distribution and Service Plans” herein.)
