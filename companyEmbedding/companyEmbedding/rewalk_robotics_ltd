MARLBOROUGH, Mass. and YOKNEAM ILIT, Israel, June 19, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- ReWalk Robotics Ltd. (Nasdaq:    RWLK) ("ReWalk"), leading manufacturer of exoskeleton systems, premiered the prototype for a soft suit exoskeleton intended to assist stroke survivors on Yahoo Finance. 








ReWalk CEO Larry Jasinski was joined by collaborators from Harvard University's Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering to showcase the prototype, called Restore, and demonstrate how the system works. ReWalk announced a focus on the development of the soft suit as a core company goal for FY2017.
"We are thrilled with the progress of the Restore system, which will provide life changing technology to a whole new class of patients facing mobility issues," said Jasinski. "With the prototype finished, we are eager to begin clinical studies and pursue regulatory approvals so that these systems can be provided to millions of patients who can benefit from access to the device."
ReWalk is working with the Wyss Institute on the development of lightweight designs to complete clinical studies, pursue regulatory approvals and commercialize the systems on a global scale. The first commercial application will be for stroke survivors, followed by Multiple Sclerosis patients and then additional applications. There are an estimated 3 million stroke survivors with lower limb disability in the U.S.  
How It Works: the Restore transmits power to key joints of the legs with cable technologies, powered with software and mechanics that are similar to the technologies used in the ReWalk exoskeleton system for individuals with spinal cord injury. The cables are connected to fabric-based designs that attach to the legs and foot, thus lending the name "soft suit."  
Anticipated delivery of a commercial Restore soft suit is slated for 2018.

ReWalk Robotics is building a ‘soft exoskeleton’ to rehabilitate stroke patients

Grail is raising at least $1 billion to fund its early cancer screening test












The Boston-based company that was first to provide robotic legs to paralyzed veterans in the U.S., ReWalk Robotics Ltd., has a new product in development that you won’t see this week at CES. The device is a “soft exoskeleton,” designed to help people who have lower limb disability but who have not severed their spinal cord or otherwise become paraplegic.
According to ReWalk CEO Larry Jasinski, “Many people who have had a stroke can stand up but cannot lift their feet well or cannot put their legs down or propel the leg on their own to walk. If you could help them move their legs, but not have to put a big structure around them, it would be a very attractive option.”
The new product will help ReWalk broaden its market, addressing patients recovering from a stroke, or dealing with everything from the effects of old age to diseases that impair their mobility like MS and Parkinson’s disease. The soft exoskeleton could be utilized by these patients, either long-term or as part of a rehab process.
Today, ReWalk’s soft exoskeleton prototype looks more like something a rock climber might wear than Transformer parts. Its main elements are: a belt and fanny pack with motors and a computer within, cables that extend down the legs, knee braces to keep them in place and sensor-laden footplates that can fit into a sneaker or other soft shoe.
The waist belt weighs about eight pounds and the cables, braces and footplates add about two more pounds to the total weight, at this point. ReWalk acquired the initial technology design from the Wyss Institute at Harvard, which had begun developing a “biologically inspired smart suit,” the Medexo, with funding from the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) back in 2014. DARPA has long had an interest in technology that can be applied to help soldiers or medics walk farther, or for longer, and carry more weight in the field.
Jasinski tells TechCrunch that one reason for the tech transfer deal was that Harvard researchers had a great design, but needed to marry it with expertise around motors, gears and software to make it work in the real world. ReWalk had done all that with its earlier systems, and had also figured out how to work with the FDA and the VA to get its devices approved for veteran benefits reimbursements.
Here’s how the new technology helps a patient walk on their own, Jasinski explained: “Think about a bicycle. You have cables that transfer force down a line to close a brake down on the bike’s tires. This uses the same principle but is obviously more complex. One cable runs along the outside part on the front of your leg and another on the back. The motor and gear are on your waist attached to the cables. A lightweight brace worn on your calf keeps the cables in place. The computer and our software will tell the motor to turn just enough to lift the cable, pull it and get you ground clearance, then propel your foot forward. Sensors in a footplate in your shoe send data to the computer to let it know everything about your position and when you are walking.”
ReWalk will begin clinical studies of its soft exoskeletons in the back half of 2017. The company seeks to make the device available in 2018, pending FDA approvals. The soft exoskeleton will initially have power sufficient to move the legs, or be constantly walking, for two hours at a stretch.
The company will seek distribution again through the VA health system and private sector rehab centers that already pay for “gait training” systems for stroke patients. Later, the product could be adapted for those with diseases like MS, which strikes more women than men and usually is diagnosed in a person’s late 20s or early 30s, or Parkinson’s.
“If you had a stroke, and you were laying in a hospital bed for 10 days, theoretically you could lose 10 percent to 20 percent of your muscle mass,” Jasinski said. If you could use this in recovery, you’d have a much better chance at regaining your mobility in full is the hope. With MS and Parkinson’s we think about using this to walk more, and put off later-stage developments.”

ReWalk is a commercial bionic walking assistance system that uses powered leg attachments to enable paraplegics to stand upright, walk and climb stairs.[1][2] The system is powered by a backpack battery, and is controlled by a simple wrist-mounted remote which detects and enhances the user's movements.[3] Designed in Yokneam, Israel, by Amit Goffer,[4] the ReWalk is marketed by ReWalk Robotics Ltd (originally Argo Medical Technologies Ltd),[5] and is priced at approximately US$85,000 per unit.[6]
The device underwent clinical trials at MossRehab in suburban Philadelphia.[7] In July 2014, ReWalk Robotics filed for an American initial public offering that could raise up to US$58 million. The company is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the symbol "RWLK".[8]

Versions[edit]
At the time of its initial release, ReWalk was available in two versions – the ReWalk I and the ReWalk P. The ReWalk I is used by medical institutions for research or therapy to be used under the supervision of a healthcare professional. The ReWalk P is for personal use by patients at home or in public.
An updated version, ReWalk Rehabilitation 2.0, was released in January 2013. The ReWalk 2.0 featured improved sizing for taller individuals and some enhancement in controlling software.[9]
Operation[edit]
The ReWalk system weighs approximately 23.3 kg (51 lb); the backpack containing the system's Windows-operated computer and battery weighs around 2.3 kg (5.1 lb), and the robotic leg attachments weigh around 21 kg (46 lb).[10] The user can engage in three modes: walking, sitting, and standing. The signals to these modes are sent via a wrist-watch type device to the computer.[10]
Users[edit]
The ReWalk was approved for hospital use in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2011.[3] FDA approval for home and public use was issued in June 2014.[11][12]
In 2010, a prototype ReWalk appeared in the American TV series Glee; the exoskeleton is used by fictional character Artie Abrams during the Season 2 episode "A Very Glee Christmas".[13][14]
On 8 May 2012, paralyzed British woman Claire Lomas became the first person to finish a marathon using a bionic assistance suit. Lomas, who was paralyzed from the waist down in a 2007 riding accident, completed the London Marathon in 17 days with her ReWalk system.[15] Later in 2012, Lomas became the first person to take the ReWalk suit home for assistance with everyday tasks,[16] and participated in the opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Paralympics in her ReWalk.[17]
By 2015, Japanese robotics maker Yaskawa Electric Co. has been distributing ReWalk in Asia, i.e. China, under a deal signed in 2014 with ReWalk Robotics. However, in Japan itself ReWalk faces a long approval process that is typical for Japanese businesses.[18][19] This is due to tight regulation laws in Japan that has been effect for the last decade.[20]
Criticisms[edit]
The weight and bulk of the ReWalk exoskeleton is considered to be too much for some users by its creator, Amit Goffer.[4] In addition, with a price of between US$69,500[10] to US$85,000,[6] the system is beyond the reach of many poorer patients, especially because, as of July 2014, health insurance in the United States does not yet cover the ReWalk.[10] Larry Jasinki, the CEO of ReWalk, stated in 2014 that the company is "working with insurers and other health-care coverage providers to ensure individuals eligible to use the ReWalk are able to purchase a system".[10]

REWALK ROBOTICS LTD. (NASDAQ:RWLK)Historical Stock Chart
1 Month : From Jun 2017 to Jul 2017



MARLBOROUGH, Mass. and YOKNEAM ILIT, Israel, July 11, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- ReWalk Robotics Ltd. (NASDAQ: RWLK) ("ReWalk" or the "Company"), a leading manufacturer of exoskeleton systems, announced today that the Company has signed a new, exclusive distribution agreement in France with Harmonie Médical Service (HMS). Through the agreement, HMS will serve as the sole distributor of ReWalk exoskeleton systems to qualifying candidates with spinal cord injury (SCI) across France. HMS, one of the largest medical device providers in the country, will be able to distribute both ReWalk Personal systems for use in the home and community and ReWalk Rehabilitation systems in clinical rehabilitation settings of providers working with individuals with SCI.



"The partnership with HMS provides an ideal structure to allow paralyzed individuals throughout France the ability to walk again," said Jodi Gricci, Chief Commercial Officer of ReWalk Robotics. "Starting in 2011, Dr. Jacques Kerdraon at Kerpape demonstrated leadership and built data to show the value of this technology. As the product is now available for everyday use at home and in the community, HMS provides the resources, support structure and quality as a leading provider of products for injured individuals."
"Our partnership with ReWalk is a real opportunity for HMS," said Sébastien Chamereau, Head of Disability Activity for Harmonie Médical Service. "We have been working for 30 years in the medical materials domain with people who have lost their mobility. We have always looked for innovative technologies in this domain, especially with the arrival of the first stand-up wheelchairs and, later, intelligent control systems. Our goal is to provide maximum autonomy to our customers in their everyday lives. The ReWalk 6.0 offers new medical and social opportunities to individuals with spinal cord injury. In signing this exclusive distribution contract with ReWalk, HMS will foster the arrival of this new technology throughout France. It is when I saw sparkles in the eyes and a large smile on the face of a young paraplegic man using a ReWalk system that I knew why I really wanted to provide this product in France."
Established in 1789, HMS is a renowned health service provider in France, with branches throughout the country and more than 500 employees. The distribution agreement with ReWalk will apply to all of the HMS offices across France.

Website

ReWalk is a commercial bionic walking assistance system that uses powered leg attachments to enable paraplegics to stand upright, walk and climb stairs.[1][2] The system is powered by a backpack battery, and is controlled by a simple wrist-mounted remote which detects and enhances the user's movements.[3] Designed in Yokneam, Israel, by Amit Goffer,[4] the ReWalk is marketed by ReWalk Robotics Ltd (originally Argo Medical Technologies Ltd),[5] and is priced at approximately US$85,000 per unit.[6]
The device underwent clinical trials at MossRehab in suburban Philadelphia.[7] In July 2014, ReWalk Robotics filed for an American initial public offering that could raise up to US$58 million. The company is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the symbol "RWLK".[8]

Versions[edit]
At the time of its initial release, ReWalk was available in two versions – the ReWalk I and the ReWalk P. The ReWalk I is used by medical institutions for research or therapy to be used under the supervision of a healthcare professional. The ReWalk P is for personal use by patients at home or in public.
An updated version, ReWalk Rehabilitation 2.0, was released in January 2013. The ReWalk 2.0 featured improved sizing for taller individuals and some enhancement in controlling software.[9]
Operation[edit]
The ReWalk system weighs approximately 23.3 kg (51 lb); the backpack containing the system's Windows-operated computer and battery weighs around 2.3 kg (5.1 lb), and the robotic leg attachments weigh around 21 kg (46 lb).[10] The user can engage in three modes: walking, sitting, and standing. The signals to these modes are sent via a wrist-watch type device to the computer.[10]
Users[edit]
The ReWalk was approved for hospital use in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2011.[3] FDA approval for home and public use was issued in June 2014.[11][12]
In 2010, a prototype ReWalk appeared in the American TV series Glee; the exoskeleton is used by fictional character Artie Abrams during the Season 2 episode "A Very Glee Christmas".[13][14]
On 8 May 2012, paralyzed British woman Claire Lomas became the first person to finish a marathon using a bionic assistance suit. Lomas, who was paralyzed from the waist down in a 2007 riding accident, completed the London Marathon in 17 days with her ReWalk system.[15] Later in 2012, Lomas became the first person to take the ReWalk suit home for assistance with everyday tasks,[16] and participated in the opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Paralympics in her ReWalk.[17]
By 2015, Japanese robotics maker Yaskawa Electric Co. has been distributing ReWalk in Asia, i.e. China, under a deal signed in 2014 with ReWalk Robotics. However, in Japan itself ReWalk faces a long approval process that is typical for Japanese businesses.[18][19] This is due to tight regulation laws in Japan that has been effect for the last decade.[20]
Criticisms[edit]
The weight and bulk of the ReWalk exoskeleton is considered to be too much for some users by its creator, Amit Goffer.[4] In addition, with a price of between US$69,500[10] to US$85,000,[6] the system is beyond the reach of many poorer patients, especially because, as of July 2014, health insurance in the United States does not yet cover the ReWalk.[10] Larry Jasinki, the CEO of ReWalk, stated in 2014 that the company is "working with insurers and other health-care coverage providers to ensure individuals eligible to use the ReWalk are able to purchase a system".[10]

ReWalk™ Rehabilitation 







The ReWalk Rehabilitation System is designed for use in clinics where it can provide valuable exercise and therapy for your patients. It also enables individuals to train in preparation for using their own ReWalk Personal System at home and in the community.
Designed for all day use, the battery-powered system features a light, wearable exoskeleton with motors at the hip and knee joints. The ReWalker controls movement using subtle changes in his/her center of gravity. A forward tilt of the upper body is sensed by the system which initiates the first step, and repeated body shifting generates a sequence of steps which mimics a functional natural gait of the legs.
The ReWalk Rehabilitation System can be customized to provide optimal fit for each client. The graphical user interface allows therapists to enter a broad range of parameters for an individual and change them as they progress in their training.
A comprehensive WW Training Standards program is conducted to train the rehabilitation team members on the required skills to safely and comfortably use the technology.
For more information on becoming an Advanced ReWalk Training Clinic contact us.

ReWalk Robotics Ltd.

Robbins Arroyo LLP: ReWalk Robotics Ltd. (RWLK) Misled Shareholders According to a Recently Filed Class Action
Robbins Arroyo LLP announces that a class action complaint was filed against ReWalk Robotics Ltd. (NASDAQGM: RWLK) in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of San Mateo. The complaint is brought on behalf of all purchasers of ReWalk securities pursuant to the company’s September 12, 2014 initial stock offering (“IPO”), for alleged violations of the Securities Act of 1933 by ReWalk’s officers and directors. ReWalk, a medical device company, designs, develops, and commercializes exoskeletons for wheelchair-bound individuals.
ReWalk Accused of Misrepresenting Its Ability to Obtain Regulatory Approval for Its Product
According to the complaint, on or about September 17, 2014, ReWalk announced the closing of its offering of 3,450,000 ordinary shares to the public, through which the company raised approximately $41.4 million. ReWalk had previously filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) the registration statement for the IPO, which described the company’s exoskeleton product, the anticipated market for it, as well as the company’s efforts to develop the product, obtain regulatory approval for it, and to sell it. The registration statement stated that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) had classified ReWalk as subject to special controls, which included compliance with medical device consensus standards, performance of a postmarket surveillance clinical study demonstrating a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness in urban terrain, and a training program, among other things.
The complaint alleges, however, that the registration statement failed to disclose that ReWalk was unable to comply with the special controls and provide the FDA with a postmarket surveillance study of the ReWalk product. ReWalk omitted that it received a Warning Letter from the FDA in September of 2015, in which the FDA outlined ReWalk’s substantial failures to propose and commence an adequate postmarket surveillance plan. Making matters worse, ReWalk had in fact previously received several letters from the FDA in which it notified the company that the company’s postmarket surveillance submission lacked the information needed to complete the review. On May 10, 2016, ReWalk revealed that at the time of the IPO, the company had been unable to comply with the FDA’s special controls due to inadequate staffing. Following the release of the Warning Letter to the public on February 25, 2016, ReWalk stock fell over 50% from $11.65 per share to $5.70 per share on September 1, 2016.
ReWalk Shareholders Have Legal Options
Concerned shareholders who would like more information about their rights and potential remedies can contact attorney Darnell R. Donahue at (800) 350-6003, or you can complete the form below and we will contact you directly.

We estimate that the net proceeds to us from this offering, after deducting
underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses, will be approximately
$31.3 million (or approximately $36.3 million if the underwriters exercise their
option to purchase additional ordinary shares in full).

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate
purposes, including sales and marketing expenditures aimed at growing our
business and research and development expenditures focused on product
development. We expect that the net proceeds from this offering will be
sufficient for us to expand our sales, marketing and training infrastructure and
for our other current development activities, including adapting ReWalk for
other indications and the development of our next generation of ReWalk. We may
also use net proceeds from this offering to make acquisitions or investments in
complementary companies or technologies, although we do not have any agreement
or understanding with respect to any such acquisition or investment at this
time. We do not currently have specific plans or commitments with respect to the
net proceeds from this offering and, accordingly, are unable to quantify the
allocation of such proceeds among the various potential uses. We will have broad
discretion in the way that we use the net proceeds of this offering.


The market in which we operate is characterized by active competition and rapid
technological change, and we expect competition to increase. Competition arises
from providers of other mobility systems and prosthetic devices.

We are aware of a number of other companies developing competing technology and
devices, and some of these competitors may have greater resources, greater name
recognition, broader product lines, or larger customer bases than we do. Our
principal competitors in the medical exoskeleton market consist of Ekso Bionics
(OTC: EKSO), Rex Bionics (London Stock Exchange: RXB), Cyberdyne (Tokyo Stock
Exchange: 7779), and Parker Hannifin (NYSE: PH). We believe we have key
competitive advantages over these companies, such as our tilt-sensor technology
that provides a self-initiated walking experience, more natural gait and
functional walking speed, slimmer and lighter design, ReWalk’s ability to
support its own weight and broad user specifications. Additionally, we are not
aware of any medical exoskeleton product that is cleared or in the process of
seeking clearance from the FDA for personal use. ReWalk Personal is the first
medical exoskeleton cleared by the FDA for personal use in the United States.

In addition, we compete with alternative devices and alternative therapies,
including treadmill-based gait therapies, such as those offered by Hocoma,
AlterG, Aretech and Reha Technology. Other medical device or robotics companies,
academic and research institutions, or others may develop new technologies or
therapies that provide a superior walking experience, are more effective in
treating the secondary medical conditions that we target or are less expensive
than our current or future products. Our technologies and products could be
rendered obsolete by such developments.

We may also compete with other treatments and technologies that address the
secondary medical conditions that ReWalk seeks to mitigate.


Company Description
We are an innovative medical device company that is designing, developing and
commercializing exoskeletons that allow wheelchair-bound individuals with
mobility impairments or other medical conditions the ability to stand and walk
once again. We have developed and are continuing to commercialize


 ReWalk, an
exoskeleton that uses our patented tilt-sensor technology and an on-board
computer and motion sensors to drive motorized legs that power movement.

Current ReWalk designs are intended for people with paraplegia, a spinal cord
injury resulting in complete or incomplete paralysis of the legs, who have the
use of their upper bodies and arms. We currently offer two products: ReWalk
Personal and ReWalk Rehabilitation. ReWalk Personal is designed for everyday use
by individuals at home and in their communities, and is custom-fit for each
user. ReWalk Rehabilitation is designed for the clinical rehabilitation
environment where it provides valuable exercise and therapy. It also enables
individuals to evaluate their capacity for using ReWalk Personal in the future.
In 2011, we launched ReWalk Rehabilitation for use in hospitals and
rehabilitation centers in the United States and Europe. We began marketing
ReWalk Personal in Europe with CE mark clearance at the end of 2012 and received
FDA clearance to market it in the United States in June 2014. ReWalk is the
first exoskeleton cleared by the FDA for personal use. In the future, we will
need to obtain approval from the applicable regulatory agency of any additional
jurisdiction in which we seek to market ReWalk.

ReWalk is a breakthrough product that can fundamentally change the health and
life experiences of users. ReWalk is currently the only commercialized
exoskeleton using a tilt sensor to restore self-initiated walking. Designed for
all-day use, ReWalk is battery-powered and consists of a light, wearable
exoskeleton with integrated motors at the joints, an array of sensors and a
computer-based control system to power knee and hip movement. ReWalk controls
movement using subtle changes in the user’s center of gravity. A forward tilt of
the upper body is sensed by the system, which initiates the first step. Repeated
body shifting generates a sequence of steps which allows for natural gait with
functional walking speed. Because the exoskeleton supports its own weight, users
do not expend unnecessary energy while walking. While ReWalk does not allow
side-to-side actuation, users are able to turn by shifting their weight to the
side. ReWalk also allows users to sit, stand and, in some cases, climb and
descend stairs. ReWalk users are able to independently operate the devices, and
most are able to put on and remove the devices by themselves. However, our
safety guidelines and FDA specifications require users to be accompanied by a
trained companion.

Published clinical studies demonstrate ReWalk’s ability to deliver a natural
gait and functional walking speed, which has not been shown in studies for any
competing exoskeleton. In addition, our interim analysis of an ongoing clinical
study and our experience working with health care practitioners and ReWalk users
suggests that ReWalk has the potential to provide secondary health benefits.
These benefits include reducing pain and spasticity and improving bowel and
urinary tract function, body and bone composition, metabolism and physical
fitness, as well as reducing hospitalizations and dependence on medications.
Because of these secondary medical benefits, we believe that ReWalk has the
ability to reduce the lifetime healthcare costs of individuals with spinal cord
injuries, making it economically attractive for individuals and third-party
payors. While we believe that ReWalk offers significant advantages over
competing technologies and therapies, disadvantages include the time it takes
for a user to put on ReWalk, the slower pace of ReWalk compared to a wheelchair,
the weight of ReWalk when carried, which makes it more burdensome for a
companion to transport than a wheelchair, and the requirement that users be
accompanied by a trained companion.

We believe that the current design of Rewalk provides a functional technical
base that can be easily adapted to address medical indications other than
paraplegia that affect the ability to walk. We are currently engaged in research
and development efforts to adapt ReWalk to address the mobility needs of
quadriplegia and multiple sclerosis patients, and, in the future, we plan to
address these needs in stroke and cerebral palsy patients. We are also
developing our next generation of ReWalk, with a more efficient drive mechanism,
slimmer profile and lighter body, as well as other improvements.

Development of ReWalk took over a decade and was spurred by the experiences of
our founder, Dr. Amit Goffer, himself a quadriplegic. As of August 1, 2014, we
had placed 62 ReWalk Rehabilitation and 19 ReWalk Personal systems, 88% of which
were purchased by our customers and 12% of which were placed with clinics and
distributors for training, market development and clinical testing. Through
August 1, 2014, we have trained over 400 ReWalk users, representing over 20,000
hours of use.

Our commercialization strategy is to penetrate rehabilitation centers, hospitals
and similar facilities that treat patients with spinal cord injuries to become
an integral part of their rehabilitation programs and to develop a broad based
training network with these facilities to prepare users for home and community
use. According to the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center, 87.1% of
persons with spinal cord injuries are sent to private, non-institutional
residences (in most cases, their homes) after hospital discharge. As a result,
while the majority of our sales to date have been ReWalk Rehabilitation units,
the primary focus of our commercialization efforts going forward will be
marketing ReWalk Personal for routine use at home, work or in the community, and
we expect sales of ReWalk Personal to account for the substantial majority of
our revenues in the future.

We expect to generate revenues from a combination of self-payors and third-party
payors. While no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement by third-party
payors currently exists for electronic exoskeleton technologies such as ReWalk
in the United States or elsewhere, we plan to pursue various paths of
reimbursement and support fundraising efforts by institutions and clinics. In
July 2014, the James J. Peters VA hospital (Bronx, New York) announced that it
would be fully committed to supporting the procurement of ReWalk Personal and
providing the staffing support needed for all eligible veterans with spinal cord
injury for whom ReWalk is clinically indicated. As the first hospital to
research the health-related benefits of an exoskeletal walking device for people
with spinal cord injury, the Bronx VA experience supports the clinical use of
ReWalk and similar FDA-approved technologies. We believe that additional VAs
will adopt similar policies in the future.
