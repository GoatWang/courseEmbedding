A better bioplastic for a better world
Green Dot makes bioplastic and biocomposite pellets. These materials allow designers and manufacturers to lessen the environmental impact of the plastic products we use and love everyday, without sacrificing quality or performance.







Starch composites
A USDA-certified biobased plastic that’s incredibly versatile and capable of withstanding high temperatures, starch-based composites are suitable for either rigid or pliable plastic applications. Our Terratek SC line lets you replace up to 65 percent of your plastic product with renewable materials.

Wood-plastic composites
Made from reclaimed wood fibers and either virgin, recycled or biodegradable plastic, wood-plastic composites combine the manufacturing possibilities of plastics with the aesthetics and durability of wood. These customizable composite materials are easy to work with, durable and can be made to achieve a variety of looks and feels.

Biodegradeables
Starch-based biodegradables can help decrease landfill volumes and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. They are ideal for single-use disposable products. These materials may be rigid or pliable and can be customized to desired physical properties.
Learn more
Elastomers
Strong and durable, yet flexible, Terratek Flex is the market’s first bioplastic elastomer verified to meet both U.S. and E.U. standards for compostability, and tested by NSF Laboratories to meet the strictest international toy safety standards. The material has an exquisite soft touch, and is ideal for scenting.

Building four paths to sustainability
Pragmatism has its place in the green movement. No one bioplastic solution will eliminate the problems of waste, over reliance on non-renewable resources or the use of harmful chemicals in manufacturing. But at Green Dot, we believe a combination of strategies give product designers and entrepreneurs the flexibility to choose materials that perform up to expectations without devastating the planet.
