Words such as "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "intend" and similar expressions, as they relate to the company or its management, identify forward-looking statements.

COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS FOR EFFICACIOUS AND SAFE DELIVERY OF SIRNA USING SPECIFIC CHITOSAN-BASED NANOCOMPLEXES



Publication number:  20160152988
                                            

Abstract:  There is disclosed a composition and a method for the efficient delivery of a therapeutic RNAi-inducing nucleic acid to cells both in vitro and in vivo through specific formulations of a non viral delivery system using chitosans. Particularly, the composition contains a nucleic acid and a specific chitosan that has the following physico-chemical properties: a number-average molecular weight between 5 kDa and 200 kDa, a degree of deacetylation between 80% and 95% and a chitosan amine to nucleic acid phosphate ratio below 20.

GENE THERAPY FOR DIABETES WITH CHITOSAN-DELIVERED PLASMID ENCODING GLUCAGON-LIKE PEPTIDE 1



Publication number:  20130210717
                                            

Abstract:  Chitosan delivers a plasmid encoding Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 (GLP-1) to cells in a patient for gene therapy of diabetes. Chitosan is optimized for plasmid transfection by modulating three of its physico-chemical properties: degree of deacetylation (DDA), molecular weight (MW), and ratio of amines on chitosan to phosphates on DNA (N:P ratio), Chitosan 92-10-5 (DDA-MW-N:P) is more efficient than chitosans 80-10-10 and 80-80-5 in delivering a plasmid encoding luciferase or GLP-1(7-37) to cells. In the Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rat model of diabetes, chitosan-delivered pVax plasmid encoding GLP-1 lowers glucose levels, increases insulin production and reduces weight gain.
