It's free!Your colleagues, classmates, and 500 million other professionals are on LinkedIn.View Mollie’s Full ProfileSummaryMy resume shows a diverse job background but I prefer to think of it as well rounded. Through all of these jobs, I’ve met all sorts of people with different needs and in different places of their life giving me a more open perspective of the world. I’ve also been able to strengthen my customer service skills in each job because of the different people I was dealing with at the time. While working at Macy’s I dealt with a lot of impatient people who were frantic from holiday shopping. At the Joint Base Chapel, I came across many people who were at a crossroads in their life and needed a little help dealing with it. When I worked as a janitor for Colorado State University, I saw a lot of college kids who were free for the first time and had little to no respect for being an adult in all areas of their life. No matter the situation, I had to use my customer service skills to effectively navigate each encounter with grace, kindness and a level head. 	While volunteering at the chapel I was also able to work in many youth programs. I volunteered with the teen youth group, I taught the 5th and 6th graders on Wednesday night religious education and I headed the worship interns program where we taught 7-13 year olds to take in a sermon and apply it to their life. In these programs, I had to encourage participation in the various activities we would do during each session. I kept the participants safe and let them know this was a place they could talk openly while still maintaining order. 	In all my previous jobs, education and life in general I have been able to develop computer skills with Microsoft office and many different social networking sites and the internet in general. My communication skills have also grown both verbally and in writing, which is my strong suit. I can work well under pressure and deadlines while still working efficiently.ExperienceSales AssociateMacy'sOctober 2012  –  December 2012 (3 months)I assisted customers in locating products while making suggestions as to complimentary items to purchase or in place of the item they looked for if currently unavailable. Maintained the appearance of the floor while replacing items from the dressing rooms. Filled the role of cashier and helped the customer in determining which coupon was best for the amount that they were purchasing. Handled returns and exchanges as well as locating items at different stores or the warehouse for order.Volunteer receptionistJoint Base McGuire-Dix-LakehurstJune 2012  –  December 2012 (7 months)I answered phones and transferred the caller to the person they needed to speak to. I greeted anyone that walked into the chapel office and directed them as necessary. I took messages and scheduled invocations. On occasion, I helped with small projects around the office. For example updating the chapel rosters, recreating the chapel brochures and taking reservations for the marriage retreats held through the chapel. In total, I had over 550 volunteer hours in this one position.Teacher, mentorJoint Base McGuire-Dix-LakehurstFebruary 2012  –  December 2012 (11 months)I taught 5th and 6th graders religious education. I led a program called worship interns where children ages 7-13 who were no longer in sunday school classes learned how to sit in the church during the sermon and take a message out of it as well as applying it to their lives. I created the lessons and class structure to teach the children how to take notes and what to listen for as the preacher was talking. I also volunteered with the youth group, ages 13-18.Sales AssociateJoint Base Uniform and Equipment CenterSeptember 2011  –  March 2012 (7 months)I handled and reorganized the entire packing and shipping operation for the store. Managed the online stores. Kept the store clean and organized. Added new merchandise to the floor to optimize sales. Assisted purchasing officers through the store and in deciding which items to purchase for deploying units. Learned extensively about each product on the floor and any new products that came into the store so as to better sell the product to the customer.Student supervisor, custodianColorado State UniversityAugust 2008  –  May 2011 (2 years 10 months)Fort Collins, Colorado AreaI supervised other employees as we cleaned a given area using basic cleaning utensils and chemicals or heavy machinery. Sometimes we would work as a team on large projects or alone on smaller projects. I cleaned areas when it's scheduled cleaner was absent. Answered phones on occasion. Decided which areas I wanted to clean, before I was a supervisor, and managed my time so that I could adequately clean my areas and still make it to all of my classes.SkillsMicrosoft ApplicationsCashieringWritingCustomer ServicePhone EtiquetteMulti-line PhoneHow's this translation?Great•Has errorsThanks for your help!EducationColorado State UniversityInternational studies, Latin AmericaInternational studies, Latin America2008  –  2011View Mollie’s full profile to...See who you know in commonGet introducedContact Mollie directlyView Mollie’s Full ProfileNot the Mollie you’re looking for?

Boost productivity with exact positioning
Integrated laser projection systems for both 2D and 3D applications providing precision alignment. Allows for projection of laser patterns onto complex curved surfaces in complete 3D images, suitable for mold composite layup, wind turbine blade production, vehicle construction, aerospace and a variety of manufacturing processes.







Carter lights the way to greater accuracy
A full offering of high powered line lasers, both red and green, suitable for any application requiring a clean crisp line for visual alignment. These lasers carry a full two-year warranty, are waterproof and come in a variety of line lengths, optics and mounts.







The Next Evolution in Steadyrest Work Support Systems
This system is compatible with a range of lathe sizes from mini to 20" all with one unit. The system is lightweight, yet very robust. The system can be split open to access or remove the work piece as well as converting it from Steadyrest to Bowlrest configurations.







Spend more time cutting and less time adjusting
Carter Upgrade conversion kits increase your saws performance through the use of sealed ball bearing roller guides or Tefloy™ lubricated block support guides. This provides your saw with reduced blade friction, improved cutting accuracy, and is adjustable for various blade widths. Our bearing guides have no wear surfaces which means that until you need to change the blade size you won’t have to adjust your guides, so spend more time woodworking and less time adjusting.







Innovative new Hollowing System from Carter
The Hollow Roller™ system is a complete, easy to set-up turnkey hollowing system that allows the operator to focus on the work and art of the vessel being turned versus on the system. The boring bar is completely captive and incorporates a full sealed bearing lubrication free roller system that eliminates the drag on the bar, thus enabling a smoother flowing motion to all tool movements.
