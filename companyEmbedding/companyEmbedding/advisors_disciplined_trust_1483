Capturing Results Through Innovation and Discipline Through a structured and disciplined approach we will provide exclusivity and customized investment strategies for our clients.  We will be distinguishable by the personal relationships we build with our clients, truly listening to and understanding their financial goals and objectives.


Right around the midpoint in life, humans tend to learn that if you make a decision in an emotional state of mind, you have a great chance of making the wrong choice.  Among the most damaging emotions of all are greed and fear.


Fortunately, life experience serves you well and success is achieved in family and in business.  This wisdom brings financial rewards.  Sound decision making allows you to achieve substantial life goals and to surround yourself with friends and colleagues who have the same long-range vision.  


Yet when it comes to investing in the market, seasoned life veterans inadvertently join hands with an entire population that never learned the same lessons.  Unknowingly, their investments are commingled with approximately 85% of the marketplace who make investment decisions based on greed and fear.  This herd mentality drives the market impacting your holdings at this very moment…

GENERATIONAL WEALTH
At Discipline Advisors, Inc. we take a comprehensive approach to estate planning and the management of our clients’ wealth. We start by ensuring our clients have proper trusts and documents in place.
“We’ve helped hundreds of clients achieve peace of mind – and a common goal – that when their children receive their inheritance, they will perceive their gift as inheriting a legacy, not winning the lottery.” – Joe Michaletz
We strive to help our clients transfer their values, along with their wealth, to the next generation. We spend the time necessary to educate, explain and help our clients identify their vision, mission, values and goals. We then work with a team, including CPAs and estate tax attorneys, to customize proper estate planning documents to accomplish their goals. At Discipline Advisors, Inc. it is our passion to see our clients transfer their wealth with clarity, with purpose, while minimizing taxes and estate settlement costs.
RETIREMENT PLANNING AND INCOME
Most retirees draw income out of their portfolios, simultaneously pulling from equities as well as fixed income positions. Yet in a down market, a greater number of equity shares must be sold to achieve the same amount of monthly income. A share that no longer exists in your portfolio never has the ability to regain value once the market rebounds. Few retirees realize that those additional shares sold permanently reduce the average rate of return of the portfolio.
This is because the income withdrawal phase of a portfolio must be managed differently than the accumulation phase. During the accumulation phase, the order in which you receive particular year-to-year returns has no impact on the resulting growth. However, during the income withdrawal phase, the order in which you achieve particular returns – say 5% one year and 12% the next, or vice versa – can substantially affect your principal.
Our TRIPLE DISCIPLINE INVESTMENT SYSTEM allows us to significantly and strategically reduce the number of equity shares sold to help produce retirement cash flow. As a result, we add to the long-term growth potential of your portfolio while maximizing the amount of potential income you can withdraw.

Home >> Our Philosophy Our Philosophy
COMMINGLING WITH THE HERD
THE HERD represents approximately 85% of investors – investors who make decisions in an emotional state of mind with a short time horizon and a short fuse. They buy and sell based on greed and fear. When a stock goes up, they buy high. When a position begins to decline, they ride it down and often sell low. If the assets of the long-term investor are commingled with THE HERD via mutual funds or large institutionally managed accounts, the investor’s holdings are attached to the same emotional roller coaster. Fasten your seat belt. The very person you would never go into business with, or never appoint to your entity’s board, has become your partner in risk.
We have unique strategies that separate us from THE HERD. We can provide exclusivity and we can customize investment strategies to meet the needs of any client because of our independent nature.
We have spent over two decades developing a proprietary investment management system that removes human emotion from decision making, thereby separating our clients from THE HERD. It is based on three key disciplines which we use to our clients’ advantage. And we never, ever violate these three disciplines.
A WORD ABOUT CAPACITY: WHY BIGGER ISN’T BETTER
Ask any large mutual fund manager, or manager of large institutional portfolios, how long it would take to liquidate their largest holding without negatively impacting the price of the stock. After an uncomfortable pause, they’ll typically predict six months or more.
Ask yourself – if the market’s going down, do you have six months to wait?
Capacity is defined as the length of time it takes for a manager to liquidate his or her largest holding without negatively impacting the price of the stock. The capacity question is the first question we ask every money manager we interview. If they cannot liquidate within five days or less, they’re simply not a candidate for our system.
Many investors feel safer in bigger funds or large institutional accounts. Many advisors advocate their selection. We have strongly believe that bigger is not better. Consider this cause and effect. The short-term mentality of THE HERD reacts to even the most minor economic uncertainty and drives the market down. Large funds are forced to liquidate assets quickly, and at their low point, to meet THE HERD’S redemption requests. By liquidating too much too quickly, their actions inadvertently drive the price of a particular holding down.
Alternatively, their capacity constraints don’t allow them to get out quickly enough, leaving their investors holding ever-declining positions. And then the story gets worse. Most large funds are relegated to keeping no more than 10% in cash. When THE HERD hears a spark of good news, and the market shows promise of a rebound, THE HERD reinvests, plowing cash back into the managers’ hands. It’s no longer a buyer’s market, but the fund finds itself with too much cash. Because of the rules it is asked to follow, it is forced to literally buy high.
NOT ALL PRIVATELY MANAGED ACCOUNTS ARE MANAGED PRIVATELY
Many affluent individuals or institutional investors feel safer when invested in privately managed accounts. However, the institutional managers who manage those accounts typically also manage the mutual fund accounts with the same stock holdings. Therefore the privately managed accounts are forced to follow the same guidelines as the mutual funds and possess the same capacity issues.
Our TRIPLE DISCIPLINE INVESTMENT SYSTEM captures the agility of the market by hiring those individual money managers who oversee millions – not billions. Because most own their own privately-held firms, they have the freedom to act on research and intellect. We have found that there are many good stock pickers in the world, but there are few good stock sellers. That is why each of our managers is required to have a documented, proven sell discipline based on technical research, price targets and trigger points. This protects our clients’ downside risk, and once again removes human emotion from investing.

Unit Investment Trusts (UITs) are sold only by prospectus. Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing which contains a detailed explanation of the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Investors should consult their accounting, legal, or tax advisor.


* Information labeled “Fee-Based Account” provides information pertaining to units purchased through registered investment advisers, certified financial planners or registered broker-dealers who in each case either charge investor accounts periodic fees for brokerage services, financial planning, investment advisory or asset management services, or provide such services in connection with an investment account for which a comprehensive “wrap fee” charge is imposed. You should consult your financial advisor to determine whether you can benefit from these accounts and whether your unit purchases are eligible for this discount. To purchase units in these accounts, your financial advisor must purchase units designated with one of the Fee Account CUSIP numbers, if available. The amounts shown are different from what would be applicable for units purchased in other accounts (i.e. “Commission-Based Accounts”) not eligible for this discount.  See your prospectus and consult your financial advisor for more information about eligibility and applicability of the Fee-Based Account discount.
