YOU ARE HERE: LAT Home→Collections→ClinicsHow I Made It: J. Mario Molina and John MolinaThe brothers expanded their father's clinic business, Molina Healthcare, into facilities across the country that cater to patients on government medical assistance.May 23, 2010|By Nathan Olivarez-Giles and Darrell Satzman


The gig: J. Mario Molina and John Molina, who are brothers, run Molina Healthcare Inc., a health maintenance organization provider that operates 19 clinics in 10 states. The company, based in Long Beach, has 2,900 employees and more than 1.4 million customers, most of whom receive Medicaid, Medi-Cal and other government healthcare assistance. Last year the company took in $3.7 billion, of which $31 million was profit. Founding father: In 1980, emergency-room physician C. David Molina started Molina Healthcare after noticing an influx of patients in the ER who had been turned away from doctors who wouldn't accept Medi-Cal. "Nobody wanted to take care of them," said Mario, 51, chief executive of the company. "They would come in for sore throats and diaper rash, kids with fevers and earaches, things that weren't really emergencies." Family business: Mario, John and their three sisters all pitched in at the initial three clinics. "It was expected of us to help out," Mario said. "We'd work at the reception desk, we'd paint the buildings, sweep, mop, water plants, mow the lawn, wash windows, clean bathrooms, anything that needed to be done, short of seeing patients." Different paths: Mario followed in his father's footsteps and became a doctor, attending medical school at USC. John got a degree in economics from USC. "I was the exact opposite of Mario and I was very squeamish," said John, 46, now chief financial officer of the company. "I didn't want to go hang out in the ER, but I loved doing payroll." Growing pains: In 1989, the company took over the lease on nine closed clinics formerly operated by Maxicare Corp. To help pay for the expansion, David Molina took out a second mortgage on the family home. "We literally started those nine clinics empty," Mario said. "Dad sent John and I out to recruit back all the people who were working for Maxicare. It took months to get going, but patients eventually came back too." Twist of fate: Mario, who aimed for a career in research, was conducting diabetes studies at USC in 1990 when Molina Healthcare's medical director died unexpectedly. Mario took the job part time and continued on at USC until his father gave him a choice. "He said, 'I really need someone to be a full-time medical director. If you want the job, it's yours. If you don't, I'm going to hire someone else,'" Mario said. "So I decided to leave academics and go with my dad." On their own: David Molina died in 1996, two months before the company was set to expand into Utah. "Dad had always been here and we worked very closely with him, but all the big decisions were his," Mario said. "It was sort of like being on a high wire and then they take away your safety net. John and I were young and a lot of people didn't think we'd be able to pull it off, but we did." The brothers continued the company's expansion by purchasing HMO providers in Washington state and Michigan. Going public: "We had come to a fork in the road and it was clear that we couldn't continue to grow the way we wanted if we didn't get more capital," Mario said. Molina Healthcare went public in 2003, raising more than $115 million in its initial public offering. The brothers used that money to expand further. The revenue brought in from the growth of the company allowed Molina Healthcare to buy a health information management business from Unisys Corp. that runs Medicare programs under state contracts for $135 million in cash in January. According to Hispanic Business Magazine, Molina Healthcare is now the second-largest Hispanic-owned company in the U.S., behind Brightstar Corp., which provides distribution services for wireless firms.  Obama boost: The recently passed healthcare legislation could benefit Molina Healthcare, Mario said. "We serve primarily Medicaid patients, and the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that with the Obama healthcare changes, another 15 to 19 million people that are uninsured now will be placed on Medicaid over the next few years. That will increase our potential customer base by about 25%." Risk as a business strategy: "If you look back at the history of the company, each of our turning points as a company involved taking a risk," John said. "When Dad expanded from three to 12 clinics, that was a risk. When we expanded into Utah after Dad died, that was risky too. For some deals, to buy a small health plan in another state or something like that, we've had to scrape every penny we had together to pull it off. "It can be scary sometimes, but we make the moves that we think will make the company better in the long term, not just what will be the best in the short term." nathan.olivarezgiles@latimes.com

History[edit]
Molina Healthcare was founded in 1980 by C. David Molina, an emergency room physician in Long Beach, CA.[5] He had seen an influx of patients using the emergency room for common illnesses such as a sore throat or the flu because they were being turned away by doctors who would not accept Medi-Cal. As a result of his emergency room work, Dr. Molina established his first primary care clinic with the goal of treating the lowest-income patients, regardless of their ability to pay.[6]
The company was run by Dr. Molina’s son, J. Mario Molina, MD, who was a physician. He was the president and CEO of the company. John Molina, Mario’s younger brother, was the current CFO of Molina Healthcare.[7] In May of 2017, in light of poor financial performance by the company, J. Mario and John were removed from their positions by the board, ending family control of the company.[8] The two took over the Molina’s operations after their father died in 1996 and continued to expand the company.
However there are reports that it was J Mario Molina's outspoken criticism of the current administration that motivated the firing.
“I’ve been a very vocal critic of what’s going on in Washington,” Molina told Politico. “I know the other health plan executives have been afraid to speak out. Maybe they’re smarter than I am, but I’m not going to back off.”
FierceHealthCare.com reported: "Molina Healthcare had thrived in the ACA’s individual marketplaces, but revealed in February that it lost $110 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, due at least in part to the fact that it had to pay significantly more into the risk adjustment program than it had anticipated.
However, despite those losses, Molina beat Wall Street predictions for the first quarter of 2017, the results of which were announced a day after the brothers were fired."
There has also been speculation by industry analysts about a sale of the company, which may present an additional motivation to remove members of the founder's family from leadership positions.

C. David Molina’s daughter Martha Bernadett, MD is also a part of Molina Healthcare. Since receiving two Robert Wood Johnson Foundation awards in 2002, Dr. Bernadett has served as the Executive Vice President of Research and Innovation at Molina Healthcare.

Both companies are accused of discriminating against American workers who claim they were fired and replaced with H-1B workers. The companies are accused of violating numerous federal and state labor laws. In July, the U.S. District Court, Central District of California ruled that there were no federal claims, which the plaintiff’s attorney had acknowledged in his Declaration in Support of (the plaintiff’s) Motion to Remand.

History[edit]
Molina Healthcare was founded in 1980 by C. David Molina, an emergency room physician in Long Beach, CA.[5] He had seen an influx of patients using the emergency room for common illnesses such as a sore throat or the flu because they were being turned away by doctors who would not accept Medi-Cal. As a result of his emergency room work, Dr. Molina established his first primary care clinic with the goal of treating the lowest-income patients, regardless of their ability to pay.[6]
The company was run by Dr. Molina’s son, J. Mario Molina, MD, who was a physician. He was the president and CEO of the company. John Molina, Mario’s younger brother, was the current CFO of Molina Healthcare.[7] In May of 2017, in light of poor financial performance by the company, J. Mario and John were removed from their positions by the board, ending family control of the company.[8] The two took over the Molina’s operations after their father died in 1996 and continued to expand the company.
However there are reports that it was J Mario Molina's outspoken criticism of the current administration that motivated the firing.
“I’ve been a very vocal critic of what’s going on in Washington,” Molina told Politico. “I know the other health plan executives have been afraid to speak out. Maybe they’re smarter than I am, but I’m not going to back off.”
FierceHealthCare.com reported: "Molina Healthcare had thrived in the ACA’s individual marketplaces, but revealed in February that it lost $110 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, due at least in part to the fact that it had to pay significantly more into the risk adjustment program than it had anticipated.
However, despite those losses, Molina beat Wall Street predictions for the first quarter of 2017, the results of which were announced a day after the brothers were fired."
There has also been speculation by industry analysts about a sale of the company, which may present an additional motivation to remove members of the founder's family from leadership positions.
(Reference: http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/aca/ousted-molina-ceo-insurers-afraid-trump-administration)
C. David Molina’s daughter Martha Bernadett, MD is also a part of Molina Healthcare. Since receiving two Robert Wood Johnson Foundation awards in 2002, Dr. Bernadett has served as the Executive Vice President of Research and Innovation at Molina Healthcare. She founded the Molina Institute for Cultural Competency, Book Buddies and the Molina Foundation, a non-profit organization to promote access to education and health care to reduce disparities.[9]
Clinic Expansion[edit]
The first Molina Medical clinic was opened in Wilmington, CA in 1980. Since then, 29 clinics have opened in Northern California, Southern California, Washington, New Mexico, Florida and Utah.[10][11] Molina Medical Group (MMG) also runs state-owned clinics in Fairfax County, Virginia. The clinics were opened to provide health care to low-income families and individuals.
Becoming an HMO[edit]

History[edit]
Molina Healthcare was founded in 1980 by C. David Molina, an emergency room physician in Long Beach, CA.[5] He had seen an influx of patients using the emergency room for common illnesses such as a sore throat or the flu because they were being turned away by doctors who would not accept Medi-Cal. As a result of his emergency room work, Dr. Molina established his first primary care clinic with the goal of treating the lowest-income patients, regardless of their ability to pay.[6]
The company was run by Dr. Molina’s son, J. Mario Molina, MD, who was a physician. He was the president and CEO of the company. John Molina, Mario’s younger brother, was the current CFO of Molina Healthcare.[7] In May of 2017, in light of poor financial performance by the company, J. Mario and John were removed from their positions by the board, ending family control of the company.[8] The two took over the Molina’s operations after their father died in 1996 and continued to expand the company.
However there are reports that it was J Mario Molina's outspoken criticism of the current administration that motivated the firing.
“I’ve been a very vocal critic of what’s going on in Washington,” Molina told Politico. “I know the other health plan executives have been afraid to speak out. Maybe they’re smarter than I am, but I’m not going to back off.”
FierceHealthCare.com reported: "Molina Healthcare had thrived in the ACA’s individual marketplaces, but revealed in February that it lost $110 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, due at least in part to the fact that it had to pay significantly more into the risk adjustment program than it had anticipated.
However, despite those losses, Molina beat Wall Street predictions for the first quarter of 2017, the results of which were announced a day after the brothers were fired."
There has also been speculation by industry analysts about a sale of the company, which may present an additional motivation to remove members of the founder's family from leadership positions.
(Reference: http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/aca/ousted-molina-ceo-insurers-afraid-trump-administration)
C. David Molina’s daughter Martha Bernadett, MD is also a part of Molina Healthcare. Since receiving two Robert Wood Johnson Foundation awards in 2002, Dr. Bernadett has served as the Executive Vice President of Research and Innovation at Molina Healthcare. She founded the Molina Institute for Cultural Competency, Book Buddies and the Molina Foundation, a non-profit organization to promote access to education and health care to reduce disparities.[9]

However, in March 2013, Gov. Bobby Jindal canceled that contract. A new fiscal agent has yet to be named.[35] MMS also gained a contract with the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Both companies are accused of discriminating against American workers who claim they were fired and replaced with H-1B workers. The companies are accused of violating numerous federal and state labor laws. In July, the U.S. District Court, Central District of California ruled that there were no federal claims, which the plaintiff’s attorney had acknowledged in his Declaration in Support of (the plaintiff’s) Motion to Remand. Molina has expressed confidence it will “win in court because specific allegations have been examined and found false.”[53]

Labor Litigation[edit]
In April 2011, a lawsuit was filed against the company and its outsourcing firm Cognizant Technologies in California state court. Both companies are accused of discriminating against American workers who claim they were fired and replaced with H-1B workers. The companies are accused of violating numerous federal and state labor laws. In July, the U.S. District Court, Central District of California ruled that there were no federal claims, which the plaintiff’s attorney had acknowledged in his Declaration in Support of (the plaintiff’s) Motion to Remand. Molina has expressed confidence it will “win in court because specific allegations have been examined and found false.”[53]
