Global Portable Gas Chromatograph Market: Snapshot
Applications of gas chromatograph techniques have witnessed a tremendous rise in areas such as production monitoring, research, petrochemical, quality check in the chemicals industry, effluent management in the industrial sector, and forensic science. While the conventional stationary, laboratory desk-top, process at-line and on-line chromatographs of a variety of sizes and configurations are still ubiquitous across key application sectors, the increased need for effective on-field analytical tools has led to the vast rise in adoption of portable gas chromatographs in the recent times. 
In areas such as homeland security, environment sustenance, and legal proceedings, especially, the demand for portable gas chromatographs for purposes such as trace analysis and analyte identifications has witnessed significant rise over the years. The use of advanced portable instruments in these areas allow for quick analysis, which helps in retaining the sample’s integrity and curtailing potential delay in sample analysis. The rising demand for portable gas chromatographs from such and a variety of other areas where field analysis plays a big role in deciding the authenticity or effectiveness of analysis has compelled companies to develop a variety of portable instruments. 
Most devices in the market presently can be segmented into two broad classes: small-sized instruments that can be manually carried to the site or can be held in hands for the qualitative analysis of the sample and medium-sized instruments (needing some form of transportation to be carried to the desired site) for a much broader, quantitative analysis. With a vast rise in the number of environment sustenance norms being implemented across the globe, the demand for advanced portable gas chromatographs, of both handheld as well as transportable varieties, is expected to significantly rise in the next few years.
Portable Gas Chromatograph Market: Overview 
A portable gas chromatograph (GC) is an analytical instrument used for separating the different components of a mixture and analyzing them. The components that are separated can be made to vaporize without decomposing and the methods of separation mainly use various inert gases such as helium, argon, nitrogen, and hydrogen across a solid stationary phase. The instrument typically consists of a sample injector, flow controller, column oven, GC column, and a detector. Rise in government spending across regions along with importance of chromatography test in various end-use industries are the factors expected to boost the growth of the portable gas chromatograph market across various regions.
Increasing number of conferences to create awareness about modern gas chromatography techniques and emerging application of portable in gas chromatograph in healthcare industries will keep the market evolving. Portable gas chromatography can be used as a standalone application or may be combined with other mass spectrometers to enhance its performance. The major end-use industries where portable gas chromatograph are widely used are oil and gas, food and agriculture, and environmental biosciences.
This report, prepared with the help of extensive primary and secondary research, provides detailed insight into current market scenario, key manufacturing processes, emerging development trends, and competitive dynamics impacting the growth of the market in various regions.

Tokio Solution Management, GC Securities Create Private Cat Bond Platform For Smaller Capacity Buyers

 Print
 Email









 

		June 10, 2013					


Tokio Solution Management Ltd. and GC Securities, a division of MMC Securities Corp., have created a private catastrophe bond platform to meet the needs of an underserved segment of reinsurance buyers.
The platform is called the Tokio Tensai Platform and it will provide access to reinsurance buyers whose capacity needs are below the threshold amount needed to justify a traditional Rule 144A catastrophe bond issuance, GC Securities said in a statement, without specifying an amount.
In a statement announcing the platform, Chi Hum, Managing Director at GC Securities, said, “The advantages of capital markets capacity previously available only to the largest of capacity buyers will now be made available to a broader client segment.”
Kathleen Faries, CEO of Tokio Solution said the Tokio Tensai Platform is an alternative to the traditional Rule 144A offering process.
Building off Tokio Millenium Re’s experience as a facilitator and risk transformer, Tokio Solution will provide clients the ability to sponsor catastrophe bond transactions through Shima Reinsurance Ltd., the Bermuda domiciled Class III Segregated Accounts Company of TMR.
GC Securities, a U.S. registered broker-dealer and member FINRA/SIPC, will serve as a placement agent for each of the private placements through Shima Re.
Through a simplified and standardized process, the Tokio Tensai Platform is designed to significantly reduce the time and cost traditionally associated with sponsoring catastrophe bonds by utilizing Shima Re’s platform and proprietary shelf documentation.  Still, the Tokio Tensai Platform will also allow clients to customize coverage along a range of triggers and reinsurance structures while in keeping with the lower cost approach of the product.
The name Tokio Tensai is derived from the Japanese word “Tensai,” which in English means “genius” and “act of God”— a reference to innovation and coverage of catastrophe risks.
The English translation of Shima is “Island.”
