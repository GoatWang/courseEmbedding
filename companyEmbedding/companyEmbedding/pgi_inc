Sawbuck Chainsaw Chaps saved my life

June 30, 2014

I have been using a chainsaw for many many years and I've never experienced what happened the day your chaps got tested. I had just cut down a small oak tree about 8 inches in diameter. After I had the tree cut up I came back to the stump to cut it off closer to the ground. Rather than just moving the saw through the stump from right to left I was evidently rotating the saw around the stump. I'm assuming the momentum of the saw kept coming around in an arc. After the stump had been cut through, the saw then hit my leg above the knee (I was on my knees at the time) and the saw was instantly stopped by the chaps. Needless to say I was stunned and couldn't believe what had just happened.

Working with chemicals and meat by-products is an occupational hazard in many industries. But occupational hazards do not – and should not mean that accidents are an acceptable part of the job.
PGI manufactures a wide variety of garments that protect against various chemicals as well as the oils, fats, and other by-products prevalent in the meat, fish and seafood handling and eviscerating industries. U.S.D.A accepted for food and meat handling – our wide range of protective garments include the famous Brute™ and Mini-Brute™ Aprons, Smocks, Sleeves and Spats.

Sawbuck Chainsaw Chaps saved my life

I have been using a chainsaw for many many years and I've never experienced what happened the day your chaps got tested. I had just cut down a small oak tree about 8 inches in diameter. After I had the tree cut up I came back to the stump to cut it off closer to the ground. Rather than just moving the saw through the stump from right to left I was evidently rotating the saw around the stump. I'm assuming the momentum of the saw kept coming around in an arc. After the stump had been cut through, the saw then hit my leg above the knee (I was on my knees at the time) and the saw was instantly stopped by the chaps. Needless to say I was stunned and couldn't believe what had just happened.

Mini Brute | Heavyweight Double Coated Nitrile







              $ 24.86
            







Notify me when this product is available:








Priced Individually - Sold By The Dozen

Description

The Heavyweight Mini Brute is designed with a single purpose – to outwear any other protective apron in its class. Constructed with a built-in extra layer of Nitrile for superior cut protection and wear resistance, the Mini Brute's design also helps prevent bacterial collection and leakage along patch seams, seamlines and peeling/flaking caused by sewn on belly patches. And when it comes to unparalleled protection and wear-life, PGI’s Brute Aprons are standard equipped with the patented “Belly Band” for that built-in extra layer – where it counts most.
Sold and packaged by the dozen.

Specifications





35” wide X 48” long
Base 17-19 mil. / band 28-30 mil.
14-1/2” long reinforced X 35” Wide Belly Band (runs full width of apron)
30” long X 1” wide  webbing neck strap with adjustable snap buckle
Nickel-plated brass grommets will not corrode or rust
Excellent resistance to acids, solvents, oils and animal fats
U.S.D.A. Accepted for food and meat handling
Polyester base fabric provides superior coating adhesion, cut protection and abrasion and tear resistance
Quick release metal buckle with 1" wide polyester webbing strap provides better comfort and safety than standard rope or tape ties and allows apron neck strap to release if caught in moving equipment
All edges turned and sewn with single needle lock stitch
Available in yellow with heavy-duty, color-coordinated nylon thread
Sold and packaged by the dozen
Machine wash warm with mild detergent. Air dry. Do Not Dry Clean.




Nitrile (Hycar) Rubber

Nitrile (Hycar) rubber has exceptional resistance to animal fats, vegetable oils, petroleum oils, aromatic hydrocarbon and many acids. It also has excellent abrasion resistance and tensile strength making it one of the most durable rubber coatings available. The Brute and Mini-Brute is PGI’s patented Belly Band apron which is guaranteed to outwear any competitive patched aprons. A 14” solid Nitrile band is “cured” right into apron across the belly wear area for maximum adhesion – can’t peel or snag like patched aprons and has no place for bacteria or contaminates to collect. Because there is no intervening fabric layers, as on other patched aprons, both cut and wear resistance is unequaled. The Belly Band covers approximately 500 square inches which is twice as much as other patched aprons. For over 35 years the Brute and Mini-Brute aprons have been the apron of choice for Food and Meat Handlers the world over and is universally accepted by U.S.D.A., by other government inspectors and by the meat and food processing industry itself.
