This is the largest and most powerful tool battery I have encountered, and it will really last a long time due to its high capacity. 

This battery can be used interchangeably in a number of different Snapper tools: leaf blower, electric mower, chain saw, hedge trimmer, and grass trimmer. It is ideal to have such interchangeability among tools. 

Because this is a lithium-ion battery, there are no worries about the battery memory being affected by the charging cycle. Just plug in in the charger any time convenient to top of the battery so you are ready to go for the next use.

It just makes things less complicated having one size battery for so many tools! 

I highly recommend this battery and the whole system of Snapper tools that are supported by this battery!

This is an exceptionally powerful battery and there seems to be little limit to what it can do.

Keep in mind, you're dealing with none other than BRIGGS AND STRATTON! Those folks have been doing gas motors for ages, so when I saw they teamed up with SNAPPER I knew this was going to be a leap forward in the world of battery operated tools. 

First and foremost, this is an 82 VOLT (!) Battery! It has ample power to run hedge clippers, blowers, line trimmers, chainsaws (!), and even lawn mowers! All these tools are generally sold seperately from the charger and battery, something I didn't like at first (due to the additional purchase), but if you're going to go with all SNAPPER tools, then you're only going to need this battery. No sense buying the battery over and over again. 

I'm going to take a moment to note that I probably wouldn't say that about some of the older battery tool systems. If the battery dies, then your tools all die too. Extra batteries were the norm for me with this type of tool. But Briggs and Stratton/Snapper gaurantees this battery for TWO YEARS! I don't know about you and how you use these types of tools, but I can really put them through the grind and get a lot of use (abuse?) out of them. When they first started making battery operated tools (drills and such) I fully expected them to last a while, then give up. I don't get that vibe from this battery. 

I think this thing is built to last a LONG time.

Of course, there's no way for me to know that for absolute certain until I've used it extensively for a couple of years. All I can say at this time is that I have the hedge trimmer and the line grass trimmer that goes with this battery... and they've worn me out before I've run out of juice so far! I haven't even experienced any perceived falling off of power as I've gone along and that's pretty impressive for a tool like a hedge clipper.

I have a ton of faith in Briggs and Stratton. I think they took some time to develop one great battery system to work with the Snapper full line of tools. If you're looking to finally get a system that has just about everything you need for your home lawn, this is it.

This system is a leap forward for battery operated tools.
