(MENAFN Editorial) lang="EN-US">  Mueller Industries, Inc. Reports Second Quarter 2017 Earnings  MEMPHIS, Tenn., July 25, 2017 -- Mueller Industries, Inc. (NYSE: MLI) announced today operating income of 46.8 million for the second quarter of 2017, compared with 44.4 million in the same quarter last year. Net income for the period was 27.6 million, or 48 cents per diluted share, on net sales of 614.3 million. This compares with net income of 27.8 million, or 49 cents per diluted share, on net sales of 544.1 million in the same quarter of 2016. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to higher selling prices and higher overall unit volumes.  Financial and Operating Highlights for the second quarter of 2017:  The average price of copper was 21 percent (45 cents per pound) higher compared with the same period of 2016.  During the quarter, Mueller sold its 50.5% share of the MXR  #China  tube mill. The gain from the sale was more than offset by one-time expenses related to startup costs at the Cedar City, Utah tube mill and the press relocation to the Fulton, Mississippi tube mill.  Interest expense for the quarter was 6.4 million compared with 1.7 million in the same quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to interest on the Company's 6% Subordinated Debentures distributed on March 9, 2017 as part of a special dividend.  At quarter end, cash totaled 167.6 million.  Regarding the outlook, Greg Christopher, Mueller CEO, said, "Business conditions in the markets we serve are on track with our expectations for 2017. Construction activity in the U.S. continues to provide steady demand for many of our products, and improvement in industrial demand after several years of softness is encouraging."  In addition, Mr. Christopher commented, "On May 31, 2017, we acquired the PexCor and HeatLink companies, which support our strategy to grow in the area of pressure plastic piping systems. Further, on June 21, 2017, we made a strategic decision to exit our joint venture in  #China  after years of mediocre performance and increasingly challenging business conditions. We believe that reallocating cash and resources to other initiatives, such as the plastic acquisition and our new mills in  #Bahrain  and Utah, will provide better returns in the future."  Mueller Industries, Inc. is an industrial manufacturer that specializes in copper and copper alloy manufacturing while also producing goods made from aluminum, steel, and plastics. It is headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee and comprises a network of operations in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Great Britain, South Korea, and China. Its products include tubing, fittings, valves, vessels, and related items for plumbing and HVACR related piping systems, as well as rod, forgings, extrusions, and various components for OEM applications. Products are distributed into sectors such as building construction, appliance, defense, energy, and automotive.  *********************  Statements in this release that are not strictly historical may be "forward-looking" statements, which involve risks and uncertainties.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
