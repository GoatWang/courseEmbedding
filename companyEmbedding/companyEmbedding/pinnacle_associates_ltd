At Pinnacle Associates we seek to build and manage tax-efficient portfolios to meet our clients' financial objectives. The investment process begins with identifying a client's return objectives, time horizon, risk tolerance and near and long-term liquidity needs. Additional consideration is also give to client-specific special circumstances (i.e. existing portfolio positions, etc.). Once this information is gathered and analyzed we determine an appropriate allocation among the traditional asset classes and implement an investment strategy. Portfolios are then monitored and adjusted with respect to changing market conditions and investor circumstances.

Pinnacle Associates (Assessment) Limited help Clients manage their risks.
We specialise in health, safety and environmental (HSE) risks and focus on embedding the management and control of these risks as a way of life for our Clients by helping to change attitudes, behaviour and values as a route to compliance, effective performance and continual improvement.
We also assist our Clients with specific project requirements through a wide variety of HSE services. We have developed a reputation which leads to our Clients coming back to us and recommending us to others.




More than any other issue, we successfully meet our Client's demands for something different in the way that they assess HSE and wider business performance - delivering higher value results that are cost effective, fit in with work plans and schedules, and optimise traditional auditing to focus on where the real risks are..... introducing Pinnacle360°. 


Pinnacle360o
Managing health, safety and environmental performance has changed from focussing on compliance to one of needing to understand the risks faced, where they are and how effectively they are being managed.
Pinnacle360o addresses this gap, a powerful and proven assessment methodology for organisations of all sizes and structures that identifies where your health, safety and environmental risks are based on what people actually do, not what they say they have done, enabling accurate targeting of health, safety and environmental improvement activity.
Pinnacle360o therefore centres on people's behaviour and their impacts, what really counts, moving beyond just compliance into risk management enabling you to gain considerably more value from your internal auditing investment.
The Benefits:

Cost effective and provides more valuable results compared to traditional auditing techniques alone
Reduces the carbon footprint associated with traditional audit techniques
Convenient, flexible and easy to use
A patented web-based application, allowing you to work around busy work plans and schedules
Relate assessment findings to strategic drivers of risk important to your business as well as standards and frameworks as required
Optimises traditional audits by providing a clear picture of where the key risks are
Defines where targeted appropriate, high-potential improvement activity would be most beneficial to your business
Allows you to influence future performance as opposed to reactively manage issues in hindsight
Provides consistent benchmarking across multiple sites
Helps you to achieve your business goals and certification to ISO standards if required
Can be tailored to any size or structure of organisation, both inside and outside health safety and environment
