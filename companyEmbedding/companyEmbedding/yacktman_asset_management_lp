Fund Focus
AMG Yacktman Focused Fund – Security Selection Only seeks to generate equity-like rates of return over a full market cycle while managing the level of risk. Under normal circumstances, at least 95% of the Fund’s assets will be invested in securities. The Fund is non-diversified and mainly invests in common stocks of the United States companies of any size, some, but not all of which, pay dividends. The Fund may also invest in foreign equity securities, including emerging market securities, and debt securities. For hedging and investment purposes, the Fund may engage in short sales of securities, including short sales of securities the Fund does not own.Yacktman employs a disciplined investment strategy, buying growth companies at what it believes to be low prices. Yacktman believes this approach combines the best features of "growth" and "value" investing. When they purchase stocks, they generally search for companies they believe to possess one or more of the following three attributes: (1) good business; (2) shareholder-oriented management; or (3) low purchase price.
Good Business
A good business may contain one or more of the following: 
High market share in principal product and/or service lines 
A high cash return on tangible assets 
Relatively low capital requirements allowing a business to generate cash while growing 
Short customer repurchase cycles and long product cycles  
Unique franchise characteristics 

Shareholder-Oriented Management 
Yacktman believes a shareholder-oriented management does not overcompensate itself and wisely allocates the cash the company generates. Yacktman looks for companies that: 
Reinvest in the business and still have excess cash 
Make synergistic acquisitions  
Buy back stock 

Low Purchase Price 
Yacktman looks for a stock that sells for less than what an investor would pay to buy the whole company 
The stock prices of individual companies can vary significantly over short periods of time, and such price movements are not always correlated with changes in company fundamental performance. 


Where This Fund May Fit As Part Of Your Asset Allocation
The Fund may be appropriate for your overall investment allocation if you are:
Looking to gain exposure to domestic and foreign equity securities
Seeking to generate equity like rates of return over a full market cycle while managing the level of risk
Willing to accept short-term volatility of returns


Disclosure
Investors should carefully consider the Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses before investing. For this and other information, please call 800.835.3879 or download a free prospectus. Read it carefully before investing or sending money.
Risks
A short-term redemption fee of 2% will be charged on redemptions of fund shares within 60 days of purchase.
The Fund may invest greater than
5% of its assets in money market securities, cash, or cash equivalents as a temporary defensive measure in response to adverse market, economic, political or other conditions.
The Fund may suffer significant losses on assets that it sells short. Unlike the possible loss on a security that is purchased, there is no limit on the amount of loss on an appreciating security that is sold short.
The Fund is subject to the risks associated with investments in debt securities, such as default risk and fluctuations in the perception of the debtor’s ability to pay its creditors. Changing interest rates may adversely affect the value of an investment. An increase in interest rates typically causes the value of bonds and other fixed income securities to fall.
The Fund may invest in derivatives such as options and futures; the complexity and rapidly changing structure of derivatives markets may increase the possibility of market losses.
A greater percentage of the Fund’s holdings may be focused in a smaller number of securities which may place the Fund at greater risk than a more diversified fund.
High-yield bonds (also known as “junk bonds”) may be subject to greater levels of interest rate, credit, and liquidity risk than investments in higher rated securities. These securities are considered predominantly speculative with respect to the issuer's continuing ability to make principal and interest payments. The issuers of the Fund's holdings may be involved in bankruptcy proceedings, reorganizations, or financial restructurings, and are not as strong financially as higher-rated issuers.
Investments in international securities are subject to certain risks of overseas investing including currency fluctuations and changes in political and economic conditions, which could result in significant market fluctuations.  These risks are magnified in emerging markets.
The Fund is subject to risks associated with investments in mid-capitalization companies such as greater price volatility, lower trading volume, and less liquidity than the stocks of larger, more established companies.
The Fund is subject to risks associated with investments in small-capitalization companies, such as erratic earnings patterns, competitive conditions, limited earnings history and a reliance on one or a limited number of products.
The Fund invests in value stocks, which may perform differently from the market as a whole and may be undervalued by the market for a long period of time.

Fund Focus
The Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation, and, to a lesser extent, current income. The Fund is non-diversified and mainly invests in common stocks of United States companies of any size, some, but not all of which, pay dividends. Yacktman employs a disciplined investment strategy, buying growth companies at what it believes to be low prices. Yacktman believes this approach combines the best features of "growth" and "value" investing. When they purchase stocks, they generally search for companies they believe to possess one or more of the following three attributes: (1) good business; (2) shareholder-oriented management; or (3) low purchase price.
Good Business
A good business may contain one or more of the following: 
High market share in principal product and/or service lines 
A high cash return on tangible assets 
Relatively low capital requirements allowing a business to generate cash while growing 
Short customer repurchase cycles and long product cycles  
Unique franchise characteristics 

Shareholder-Oriented Management 
Yacktman believes a shareholder-oriented management does not overcompensate itself and wisely allocates the cash the company generates. Yacktman looks for companies that: 
Reinvest in the business and still have excess cash 
Make synergistic acquisitions  
Buy back stock 

Low Purchase Price 
Yacktman looks for a stock that sells for less than what an investor would pay to buy the whole company 
The stock prices of individual companies can vary significantly over short periods of time, and such price movements are not always correlated with changes in company fundamental performance. Accordingly, Yacktman generally prefers to wait for buying opportunities. Such opportunities do not always occur in correlation with overall market performance trends 


Where This Fund May Fit As Part Of Your Asset Allocation
The Fund may be appropriate for your overall investment allocation if you are:
Looking to gain exposure to domestic and foreign equity securities 
Seeking long-term capital appreciation 
Willing to accept short-term volatility of returns 


Disclosure
Investors should carefully consider the Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses before investing. For this and other information, please call 800.835.3879 or download a free prospectus. Read it carefully before investing or sending money.
Fund inception dates reflect that of the Predecessor Fund, which was reorganized into the Fund on June 29, 2012.

A short-term redemption fee of 2% will be charged on shares held for less than 60 days.
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five- and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. 
Morningstar Rating is for the share class indicated only (see ticker); other share classes may have different performance characteristics. The Ranking may reflect the waiver of all or a portion of the fund's fees. Without such waiver, the Rankings may have been lower. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
