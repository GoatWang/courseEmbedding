THE OTG HISTORY





  





A flying start
The budget for the first ordinary year (2002) was made up with an expected start-up deficit, but came out with a surplus. This early market acceptance was linked to the quality formula of combining experienced engineers from safety/risk management and drilling & well operations into “functional teams”, a professional strategy that is attractive to many ambitious engineers. In the beginning of December 2001, just two weeks after the first job advert, 10-11 strong and enthusiastic candidates had accepted our job offer, and a further 10-12 qualified candidates were to be evaluated the same month.
Achilles Certification
Our quality model is according to the ISO-9001 standard, and OTG was Achilles certified already in March 2002. Today our Achilles certification no. 24949 covers 17 product services.













  




The OTG Analysis Teams
The OTG “flying squad” Analysis Teams have served our clients since 2002 when in need for expedient but still high quality analysis support. The branding “OTG FAST Team” (First Aid Safety Team) and “OTG FORT Team” (Field Operations Resource Team) is self-explanatory: During the first decade, the OTG analysis teams successfully completed more than 300 studies and projects, maninly within risk management and drilling & well operations. Today, our skilled engineers have available capacity to run multi-discipline projects and providing engineering support within technical safety, automation, both risk management, HSE and drilling & well operations.
Frame agreements
Already in 2002, frame agreements were established with Statoil, ConocoPhillips, Aker, and Aibel. Long term mutually beneficial customer relationships is the core of our business.
Software solutions
A new business area with focus on software solutions was established in 2009. Our main product line is software solutions assisting the oil and gas industry in reducing risk and improving operational performance. Our software products combine many years of hands-on field expertise with highly skilled software developers with proven track records from previous success products in the petroleum industry.

Oilfield Technology Group, Inc. Key Developments

Hexion’s Oilfield Technology Group Releases Canadian Resin Coated Proppants
Jul 21 16
The Oilfield Technology Group (OTG) of Hexion Inc. announced the release of new resin coated proppants that are produced in Canada. Hexion’s True North™ proppants are a curable resin coated sand available in 20/40 and 30/50 mesh sizes. The True North resin system is applied to Canadian frac sand to provide an economical resin coated proppant for the region. These new proppants incorporate Hexion’s Stress Bond™ technology. They bond in the fracture with closure stress, providing all the benefits of a curable resin coated sand such as increased fracture flow capacity and proppant flowback control along with proppant fines reduction. There is also a low temperature version of the product. True North L proppants are specifically designed for low temperature reservoirs. Additionally, the resin system of these proppants offers reduced dust generation during the pneumatic transfer and conveying process compared to uncoated frac sand. True North proppants can reduce the amount of respirable silica to levels below the new U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and existing Canadian limits. This helps improve the health and safety of workers on location. Resin coated proppants are used in the hydraulic fracturing process to help optimize production from oil and gas wells by maximizing fracture flow capacity from the reservoir to the wellbore. Technological innovations and Hexion’s introduction of enhanced materials have expanded the use of resin coated proppants into unconventional reservoirs that feature complex and challenging geological formations. Hexion’s experienced personnel, with their years of hydraulic fracturing knowledge and expertise, continue to bring advanced proppants to the industry.


Hexion's Oilfield Technology Group Announces Expansion of Canadian Proppant Manufacturing Plant
Jun 9 16
The Oilfield Technology Group (OTG) of Hexion Inc. announced the expansion of its resin coated proppant manufacturing facility in Canada to provide a more efficient supply of proppants to fracturing service companies and operators in the oil and gas industry. Hexion's proppant plant located in Sturgeon County, north of Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, Canada is in the process of a phased expansion project, which will significantly increase capacity and logistics capability to efficiently service the Canadian market. These improvements will provide significant additional manufacturing capacity to support the future growth in the Canadian proppant market. The internal plant capacity is expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2016. The expansion project includes the purchase of additional land for the installation of track that will accommodate over 100 railcars. New storage silos will ensure ample sand supplies, especially during peak seasons. Production capacity improvements will allow for quicker response to market demand and on-time delivery of product through Hexion's transloading network that services the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin. This plant is currently the only proppant manufacturing facility in Canada within the industry and produces a variety of products such as Hexion's Yukon Black proppants, which are a next-generation resin coated sand that bonds at low temperatures. These proppants are ideal for fracture treatments in the low temperature reservoirs in Canada where flowback control is necessary. Low temperature bonding down to 70degreeF (21degreeC) bottom-hole static temperature is achieved without the use of a consolidation aid. Resin coated proppants are used in the hydraulic fracturing process to help optimize production from oil and gas wells by maximizing fracture flow capacity from the reservoir to the wellbore.

Oilfield Technology Group Expands Manufacturing Facility In Alberta, Canada

	The Oilfield Technology Group of Hexion Inc. is expanding its resin coated proppant manufacturing facility in Alberta, Canada. The expansion will provide a more efficient supply of proppants to fracturing service companies and operators in the oil and gas industry. 
 
According to company officials, Hexion’s proppant plant located in Sturgeon County, north of Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, Canada is in the process of a phased expansion project, which will significantly increase capacity and logistics capability to efficiently service the Canadian market.  These improvements will provide significant additional manufacturing capacity to support the future growth in the Canadian proppant market.  The internal plant capacity is expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2016.
 
The expansion project includes the purchase of additional land for the installation of track that will accommodate over 100 railcars.  New storage silos will ensure ample sand supplies, especially during peak seasons.  Production capacity improvements will allow for quicker response to market demand and on-time delivery of product through Hexion’s industry-leading transloading network that services the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin.
 
“Hexion is a leading supplier of resin coated proppants to the oil and gas industry and this expansion will increase our manufacturing and delivery capabilities to meet the needs of our customers,” said Jerry Kurinsky, Senior Vice President/General Manager, OTG.  “These investments demonstrate our continued commitment to our customers in Canada.  Hexion will be ready to meet the demands of the industry when the market recovers.”
 
“This plant is currently the only proppant manufacturing facility in Canada within the industry and produces a variety of products such as Hexion’s Yukon Black proppants, which are a next-generation resin coated sand that bonds at low temperatures,” company officials said. “These proppants are ideal for fracture treatments in the low temperature reservoirs in Canada where flowback control is necessary.  Low temperature bonding down to 70°F (21°C) bottom-hole static temperature is achieved without the use of a consolidation aid. “
 
“Resin coated proppants are used in the hydraulic fracturing process to help optimize production from oil and gas wells by maximizing fracture flow capacity from the reservoir to the wellbore,” officials explained. “Technological innovations and Hexion’s introduction of enhanced materials have expanded the use of resin coated proppants into unconventional reservoirs that feature complex and challenging geological formations.”

 IT Solutions Tailored to Your Needs
Energy providers face unique challenges. Our experts can help you tackle them.
 






























You Need Security
Energy companies are a prime target for security breaches and face myriad serious threats, from individual hackers to foreign governments. The consequences of a security incident can be disastrous for both you and your customers. We can help protect your organization using industrial IT security.
First, we can help you assess your current cyberassets and vulnerabilities. Then we can work together to design an industrial cybersecurity strategy. We’ll help you draft a plan for what to do before, during and after a cyberattack, and then we’ll work with you to implement and deploy it.

You Need Support for a Mobile Workforce
When it comes to mobile, one device doesn’t fit all. Mobile workers in the energy industry can be traveling professionals who need to access business data on the road or field employees whose work is as diverse as drilling on a rig or delivering heating oil to customers. Consumer-grade equipment just won’t cut it — and neither will a consumer-grade mobile strategy.
Rugged devices need a ruggedized network. Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) networks help you connect scattered sites and hardened equipment so you can remotely monitor and control operations. The benefits of a ruggedized approach are numerous, from greater automation to reduced environmental impact, not to mention improved collaboration between devices, people and systems.


Learn how to harness ruggedized networking and IoT to maximize business performance. Get the article.





































You Need High-Performance Computing and Analytics
As companies come under increasing pressure to make their operations as cost-efficient as possible, high-performance computing (HPC) is one area that can help you save time and money.
It’s already paying dividends across the industry. Thanks to supercomputing, digital technologies such as advanced sensors and data analytics can increase oil and gas production by up to 8 percent, reduce facility capital costs by up to 3 percent and lower operating costs by anywhere from 5 percent to 25 percent. Our high-performance offerings include InfiniBand architecture, 10 Gig-E switching, solid-state memory, high-availability/high-volume storage, high-performance servers and power management systems.
Discover more benefits of high-performance computing. Read about it.

Compression Mounts


								These rugged mounts are normally used for vertically applied loads to prevent the transmission of noise and vibration caused by the rotation of unbalanced equipment such as centrifuges, blowers, pumps, vibrators and air handling systems. They effectively isolate disturbing frequencies as low as 900 rpm (15 Hz), providing up to 90% isolation at 1,500 rpm (25 Hz). Their elastomer-in-compression design effectively interrupts noise transmission paths to prevent sounding board effects.
