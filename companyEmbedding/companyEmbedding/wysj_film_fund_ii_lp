American Securities Opportunities Fund III, L.P. Closes Third Fund at $1B Hard Cap

Jun 27, 2014, 08:00 ET
		  		  						
						 from   American Securities LLC 











 
















































 

 




















 


NEW YORK, June 27, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- American Securities LLC today announced the closing of its third distressed private equity investment partnership, American Securities Opportunities Fund III, L.P., with total capital commitments from external investors of $1 billion.  The partnership was oversubscribed and hit its hard capitalization, ending with nearly 40 percent more capital than its $753.4 million predecessor, American Securities Opportunities Fund II L.P.  Institutional investors included leading asset managers, insurance companies, pension funds and sovereign wealth funds.
In announcing the closing of ASOF III, American Securities Opportunities Fund's Chief Investment Officer, Lawrence A. First, said, "We are pleased to have raised a new pool of capital that will allow us to continue to apply our value-based investment approach in a disciplined manner to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns from debt instruments of middle market companies."
American Securities Opportunities Fund invests in securities of companies that may be stressed or undergoing operational, financial, or other challenges, and in securities trading at a discount to intrinsic value.  The firm has the ability to invest across the entire capital structure, make loans to – and equity or equity-like investments in – stressed companies, fund recapitalizations, provide debtor-in-possession loans and exit financings, and invest in securities in order to fund both in-court and out-of-court restructuring plans.  American Securities Opportunities Fund can participate in both control and non-control investments.
In 2006, American Securities LLC created a dedicated team to invest in primarily debt instruments of stressed businesses under the American Securities Opportunities Fund brand because it believed that there would be opportunities to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns through investments in these types of situations.  American Securities Opportunities Fund is an affiliate of American Securities LLC, and is led by a separate investment team with over 95 years of collective investing, restructuring, and bankruptcy experience.
Michael G. Fisch, President and Chief Executive Officer of American Securities LLC, commented, "Larry First, Tony Grillo, and the other members of the American Securities Opportunities Fund team have been strong generators of attractive returns historically and we are enthusiastic about their ability to continue this success on behalf of investors in American Securities Opportunities Fund III, L.P.  We are delighted that the team will be able to continue investing on behalf of many long-standing investors and select new relationships."
About American Securities Opportunities FundAmerican Securities Opportunities Fund makes attractive risk-adjusted investments in securities of companies that are distressed or undergoing operational, financial, or other stress and securities trading at a discount to intrinsic value.  American Securities Opportunities Fund's strategy includes making control, as well as non-control, investments.  American Securities Opportunities Fund has more than $2 billion under management.  The firm is affiliated and works in collaboration with American Securities LLC.  More information about American Securities Opportunities Fund can be found at www.asopportunitiesfund.com. 
About American Securities LLCBased in New York with an office in Shanghai, American Securities is a leading U.S. private equity firm that invests in market-leading North American companies with annual revenues generally ranging from $500 million to $2 billion.  American Securities and its affiliates have more than $10 billion under management.  The firm traces its roots to a family office founded in 1947 to invest and manage a share of the fortune created from the growth of Sears, Roebuck & Co in the early 1900s.  More information about American Securities can be found at www.american-securities.com.

Balbec Capital Closes Second Global Credit Fund At $629 Million

									 from   Starwood Capital 











 
















































 

 




















 


GREENWICH, Conn., Aug. 6, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Balbec Capital LP, an affiliate of leading global private investment firm Starwood Capital Group, announced today the closing of its second global credit fund, Insolve Global Credit Fund II (IGCF-II). With high investor demand, the Fund ultimately closed at $629.2 million in capital commitments. 
"We are pleased with the strong support for IGCF-II from a group of partners that includes family offices, wealth management firms, endowments, insurance companies, foundations and other investors from around the world," said Warren Spector, Co-Chairman of Balbec Capital. "Balbec Capital's deep experience and extensive relationships in the consumer insolvency receivables market, coupled with Starwood Capital's operational support, represents a powerful combination for investors." 
Balbec Capital invests primarily in the portfolios of steeply discounted claims in which the debtor or assets are in bankruptcy. Investments typically involve credit card and other personal loan claims that are subject to court-approved and administered payment plans on unsecured consumer debt, as well as structured payment plans to provide liquidity to sellers. Balbec Capital CEO Charles Rusbasan helped establish the worldwide consumer insolvency investment market more than two decades ago while at Bear Stearns. Mr. Rusbasan and his team affiliated with Starwood Capital in 2011, and closed its first pooled investment fund (IGCF-I) in June 2012.  
"IGCF-II continues the successful approach of its predecessor fund, with a focus on seeking out investments with the potential to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns that are uncorrelated to the capital markets, and providing capital to sellers for assets in which there is not a ready capital market," said Mr. Rusbasan. "We are one of the few buyers of consumer insolvency receivables with the resources and experience to invest in these assets on a truly global basis." 
"While our robust pipeline has already enabled us to commit approximately $200 million of IGCF-II's capital, we continue to actively explore potential purchases of debt in both new and established markets," added Mr. Rusbasan.
About Balbec Capital LP
Balbec Capital LP, an affiliate of leading global private investment firm Starwood Capital Group, is a pioneering investor in portfolios of steeply discounted claims in which the debtor or assets are in bankruptcy. The company's investments typically range across a broad spectrum that includes consumer debt, small business and SME debt in which the obligor has filed for bankruptcy protection or entered into another restructuring, as well as financing and analytics services for local operators that invest in similar portfolios. With a track record of innovation in the worldwide insolvency markets, Balbec Capital seeks to generate returns that are uncorrelated to the capital markets and mitigate risk through a broadly diversified global portfolio. Additional information can be found at balbec.com.

The Firm has invested in virtually every category of real estate on a global basis, opportunistically shifting asset classes, geographies and positions in the capital stack as it perceives risk-reward dynamics to be evolving.
