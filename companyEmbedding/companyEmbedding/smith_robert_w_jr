Overview


Experience


Highlights




Robert W. Smyth focuses his practice on professional malpractice defense, products liability defense and mass tort/environmental litigation.  Mr. Smyth commenced his career as an associate in the litigation department of Baker & McKenzie, gaining international partnership status in 1989. He left Baker & McKenzie in 1995 to co-found Donohue Brown Mathewson & Smyth.
Over the course of 30+ years of active litigation practice, Mr. Smyth has represented physicians, hospitals and nursing homes in high exposure malpractice actions, lawyers in legal malpractice actions, large manufacturers in product liability actions and multi-national construction companies in construction disputes. 

Mr. Smyth has tried to verdict dozens of high exposure cases. Many of these cases, such as his defense of the St. Charles School District in mass tort mold litigation, have received national attention. His successful defense of a national contractor in Illinois’ first “Sick Building Syndrome” trial (DuPage County Courthouse Litigation) was profiled on the front page of the Chicago Tribune.

He served as managing partner of DBMS from 2002-2007.

Mr. Smyth's professional excellence has been recognized by peers, dating back to his consistent AV Martindale-Hubbell rating (the highest rating available) annually, since 2001, as well as his annual recognition as an Illinois Leading Lawyer (since 2004) and Illinois Super Lawyer (since 2006).

How the BuildZoom Score works

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Michigan:













Does Smith, Robert W Jr carry a valid contracting license?



Michigan requires contractors performing any work on residential properties to be licensed with the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs. 
Smith, Robert W Jr currently holds license 2101117177 (Builder Individual, Builders Salesperson Temporary), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Michigan?



Contractors in Michigan must complete a 60 hour approved prelicensure education class prior to taking a buisness and law exam. Contractors are required to take continuing education upon renewal of an active license. 











Your liability risk when hiring Smith, Robert W Jr



Michigan requires licensed contractors to carry an active workers' compensation policy. Although general liability insurance is not required under Michigan state law, it is always advisable to hire contractors who carry it. Request copies of the certificates for both forms of insurance for your records. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Michigan, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
