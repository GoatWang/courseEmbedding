Learn about sponsoring this memorial...Birth: Jun. 22,  1902OakleyCassia CountyIdaho, USADeath: Aug. 18,  2002BurleyCassia CountyIdaho, USADeseret News, The (Salt Lake City, UT) - August 20, 2002.    Deceased Name: Obituary: Oleen Dummer.  BURLEY, IDAHO- He died as he lived, with quiet and dignity. In the early morning hours of Sunday, August 18, 2002, William Oleen Dummer, passed away at the home of his daughter, Nola Holyoak, a few weeks after celebrating his 100th birthday with most of his descendants.  He was born at the family homestead near Oakley, Idaho, on June 22, 1902, and attended elementary and secondary schools in Oakley. He received a B.S. from the University of Utah and a M.S. from the University of Idaho.  Oleen married Mary Delora Bates on November 25, 1925, in the Salt Lake Temple. They had a happy and productive life. Oleen taught in the public schools system from 1924, until he retired in 1967, from his position teaching Chemistry and Physics at Burley High School. Like many teachers, he had a great influence for the good on thousands of students passing through his classes.  He combined a strong intellect with a talent for hard work, leaving a legacy of accomplishments and fun times for his six children and scores of grandchildren to try to emulate. Long will we remember the good times we enjoyed with Oleen and Delora at the family cabin in Island Park, fishing, hiking or snowmobiling. We value the lesson taught that we should take time from our daily routines to enjoy the great outdoors with our families.  Oleen was active in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormon). He served as a scout leader, a member of a bishopric, a teacher of many classes, a stake missionary and with his wife, Delora, as officiators in the Boise Temple. He also served as Branch President in Hibbing, Minnesota, where he and Delora were full time missionaries after their retirement.  He is survived by five children, Nola Belle Holyoak (Richard) of Burley, Idaho, Arthur (Leslea) of Salt Lake City, Utah, Eola Luke (Gordon) of Murtaugh, Idaho, Laird (Vaudys) of Northridge, California, and Janet Putnam (Gil) of Shelley, Idaho. He is also survived by 38 grandchildren, 101 great-grandchildren, nine great-great-grandchildren, plus 43 stimulating in-laws.  He was preceded in death by his wife, Delora in 1996; his daughter, Mavis Hanks; two great-grandchildren and two great-great-grandchildren.  The funeral will be held at 11:00 a.m. Saturday, August 24, 2002, at the Burley Second, Fourth and Tenth Ward Chapel of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormon), 515 East 16th Street, Burley, with Bishop Jon Searle, officiating.  Interment will be in the Oakley Cemetery.  Friends may call at Rasmussen Funeral Home, 1350 East 16th Street, Burley, on Friday, August 23, 2002, from 6:00 until 8:00 p.m., and at the church on Saturday, from 10:00 until 10:45 a.m.  Family links:  Parents:  Charles Arthur Dummer (1869 - 1916)  Agnes Jeanette McBride Dummer (1875 - 1969)  Spouse:  Mary Delora Bates Dummer (1903 - 1996)*  Children:  Mavis Arlene Dummer Hanks (1926 - 1998)*  Siblings:  Reva Leona Dummer Skoro (1895 - 1989)*  Arthur Delno Dummer (1897 - 1981)*  William Oleen Dummer (1902 - 2002)  Eola Dummer Layton (1905 - 1973)*  Agnes Eola Dummer Layton (1905 - 1973)*  Sara Urilda Dummer Yates (1907 - 2005)*  Nona Mae Dummer Jordan (1911 - 2004)* *Calculated relationship Burial:
