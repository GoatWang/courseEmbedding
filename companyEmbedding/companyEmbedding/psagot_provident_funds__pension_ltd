Background[edit]
The Psagot Investment House was established in 2003 through the merger of Psagot Mutual Funds and Psagot Ofek, a portfolio management company founded by Gabriella Ravid in 1990.[3][4] In 2005, subsequent to the Bachar Reform, Bank Leumi finalized the sale of Psagot to York Capital Management, a New York-based investment firm. York Capital sold its stake in the company (76%) to Apax Partners in 2010.[5][6] At $576 million, the Apax takeover of Psagot was Israel's largest private equity deal in 2010.[7]
Under the direction of Roy Vermus as CEO beginning in 2006, Psagot grew to become Israel's largest investment firm through a series of strategic fund acquisitions.[8][9] It acquired a provident fund managing NIS20 billion in assets from Prisma Investment House Ltd. in 2009 and made its first major pension fund acquisition in 2010 after outbidding a competitor for control of the Histadrut Leumit fund, which managed NIS6 billion in assets.[10][11][12] In addition, Vermus shut down Psagot's underwriting unit.[13] Forbes Israel ranked Vermus the fourth most influential young Israeli in 2008.[14]
ISA investigations[edit]
In 2003, when Psagot was still owned by Bank Leumi, the Israel Securities Authority launched an investigation into the firm's dealings for suspected violations of the Regulation of Investment Advice and Investment Portfolio Management Law (1995). The investigation went on for a year and culminated in a raid of Psagot's offices and the taking in of the firm's executives for questioning in late 2004. The impetus for the investigation was a Psagot fund having raised NIS1.7 billion in a single day.[15] Psagot founder and general manager Gabriella Ravid resigned along with her deputy in late 2006.[4] In 2008 Bank Leumi agreed to pay a fine of NIS25 million as part of a plea bargain agreement.[16]
In 2010 police arrested three senior Psagot employees on charges that they were involved in manipulating the prices of government and corporate bonds in order to redound greater profits to the firm and inflate their bonuses in the years 2007–2009. An investigation conducted by the ISA concluded with Psagot agreeing to pay a fine of NIS150 million as part of a plea bargain.[17][18][19][20] Psagot CEO at the time, Roy Vermus, was subsequently compelled to resign from the firm after the Supreme Court rejected an appeal he filed against his forced ouster from the company.[8]

Hagay Badash: Our goal is to continue to expand in the long-term savings world, and we'll seek ways to get stronger.



Psagot Investment House Ltd. unit Psagot Provident Funds Ltd. is different from the investment house's other activities; unlike the company's mutual funds and portfolio management businesses, which developed through organic grwoth, its provident funds were acquired almost entirely from the banks. Two years ago, Psagot was one of the smallest companies in the provident funds sector, with NIS 1 billion in assets under management.     Following the acquisition of Gadish Global Financial Services (2007) Ltd. and provident funds from Prisma Investment House Ltd., Psagot Provident Funds is now the largest company in the sector, with NIS 45 billion in assets under management and a 17% share of the market. It is almost as large as the next two largest provident funds managers combined, and its market share equals that of Bank Hapoalim (TASE: POLI) before the Bachar committee forced the banks to divest their provident funds.     Psagot Provident Funds CEO Hagay Badash says, "Psagot's growth was strong and fast, within a short time. We consider provident funds, especially advanced training funds with tax breaks, as the right and best pension products for customers. It is a transparent product, with simple and easy portability. The entire accumulation is really yours, and you understand the management fees."  "Globes": You're the largest provident funds management company, but there are other products in the long-term savings market. You're weak in the pensions market, and you have no life insurance. Badash: "Our distribution systems also market the Pisga Pension Fund, a joint fund with Ayalon Holding Ltd. (TASE: AYAL), and we're increasingly stressing pension funds. Our goal is to continue to expand in the long-term savings world, and we'll seek ways to get stronger. Just as we knew how to get strong in provident funds through acquisitions, we'll do the same in pensions."    
        




What about acquiring an insurance company? "We do not hold negotiations through the newspapers."  What is your consolidation plan? "We'll reduce parallel provident funds and plans. In the first stage (which was completed in August - E.P.), we consolidated provident funds acquired from Bank Leumi and advanced training funds acquired from Bank Hapoalim. In the second stage, which will be completed by the end of October, we'll consolidate provident funds acquired from Bank Hapoalim. This will reduce the number of provident funds from 89 to 60, and we'll further consolidate them during 2010 until we reach compliance with the Ministry of Finance guidelines to have one provident fund of each type. After 2011, we'll apply the Chilean model."  Since the Bachar committee forced the banks to divest their provident funds, management fees have soared. "There are processes that caused management fees to rise: cost of service, regulation, oversight, risk management, and advertising. We sell a product at a fair price. The maximum management fee permitted is 2% of assets management, and some management companies charge this. We don’t. Psagot's average management fee is 1.12%, and a small investor with NIS 20,000 pays 1.6%."

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Psagot aims for new pension fund
















 
50 Hot employees agree voluntary early retirement

Psagot wants to enter the fastest growing segment of the long-term savings market and round out its product offering.



Psagot Investment House Ltd., run by CEO Roy Vermus, is due to set up a new pension fund by the end of the year, according to the financial report for 2009 of subsidiary, Psagot Provident Funds Ltd. Provident funds are a major part of Psagot's business, but following regulatory changes in recent years, new customers have preferred investing in pension funds and manager's insurance. Psagot therefore wants to enter the fastest growing segment of the long-term savings market by rounding out its product offering.   
        




For this reason, Psagot bought the old pension fund of the Histadrut (National Federation of Labor in Israel) for NIS 107 million, an unusually high amount. Psagot also owns 20% of the New Magen Zahav Pension Fund, and has an option to increase its stake to 49%. Ayalon Holding Ltd. (TASE:AYAL) owns the rest of New Magen Zahav. Psagot said in response, "As Israel's largest investment house, Psagot continues to increase its portfolio of assets under management and to deepen its presence in the management of long-term savings, especially pension savings."
