Research Emphasis: 1) Host response to infection  and (2) regulation of inflammatory diseases. The  primary function of the immune response is to protect the host from harmful  microbial invaders. The initial response of the host to microbial infection is  to mobilize and recruit innate phagocytic cells (neutrophils and macrophages)  to the site of infection where they will engulf and kill the invaders. If  required, other more specialized immune cells (T calls and B cells) can be  activated to join in the fight. Pathogenic microbes are able to thwart the  immune response (at least for a while) and thus cause disease. Understanding  the mechanisms used by the host immune response to remove pathogenic microbes,  and those used by the microbes to combat this removal, is a primary focus of  the lab.
Many  of the diseases of the modern world (arthritis, heart disease, cancer, asthma,  etc) are considered by many researchers to be caused by chronic inflammation.  Inflammation is in general a beneficial response. It occurs in response injury  or infection, mediates removal of microbes or irritants, and restores the  tissue to its normal function. However, sometimes this process goes awry and  the tissue fails to undergo resolution of the inflammation and chronic  inflammatory disease ensues. In the past, resolution of inflammation was  thought to be a passive event, the irritant was removed and the inflammation  just “went away”. Now we know the resolution of inflammation, just like its  development, is a tightly controlled process. However, little is known about  how the resolution of inflammation is regulated. Bioactive lipids (eicosanoids)  are known to be important regulators of inflammatory processes. How these  compounds regulate both the development and resolution of inflammation is  another primary focus of the lab.

Publisher's Description▼▲
The Swindoll Study Bible offers the best of Chuck Swindolls wit, charm, pastoral insight, and wise biblical study directly to you as you study Gods Word. Chucks warm, personal style comes across on every page, and his informed, practical insights get straight to the heart of the Bibles message for the world today. Reading each part of this study Bible is like hearing Chuck speak Gods Word directly to your heart. It will both encourage readers faith and draw them deeper into the study of Gods Word.In Chucks own words:This study Bible was designed with you in mind. As you read the Scriptures, imagine me sitting beside you and sharing personal stories, important insights, and hard-earned lessons that will encourage you to walk more closely with Jesus Christ. Youll discover the who, what, where, when, why, and how of the Bible. Who wrote it and when? What does it mean, and where did its events occur? Why should I trust it? And most importantly, how can I apply it today?Its that last question more than any other that has fed my passion to publish this Bible. My primary focus in ministry has been teaching biblical insight for livingfor genuine life change. After all, thats why God communicated His Word to usthat we may become like His Son, Jesus Christ, the central figure of this Book.Free App with Purchase! App includes all content from the Swindoll Study Bible and can be used on up to 5 devices. Available for iOS and Android.

This is NOT a retyped or an ocr'd reprint. Illustrations, Index, if any, are included in black and white. Each page is checked manually before printing. As this reprint is from very old book, there could be some missing or flawed pages, but we always try to make the book as complete as possible. Fold-outs, if any, are not part of the book. If the original book was published in multiple volumes then this reprint is of only one volume, not the whole set. This paperback book is SEWN, where the book block is actually sewn (smythe sewn/section sewn) with thread before binding which results in a more durable type of paperback binding. It can also be open wide. The pages will not fall out and will be around for a lot longer than normal paperbacks. This print on demand book is printed on high quality acid-free paper.

Item Description: ReInk Books, 2017. Softcover. Book Condition: NEW. Reprinted from 1892 edition. Language: eng. NO changes have been made to the original text. This is NOT a retyped or an ocr'd reprint. Illustrations, Index, if any, are included in black and white. Each page is checked manually before printing. As this reprint is from very old book, there could be some missing or flawed pages, but we always try to make the book as complete as possible. Fold-outs, if any, are not part of the book. If the original book was published in multiple volumes then this reprint is of only one volume, not the whole set. This paperback book is SEWN, where the book block is actually sewn (smythe sewn/section sewn) with thread before binding which results in a more durable type of paperback binding. It can also be open wide. The pages will not fall out and will be around for a lot longer than normal paperbacks. This print on demand book is printed on high quality acid-free paper. Original Publisher: Providence, R.I., Brown & Sharpe manufacturing company 90 pages.  Bookseller Inventory # 451079803
