Richard H. Auchinleck
RICHARD H. AUCHINLECK joined Gulf Canada in 1976 where he has held
positions of increasing responsibility. His varied experience has
contributed to his strong understanding of both the oil and gas industry
in general, and specifically, Gulf Canada. Born in Vancouver, Mr.
Auchinleck received a Bachelor of Applied Science degree in Chemical
Engineering from the University of British Columbia in 1976. His first
position at Gulf was as a gas utilization engineer. With additional
plant and field experience gained at one of Gulf’s sour gas plants, he
subsequently moved to a field production office. In 1982, he joined the
Beaufort Sea drilling group and spent one year in Japan overseeing
construction of an offshore drilling rig for Arctic Operations.  Mr.
Auchinleck returned to Calgary to become Superintendent of the Heavy Oil
operations with responsibility for Gulf’s steamflood and oxygen
fireflood operations at Pelican Lake and Wabasca. A series of promotions
followed: Joint Interest Coordinator, Manager of Engineering, Manager of
Finance (Major Projects Group), and finally General Manager of the North
Business Unit in 1991. After assuming these leadership roles, Mr.
Auchinleck was promoted to Vice-President in 1993, and later was
appointed Senior Vice-President, International and Exploration, which
included responsibilities for both marketing and acquisitions in 1995.
In July 1997, Mr. Auchinleck was appointed Chief Operating Officer of
Gulf and in September was given the additional role of Chief Executive
Officer for Gulf Indonesia Resources. Mr. Auchinleck subsequently
resigned his position at Gulf Indonesia (although he remains a Director)
with the February 1998 appointment to President and Chief Executive
Officer of Gulf Canada. In addition, he is a Director of the Canadian
Energy Research Institute, Honorary Director and Lifetime Member of the
Canadian Heavy Oil Association and a member of the Association of
Professional Engineers, Geologists and Geophysicists of Alberta. Mr.
Auchinleck is married with one daughter and enjoys restoring and driving
vintage sports cars, skiing and music.

Richard H. Auchinleck - Gulf Canada Resources (gou.t) - The Wall Street Transcript
















































 






































Natural Resources >> CEO Interviews >> October 25, 1999 Richard H. Auchinleck –  Gulf Canada Resources (gou.t)
RICHARD H. AUCHINLECK joined Gulf Canada in 1976 where he has held
positions of increasing responsibility. His varied experience has
contributed to his strong understanding of both the oil and gas industry
in general, and specifically, Gulf Canada. Born in Vancouver, Mr.
Auchinleck received a Bachelor of Applied Science degree in Chemical
Engineering from the University of British Columbia in 1976. His first
position at Gulf was as a gas utilization engineer. With additional
plant and field experience gained at one of Gulf's sour gas plants, he
subsequently moved to a field production office. In 1982, he joined the
Beaufort Sea drilling group and spent one year in Japan overseeing
construction of an offshore drilling rig for Arctic Operations.  Mr.
Auchinleck returned to Calgary to become Superintendent of the Heavy Oil
operations with responsibility for Gulf's steamflood and oxygen
fireflood operations at Pelican Lake and Wabasca. A series of promotions
followed: Joint Interest Coordinator, Manager of Engineering, Manager of
Finance (Major Projects Group), and finally General Manager of the North
Business Unit in 1991. After assuming these leadership roles, Mr.
Auchinleck was promoted to Vice-President in 1993, and later was
appointed Senior Vice-President, International and Exploration, which
included responsibilities for both marketing and acquisitions in 1995.
In July 1997, Mr. Auchinleck was appointed Chief Operating Officer of
Gulf and in September was given the additional role of Chief Executive
Officer for Gulf Indonesia Resources. Mr. Auchinleck subsequently
resigned his position at Gulf Indonesia (although he remains a Director)
with the February 1998 appointment to President and Chief Executive
Officer of Gulf Canada. In addition, he is a Director of the Canadian
Energy Research Institute, Honorary Director and Lifetime Member of the
Canadian Heavy Oil Association and a member of the Association of
Professional Engineers, Geologists and Geophysicists of Alberta. Mr.
Auchinleck is married with one daughter and enjoys restoring and driving
vintage sports cars, skiing and music. Profile
