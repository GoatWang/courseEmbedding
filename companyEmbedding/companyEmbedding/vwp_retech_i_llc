Waste Treatment (PACT™)
April 13, 2015
Materials: Hazardous, Radioactive and Biological WastesApplications: Waste Vitrification Product Literature: N/A 













 




 









 


 





















 

The Plasma Arc Centrifugal Treatment (PACT™) System provides superior destruction of a wide variety of wastes, including hazardous, radioactive and biological wastes, even if lightly characterized or heterogeneous. The PACT™ system uses high temperature nitrogen plasma to break apart complex hydrocarbons into simple and clean gases while converting metals and oxides to a stable, homogeneous and durable slag that needs no further treatment and is ready for sale as aggregate or long term storage. Our PACT™ process greatly reduces the volume of charged material, from loose feed, slurries, small batches or even 200-liter drums, fed whole, without any unacceptable emissions. PACT™ systems can be manufactured in a variety of sizes and configurations to suit many common industrial or military situations such as commercial and field hospitals, medical, nuclear or research facilities, as well as refineries and waste treatment plants.
The Retech PACT™ systems are recognized worldwide as the answer for processing and disposal of environmentally hazardous materials and waste products, thereby ensuring a cleaner environment for future generations.
