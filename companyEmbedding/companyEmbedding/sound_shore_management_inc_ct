Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.
Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. The Morningstar Rating is for the share class specified only; ratings for other share classes will vary.  Sound Shore Fund (Investor Class) was rated against the following numbers of U.S. domiciled Large Value funds over the following time periods: 1,088 funds in the last three years, 934 funds in the last five years, and 680 funds in the last ten years. With respect to these Large Value funds, Sound Shore Fund (Investor Class) received a Morningstar Rating of 3, 4, 3 stars for the three-, five- and ten-year periods, respectively.

An investment in the Fund is subject to risk, including the possible loss of principal amount invested.  Mid Cap Risk:  Securities of medium sized companies may be more volatile and more difficult to liquidate during market downturns than securities of large, more widely traded companies.  Foreign Securities Risk:  The Fund may invest in foreign securities primarily in the form of American Depositary Receipts.   Investing in the securities of foreign issuers also involves certain special risks, which are not typically associated with investing in U.S. dollar-denominated securities or quoted securities of U.S. issuers including increased risks of adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market or economic developments. Investments in foreign securities also may be affected favorably or unfavorably by changes in currency rates and in exchange control regulations.
          

Before investing you should carefully consider the Fund's investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses.  This and other information is in the prospectus and summary prospectus, a copy of which may be obtained by calling (800) 551-1980 or via this website.  Please read the prospectus and summary prospectus carefully before you invest.

Sound Shore Management, Inc.
Firm Background:  Contrarian Value Investors Since 1978
Sound Shore Management, Inc. registered as an investment adviser with the SEC in 1978. As of June30, 2017, approximately 58% of the firm's $6.4 billion of assets under management are separate discretionary institutional equity accounts. Included among our institutional clients are the pension plans of Fortune 500 companies, foundations and endowment funds. In addition, we manage a "no-load" mutual fund, the Sound Shore Fund, for individual investors and smaller institutions. The firm's employees, as well as our profit-sharing plan, are invested in the Sound Shore Fund. We offer the benefits of a firm that is managed by its owners who utilize a consistent and disciplined value-oriented investment strategy.


The Sound Shore Team:  Experience, Depth, Full-Cycle Tested
The four members of Sound Shore's Investment Committee, all of whom are firm partners, have been directly managing Sound Shore's strategy for 38, 38, 20 and 12 years, respectively. Our investment team also includes three veteran analysts each with more than a decade of equity investing experience. From this seasoned investment research group, we typically assign a research team of two to each stock, a structure that provides balanced, accountable, and efficient decision making. Sound Shore's distinct investment process allows us to identify stock-specific opportunities that are overlooked by other investors.
Sound Shore's investment team and performance are full cycle tested. We have been managing institutional separate accounts since our 1978 founding, and have invested through the full range of market conditions. Our results confirm the merits of consistently sticking to a contrarian investment process over complete market cycles.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60)

      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):
Starting Quarter

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.
