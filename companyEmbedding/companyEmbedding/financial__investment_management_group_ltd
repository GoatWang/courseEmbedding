4. 28 out of 35 funds. Ranking based on Class Z share funds with 10-year history. Rankings for Class Z share funds that rank top 50% or better within their respective Morningstar Categories over the trailing 1-, 3-, & 5-year periods are 31/56 funds, 29/48 funds, and 25/42 funds, respectively. Source: Morningstar as of 3/31/17.
5. 9 out of 10 fixed income funds. Ranking based on Class Z share fixed income funds with 10-year history. Rankings for Class Z share fixed income funds that rank top 50% or better within their respective Morningstar Categories over the trailing 1-, 3-, & 5-year periods are 12/18 funds, 14/15 funds, and 11/13 funds, respectively. Source: Morningstar as of 3/31/17.
6. P&I/Towers Watson Top 300 Pension Funds ranking as of 12/31/16, published 9/30/16.
7. Based on U.S. Plan Sponsor rankings in Pensions & Investments as of 12/31/16.
Morningstar rankings are based on total return, do not include the effects of sales charges, and are calculated against all funds in each fund's respective Morningstar category. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Performance by share class may vary.
Star ratings shown are for Class Z shares, which are available to individual investors through certain retirement and wrap fee programs, and to institutions at an investment minimum of $5,000,000. Performance by share class may vary. In addition to the ones shown above, other classes, which contain either a sales load or a contingent deferred sales charge, are also available. These expenses will generally lower total fund return. Please see the prospectus for additional information about fees, expenses and investor eligibility requirements.
The risks associated with investing in these funds include but are not limited to: derivative securities, which may carry market, credit, and liquidity risks; short sales, which involve costs and the risk of potentially unlimited losses; leveraging, which may magnify losses; high yield (“junk”) bonds, which are subject to greater market risks; small/mid cap stocks which may be subject to more erratic market movements than large cap stocks; foreign securities, which are subject to currency fluctuation and political uncertainty; real estate, which poses certain risks related to overall and specific economic conditions as well as risks related to individual property, credit and interest-rate fluctuations; and mortgage-backed securities, which are subject to prepayment and extension risks. Sector funds and Specialty funds may not be suitable for all investors. Such funds are non-diversified, so a loss resulting from a particular security will have greater impact on the Fund's return. Fixed income investments are subject to interest rate risk, and their value will decline as interest rates rise. The risks associated with each fund are explained more fully in each fund's respective prospectus. There is no guarantee a fund's objectives will be achieved.
Some Morningstar Ratings may not be customarily based on adjusted historical returns. If so, an investment's independent Morningstar Rating metric is compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating for certain time periods. The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.
For the overall, 3-, 5- and 10-year periods, respectively, as of 3/31/17: Prudential Balanced Fund was rated 5 stars out of 721 funds, 5 stars out of 721 funds, and 5 stars out of 616 funds, and 4 out of 424 funds, respectively; Prudential High Yield Fund was rated 5 stars out of 596 funds, 5 stars out of 596 funds, 4 stars out of 471 funds, and 5 stars out of 318 funds, respectively; Prudential Short-Term Corporate Bond Fund, Inc. was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 359 funds, and 5 stars out of 257 funds, respectively; Prudential Total Return Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 750 funds, and 5 stars out of 538 funds, respectively; Prudential California Municipal Income Fund was rated 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 65 funds, and 5 stars out of 52 funds, respectively; Prudential National Muni Fund was rated 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 224 funds, and 5 stars out of 150 funds, respectively; Prudential QMA Small-Cap Value Fund was rated 5 stars out of 353 funds, 5 stars out of 353 funds, 4 stars out of 309 funds, and 5 stars out of 199 funds, respectively; Prudential Short Duration Multi-Sector Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, and 5 stars out of 444 funds, respectively.

Most people think of estate planning as the process of arranging their affairs in anticipation of death. And that obviously is the main focus of estate planning. But, done properly, estate planning can help increase our own happiness.

We all want to be happy. That seems to be why we do everything, isn't it? It's especially true with respect to our financial lives. And yet, some of us can't figure out how to get there. There have been many books published on the science of happiness, particularly in the last 10 to 15 years. And, although none of them answer the question definitively, the findings they cite give us some signposts about financial happiness.
What Impacts Our Happiness?
Many factors contribute to our lack of financial happiness. To begin with, our perception of what we need to be happy dictates how we behave and how we pursue our goals. However, it turns out that our perceptions are often faulty.We think we have far more control over future events than we do. Our memories tend to be faulty; our brains, after having experienced something, will fill in “facts” that didn't actually exist, with the result that we build a past that never happened.Lack of true imagination is common: We find it particularly difficult to imagine that we will ever think, want, or feel differently than we do now.We treasure our own uniqueness. We see ourselves as better (more intelligent, more effective in business) or even worse (more selfish), but never average. As a result, we    fail to learn from the experiences of others.
Money and happiness
We have a difficult relationship with money. We have been told that money alone does not equal happiness. However, it is possible that, in some cases, money can add to happiness.The National Academy of Sciences reported that people's emotional well-being increases along with their income, but only up to about $75,000 per year. On the other hand, it also seems that incremental increases in income once a person is safely above the poverty level (or perhaps above the annual $75,000 level) do not result in incremental increases in happiness. Studies of other countries' levels of happiness bear this out. People in Latin American countries, for instance, where average income levels are much lower, are more or less on par in the happiness department with Americans, who have the highest per capita income.It may be that Americans are not as happy as their income level would suggest because we live in a culture of stress: We are overworked and our consumer culture (like our biology) posits that feeling good is the main purpose in life, rather than a byproduct of living right.
Planning Our Way to Happiness
So what can we do with this information? Because self-control is so critical for happiness, it would seem that in-depth planning for your financial life is an important component to happiness. If you have adequate information about your financial situation and can use that information to formulate a road map for where you want to go, then you are likely to have greater autonomy, or control, and therefore may have a greater potential to be happier.Good planning is not merely “financial” planning. This is true because money alone does not make a person happier. Rather, solid planning is built on a basis of solid discovery. That is, to formulate a plan that may truly improve your life, you must first discover those key goals and issues that really motivate you, and then compare your existing financial situation against these goals to see how prepared you are to meet those goals. Once you've uncovered what is most important to you, you can begin to formulate a plan that really makes sense and that can potentially lead you to greater happiness.This kind of planning can't be done on a website or with software. It requires soul-searching and possibly some help from professionals who know how to ask the right questions and interpret the answers. But the reward for doing it the right way just might be a greater degree of happiness!
Ready, Set, Plan
Put in more tangible terms, we strongly recommend planning that proceeds in the following steps. Note that the first four steps aren't really planning at all, but rather discovery steps that are necessary before any meaningful planning can take place:Identify your key goals and issues. Make them specific and start with the nonfinancial ones. One author identified seven factors that included things like family and personal relationships, meaningful work, friends, and values as being key drivers of happiness. Think of those kinds of goals first. What might retirement look like to you? Will you be the kind of person who will always have to work — not for the money but to keep you from going crazy? If maintaining community and personal relationships is important to you, do you really need that second house? Let personal, values-based decisions drive the financial ones. Complete your own personal balance sheet. Having a personal and  detailed balance sheet lets you see at a glance what your total financial picture looks like, including assets that you might not otherwise consider, like life insurance and real estate.Identify your risk sensitivity. We've now endured the Great Recession and we know viscerally how that feels. In light of that experience, what is your emotional reaction to risk? This is less about how a financial professional might describe it and more about your reaction to it.Assemble a list of your estate planning documents.Begin the planning process with all this information at hand. Only after you've assembled all the information just described should you start the planning process.

Five ways you may want to adjust your retirement plan as people live longer, more active years.

Thanks to medical advances, more people are living longer and with an eye on a healthy lifestyle. That's terrific news for everyone. But a longer, more active life also means rethinking traditional views of your needs for retirement, and that should include a critical look at how your portfolio is put together.It used to be that as individuals and investors got close to and entered retirement, they changed their portfolios to have less exposure to equities and more to fixed income in order to protect what was built over the years. Drew Denning, Retirement Strategist for Wells Fargo Advisors, notes that now, however, you may need retirement income for 30 or more years. And he adds that with an inflation assumption of 3%, your costs will double in 24 years.So how do you help ensure you stay as financially healthy as you are physically fit for all those wonderful years of retirement? Denning outlines five suggestions to rethink the way you invest in retirement.
1) Reconsider your risk
For starters, Denning advises that you revisit your risk tolerance. For those transitioning from working to retirement, this advice is even more important. “The loss of a regular paycheck can cause more aggressive investors to become even more nervous when a market correction occurs. If you cannot either emotionally or financially withstand a market correction without withdrawing from the market, then your portfolio is too risky,” says Denning.This doesn't mean, however, that you should move to 100% bonds. “Keeping a healthy dose of exposure to stocks and/or equities can help a portfolio keep pace with inflation,” he adds.
2) Keep a cash reserve
Most people know the importance of keeping an emergency fund during your working years, but what about when you're drawing down on existing funds? Conventional advice about establishing a cash reserve bears repeating, according to Denning. When a market decline occurs or when you have an emergency expense, your cash reserve can be a resource not only financially but also emotionally. Denning points out that analysis shows that this reserve should cover anywhere from one to three years of essential expenses.
3) Adjust your habits for market conditions
“Consider using adaptable spending if your budget allows,” counsels Denning. “When your portfolio declines in value, reduce your planned withdrawals; and when the market increases, increase your withdrawals or spending.” This approach, he adds, “can dramatically increase the long-term sustainability of your portfolio.”
4) Focus on fixed income
Although it's important to maintain an allocation of stocks, bonds, and cash in your portfolio, pay special attention to your bond allocation, Denning advises. In today's low-interest-rate environment, many analysts are predicting a slow and steady increase in rates during the next five to 10 years. While increasing rates are desirable to retirees, it can also have a negative impact on the value of your bond portfolio.“For instance, if interest rates rise by 1%, a bond portfolio with a 10-year duration will decrease in value by 10%,” Denning says. A possible solution: “I would suggest selecting a bond portfolio with a two-to-three-year duration, where a 1% increase in rates would only result in a 2% to 3% decline in the value of the portfolio.”
5) Build your health care plan
As life spans and the number of years you spend in retirement increase, you likely will be subject to a corresponding increase in health care expenses. According to a 2015 report from HealthView Insights, the average lifetime health care expenses for a 65-year-old healthy couple retiring in 2015 and covered by Medicare parts B, D, and a supplemental insurance policy will be more than $400,000 once out-of-pocket medical expenses are added into the equation.Regarding this somewhat sobering statistic, Denning advises to pay attention to your health and address any medical issues before they have a chance to become major concerns.It's not your parents' retirement — the same strategies that worked for them may not be right for you if you're looking at spending 25 or more active years as a retiree.

Wealth vs. Health: Take a Balanced Approach











Wealth vs. Health: Take a Balanced Approach

Wealth Management
4 MINUTE READ









Don't let your focus on building and preserving wealth negatively impact your family relationships and personal health.

If you're in your prime earning years, your focus is likely on building the wealth you will need to live well in retirement. Americans are living longer and health care costs are rising. Investing enough money to provide sufficient income to sustain your current lifestyle can help pave the way for a more secure retirement. But too much focus on meeting future income needs can be stressful particularly when you are in your 30s, 40s and 50s and may be facing many family commitments. How do you find a balance?Start by realizing that it's normal to feel a nerve-wracking pull between enjoying your life today and accumulating sufficient wealth to cover all your expenses in retirement. “Thinking about how much income you will need in retirement can be very daunting,” says Tracie McMillion, CFA, Head of Global Asset Allocation at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.For most people, prime working years are also prime family years — the time when children are growing up and older family members may begin to need medical care. Having a single-minded focus on wealth-building at the expense of family priorities can cause major stress, which can even impact your health. More than just an annoyance, chronic stress raises the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, depression, anxiety disorder, and other illnesses.Burying your head in the sand isn't the answer, either. “People tend to focus more on the present than the future,” says Margie E. Lachman, Ph.D., professor of psychology and director of the Lifespan Initiative on Healthy Aging and Lifespan Lab at Brandeis University.While it can be fun to live in the moment, the secret to building wealth without damaging your health lies in taking a balanced approach. Here are six ways to find a work-life balance that allows you to enjoy today while saving for tomorrow.
1) Don't wait
If you don’t think that you will be able to meet your income needs in retirement, don't waste time beating yourself up about it. Meet with your financial team now to take immediate action. You may want to consider whether you are accumulating wealth in the most tax-efficient accounts and also revisit your regular expenditures. Having a clear plan in place can help you increase opportunities available to you when you retire.
2) Rethink retirement income
When interest rates are high, many retired investors look to bond portfolios for income. But with sustained low interest rates, those accumulating wealth for retirement as well as those already in retirement may need to consider other avenues to generate their income.“Sometimes, fear of risk makes people too conservative with retirement savings. They don't want to lose what they've worked so hard for,” McMillion says. “But you do want to get a good return on your money.&rdquo Because people are living longer in retirement, you may want to keep exposure to equities and other growth investments even as you get closer to retirement. A portfolio that relies solely on fixed income may not be able to keep up with inflation. “Talk to your investment specialist to determine which strategies align with your specific needs,” offers McMillion.
3) Involve your family
Take advantage of opportunities to talk with your family about finances. When your children are young, it can help to explain why it's so important for you to save for the future and that sometimes short-term sacrifices are necessary to make that happen. Understanding the family's financial realities may help lower everyone's stress levels when you occasionally have to make the choice to skip a Little League game or gymnastics meet in order to put in some extra hours at work. By having regular conversations about budgeting and investing, your children will be well informed as they mature and more prepared for their own financial futures.
4) Take care of your health
Neglecting self-care not only interferes with your quality of life but can also make your post-retirement health care costs skyrocket. Protect your health and your nest egg by eating a healthy diet, exercising most days of the week, maintaining a healthy weight, getting regular health checkups, and staying up to date on vaccinations. These things do take time and effort, but they can have big payoffs later in life.
5) Make your money work as hard as you do
Business owners often have their company’s balance sheet top of mind as they build their business. But once the business is passed along, their personal balance sheet will need to be structured to sustain them. As always, diversification and asset placement are key strategies to help plan for growth and income in a portfolio. Your investment professional can help you evaluate your current allocation against your anticipated needs and recommend adjustments to help keep you on track.
6) Think beyond dollars
Investing cash during your prime earning years is important, of course. But it's also essential to plan in a more holistic way as well. “Make investments in the future — not just monetary ones, but also in relationships, health, career, and education,” Lachman says. “They all can pay big dividends in the long run.”Alice Lesch Kelly is a freelance writer based in the Boston area.

Our approach

Leaders of small and mid-sized businesses have multiple roles and competing priorities. You want a best-in-class retirement plan but may be unsure about all the complexities and requirements. You may be uncertain about the costs and fees involved. You need a provider focused solely on retirement and aligned with your needs and goals—and fully committed to you, your participants, and the ongoing improvement of retirement investing.

Vanguard is committed to the retirement business and is a leader in the retirement plan industry. Best of all, you can benefit from Vanguard's unique ownership structure: We're owned by our clients and not by outside investors or stockholders. That means you never need to question whose interests come first for us. This approach serves as a foundation for all that we do with Vanguard Retirement Plan Access™, our 401(k) offer for small and mid-sized plans. You can count on our expertise to remove the uncertainties from managing your plan and our leadership to help you offer a strong plan for your participants. 



Key benefits




You can:

Have confidence in your plan.
Understand your costs.
Focus on your business.





Cost-conscious?
As a business owner and plan fiduciary, you want to eliminate ambiguity in retirement plan costs. Research has shown that plan costs for the smaller end of the market tend to be higher, and you need a retirement plan provider that not only provides transparent pricing but has a fair and reasonable cost structure.1
With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access:

You receive an All-in Fee Report that shows the total cost of your plan.
You have access to low-cost Vanguard index funds, plus the opportunity to choose from among more than 12,000 non-Vanguard funds.
Your annual recordkeeping price is based on a per-participant fee—a fee that doesn't jump as your assets grow, as with many small to mid-sized retirement plans.
You have flexibility in how you cover your plan costs—including a recordkeeping credit depending on the share class selected.




Too busy?
 As a business owner, you're pressed for time and focused on many aspects of business. With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access, you can rely on high-quality recordkeeping and administration to ease your administrative burden and help your employees stay on track for retirement.

Who We Are
Why FIM Group?
Wealth Management
401(k) + Retirement Planning
Financial Planning








We Believe in Following Values
We believe that studying the skills, talents, observations and behaviors of proven, successful investors can lead to investing success. The superior performance of private investors like Warren Buffett, Peter Lynch and John Templeton, and scholars like Benjamin Graham and Larry Ellis, can be distilled into a single, disciplined approach that captures the essence of their investment strategies. In our dynamic, ever-changing world, committed investors realize that they have three broad tools at their disposal that allow them to invest with excellence and maximize their benefits:
Selective diversification and concentrationCareful security analysisA “price matters” orientation to capture excess returns
We Don’t Believe in Shortcuts
Money doesn’t manage itself, and capturing excess investment returns does not just happen. Successful investing takes identifiable talent and skills that must be implemented with consistency and discipline. Asset allocation is part of those tools but not the “tool” itself. The world changes daily, and a “Let’s wait till the quarterly meeting” approach to management simply does not work.
Investors that use indexing, passive benchmarking, or weekly, monthly or quarterly committee-driven models are looking for shortcuts for better performance. As any professional coach or athlete will tell you, there are no shortcuts to success or greatness. Indexers, ETF allocators and those who passively index will never achieve investment greatness. 
We Use Rationality to Enhance Returns
Most investors accept the fate of the psychological influences that can lead them astray. We see opportunity in what we call the “four poisons” that every investor must acknowledge before realizing their potential to enhance returns and reduce risks.
Recency effect – The most powerful of the poisons, recency effect is a person’s predisposition to give current history more weight than past history. As financial stewards, FIM Group’s team must maintain their long-term focus and resist the urge to time markets, be enticed by the “strategy of the day” or make financial decisions based on fear.Endowment behavior and inertia – This pertains to an investor’s desire to hold onto a familiar investment even when it is no longer profitable. Endowment behavior can also cause investors to stay with “bad” investment decisions based on outdated information, even though there is current evidence that suggests otherwise. Endowment behavior has significant influence on the “hold-sell” decision. FIM Group believes a “sell” discipline is equally as important as a “buy” discipline.Crowd following – Most investors would rather follow the crowd and be wrong about their financial decisions than being right and successfully standing apart. It is human nature to want to fit in and take the traditional route; however, if everyone is investing a certain way, then the profits have already been made and the risks are enhanced as the crowd realizes they bought into a mania. FIM Group monitors the current “hot” ideas to ensure that we are not buying into a mania or being influenced irrationally by a crowd.Laziness, oversimplification and narrow investment universe – Investing is complicated. Our brains are wired to oversimplify complex subjects, which can get investors into trouble. Flexibility, humility, maturity, truth-seeking, experience, training, analysis, and common sense are the antidotes to oversimplification.
Value Can Be Added by Flexibility and Discipline
Investing without borders is our core investment philosophy, which applies not only to geographical borders, but also to asset class, industry and market constraints. We believe that flexibility gives our investment team the necessary tools to achieve our absolute return goals while managing risk, specifically seeking to mitigate the permanent loss of capital.
Our Investment Philosophy Is Grounded
For over 25 years, we have remained consistent and true to our investment philosophy, which you may view by clicking here.
A Disciplined Investment Management System Is Important
Our approach to investment management takes elements from the philosophies of investing legends. Click here to view our system.
Opportunistic Trading Increases Returns
Careful trading can reduce costs and even add value to the investment management process. FIM Group’s managers have spent the bulk of their careers involved in the trading process and use direct trading platforms, where available, to monitor markets and trade globally.
Low Cost
We are patient and price-conscious in our buying and selling decisions. We are fee-only advisers and do not add cost by receiving any form of commissions from mutual funds, wrap charges, soft dollar fees from brokers, or charging trustee or custodial fees. We have a flat asset under management fee structure that is reasonable and designed to be low enough to have minimal effect on client returns.
We Believe in Transparency and Ethics
Our clients get to see how the investment management process works. FIM Group clients see each trade on their account, and any commissions, fees or other expenses are disclosed in a straightforward manner. Clients know exactly what investments are in their investment portfolio.
Broad Line of Capabilities for Long-Term Investors
FIM Group’s ability to know our clients and construct portfolios designed to meet their individual goals, constraints and objectives is a core strength that is consistent with our values and grounded approach. Our goal is to provide our clients with portfolios that maximize returns for their desired risk level.
Independent and Dedicated
FIM Group is an independently owned investment management firm. We serve our clients, stakeholders, employee shareholders, society and the community. FIM Group’s team is dedicated to managing investments in the best interests of our clients.
Dedicated Client Service Professionals
Our client service team is talented, committed and trained to serve our clients’ needs in a timely manner. We strive to help our clients beginning with their very first phone call and continue to build long-term relationships with each client for years to come.

Background Information:


Financial & Investment Management Group Ltd. »
Financial & Investment Management Group's (FIM Group) strategies are based on the premise that an investment's price is more volatile than its underlying, real fundamental value. The firm believes that returns, over time, can be increased and risks reduced by avoiding investments which are over-priced and favoring investments that are under-priced. Investment strategies may include long-term and short-term purchases depending on the client's individual needs. Asset allocation is a favored strategy and investments may include long and short-term investment, money market funds, mutual funds, stocks,bonds or other investment vehicles.FIM Group's employs an active, quantitative investment selection process. The firm believes that fixed income investments have a high degree of risk-adjusted quantifiable predictability. FIM Group seeks to identify and compare each income investment's expected return over time. Their goal is to add value by actively managing fixed income investments for total returns from interest, dividends and capital gains and by having such managed portfolios contain the firm's top risk-adjusted selections at all times.

Company Description


Financial & Investment Management Group's (FIM Group) strategies are based on the premise that an investment's price is more volatile than its underlying, real fundamental value. The firm believes that returns, over time, can be increased and risks reduced by avoiding investments which are over-priced and favoring investments that are under-priced. Investment strategies may include long-term and short-term purchases depending on the client's individual needs. Asset allocation is a favored strategy and investments may include long and short-term investment, money market funds, mutual funds, stocks,bonds or other investment vehicles.FIM Group's employs an active, quantitative investment selection process. The firm believes that fixed income investments have a high degree of risk-adjusted quantifiable predictability. FIM Group seeks to identify and compare each income investment's expected return over time. Their goal is to add value by actively managing fixed income investments for total returns from interest, dividends and capital gains and by having such managed portfolios contain the firm's top risk-adjusted selections at all times.

Most people think of estate planning as the process of arranging their affairs in anticipation of death. And that obviously is the main focus of estate planning. But, done properly, estate planning can help increase our own happiness.

We all want to be happy. That seems to be why we do everything, isn't it? It's especially true with respect to our financial lives. And yet, some of us can't figure out how to get there. There have been many books published on the science of happiness, particularly in the last 10 to 15 years. And, although none of them answer the question definitively, the findings they cite give us some signposts about financial happiness.
What Impacts Our Happiness?
Many factors contribute to our lack of financial happiness. To begin with, our perception of what we need to be happy dictates how we behave and how we pursue our goals. However, it turns out that our perceptions are often faulty.We think we have far more control over future events than we do. Our memories tend to be faulty; our brains, after having experienced something, will fill in “facts” that didn't actually exist, with the result that we build a past that never happened.Lack of true imagination is common: We find it particularly difficult to imagine that we will ever think, want, or feel differently than we do now.We treasure our own uniqueness. We see ourselves as better (more intelligent, more effective in business) or even worse (more selfish), but never average. As a result, we    fail to learn from the experiences of others.
Money and happiness
We have a difficult relationship with money. We have been told that money alone does not equal happiness. However, it is possible that, in some cases, money can add to happiness.The National Academy of Sciences reported that people's emotional well-being increases along with their income, but only up to about $75,000 per year. On the other hand, it also seems that incremental increases in income once a person is safely above the poverty level (or perhaps above the annual $75,000 level) do not result in incremental increases in happiness. Studies of other countries' levels of happiness bear this out. People in Latin American countries, for instance, where average income levels are much lower, are more or less on par in the happiness department with Americans, who have the highest per capita income.It may be that Americans are not as happy as their income level would suggest because we live in a culture of stress: We are overworked and our consumer culture (like our biology) posits that feeling good is the main purpose in life, rather than a byproduct of living right.
Planning Our Way to Happiness
So what can we do with this information? Because self-control is so critical for happiness, it would seem that in-depth planning for your financial life is an important component to happiness. If you have adequate information about your financial situation and can use that information to formulate a road map for where you want to go, then you are likely to have greater autonomy, or control, and therefore may have a greater potential to be happier.Good planning is not merely “financial” planning. This is true because money alone does not make a person happier. Rather, solid planning is built on a basis of solid discovery. That is, to formulate a plan that may truly improve your life, you must first discover those key goals and issues that really motivate you, and then compare your existing financial situation against these goals to see how prepared you are to meet those goals. Once you've uncovered what is most important to you, you can begin to formulate a plan that really makes sense and that can potentially lead you to greater happiness.This kind of planning can't be done on a website or with software. It requires soul-searching and possibly some help from professionals who know how to ask the right questions and interpret the answers. But the reward for doing it the right way just might be a greater degree of happiness!
Ready, Set, Plan
Put in more tangible terms, we strongly recommend planning that proceeds in the following steps. Note that the first four steps aren't really planning at all, but rather discovery steps that are necessary before any meaningful planning can take place:Identify your key goals and issues. Make them specific and start with the nonfinancial ones. One author identified seven factors that included things like family and personal relationships, meaningful work, friends, and values as being key drivers of happiness. Think of those kinds of goals first. What might retirement look like to you? Will you be the kind of person who will always have to work — not for the money but to keep you from going crazy? If maintaining community and personal relationships is important to you, do you really need that second house? Let personal, values-based decisions drive the financial ones. Complete your own personal balance sheet. Having a personal and  detailed balance sheet lets you see at a glance what your total financial picture looks like, including assets that you might not otherwise consider, like life insurance and real estate.Identify your risk sensitivity. We've now endured the Great Recession and we know viscerally how that feels. In light of that experience, what is your emotional reaction to risk? This is less about how a financial professional might describe it and more about your reaction to it.Assemble a list of your estate planning documents.Begin the planning process with all this information at hand. Only after you've assembled all the information just described should you start the planning process.

Don't let your focus on building and preserving wealth negatively impact your family relationships and personal health.

If you're in your prime earning years, your focus is likely on building the wealth you will need to live well in retirement. Americans are living longer and health care costs are rising. Investing enough money to provide sufficient income to sustain your current lifestyle can help pave the way for a more secure retirement. But too much focus on meeting future income needs can be stressful particularly when you are in your 30s, 40s and 50s and may be facing many family commitments. How do you find a balance?Start by realizing that it's normal to feel a nerve-wracking pull between enjoying your life today and accumulating sufficient wealth to cover all your expenses in retirement. “Thinking about how much income you will need in retirement can be very daunting,” says Tracie McMillion, CFA, Head of Global Asset Allocation at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.For most people, prime working years are also prime family years — the time when children are growing up and older family members may begin to need medical care. Having a single-minded focus on wealth-building at the expense of family priorities can cause major stress, which can even impact your health. More than just an annoyance, chronic stress raises the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, depression, anxiety disorder, and other illnesses.Burying your head in the sand isn't the answer, either. “People tend to focus more on the present than the future,” says Margie E. Lachman, Ph.D., professor of psychology and director of the Lifespan Initiative on Healthy Aging and Lifespan Lab at Brandeis University.While it can be fun to live in the moment, the secret to building wealth without damaging your health lies in taking a balanced approach. Here are six ways to find a work-life balance that allows you to enjoy today while saving for tomorrow.
1) Don't wait
If you don’t think that you will be able to meet your income needs in retirement, don't waste time beating yourself up about it. Meet with your financial team now to take immediate action. You may want to consider whether you are accumulating wealth in the most tax-efficient accounts and also revisit your regular expenditures. Having a clear plan in place can help you increase opportunities available to you when you retire.
2) Rethink retirement income
When interest rates are high, many retired investors look to bond portfolios for income. But with sustained low interest rates, those accumulating wealth for retirement as well as those already in retirement may need to consider other avenues to generate their income.“Sometimes, fear of risk makes people too conservative with retirement savings. They don't want to lose what they've worked so hard for,” McMillion says. “But you do want to get a good return on your money.&rdquo Because people are living longer in retirement, you may want to keep exposure to equities and other growth investments even as you get closer to retirement. A portfolio that relies solely on fixed income may not be able to keep up with inflation. “Talk to your investment specialist to determine which strategies align with your specific needs,” offers McMillion.
3) Involve your family
Take advantage of opportunities to talk with your family about finances. When your children are young, it can help to explain why it's so important for you to save for the future and that sometimes short-term sacrifices are necessary to make that happen. Understanding the family's financial realities may help lower everyone's stress levels when you occasionally have to make the choice to skip a Little League game or gymnastics meet in order to put in some extra hours at work. By having regular conversations about budgeting and investing, your children will be well informed as they mature and more prepared for their own financial futures.
4) Take care of your health
Neglecting self-care not only interferes with your quality of life but can also make your post-retirement health care costs skyrocket. Protect your health and your nest egg by eating a healthy diet, exercising most days of the week, maintaining a healthy weight, getting regular health checkups, and staying up to date on vaccinations. These things do take time and effort, but they can have big payoffs later in life.
5) Make your money work as hard as you do
Business owners often have their company’s balance sheet top of mind as they build their business. But once the business is passed along, their personal balance sheet will need to be structured to sustain them. As always, diversification and asset placement are key strategies to help plan for growth and income in a portfolio. Your investment professional can help you evaluate your current allocation against your anticipated needs and recommend adjustments to help keep you on track.
6) Think beyond dollars
Investing cash during your prime earning years is important, of course. But it's also essential to plan in a more holistic way as well. “Make investments in the future — not just monetary ones, but also in relationships, health, career, and education,” Lachman says. “They all can pay big dividends in the long run.”Alice Lesch Kelly is a freelance writer based in the Boston area.

Five ways you may want to adjust your retirement plan as people live longer, more active years.

Thanks to medical advances, more people are living longer and with an eye on a healthy lifestyle. That's terrific news for everyone. But a longer, more active life also means rethinking traditional views of your needs for retirement, and that should include a critical look at how your portfolio is put together.It used to be that as individuals and investors got close to and entered retirement, they changed their portfolios to have less exposure to equities and more to fixed income in order to protect what was built over the years. Drew Denning, Retirement Strategist for Wells Fargo Advisors, notes that now, however, you may need retirement income for 30 or more years. And he adds that with an inflation assumption of 3%, your costs will double in 24 years.So how do you help ensure you stay as financially healthy as you are physically fit for all those wonderful years of retirement? Denning outlines five suggestions to rethink the way you invest in retirement.
1) Reconsider your risk
For starters, Denning advises that you revisit your risk tolerance. For those transitioning from working to retirement, this advice is even more important. “The loss of a regular paycheck can cause more aggressive investors to become even more nervous when a market correction occurs. If you cannot either emotionally or financially withstand a market correction without withdrawing from the market, then your portfolio is too risky,” says Denning.This doesn't mean, however, that you should move to 100% bonds. “Keeping a healthy dose of exposure to stocks and/or equities can help a portfolio keep pace with inflation,” he adds.
2) Keep a cash reserve
Most people know the importance of keeping an emergency fund during your working years, but what about when you're drawing down on existing funds? Conventional advice about establishing a cash reserve bears repeating, according to Denning. When a market decline occurs or when you have an emergency expense, your cash reserve can be a resource not only financially but also emotionally. Denning points out that analysis shows that this reserve should cover anywhere from one to three years of essential expenses.
3) Adjust your habits for market conditions
“Consider using adaptable spending if your budget allows,” counsels Denning. “When your portfolio declines in value, reduce your planned withdrawals; and when the market increases, increase your withdrawals or spending.” This approach, he adds, “can dramatically increase the long-term sustainability of your portfolio.”
4) Focus on fixed income
Although it's important to maintain an allocation of stocks, bonds, and cash in your portfolio, pay special attention to your bond allocation, Denning advises. In today's low-interest-rate environment, many analysts are predicting a slow and steady increase in rates during the next five to 10 years. While increasing rates are desirable to retirees, it can also have a negative impact on the value of your bond portfolio.“For instance, if interest rates rise by 1%, a bond portfolio with a 10-year duration will decrease in value by 10%,” Denning says. A possible solution: “I would suggest selecting a bond portfolio with a two-to-three-year duration, where a 1% increase in rates would only result in a 2% to 3% decline in the value of the portfolio.”
5) Build your health care plan
As life spans and the number of years you spend in retirement increase, you likely will be subject to a corresponding increase in health care expenses. According to a 2015 report from HealthView Insights, the average lifetime health care expenses for a 65-year-old healthy couple retiring in 2015 and covered by Medicare parts B, D, and a supplemental insurance policy will be more than $400,000 once out-of-pocket medical expenses are added into the equation.Regarding this somewhat sobering statistic, Denning advises to pay attention to your health and address any medical issues before they have a chance to become major concerns.It's not your parents' retirement — the same strategies that worked for them may not be right for you if you're looking at spending 25 or more active years as a retiree. Taking a thorough look at your investment strategy may help ensure you'll be enjoying every one of those years.

Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp.").

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
