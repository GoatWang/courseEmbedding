Enterprise Network Solutions


We serve a wide variety of business organizations from Pharmaceutical
      to Media & Entertainment. At Sunesys, we understand that each enterprise
      has a unique set of requirements, with bandwidth and security at the top of
      most lists. Companies benefit from Sunesys' ability to offer custom solutions
      fitting their unique needs and an ever-expanding network of over 29,000 miles
      in more than 30 states across the country.

Financial IndustriesFinancial service providers require
          a distinctive set of solutions; whether its high bandwidth, security,
          or access to premium data centers and colocation facilities for data
          backup and disaster recovery. The SunTran data center transport network
          provides the key access needed to metro data centers for inter and intra-regional transport.
Media & Entertainment Industries
          Editing, post-production, remote storage and video distribution are
          all bandwidth monsters requiring huge data pipes in today's Media &
          Entertainment industries. Sunesys has solutions from 1Gbps to 100Gbps
          and if that isn't enough, our dark fiber
          and private wavelength services
          provide scalable alternatives to maximize your investment. Sunesys'
          extensive footprint offers connections to top data centers throughout
          the country, giving you additional access to wholesale providers and
          long-haul connectivity.

Industry Challenges

Being offline is not an option.  Even a blink of the eye outage could
          cost millions to your high-yield business.
Federal mandates, such as Sarbanes-Oxley, as well as other state and
          local regulations require greater accountability, security and privacy control.
Concern for data loss and system recovery, due to advanced technologies
          and applications, causes a severe threat to data security.

Don't let these industry challenges stifle your day-to-day business.
      Sunesys offers high-speed networks with the security and reliability
      needed for those tough days at the office. 

Success Story: NutriSystem
NutriSystem's network solutions proved to be undesirable when their
          carrier was acquired by a phone company. Sunesys designed, constructed,
          and maintains NutriSystem's new 8-strand fiber optic ring solution.

The Sunesys Difference
Unlike some large carriers, Sunesys is small enough to be highly focused
      on your particular vertical and your precise geography, allowing us to
      deliver tailored solutions that are fast, nimble and cost-effective.

Healthcare Network Solutions


Healthcare providers have a distinct set of IT needs ranging from data storage,
      privacy concerns, radiology and imaging data, regulatory requirements, and
      a host of other bandwidth and security focused applications. Sunesys offers
      private networks using dedicated infrastructure to keep your healthcare
      network solution secure and reliable. 
Industry Challenges

With research facilities generating 2-4 terabytes of data per week
          and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) centers driving the need for speed,
          healthcare organizations incur drastic needs for high bandwidth.
Over $19B has been disbursed to healthcare professionals and
          organizations that adopt the use of Electronic Medical Records
          (EMR/EHR) systems. These systems require the exchange of key clinical
          information through a secure and private network environment.
As HIPAA privacy and security rules continue to protect patient
          information and medical data, healthcare organizations are faced with
          requirements for highly secure data transfer.

Privacy and bandwidth hogs shouldn't be a daily concern for your
      healthcare organization. Let Sunesys guide the way to a high-speed,
      secure and reliable network solution.

Our innovative products are powered by a proprietary library of enriched electronic product content including OEM parts, aftermarket parts, garments and accessories (PG&A) and whole goods from more than 1,800 manufacturers. Business is complicated, but we believe our customers' technology tools don't have to be. We remove the complexity of selling and servicing new and used whole goods inventory and PG&A. More than 25,000 equipment dealers, distributors and manufacturers worldwide leverage our solutions to Sell More Stuff!(TM)  We go to market under the "ARI Network Services, Inc." brand name in the powersports, outdoor power equipment (OPE), marine, home medical equipment (HME), recreational vehicles (RV) and appliance industries. We service customers in the automotive dealer market under the "Auction123, an ARI Company" brand name, customers in the automotive tire and wheel aftermarket (ATW) under the "TCS Technologies, an ARI Company" brand name; and customers in the automotive aftermarket (AA) market under the "DCi, an ARI Company" brand name.  Our Solutions  Our primary solutions include: (i) Lead Generation and eCommerce Websites, giving dealers and wholesalers an online presence optimized for today's digital path to purchase and serving as a platform to drive in-bound lead generation and eCommerce sales; (ii) eCatalogs, offering access to our proprietary library of enriched electronic product content via a suite of SaaS and DaaS solutions to enable the sale of whole goods inventory and PG&A; (iii) Business Management Software designed to streamline every aspect of a dealer's operation, drive profitability and allow them to provide better customer service; and (iv) Digital Marketing Services designed to generate leads and drive traffic both to the dealer's website and brick-and-mortar location.  Our solutions also improve our dealers' overall customer satisfaction through a highly efficient and accurate data lookup experience at the parts counter and a quicker response time to online inquiries, both of which serve to significantly improve a customer's overall experience with the dealer.  Our solutions are sold through our internal sales force, which are aligned by vertical market and are composed primarily of recurring licenses and subscriptions and, in the case of business management software, perpetual licenses and maintenance contracts. Customers typically sign annual, auto-renewing contracts. Today, more than 90% of our revenues are recurring.  Lead Generation and eCommerce Websites  Our online solutions are tailored to each of the vertical markets we serve and are tightly integrated with our proprietary library of enriched electronic product content for major unit inventory and PG&A. Our website platform development teams continually  innovate our platforms to keep up with the ever-evolving demands of our customers, online shoppers and search engines to ensure we can provide dealers with websites that perform well in search and convert online visits into leads, eCommerce sales and in-store visits. We offer a full menu of website add-ons, including a mobile inventory management application, third-party inventory integrations and business management integrations. Our lead generation tools are designed to efficiently manage and nurture leads through email campaigns, automated responses, sales team reminders and other lead generating activities, increasing conversion rates and ultimately revenues for our customers.  We typically charge monthly recurring subscription fees, and may charge a one-time set up fee to develop a new dealer website, as well as variable transaction fees. Our website solutions are typically sold under one-year, renewable contracts with monthly payment terms. We host and maintain approximately 8,000 websites for dealers across all of our vertical markets.  eCatalog Platform Solutions  Our eCatalog solutions offer access to our proprietary library of enriched electronic product content via a suite of SaaS and DaaS solutions including dealer-facing manufacturer parts lookup portals and parts counter solutions; consumer-facing online parts lookup; and DaaS subscription access to our content library all designed to enable the sale of whole goods inventory and PG&A. Fees charged for the use of our eCatalog products include a recurring license fee, subscription fees for subscribed catalogs and, in some cases, page view fees.  Business Management Software  Our business management software solutions are designed to streamline every aspect of a dealer's operations to allow them to provide improved customer service. Fees charged include perpetual one-time license or installation fees, maintenance and support fees, as well as hosting fees for our SaaS version. These solutions are currently only offered in the ATW aftermarket.  Digital Marketing Services  ARI complements our suite of data-driven SaaS and DaaS solutions with digital marketing services that deliver the engaging experiences that today's consumers expect, as well as meet the demands of leading search engines like Google. ARI's Digital Marketing Services include search engine optimization, email marketing, search engine marketing (PPC), online reputation management and online directory management to help dealers drive more online leads, eCommerce sales and in-store traffic.  Other Solutions  We also offer a suite of complementary solutions, which include software, website customization, professional services and hosting services.  Our Growth Strategy  ARI's goal is to become the leading provider of SaaS and DaaS solutions and complementary services that help our customers efficiently and effectively sell more major units, replacement parts, accessories and service - in other words, Sell More Stuff!(TM) Our continued goal is to grow revenues at a double-digit rate and to grow earnings through scalability. We intend to accomplish this goal by delivering our solutions to dealers, distributors, manufacturers, service providers and consumers in selected vertical markets where the finished goods are complex equipment requiring service and which are primarily sold and serviced through an independent dealer channel which typically carries multiple brands. We believe this strategy will drive increased value to our shareholders, employees and customers.  We also believe that the execution of the following strategic pillars will enable us to achieve the growth and profitability needed to drive long-term sustainable value for our shareholders:  � Drive organic growth through expanded service offerings to grow both our subscriber customer base and our average revenue per dealer;  � Differentiate our content;  � Enter new markets;  � Expand geographically;  � Nurture and retain existing customers through world-class customer service and value-added product feature updates;  � Lead the market with open integration to related platforms; and  � Successfully execute acquisitions that align with our core strategy.  These strategic foundations are primarily centered on enhancing the value proposition to our customers, which will lead to additional revenues through pricing actions, product and feature upsells, reduced customer churn rates, and expansion by leveraging our core competencies in new complementary markets. Each of these strategic pillars is a long-term foundation for the Company's growth; within each we have established near-term goals, as discussed below.  Drive organic growth through expanded service offerings to grow both our subscriber customer base and our average revenue per dealer.  As a subscription-based, recurring revenue (RR) business, the most important drivers of future growth are nurturing and defending our customer base; developing and selling additional products to our existing customer base; and acquiring new customers. We define RR as revenue from products and services which are subscription-based and renewable, including software access fees, data content fees, maintenance fees, support fees and hosting fees. We define churn as the percentage of RR that does not renew. RR increased 11.6%, or $1,284,000 to 91.9% of total revenue for the quarter ended April 30, 2017, compared to the same period last year, and increased 10.5%, or $3,415,000 to 92.3% of total revenue for the nine months ended April 30, 2017, compared to the same period last year. To experience further growth in RR, we will continue to develop and deploy innovative new solutions. We have resources assigned to each of our core products that continue to research and develop new value-added features and functionality for our existing products. The introduction of new solutions, upgrades to existing products, and new feature sets are all designed to grow our subscriber base of dealers and our average revenue per dealer (ARPD), an important measure for a subscription-based business. We have recently developed several new features, upgrades and products, including the following:  Lead Generation and eCommerce Website Platforms  � ARI Responsive Website Platform - In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we launched our next generation Responsive website platform, completing the first phase including advanced design capabilities, lead generation capabilities and scalable website production tooling, among other market leading capabilities. We've continued expanding the capabilities of our Responsive website platform with recent development focused on automated integrations with multiple leading CRM solutions, as well as continued expansion of lead generation forms and website build tooling. These updates help our customers drive more leads and effectively convert them to sales.  � Tire and Wheel Website Platform Development - We designed and developed a new experience for mobile users allowing them to access promotions and services pages on the mobile view of our dealer websites. This new mobile view is aimed to increase conversions and search engine rankings. We also released a new connection to a third-party content tool to better expose details, videos and product ratings.  � DCi eStore Service - We developed an enhanced API to integrate our rich automotive aftermarket product content into e-commerce website platforms, opening new sales channels and value creation for our content.  eCatalog Platforms  � Data Manager RT(TM)- We completed development in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and released to market our next generation of Data Manager(TM), our OEM parts product information management software. This next-generation platform provides OEMs with reduced publishing costs and time to market through real-time publishing, ensuring end users have access to the most accurate and rich part and service content across ARI's software ecosystem. We continued expanding the capabilities of Data Manager RT with recent updates that focus on enhanced user experience workflows, international localization and expanded publishing connectivity with our PartSmart product. These enhancements expand the addressable market of the product and increase its unique value proposition and forward-looking sales opportunities.  Business Management Software  � Tire Power -We have added SMS messaging to Tire Power with the ability to send and receive text messages from the software. Now our customers can efficiently and effectively communicate with their clients to increase their workflow and document conversations.  � Tire Power - To broaden the ability of our customers to retain their clients, we have integrated MCCR (My Car Care Rewards) and myCarfax into Tire Power. These integrations give our customers the ability to sign clients to a loyalty rewards program from within the software and allows the user to see reported vehicle maintenance completed, aiding the ability to sell more stuff through factory service maintenance suggestions.  � TireWorks HD - To increase our sales opportunities in California, we have completed the integration of CA BAR and MAP requirements. This opens our expansion to the west coast for all our enterprise opportunities.  � TireWorks HD - We have developed a new digital inspection tool, TCS Inspect. This can be used on any Android or IOS device, with complete customization and integrations into the software. Now our customers will be able to efficiently communicate service and tire needs with their clients, increasing their overall average ticket revenue.  � TireWorks HD - In our Wholesale application, we have completed our integration with Quick Books. This will increase our opportunity and expand our sales strategy to smaller wholesale distributors.  Digital Marketing Services  � Extended Digital Marketing Services Packages - We developed and launched extended Digital Advertising and Email Marketing packages, providing our customers with additional curated service packages that meet the demands of their unique businesses. During the last quarter, we expanded our footprint for selling the full DigMS product and service offering into our tire and wheel and automotive markets.  These product and service enhancements are designed to automate and enhance the marketing, sales and servicing activities for our customers in order to help them sell and service more parts, garments, accessories and whole goods.  Differentiate our content.  We believe we have the largest library of replacement part, major unit, and PG&A content in the vertical markets we serve. However, simply offering the largest content library in the markets we serve is not sufficient to drive the long-term revenue growth we desire. We strive to deliver more value to our customers through the enrichment of our content and have recently made the following enhancements:  � OEM Parts Content Expansion - We've authored notable content for three new brand catalogs in the powersports market.  � PG&A Content Expansion - New content has been authored for the RV and powersports markets.  Enter new markets.  ARI currently maintains a significant share in our core vertical markets of OPE, powersports, marine, RV and appliances. Accordingly, we anticipate low single-digit growth in these markets. ARI maintains a lower share in our growth vertical markets of HME, ATW, automotive and AA. Accordingly, we are targeting double-digit growth in these markets. As we continue to increase our share in our current markets, leveraging our technology in new and underserved markets will be important to attaining high single digit to low double digit organic growth rates. ARI currently has more than 3,000 dealer websites in the ATW market. We estimate that the total addressable market includes approximately 18,000 dealers. Further, the broader AA market, which we entered via our acquisition of DCi, comprises nearly 80,000 independent service providers, more than all of our other markets combined. We intend to continue to invest heavily in this growth market, including seeking opportunities to leverage our products and services in the broader AA. We are one of the first website providers to service the HME market. We estimate that this market comprises nearly 25,000 service providers and believe the market to be in the early stages of eCommerce adoption.  Expand geographically.  Although we maintain relationships with dealers throughout the world, we have low penetration into international markets. Growing our international business will require us to secure and publish electronic content from manufacturers outside the U.S. and make changes to our existing product suite that will allow us to rapidly deploy these products in a scalable and efficient manner without the need to have "boots on the ground" in those countries.  Nurture and retain existing customers through world-class customer service and value-added product feature updates.  In order to achieve sustained high single-digit or low double-digit organic growth, we not only need to execute the growth strategies described above, we must also retain our existing customers. In a SaaS business, the cost to retain an existing customer is much less than the cost to acquire a new customer. Accordingly, customer churn is an important metric we track and manage. We experienced improvements in our churn rates the past several years as a result of strategic actions taken by the Company, all of which are designed to enhance the "stickiness" of our products within our customers' operations. In fiscal 2017, we experienced a decrease in customer churn from 16.2% for the twelve months ended April 30, 2016 to 13.2% for the twelve months ended April 30, 2017. We will continue to leverage our relationships with existing customers and closely monitor and manage the level of customer churn.  Lead the market with open integration to related platforms.  One of our strategic advantages is our focus on integrating our solutions with dealer business management systems (DMS) to pass key information, including customer and transactional data, between our solutions and the DMS, saving our customers valuable  time and eliminating redundant data entry. We currently have integration capabilities with over 90 DMS, and we continue to seek other strategic alliances that can be integrated with our product and service offerings. We recently integrated our website offerings in the powersports, marine and RV markets with CDK Global to provide dealers with websites and enhanced integrations to their DMS. This new offering allows dealers to instantly post unit inventory as well as available parts and accessories to their website directly from their CDK Lightspeed system.  Successfully execute acquisitions that align with our core strategy.  Since 1995, we have had a formal corporate development program aimed at identifying, evaluating and closing acquisitions that align with our strategy. We focus on vertically-oriented markets with a large base of independent, multi-line dealers that sell and service complex equipment. Our strategy is to acquire companies that allow us to do one or more of the following: (i) expand our market share in existing verticals; (ii) expand into new markets that fit our desired profile; (iii) provide us with complementary products which can be cross-sold to our existing customer base; (iv) provide opportunities to cross-sell our existing products; and (v) can be integrated into our operations, thereby creating cost-saving synergies.  From the program's inception through April 30, 2017, we have closed 17 acquisitions. A summary of some of our most recent acquisitions is as follows:  Acquisition Date Strategy Expand our position in the automotive Auction123, LLC November 2016 ? industry, cross-sell existing products A leading provider of electronic catalog Direct Communications Inc. July 2015 ? and content in the AA industry Extend business management software TASCO Corporation (and affiliated Signal April 2015 ? platform in the ATW market Extraprise Corporation) ? Consolidate website position and add new Tire Company Solutions, LLC September 2014 business management software in the ATW market ? A leading provider of social media and DUO Web Solutions November 2013 online digital marketing services in the powersports industry 50 Below Sales & Marketing, Inc. November 2012 ? A market leader in the powersports industry (Retail Division) ? Entrance into ATW and DME industries ? New award-winning website platform Ready2Ride, Inc. August 2012 ? First of its kind aftermarket fitment data for the powersports industry --------------------------------------------------------  On November 1, 2016, the Company acquired substantially all the assets of Auction 123, Inc. ("Auction 123"), a leading provider of software and services to help dealers in selected vertical markets manage and feed inventory information to online marketplaces to drive more sales and leads. Auction 123 serves several vertical markets including automotive dealers, powersports, recreational vehicles and marine. Consideration for the acquisition (the "Company Purchase Price") included, (i) a cash payment equal to $10,250,000; (ii) a $250,000 cash hold-back, subject to adjustment; and (iii) a contingent earn-out purchase price payable in two installments and contingent upon the attainment of specific revenue goals related to a specific customer.  Founded in 2001, Auction 123 has been a leader in online marketing solutions, inventory management and website development solutions for dealers in selected vertical markets. Their award-winning web-based software offers tight and seamless integration between the dealer management system (DMS), the dealer's website, eBay Motors, Craigslist, Facebook and other third-party classified websites. The acquisition eliminated elements of ARI's cost of revenue from a third party vendor and introduced ARI into the automotive dealer market. The acquisition is also expected to accelerate ARI's opportunity to drive organic growth through the cross�selling of new products. The combined customer benefits and operational efficiencies are expected to result in a stronger organization that can create more value for our customers, shareholders and employees. The Company's strategy is to integrate the sales teams from acquisitions as quickly as possible in order to realize cross-selling synergies. As a result, we do not track revenues and costs specific to the individual acquired businesses.  Summary of Operating Results  Total revenue increased 12.0%, or $1,441,000, for the three months ended April 30, 2017 to $13,425,000, compared to $11,984,000 for the same period last year. Year-to-date revenue increased 9.8% or $3,468,000 to $38,941,000, compared to  $35,473,000 for the same period last year. Recurring revenue increased 11.6% to $12,337,000 during the three months ended April 30, 2017 and 10.5% to $35,946,000 during the nine months ended April 30, 2017, compared to $11,053,000 and $32,531,000, respectively, during the same periods last year. The growth in year-over-year total revenue was attributable to incremental revenue from the Auction 123 business acquired in November 2016, as well as organic growth in revenue from ARI's historical products, primarily in digital marketing services and lead generation and eCommerce solutions.  Operating income increased 61.5%, or $566,000, from $921,000 for the three months ended April 30, 2016 to $1,487,000 for the same period this year and increased 12.5% or $325,000 from $2,602,000 for the nine months ended April 30, 2016 to $2,927,000 for the same period this year. Net operating expenses increased 6.8% or $597,000 and 8.0% or $2,106,000 during the three and nine month periods ended April 30, 2017, respectively, compared to the same periods last year. The increases were primarily due to the additional costs of the Auction 123 operations and professional fees related to a proxy contest.  Net income was $1,425,000, or $0.08 per share, for the three months ended April 30, 2017, compared to $448,000, or $0.03 per share, for the same period last year. Net income for the nine months ended April 30, 2017 was $2,023,000, or $0.12 per share, compared to a net income of $1,285,000, or $0.07 per share, for the same period last year. The increase was due to increased operating profit as well as US research and development ("R&D") tax credits recorded in the third quarter ended April 30, 2017.  Net cash provided by operations increased 26.8% to $7,029,000 for the nine months ended April 30, 2017 compared to $5,543,000 for the same period last year, primarily as a result of revenue growth, operational efficiencies and the cash flow generated by Auction 123.

Enterprise Network Solutions


We serve a wide variety of business organizations from Pharmaceutical
      to Media & Entertainment. At Sunesys, we understand that each enterprise
      has a unique set of requirements, with bandwidth and security at the top of
      most lists. Companies benefit from Sunesys' ability to offer custom solutions
      fitting their unique needs and an ever-expanding network of over 29,000 miles
      in more than 30 states across the country.

Financial IndustriesFinancial service providers require
          a distinctive set of solutions; whether its high bandwidth, security,
          or access to premium data centers and colocation facilities for data
          backup and disaster recovery. The SunTran data center transport network
          provides the key access needed to metro data centers for inter and intra-regional transport.
Media & Entertainment Industries
          Editing, post-production, remote storage and video distribution are
          all bandwidth monsters requiring huge data pipes in today's Media &
          Entertainment industries. Sunesys has solutions from 1Gbps to 100Gbps
          and if that isn't enough, our dark fiber
          and private wavelength services
          provide scalable alternatives to maximize your investment. Sunesys'
          extensive footprint offers connections to top data centers throughout
          the country, giving you additional access to wholesale providers and
          long-haul connectivity.

Industry Challenges

Being offline is not an option.  Even a blink of the eye outage could
          cost millions to your high-yield business.
Federal mandates, such as Sarbanes-Oxley, as well as other state and
          local regulations require greater accountability, security and privacy control.
Concern for data loss and system recovery, due to advanced technologies
          and applications, causes a severe threat to data security.

Don't let these industry challenges stifle your day-to-day business.
      Sunesys offers high-speed networks with the security and reliability
      needed for those tough days at the office. 

Success Story: NutriSystem
NutriSystem's network solutions proved to be undesirable when their
          carrier was acquired by a phone company. Sunesys designed, constructed,
          and maintains NutriSystem's new 8-strand fiber optic ring solution.

The Sunesys Difference
Unlike some large carriers, Sunesys is small enough to be highly focused
      on your particular vertical and your precise geography, allowing us to
      deliver tailored solutions that are fast, nimble and cost-effective.

Healthcare Network Solutions


Healthcare providers have a distinct set of IT needs ranging from data storage,
      privacy concerns, radiology and imaging data, regulatory requirements, and
      a host of other bandwidth and security focused applications. Sunesys offers
      private networks using dedicated infrastructure to keep your healthcare
      network solution secure and reliable. 
Industry Challenges

With research facilities generating 2-4 terabytes of data per week
          and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) centers driving the need for speed,
          healthcare organizations incur drastic needs for high bandwidth.
Over $19B has been disbursed to healthcare professionals and
          organizations that adopt the use of Electronic Medical Records
          (EMR/EHR) systems. These systems require the exchange of key clinical
          information through a secure and private network environment.
As HIPAA privacy and security rules continue to protect patient
          information and medical data, healthcare organizations are faced with
          requirements for highly secure data transfer.

Privacy and bandwidth hogs shouldn't be a daily concern for your
      healthcare organization. Let Sunesys guide the way to a high-speed,
      secure and reliable network solution.
