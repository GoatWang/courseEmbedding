BioScrip Board Of Director R. Carter Pate Becomes NACD Board Leadership Fellow






Sep 9, 2015, 7:00am EDT














ELMSFORD, N.Y., Sept. 9, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- BioScrip, Inc. (NASDAQ: BIOS) ("BioScrip" or the "Company") today announced that R. Carter Pate, a member of BioScrip's Board of Directors since May 2015, has become an NACD Board Leadership Fellow, the highest level of credentialing for corporate directors and corporate governance professionals offered by The National Association of Corporate Directors. He joins more than 50 other corporate directors from leading corporations around the world who also earned the prestigious credential during the second quarter of 2015.

"It is an honor to join the distinguished and diverse group of individuals who make up NACD's Fellowship program," said Pate.  "We share a commitment to advancing the highest standards of boardroom leadership, and the insights I've gained through NACD's Fellowship program will be key to my professional growth as a director and the contributions I make to BioScrip."
"As the emphasis on corporate governance intensifies, having one of our board members recognized with such respected credentials demonstrates how seriously we take fiduciary responsibility," said Myron Z. Holubiak, Chairman of the Board of Directors of BioScrip. "It is yet another indication of the strength of the Board of Directors we have assembled to oversee and support the implementation of the Company's operations and financial improvement plan.  Moreover, it is imperative that we operate with the highest integrity and transparency as we continue to execute our strategy to streamline the Company so as to effect meaningful change and drive shareholder value."
An NACD Fellowship, considered the definitive director credential, is a comprehensive program of study developed to educate directors about perennial and emerging boardroom issues and best practices. Completion of this rigorous program demonstrates a director's serious commitment to exemplary corporate governance.
Candidates complete a strong foundation course which focuses on topical matters and committee-specific issues, followed by additional NACD education within a 12-month period. NACD Fellows renew their status every year, maintaining and advancing their knowledge with continuous learning and peer-led collaboration. 
R. Carter Pate, CPA, has been a director of the Company since May 2015. Mr. Pate serves as Chair of the Company's Audit Committee and its newly-formed Financial Improvement Implementation Committee, and he is a member of the Company's Management Development and Compensation Committee. 
Mr. Pate previously served as Chief Executive Officer of MV Transportation, Inc., the largest privately-owned passenger transportation contracting firm based in the U.S. ("MV") from 2011 to 2014 and continues to serve as an independent strategic advisor to MV. From 1996 to 2011, Mr. Pate was employed by PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP ("PwC"), where he held increasingly responsible positions including the U.S. and Global Managing Partner of PwC's Capital Projects and Infrastructure practice, the Global and U.S. Managing Partner of PwC's Health Care Practice, and as a Partner and Leader in PwC's U.S. Restructuring Practices.

ELMSFORD, N.Y., Sept. 9, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- BioScrip, Inc. (NASDAQ:   BIOS) ("BioScrip" or the "Company") today announced that R. Carter Pate, a member of BioScrip's Board of Directors since May 2015, has become an NACD Board Leadership Fellow, the highest level of credentialing for corporate directors and corporate governance professionals offered by The National Association of Corporate Directors. He joins more than 50 other corporate directors from leading corporations around the world who also earned the prestigious credential during the second quarter of 2015.
"It is an honor to join the distinguished and diverse group of individuals who make up NACD's Fellowship program," said Pate.  "We share a commitment to advancing the highest standards of boardroom leadership, and the insights I've gained through NACD's Fellowship program will be key to my professional growth as a director and the contributions I make to BioScrip."
"As the emphasis on corporate governance intensifies, having one of our board members recognized with such respected credentials demonstrates how seriously we take fiduciary responsibility," said Myron Z. Holubiak, Chairman of the Board of Directors of BioScrip. "It is yet another indication of the strength of the Board of Directors we have assembled to oversee and support the implementation of the Company's operations and financial improvement plan.  Moreover, it is imperative that we operate with the highest integrity and transparency as we continue to execute our strategy to streamline the Company so as to effect meaningful change and drive shareholder value."
An NACD Fellowship, considered the definitive director credential, is a comprehensive program of study developed to educate directors about perennial and emerging boardroom issues and best practices. Completion of this rigorous program demonstrates a director's serious commitment to exemplary corporate governance.
Candidates complete a strong foundation course which focuses on topical matters and committee-specific issues, followed by additional NACD education within a 12-month period. NACD Fellows renew their status every year, maintaining and advancing their knowledge with continuous learning and peer-led collaboration. 
R. Carter Pate, CPA, has been a director of the Company since May 2015. Mr. Pate serves as Chair of the Company's Audit Committee and its newly-formed Financial Improvement Implementation Committee, and he is a member of the Company's Management Development and Compensation Committee. 
Mr. Pate previously served as Chief Executive Officer of MV Transportation, Inc., the largest privately-owned passenger transportation contracting firm based in the U.S. ("MV") from 2011 to 2014 and continues to serve as an independent strategic advisor to MV. From 1996 to 2011, Mr. Pate was employed by PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP ("PwC"), where he held increasingly responsible positions including the U.S. and Global Managing Partner of PwC's Capital Projects and Infrastructure practice, the Global and U.S. Managing Partner of PwC's Health Care Practice, and as a Partner and Leader in PwC's U.S. Restructuring Practices.
