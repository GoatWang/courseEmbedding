by Hugh MacEachern on 3/17/2015

Combative, Hot-Tempered & Lazy Lawyer For Hire
This attorney is a complete idiot. I hired him to do a simple probate for my dad's estate, and he did next to nothing for nearly a year! He is a screamer, uses profanity, and is completely uncooperative. Probably why he works alone and there is never anyone in his waiting room! One of the biggest mistakes I have ever made was hiring this moron and letting this nonsense go on for so long! There has to be someone else practicing law who can help navigate this simple process. Today, I am going to find a new lawyer who will be civil to me when we speak, and possess a sense of urgency to get things done. This loser has to go!
