KSL Capital Partners Credit Opportunities Fund, L.P. Announces Acquisition Financing for the Ventana Inn & Spa
























Tweet




















August 26, 2015 - 12:01 AM PDT


STAMFORD, Conn.



(Business Wire)  
      KSL Capital Partners Credit Opportunities Fund, L.P. (KSL Credit) is 
      pleased to announce that its affiliate provided a first mortgage to 
      finance the acquisition of the Ventana Inn & Spa by an affiliate of 
      Geolo Capital II LP and Wanxiang America Real Estate Group, LLC 
      (collectively, the Sponsor).
    

      The 59-room luxury resort overlooks the Pacific Ocean from its location 
      directly off of Highway 1 in Big Sur, California. Amenities include a 
      luxury spa, the Restaurant at Ventana with an outdoor deck overlooking 
      the ocean, 8,745 square feet of meeting space, two outdoor swimming 
      pools, Japanese hot baths, and a recently opened, 78-site campground 
      located within a redwood grove.
    

      Among the resort’s many accolades, it has been awarded Gold List status 
      from Condé Nast Traveler almost every year since 2005 and was 
      ranked the #8 resort on Travel + Leisure’s “Top 50 Hotels in the 
      Continental U.S.” in 2014. The resort has undergone significant 
      renovations since 2008, and the Sponsor is planning an additional 
      multi-million dollar upgrade to enhance guest amenities and expand 
      meeting and event space. Commune Hotels & Resorts will continue to 
      manage the resort.
