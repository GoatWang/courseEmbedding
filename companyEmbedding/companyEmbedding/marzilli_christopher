From improving communications for U.S. forces through a mobile battlefield network that embeds high-speed intranet into all tactical vehicles to delivering air traffic control radios to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for the past 20 years, General Dynamics C4 Systems delivers communication and information systems and products for enhancing threat and situation awareness.
With more than 8,000 employees worldwide, the General Dynamics division provides advanced system integration and products that support soldiers, police officers, agents and others who protect our nation’s citizens.
Although we may be operating in a stricter budget climate, General Dynamics C4 Systems is proving that there will always be a need for advanced communications systems.  The organization recently received a $40 million contract modification in from the U.S. Navy to support its mobile communications efforts.   In addition, it recently announced that General Dynamics has delivered its 30,000th combat search and rescue (CSAR) radio to the U.S. Air Force.
It is also developing solutions that allow the Department of Defense to be more effective during a time of fewer resources.  General Dynamics C4 Systems recently delivered radios to the U.S. Army.  This effort will provide “a tenfold increase in SATCOM capacity for secure, over-the-horizon military communications,” according to Chris Marzilli, President of General Dynamics C4 System, in a recent press release.
General Dynamics C4 Systems truly excels in the area of innovation.   Its two new encryptors in the ProtecD@R product family were recently certified by the National Security Agency (NSA) for securing information at the Top Secret level and below. The organization also recently completed critical ground system modifications and technology updates to support NASA’s three next-generation Tracking and Data Relay Satellites (TDRS).
In addition, the General Dynamics’ sponsored EDGE Innovation Network officially opened its new Space Innovation Center, which will connect NASA and other government agency professionals with more than 350 industry and academia members.
With a continued focus on providing the most innovative solutions to the government defense and public safety arenas – while also securing significant contract wins — we are proud to announce that General Dynamics C4 Systems is officially this week’s Winning Contractor.” Stay tuned for more posts about contractors proving to be nimble in the face of challenging times in our new “Winning Contractor” series.

Chris Marzilli, General Dynamics Mission Systems President, Chosen to Wash100 for Communications Tech Leadership
Posted by Anna Forrester on February 12, 2015 in Wash100 | 393 Views  


Executive Mosaic is honored to unveil Chris Marzilli, president of General Dynamics‘ mission systems business unit, as the newest inductee into the Wash100 — a group of influential leaders in the government contracting arena.
Marzilli leads a unit formed through a combination of the company’s former advanced information systems and C4 systems business areas.
He led the C4 systems unit as president before the consolidation, which closed at the end of 2014.
Marzilli manages 9,000 global employees who provide communications networking, command and control, information assurance and computing products and services for programs such as WIN-T, MUOS Ground Segment and SGSS.
The mission systems group presented its combined AIS and C4 systems portfolio at Surface Navy Association event held in January.
While Marzilli was president for C4 systems, the business provided its Trusted Network Environment software to the U.S. Central Command to support the exchange of tactical information between the U.S. and coalition partners.
He serves on the board of directors at the Cryptologic Museum Foundation of the National Security Agency and the Armed Forces Communication and Electronics Association.
Executive Mosaic congratulates Chris Marzilli and the General Dynamics team for their selection to receive this award.
