Sam Billotti – January 22, 2016This winter I tested the Catalyst, and I won’t ever go back to another stove. We love how easy start up was and Cassandra loved the bay window. It’s one of the nicest stoves we’ve had just to look at.Rated 5 out of 5
Tim Pfau – March 14, 2016The new design looks great! I can’t wait to buy one when it is available.Rated 5 out of 5
Caitlin Oursler – April 30, 2016The app control looks awesome! Let me know when I can buy the stove. I have been following your progress for a while now.Rated 5 out of 5
Bill – May 1, 2017Heated with wood all my life. Missed it when I moved out on my own. Now have a place where I can burn, but with young kids, my wife worried about safety. I found Catalyst when searching for safe wood stoves. Only stove I found that prevents chimney fires and solves other issues. Love it – happy wife, happy life.Rated 5 out of 5
Will M. – June 5, 2017We’ve heated with wood for years and always loved it, but last spring my chimney sweep came out and told us we had had a bad chimney fire sometime over the winter. It was frightening to think that our house was on fire and we didn’t even know it. That’s why we bought a Catalyst. We love the safety alerts and the automatic overfire protection. Knowing that my house and my family are protected brings me peace of mind.Rated 5 out of 5
Tim MacDonald – July 20, 2017I heard about MF Fire in Smithsonian Magazine. I was going to purchase a different wood stove from Woodstock Soapstone, but after hearing about MF Fire I did some research. What others were saying was over the top good. So decided to try for myself. This is the best wood stove I have ever had. I live at a higher altitude. My previous wood stove was impossible to start. My Catalyst couldn’t be easier to use. I have a roaring fire in less than 5 minutes and have never had to leave the door open to get it started.Add a review Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.

 November 25th, 2014
Awards
CommentsIn 2013, the founders of MF Fire entered a wood stove design competition, sponsored by the Alliance for Green Heat. This Wood Stove Decathlon challenged teams of engineers to provide an innovative design, and our entry garnered the prize for Low Emissions.The follow up to the very successful Wood Stove Decathlon was held in November 2014 at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The goal of these competitions is to solve consumer & industry pain points. For example, many consumers do not operate wood stoves well, often using the wrong wood. Also, the EPA has not raised is standards in many years for fear that the industry would not be able to meet them, and these competitions jumpstart innovation.The MF Fire founders entered an improved version of the  Mulciber prototype to compete against four other finalists. This time, the stove was judged not only for its emissions, but also for efficiency, innovation, market appeal and safety. The Mulciber achieved top marks, taking first place overall as well as first place in the categories of particulate emissions and innovation.As one example, the Mulciber adapted technology used for vehicles to improve safety in the use of wood stoves. An oxygen sensor, which regulates the fuel-to-air ratio in an engine, is used to achieve The Perfect Burn. Even with unseasoned wood, the wood stove performed quite well compared to the competitors and the existing products in the market. As a result, consumers do not have to load wood as often, saving time and money.“We want to congratulate the MF Fire team – and all the teams – for participating in a process of sharing innovation, ideas and test results,” said John Ackerly, coordinator of the event and President of the Alliance for Green Heat.  “These stoves have many of the solutions to excessive smoke from modern-day wood stoves and are challenging the EPA and the stove industry, to catch up with new technologies and new opportunities,” Ackerly said. View the write up by Alliance for Green Heat here. Today, the Mulciber stove is now named the Catalyst and is the most efficient wood stove available. The MF Fire team is proud to offer the best wood burning stove on the market.RECESS – Second Place

 May 15th, 2014
Awards
CommentsThe mission of the MIT Clean Energy Prize is to catalyze a new generation of energy entrepreneurs and great new companies. MF Fire was awarded the Energy Efficiency Prize, for top performance in Energy Efficiency, as well as the People’s Choice Award.MF Fire Reaches the Final Four in the ACC Clean Energy Challenge
 April 30th, 2014
Awards
CommentsThe ACC Clean Energy Challenge is a business plan competition. It encourages students from all universities throughout the southeastern United States to develop business plans for new clean energy companies focused on renewable energy, energy efficiency improvements and advanced fuels/vehicles. This program is supported by the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE).The competition is similar to the NCAA tournament bracket, in which 64 teams face off to advance to the championship. The finalist went on to compete in the DOE National Clean Energy Business Plan Finals in Washington, D.C. against winners from similar brackets in other regions of the country.In the 2014 competition, MF Fire won two rounds and placed among the Final Four schools. Our ultra-clean, efficient wood stove shared a bracket with teams like Charging Lane from Clemson University, who are developing a technology that can charge electric vehicles at stoplights. Or EnViv from Virginia Tech, who are developing a new hydropower technology to leverage low-flow waterways.Efficiency is one of the largest drivers of our fire science team. Our products are designed to be efficient in multiple ways – energy, effort, materials, etc. If you haven’t already, check out the Catalyst to learn more.Wood Stove Decathlon – Low Emissions Prize
 November 19th, 2013
Awards
CommentsThe Alliance for Green Heat hosted first ever Wood Stove Decathlon in 2013. The event challenged teams to design and build wood stoves that were low-emitting, high efficiency, innovative and affordable.A Maryland-based team of fire scientists accepted the challenge, entering a stove they called Mulciber. Ten judges tested & assessed the entries from 14 teams.The Mulciber Stove took home the low emissions prize, emitting fewer particulates than any other stove. At 0.2 grams per hour, the Mulciber Stove is 23 times cleaner than the current EPA emissions standards, and emits less than half the smoke of a single cigarette.Little did the team know that they had discovered the cleanest & most efficient wood stove ever tested. MF Fire was born. The Mulciber Stove is now the Catalyst and is available to consumers.View the results at the Alliance for Green Heat here.News CategoriesAs Seen In (16)Awards (6)Catalyst (14)Fire Friday (1)How To (1)Industry News (2)Investment (1)Safety (2)Testing (2)Popular Articles

What’s different about the Catalyst wood burning stove?
Save money with smart efficiencySmart efficiency is getting the most from every single piece of wood. Unlike traditional wood stoves that overheat the room, Catalyst lets you set and maintain your ideal temperature, never over or under heating the space. Catalyst’s smart controller is continuously monitoring both the fire and your room, adjusting the burn as needed. As a result, no wood is wasted and every cord of wood goes further.
Learn More
Smarter home with Catalyst appWood burning stoves should be easy to use. With the Catalyst app you can set your desired room temperature with the touch of a button, and your Catalyst stove does the rest. You can stoke the fire to quickly break the chill, or slow it down for a long relaxing night. The Catalyst app also helps you to understand your fire. See how much heat your Catalyst wood stove is producing and how much time is left before you need to load more wood.
Learn More
Actively prevent chimney firesEach year, there are more than 22,000 chimney fires and thousands of stove triggered home fires reported in the U.S. Catalyst is the only wood stove that actively protects you from over-firing and chimney fires. As your fire burns, Catalyst monitors the fire. If over-firing is imminent, Catalyst automatically throttles back your fire to a safe level, protecting your home and family.
Learn More
No soot or smoke, just clean burningCatalyst is built to burn clean in your home, not just the lab. Catalyst’s smart controller continuously maintains ideal combustion conditions, preventing the formation of soot. That’s why in head-to-head competitions with top industry competitors, Catalyst took home the low emissions prize – not just once, but every time. Catalyst exceeds the stringent 2020 EPA emissions standards, meaning you get all the fire without the smoke.

            About MF Fire | Our Story, Our Commitment & What We Believe         





Our StoryMF Fire is a fire technology company leveraging advanced combustion science to engineer superior fire products.Fire has been the catalyst of human progress since Prometheus stole it from the gods. In 2012, the wood energy industry had a problem with fire. The EPA had developed a new series of emission regulations that threatened to eliminate all but six wood stoves from the market. Yet, environmentalists in the industry knew that wood heat was something worth saving. It’s renewable, it’s local, and it harnesses an element central to the human story–fire. The original student team from the University of Maryland Department of Fire Protection EngineeringEnter Taylor Myers and Ryan Fisher, graduate student fire protection engineers. Taylor and Ryan were used to solving problems with fire. When they were approached by a professor working with the wood energy industry to develop a clean, efficient “next generation wood stove,” they accepted the challenge. At the 2013 Wood Stove Decathlon, Taylor and Ryan discovered that not only had they developed a clean and efficient wood stove, but they had developed the cleanest and most efficient wood stove ever tested. These student engineers used their ingenuity and love for problem solving to surpass every major manufacturer in the industry. Catalyst™ not only solves the environmental problems of heating with wood, but also uses smart control technology to bring wood energy bursting into the 21st century.Ryan Fisher and Taylor Myers at the second wood stove design challenge.Encouraged by the joint enthusiasm of environmentalists and techies alike, Taylor and Ryan knew they had to bring Catalyst to market. They teamed up with 28 year business veteran Paul LaPorte to develop a commercial model of the stove and Catalyst is officially available for sale.Catalyst is truly the beginning of a new era of wood energy. It’s renewable, it’s clean, and it’s beautiful. It provides all the benefits of a roaring fire, without any of the environmental cost. Thanks to a little creative thinking, Taylor, Ryan, and Paul engineered a way to keep the wood energy industry alive–they engineered the perfect burn.Industry Clean Energy ChampionMF Fire is committed to delivering the cleanest wood stove technology on the planet. As a testament to our commitment, we have won every low emissions competition or prize the wood stove industry has hosted since we started MF Fire. Each low emissions result was measured by an EPA certified lab tester. It all starts with our unique and proprietary smart technology that continuously optimizes your fire under any circumstance. Different wood types, moisture levels, elevation, you name it – we make sure every fire is perfect every time. What does this mean for you? It means you never have to worry about your fire. You can rest assured that your fire will start quickly and easily, and continue to burn all day hands free, no matter what – always delivering the best possible fire with optimal heat.What We BelieveWe believe in fireWe believe fire can deliver wonderful heat and experienceWe believe our technology delivers the perfect fire under any circumstanceWe believe in the sustainability of wood heatWe believe you should get the most value from each and every load of wood, avoiding wasted heat, or incomplete burnsWe believe fire can be a clean energy source, when using superior technology to manage your burnWe believe heating with wood should be easy and hassle freeWe believe you should be able to control your fire to meet your needs – your ideal temperature and comfort – all at the touch of a button.We believe fire shouldn’t be hard, or require undue effort to start and manageWe believe your heat should be powered locally, without dependence on places most of us have never visitedWe believe every community should be able to have clean air, but individuals have the freedom to choose a lifestyle that suits themInterested in joining the team?

    How To Modernize The Wood Stove and Help Save the Planet         



Modern Wood Stove Helps Save the Planet – Smithsonian Magazine
 Tuesday, January 19th, 2016
As Seen In, Catalyst
CommentsHow can you help save the planet? Smithsonian Magazine thinks it’s the ultra-clean Catalyst modern wood stove (previously named Mulciber).Rachel Kaufman, writing for Smithsonian Magazine, thinks that modern wood stoves might be part of the solution to foreign fossil fuels, but only if it is clean.“The problem with most wood stoves is not the carbon dioxide, but the smoke. “Black carbon,” or soot, from wood stoves and forest fires, is now thought to be the second most significant man-made agent in climate change. It’s also a big health risk, especially in developing nations where wood burning stoves are the primary way people cook food. The World Health Organization estimates that 4 million people die prematurely each year from diseases related to smoke inhalation.”So how do we make wood stoves better? We get rid of the smoke. Rachel says that that is what “…the Catalyst wood stove, an award-winning modern stove developed with a team at the University of Maryland, does very, very well.”The Catalyst wood stove brings wood burning technology into the future. Not only does the Catalyst reduce emissions, but it also reduces wood consumption due to its smart efficiency.

But before you start sending out dozens of emails and making phone calls, sit down and think about your project. What's your budget? What is the scope of your project? Will you need more than one type of professional to complete your home improvement project? Can you afford to complete the full project now, or should you tackle it bit by bit?Once you've settled on your project’s priorities, budget and scope, it's time to start researching home design professionals. Don't sell yourself short and settle on the first professional you set your sights on. Make sure that you're working with someone local, who can get to the jobsite easily and efficiently. Look into the person’s reviews, ask to speak with former clients and to see previous jobs in person. Take a good look at their portfolio photos: How similar are these projects to your own? Be honest — that mansion might look beautiful, but it might not have a lot in common with your little bungalow.Reach out to multiple professionals — especially for larger projects — and don't settle for the first bid you hear. Comparing multiple Baltimore, MD professionals' bids and experiences can help you find the one that’s best for you. Ask a lot of questions now, so you won't have unexpected answers later.Find a home design professional on Houzz. Narrow down your search by type of professional and location. Browse Baltimore, MD portfolio photos, read client reviews and contact each Baltimore, MD professional for more information. Check out the information in the specialized professional sections too for tips on how to hire the right professional for your project.  Professional Categories in Baltimore
