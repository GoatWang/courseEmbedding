DBRS Confirms Ratings on Hana Financial SPV I, LLC		


June 22, 2017







DBRS, Inc. (DBRS) has today confirmed all outstanding classes of Factoring Contract Backed Notes issued by Hana Financial SPV I, LLC. Performance trends relating to the confirmed securities were such that credit enhancement levels were sufficient to cover DBRSs expected losses at their respective rating levels. 

The ratings are based on DBRSs review of the following analytical considerations:
-- Transaction capital structure, proposed ratings and form and sufficiency of available credit enhancement.
-- The transaction parties capabilities with regard to origination, underwriting and servicing.
-- The credit quality of the collateral pool and historical performance.

Notes:
All figures are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted.

The principal methodology is DBRS Master U.S. ABS Surveillance Methodology, which can be found on dbrs.com under Methodologies.

The rated entity or its related entities did participate in the rating process. DBRS had access to the accounts and other relevant internal documents of the rated entity or its related entities.

Please see attached appendix for additional information regarding sensitivity of assumptions used in the rating process.
