Company Introduction
The company is a subsidiary of a Petroleum Agency ready to influence a quick registration of a company to become an agent to the Petroleum Agency of South Sudan. The duty is to source for end buyers of crude and bring them to the Petroleum Agency and after the end buyers make purchase you will receive $2.00 commission from the Petroleum Agency and receive another $1.00 from the end buyers as Mandate. So if at the end of every month we are able to make a sale up to 2 million barrels, we are sure of 6 Million Dollars every month.
