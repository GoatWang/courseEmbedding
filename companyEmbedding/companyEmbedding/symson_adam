Scripps' Adam Symson to receive Borrell's 2014 Award of Merit

		Posted
		
Monday, 
March 3, 2014 
12:00 am









											Adam Symson										





Adam Symson, senior vice president and chief digital officer for The  E.W. Scripps Co., has been selected as the recipient of the  2014 Borrell Award of Merit.
The honor, also known as the Innovator's Award, is bestowed on an  executive who has taken an innovative and measurably successful path to  help his or her local media company in its digital transformation. This  year's award will be presented March 4 at Borrell's annual Local Online Advertising Conference in New York City.
"We've watched Scripps make remarkable strides in the past two years  under Adam's tutelage and acquire or build out some very impressive  initiatives," said Gordon Borrell, CEO of Borrell Associates. "They're making investments, they're trying some wildly innovating things with WCPO-TV in Cincinnati,  and they're hiring dozens of digital-only sales reps across all their  26 media markets. Adam has assembled an exceptionally bright team, and  they certainly deserve credit too. But it's clear that Adam is the  digital gyroscope at Scripps."
Scripps Digital drives the company's focus on digital revenue,  journalism, marketing, technology and product development. As chief  digital officer, Symson is responsible for developing the journalism and  advertising products and services for digital-platform audiences and  advertisers in the Scripps markets and overseeing national digital  business, including Newsy and StormShield. 
"Over the last several years under Adam's leadership, we have reoriented the way we see the business," said Rich Boehne,  Scripps chairman, president and CEO. "Today we see ourselves as a  consumer products company, focused equally on supporting both our  audiences and our advertisers as they migrate onto digital platforms  while just as aggressively building out entirely new and discreet  digital businesses that represent the next season of evolution for  Scripps."
Symson started his career in radio at KGIL-AM 1260 in Los Angeles.  He's worked in various roles at Scripps TV stations before joining the  company's corporate operation in 2003 as director of investigations and  special projects for the TV group. Prior to becoming chief digital  officer, Symson was in charge of the TV division's interactive  businesses.
He serves on the boards of directors for Cincinnati Public Radio, Adath Israel and the Scripps Howard Foundation.
The award will be presented on stage on Tuesday, March 4, at 12:20 p.m.,  during Borrell's Local Online Advertising Conference at the Grand Hyatt  in New York City. About 500 media executives are expected to be in  attendance. 
Past recipients are Kirk Davis, CEO of GateHouse Media (2013); Ezra Kucharz, president of CBS Local Media (2012); Clark Gilbert, CEO of Deseret Media (2011); and Colleen Brown, CEO of Fisher Broadcasting (2010).

The E.W. Scripps Co. announced a leadership change Wednesday. CEO Rich Boehne named Chief Digital Officer Adam Symson as his successor.Boehne plans to retire in the second half of 2017. Symson has been promoted to chief operating officer.“Adam is a strong leader and an entrepreneurial thinker,” Boehne said in a message to Scripps employees. The 41-year-old Symson is “exactly the right person to lead this company into the challenging and complex opportunities ahead of us.”Boehne, 60, has been president and CEO since 2008 and was elected chairman of the board in 2013. The board anticipates Boehne will continue as its chairman following the transition later next year.Symson, 41, joined the Scripps TV division in 2002 and has held a variety of roles before taking over the company’s digital operations in 2011.In that role, he has run Scripps’ local digital businesses in 27 markets as well as national digital content companies Midroll, Newsy and Cracked. Scripps’ digital portfolio includes web, mobile and over-the-top businesses, and Symson has led the strategy and execution of product development, content, revenue and marketing for that portfolio. He also has led the company’s efforts to develop new businesses in emerging media through investment and acquisition.Symson calls it the “opportunity of a lifetime” to be able to lead a company with “a long history of excellence in journalism.”But it’s not a job he ever expected.“The goals I set for myself in my career long ago sort of ended at the point where I said I wanted to be an investigative journalist,” he said. “That’s about as far as I had planned.”Symson joined Scripps as executive producer of investigations and special projects for Scripps affiliate KNXV in Phoenix in 2002. He also has worked for CBS stations WBBM in Chicago and KCBS in Los Angeles and as an independent producer for CBS News and NBC News.“For me, the reason I’m comfortable with where I have gone is because it’s been within Scripps, a company that’s very focused on the right kind of journalism that can make an impact on the communities where we operate,” he said.Symson said Scripps will continue to pursue the strategies Boehne established in the last several years, adding different media platforms to the television stations that account for more than 80 percent of the company’s revenue.He said Boehne’s legacy at Scripps will be its 20-year evolution from a newspaper company with broadcast and cable properties to a portfolio company with TV, radio, podcasting and direct-to-consumer content platforms that keep consumers engaged and journalism alive in local media markets.“Those are big shoes to fill,” Symson said. “Rich has elegantly managed this company through a number of major transitions, while deftly keeping the focus on journalism and our core mission, returning value to shareholders and growing a very important relationship with the Scripps family.”
