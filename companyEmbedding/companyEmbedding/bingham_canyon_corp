The Bingham Canyon Mine, more commonly known as Kennecott Copper Mine among locals,[3] is an open-pit mining operation extracting a large porphyry copper deposit southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah, in the Oquirrh Mountains. The mine is the largest man-made excavation in the world[4] and is considered to have produced more copper than any other mine in history – more than 19 million tonnes.[5] The mine is owned by Rio Tinto Group, a British-Australian multinational corporation. The copper operations at Bingham Canyon Mine are managed through Kennecott Utah Copper Corporation which operates the mine, a concentrator plant, a smelter, and a refinery. The mine has been in production since 1906, and has resulted in the creation of a pit over 0.6 miles (970 m) deep, 2.5 miles (4 km) wide, and covering 1,900 acres (770 ha). It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1966 under the name Bingham Canyon Open Pit Copper Mine.[2] The mine experienced a massive landslide in April 2013 and a smaller slide in September 2013.[6]

History[edit]
Minerals, in the form of copper ore, were first discovered in Bingham Canyon in 1848 by two brothers, Sanford and Thomas Bingham, sons of Erastus Bingham, Mormon pioneers of September 1847, who grazed their cattle there. They reported their find to their leader, Brigham Young, who advised against pursuing mining operations because the survival and establishment of settlements was of paramount importance at that time. The brothers applied themselves to that purpose as directed and did not stake a claim. In 1850, the Bingham family went to settle what is now Weber County, leaving the canyon still today known by their name.[7][8]

It was not until 17 Sept. 1863 that extraction of ore began and the potential of the canyon's mineral resources began to be widely recognized. That was when George B. Ogilvie and 23 others "located the West Jordan claim", soon followed by the Vidette claim. At first, mining was confined to placer gold, lead-silver and copper-gold. Porphyry copper required processing and a railroad, which reached the canyon in 1873.[9]:61–62[10]
Enos Andrew Wall started working claims in 1887. His extensive tunnels and test pits, on his 200 acres, indicated ore containing 2% copper.[9]:38,64–65
The canyon's 19th Century mines were relatively small, and it wasn't until the end of the century that very large-scale exploitation of the canyon's ore bodies began to develop with open-pit mining. In 1896, Samuel Newhouse and Thomas Weir acquired the Highland Boy Mine, which was rich in copper, silver and gold. Together they formed the Utah Consolidated Gold Mines, Ltd. with English investors. They then formed the Boston Consolidated Gold and Copper Co., Ltd., for development of low-grade copper ore adjacent to the Utah Copper Company site.[9]:93–94
Another significant development took place in 1903, when Daniel C. Jackling and Enos A. Wall organized the Utah Copper Company. Utah Copper immediately began construction of a pilot mill at Copperton,[9] just beyond the mouth of the canyon, and the company actually started mining in 1906.[10]
The success of Utah Copper in mining the huge but low-grade porphyry copper type ore body at Bingham Canyon was based on Jacklin's 1904 decision to use open-pit mining, steam shovels and the railroad. The mine became a showplace for "railroad-pit operations" and the industrial complex defined by the mine and the ASARCO smelting operation made it the "largest industrial mining complex in the world" by 1912.[9]:168–170
Utah Copper and Boston Consolidated merged after their separate surface operations approached each other in 1906. The Kennecott Copper Corporation, established to operate mines in Kennecott, Alaska, purchased a 25 percent financial interest in Utah Copper in 1915, which they increased to 75 percent in 1923.[9]:82,151
Bingham's Canyon mine expanded rapidly, and by the 1920s the region was a beehive of activity. Some 15,000 people of widely varying ethnicity lived in the canyon, in large residential communities constructed on the steep canyon walls. The population declined rapidly as mining techniques improved, and several of the mining camps were swallowed up by the ever-expanding mine. By 1980, when Lark was dismantled, only Copperton, at the mouth of Bingham Canyon and with a population of 800, remained.
The 21 separate mining operations in existence by 1911 were consolidated into two in 1970: Kennecott and The Anaconda Minerals Company. In 1985 open-pit mining operations were halted by Kennecott's Utah Copper. In 1986, Kennecott discovered gold in nearby Barney's Canyon.[10]
KCC was purchased by Sohio in 1981 and the mine reopened in 1987 after BP Minerals purchased the assets. In 1989 the Rio Tinto Group acquired the asset, who modernized the mine, mill and smelter.[9]:9
The open-pit owners replaced an antiquated 1000-car railroad with conveyor belts and pipelines for transporting the ore and waste, which reduced costs by nearly 30% and returned the operation to profitability.[11]
Landslides[edit]

At 9:30 pm on April 10, 2013, a landslide occurred at the mine. It was the largest non-volcanic landslide in the history of North America. Around 65–70 million cubic meters (2.3×10^9–2.5×10^9 cu ft) of dirt and rock thundered down the side of the pit.[12] Understanding that the mine's steep walls made it a high risk for landslides, an interferometric radar system had been installed to monitor the ground's stability. As a result of warnings produced by this system, mining operations were shut down the previous day in anticipation of the slide. There were no injuries.[13] The massive slide is expected to cut production of mined copper by 100,000 tonnes (110,000 short tons).[14] A second slide caused an evacuation of 100 workers on September 11, 2013.[15]
Environmental history[edit]
According to environmental specialists, the mine has had adverse environmental effects on the habitats of fish and wild animals as well as air and water pollution, creating health hazards to the surrounding public.[16] Different federal agencies concerned with environmental conservation have used strict legal rules to pressure the subsidiary of Kennecott copper mine to comply with environmental regulations. Since the early 1990s, Kennecott has spent more than $400 million on clean up efforts on the affected areas to avoid regulatory laws that would have placed them on the Superfund National Priorities List (NPL).[17]

Geology[edit]

The Bingham Canyon ore deposits occur in the Bingham nappe. They are a porphyry copper deposit, formed by a quartz monzonite porphyry intruded into sedimentary rocks. They exhibit a concentric alteration pattern and mineralogic zonation around the Bingham stock. These zones include a central core containing magnetite, followed by "a molybdenite zone low in copper, a bornite-chalcopyrite-gold higher grade copper zone, a pyrite-chalcopyrite zone, a pyrite zone, and an outermost lead-zinc zone."[10]:E1,E8
Structurally, Late Paleozoic rocks were thrust faulted over the Precambrian craton during the Cretaceous Sevier orogeny. These rocks were later intruded and altered in the Tertiary by granitoid rocks. This igneous event was the source of deposition of gold, silver and other base metals.[10]:E4
Copper and molybdenum sulfide minerals are dispersed in the intruded stock and in the adjoining carbonate sedimentary skarns. The main stratigraphic rocks in Bingham Canyon are Upper Pennsylvanian sandstones, quartzites, and limestones known as the Bingham Mine Formation in the Oquirrh Group. The central porphyry ores formed from mantle hydrothermal circulation while the outer vein and deposits in the sedimentary rocks formed at lower temperature when magmatic and meteoric waters mixed.[10]
Recovery process[edit]
The extracted ore is treated at the Kennecott smelter at nearby Magna, Utah. The ore is run through a concentrator, where huge grinding mills reduce it to the consistency of face powder.[19] Flotation then separates the gangue from the metalliferous particles, which float off as a 28-percent concentrate of copper along with lesser amounts of silver, gold, lead, molybdenum, platinum and palladium. A selective flotation step separates the molybdenite (molybdenum disulfide) from the chalcopyrite.
The filtered concentrate slurry is piped 17 miles (27 km) to the smelter, where it is dried, and then injected along with oxygen into a flash smelting furnace to oxidize the iron and sulfur. The oxidized iron is skimmed off, while the sulfur dioxide gas is captured and sent to an on-site acid plant for conversion to valuable sulfuric acid - a million tons of it each year.
Left behind is a molten copper sulfide called matte. The 70-percent-copper matte is water-quenched to form a sand-like solid, then injected, with oxygen, into a flash-converting furnace that produces molten, 98.6-percent-pure copper. This copper is then cast into 700-pound (320 kg) anode plates and shipped by rail to the refinery.
At the refinery, the anode plates are pressed flat and interleaved with stainless steel cathode blanks. Automated robotic vehicles place the prepared anodes in cells containing an acidic electrolyte. When the cells are electrified, the anodes slowly dissolve, freeing copper ions that are deposited on the cathode as 99.99-percent-pure copper.
Impurities and precious metals settle to the bottom of the electrolytic cells as anode slimes. A chlorination leaching process recovers the gold and silver, which is melted in induction furnaces.
Operations[edit]




Utah Copper Co. Mill, Bingham Canyon, circa 1910


Kennecott’s Bingham Canyon Mine is the largest man-made excavation in the world, and is visible to the naked eye from an orbiting space shuttle.[20][21][22] Employing some 2,000 laborers, 450,000 short tons (400,000 long tons; 410,000 t) of material are removed from the mine daily. Electric shovels can carry up to 56 cubic yards (43 m3) or 98 short tons (88 long tons; 89 t) of ore in a single scoop. Ore is loaded into a fleet of 64 large dump trucks which each carry 255 short tons (228 long tons; 231 t) of ore at a time; the trucks themselves cost about $3 million each. There is a five-mile (8 km) series of conveyors that take ore to the Copperton concentrator and flotation plant. The longest conveyor is 3 miles (4.8 km) long.[23]
As of 2010, Kennecott Utah Copper was the second largest copper producer in the US, and provided about 13-18% percent of the U.S.'s copper needs.[20][21] It is one of the top producing copper mines in the world with production at more than 18.7 million short tons (16.7 million long tons; 17.0 Mt). Every year, Kennecott produces approximately 300 thousand short tons (272 kt or 268 thousand long tons) of copper, along with 400 thousand troy ounces (13.7 short tons 12.4 tonnes, or 12.2 long tons) of gold, 4 million troy ounces (124 tonnes, 137 short tons or 122 long tons) of silver, about 10 thousand short tons (9,100 tonnes or 8,900 long tons) of molybdenum,[20] and about a million short tons (910 kt or 890 thousand long tons) of sulfuric acid, a by-product of the smelting process.[22] Rio Tinto purchased Kennecott Utah Copper in 1989 and has invested about $2 billion in the modernization of KUC’s operations.
The current mine plan will expire in 2019. Rio Tinto has been studying a plan to extend the open pit 1,000 feet (305 m) southward, which would extend the life of the mine into the mid-2030s. The plan has been contingent on approval by the Rio Tinto board of directors and approximately 25 required environmental permits.[24]
Production[edit]
Bingham Canyon has proven to be one of the world's most productive mines. As of 2004, its ore yielded more than 17 million tons (15.4 Mt) of copper, 23 million ounces (715 t) of gold, 190 million ounces (5,900 t) of silver, and 850 million pounds (386 kt) of molybdenum. The value of the resources extracted from the Bingham Canyon Mine is greater than the Comstock Lode, Klondike, and California gold rush mining regions combined. Mines in Chile, Indonesia, Arizona, and New Mexico now[when?] exceed Bingham Canyon's annual production rate. High molybdenum prices in 2005 made the molybdenum produced at Bingham Canyon in that year worth more than the copper.[25] The value of metals produced in 2006 at Bingham Canyon was US$1.8 billion.[26]
Environmental impact[edit]
In 1990, homes that had been built on former flood plains were discovered to be contaminated with high levels of lead and arsenic.[27] Activities to clean up 100 years of accumulated impacts began in the 1990s, under state Utah Department of Environmental Quality and federal oversight and are ongoing.[28]
The EPA lists "Kennecott South Zone/Bingham" on its superfund webpage, because it was proposed to be listed as a superfund site in 1994. The South Zone includes the Bingham Mining District in the Oquirrh Mountains, about 25 miles southwest of Salt Lake City, the open pit, waste rock dumps, Copperton Mill and other historic sites. The company avoided regulatory issues of being on the NPL by voluntarily cleaning up the contaminated lands, the so-called Superfund Alternative Approach. The listing proposal was withdrawn in 2008.[29][30] More than 25 million tons of mining wastes have been removed, sludge with elevated sulfate concentrations was consolidated and capped on site.[citation needed]
1900–1909[edit]
By 1904, there were three large copper smelters and one lead smelter in the Salt Lake valley. The sulfur dioxide gas emissions from the smokestacks caused significant crop damage to neighboring crops. During the 1904-1905 winter, the farmers gathered together and decided to file suit against the smelters in the United States District Court of Utah.[31] In 1906, Federal Court Judge Marshall ruled that the smelters could not smelt ores containing more than 10% sulfur,[32] effectively closing all of the aforementioned smelters.

1910–1979[edit]
Kennecott Copper Mines was formed in 1910 after a merger of Utah Copper and Kennecott copper mining companies.[33] By 1912, environmental protection organizations were complaining about high levels of asbestos being used in the organization. Kennecott Corporation was using asbestos for preventing fires since copper processing requires very high temperatures.[34] Copper has a very high boiling point and also requires use of other chemicals to separate it from other metals and impurities present in the ore. Asbestos has microscopic particles that dispersed into the atmosphere and contributed to illnesses among workers and individuals living near the mines. Asbestos is responsible for illnesses such as pleural fibrosis, skin warts and lung cancer.[34][35]
Kennecott Corporation was also cited as contributing to emissions of heavy metals such as arsenic and mercury.[36] By 1940, arsenic and mercury were also some of the concerns that were raised by environmental protection agencies against Kennecott Corporation.[37] Both mercury and arsenic are dangerous to health in large quantities.[33][38]

Investigations in the 1980s revealed contamination in the groundwater caused by mining operations the release of hazardous materials. The State of Utah proceeded with legal action against Kennecott and filed a damage claim against the mine in October, 1986, for the loss and destruction of the natural resources, specifically the groundwater.[40][41]
There was also a threat due to the tailings dam. An engineering report in March, 1988, gave information that the tailings dam overshadowing the town of Magna had threat of collapse due to an earthquake and that the billion-ton tailings pond would bury the homes nearby if the tailing pond’s embankment failed. The mine responded by proposing various potential strategies including buying up entire subdivisions near the tailings pond, calculating the company’s liability if the embankment failed, investing $500 million to reinforce the embankment, and colluding with state regulators to keep the engineering report out of the public eye.[42]

Starting in the beginning of 1990s, dust emissions from mining began polluting surrounding areas, caused by an area near the mine where PM10 levels (particulate matter larger than 10 µg/m³) began to rise from 28μg/m³ to 50μg/m³, posing a severe health concerns for residents. The first report of PM10 rising was proposed by Schwartz and Dockery in 1992. Then, in 1997, Carter (a professor at Brigham Young University) put forward that the mine discharge of PM10 has caused lung damage to neighboring residents.
In 1995, due to scientific research showing that mining had caused the pollution of groundwater, Utah passed laws to make Kennecott companies pay $37 million to control water pollution.
As a result of mine discharge sewage containing large amounts of arsenic and selenium – selenium being particularly toxic to birds, fish and amphibians – about 30% of the fish population were killed in the early 1990s. In 1995 Kennecott, EPA and the State of Utah signed an agreement saying that Kennecott will continue to clean up the discharge sewage.[43]

From 2000 through 2011 the Bingham Canyon copper mine has had numerous chemical spills.[44]

The EPA has estimated a 72-mile plume of contaminated groundwater has been created over the course of the mine due to multiple spills and runoff. Long-term effects of the underground water supply contamination may include an increased demand for surface water solutions as the population of the Salt Lake valley grows since the county will not be able to tap into the groundwater supply.[44]
In 2007, Kennecott Utah Copper LLC was considering expanding its land holdings to Rose Canyon Ranch in the southern Oquirrh mountains and Yellow Fork Canyon land in Salt Lake County. Kennecott claims rights to file a mining claim in accordance with the Stock-Raising Homestead Act of 1916.[45]
In 2008, the United States Department of Interior Fish and Wildlife Service sued Kennecott after the release of hazardous substances including selenium, copper, arsenic, zinc, lead, and cadmium. A federal biologist claimed that these chemicals have caused great damage to the ecosystems and resources that support the migrant bird populations, as well as other fish and wildlife habitats.[41]
In the northern zone near Magna, Utah, the extensive southern tailings pond has been collecting the tailings since the mine first started mining production. Kennecott Utah Copper LLC has requested permission for a Tailings Expansion Project (TEP) to expand the tailings pond impoundment in Magna, which is already at 1.8 billion ton capacity,[42] and to expand on 721 new acres of wetlands south of the Great Salt Lake. The company has come under scrutiny for the instability of the structure. The Salt Lake Tribune published a report in 2007 revealing that the company failed to disclose information on possible damages that could occur if the tailings pond collapsed in the event of a major earthquake. From 2001 through 2009 there have been six earthquakes ranging from 2.3 to 3.4 in magnitude with an average epicenter only 3 miles away from Magna.[46]
In popular culture[edit]
Bingham Canyon Mine was featured in the 1973 made-for-TV movie Birds of Prey, with protagonist helicopter pilot Harry Walker (played by David Janssen) piloting his Hughes 500 into the crater to track down three bank robbers and their female hostage in an Aérospatiale SA 315B Lama, which was hiding behind heavy mining machinery. It was also featured prominently in The Fundamentals of Caring.

The Bingham Canyon Mine, more commonly known as Kennecott Copper Mine among locals,[3] is an open-pit mining operation extracting a large porphyry copper deposit southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah, in the Oquirrh Mountains. The mine is the largest man-made excavation in the world[4] and is considered to have produced more copper than any other mine in history – more than 19 million tonnes.[5] The mine is owned by Rio Tinto Group, a British-Australian multinational corporation. The copper operations at Bingham Canyon Mine are managed through Kennecott Utah Copper Corporation which operates the mine, a concentrator plant, a smelter, and a refinery. The mine has been in production since 1906, and has resulted in the creation of a pit over 0.6 miles (970 m) deep, 2.5 miles (4 km) wide, and covering 1,900 acres (770 ha). It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1966 under the name Bingham Canyon Open Pit Copper Mine.[2] The mine experienced a massive landslide in April 2013 and a smaller slide in September 2013.[6]

History[edit]
Minerals, in the form of copper ore, were first discovered in Bingham Canyon in 1848 by two brothers, Sanford and Thomas Bingham, sons of Erastus Bingham, Mormon pioneers of September 1847, who grazed their cattle there. They reported their find to their leader, Brigham Young, who advised against pursuing mining operations because the survival and establishment of settlements was of paramount importance at that time. The brothers applied themselves to that purpose as directed and did not stake a claim. In 1850, the Bingham family went to settle what is now Weber County, leaving the canyon still today known by their name.[7][8]

It was not until 17 Sept. 1863 that extraction of ore began and the potential of the canyon's mineral resources began to be widely recognized. That was when George B. Ogilvie and 23 others "located the West Jordan claim", soon followed by the Vidette claim. At first, mining was confined to placer gold, lead-silver and copper-gold. Porphyry copper required processing and a railroad, which reached the canyon in 1873.[9]:61–62[10]
Enos Andrew Wall started working claims in 1887. His extensive tunnels and test pits, on his 200 acres, indicated ore containing 2% copper.[9]:38,64–65
The canyon's 19th Century mines were relatively small, and it wasn't until the end of the century that very large-scale exploitation of the canyon's ore bodies began to develop with open-pit mining. In 1896, Samuel Newhouse and Thomas Weir acquired the Highland Boy Mine, which was rich in copper, silver and gold. Together they formed the Utah Consolidated Gold Mines, Ltd. with English investors. They then formed the Boston Consolidated Gold and Copper Co., Ltd., for development of low-grade copper ore adjacent to the Utah Copper Company site.[9]:93–94
Another significant development took place in 1903, when Daniel C. Jackling and Enos A. Wall organized the Utah Copper Company. Utah Copper immediately began construction of a pilot mill at Copperton,[9] just beyond the mouth of the canyon, and the company actually started mining in 1906.[10]
The success of Utah Copper in mining the huge but low-grade porphyry copper type ore body at Bingham Canyon was based on Jacklin's 1904 decision to use open-pit mining, steam shovels and the railroad. The mine became a showplace for "railroad-pit operations" and the industrial complex defined by the mine and the ASARCO smelting operation made it the "largest industrial mining complex in the world" by 1912.[9]:168–170
Utah Copper and Boston Consolidated merged after their separate surface operations approached each other in 1906. The Kennecott Copper Corporation, established to operate mines in Kennecott, Alaska, purchased a 25 percent financial interest in Utah Copper in 1915, which they increased to 75 percent in 1923.[9]:82,151
Bingham's Canyon mine expanded rapidly, and by the 1920s the region was a beehive of activity. Some 15,000 people of widely varying ethnicity lived in the canyon, in large residential communities constructed on the steep canyon walls. The population declined rapidly as mining techniques improved, and several of the mining camps were swallowed up by the ever-expanding mine. By 1980, when Lark was dismantled, only Copperton, at the mouth of Bingham Canyon and with a population of 800, remained.
The 21 separate mining operations in existence by 1911 were consolidated into two in 1970: Kennecott and The Anaconda Minerals Company. In 1985 open-pit mining operations were halted by Kennecott's Utah Copper. In 1986, Kennecott discovered gold in nearby Barney's Canyon.[10]
KCC was purchased by Sohio in 1981 and the mine reopened in 1987 after BP Minerals purchased the assets. In 1989 the Rio Tinto Group acquired the asset, who modernized the mine, mill and smelter.[9]:9
The open-pit owners replaced an antiquated 1000-car railroad with conveyor belts and pipelines for transporting the ore and waste, which reduced costs by nearly 30% and returned the operation to profitability.[11]
Landslides[edit]

At 9:30 pm on April 10, 2013, a landslide occurred at the mine. It was the largest non-volcanic landslide in the history of North America. Around 65–70 million cubic meters (2.3×10^9–2.5×10^9 cu ft) of dirt and rock thundered down the side of the pit.[12] Understanding that the mine's steep walls made it a high risk for landslides, an interferometric radar system had been installed to monitor the ground's stability. As a result of warnings produced by this system, mining operations were shut down the previous day in anticipation of the slide. There were no injuries.[13] The massive slide is expected to cut production of mined copper by 100,000 tonnes (110,000 short tons).[14] A second slide caused an evacuation of 100 workers on September 11, 2013.[15]
Environmental history[edit]
According to environmental specialists, the mine has had adverse environmental effects on the habitats of fish and wild animals as well as air and water pollution, creating health hazards to the surrounding public.[16] Different federal agencies concerned with environmental conservation have used strict legal rules to pressure the subsidiary of Kennecott copper mine to comply with environmental regulations. Since the early 1990s, Kennecott has spent more than $400 million on clean up efforts on the affected areas to avoid regulatory laws that would have placed them on the Superfund National Priorities List (NPL).[17]

Geology[edit]

Geologic map showing bedrock geology and alteration zones, USGS.


The Bingham Canyon ore deposits occur in the Bingham nappe. They are a porphyry copper deposit, formed by a quartz monzonite porphyry intruded into sedimentary rocks. They exhibit a concentric alteration pattern and mineralogic zonation around the Bingham stock. These zones include a central core containing magnetite, followed by "a molybdenite zone low in copper, a bornite-chalcopyrite-gold higher grade copper zone, a pyrite-chalcopyrite zone, a pyrite zone, and an outermost lead-zinc zone."[10]:E1,E8
Structurally, Late Paleozoic rocks were thrust faulted over the Precambrian craton during the Cretaceous Sevier orogeny. These rocks were later intruded and altered in the Tertiary by granitoid rocks. This igneous event was the source of deposition of gold, silver and other base metals.[10]:E4
Copper and molybdenum sulfide minerals are dispersed in the intruded stock and in the adjoining carbonate sedimentary skarns. The main stratigraphic rocks in Bingham Canyon are Upper Pennsylvanian sandstones, quartzites, and limestones known as the Bingham Mine Formation in the Oquirrh Group. The central porphyry ores formed from mantle hydrothermal circulation while the outer vein and deposits in the sedimentary rocks formed at lower temperature when magmatic and meteoric waters mixed.[10]
Recovery process[edit]
The extracted ore is treated at the Kennecott smelter at nearby Magna, Utah. The ore is run through a concentrator, where huge grinding mills reduce it to the consistency of face powder.[19] Flotation then separates the gangue from the metalliferous particles, which float off as a 28-percent concentrate of copper along with lesser amounts of silver, gold, lead, molybdenum, platinum and palladium. A selective flotation step separates the molybdenite (molybdenum disulfide) from the chalcopyrite.
The filtered concentrate slurry is piped 17 miles (27 km) to the smelter, where it is dried, and then injected along with oxygen into a flash smelting furnace to oxidize the iron and sulfur. The oxidized iron is skimmed off, while the sulfur dioxide gas is captured and sent to an on-site acid plant for conversion to valuable sulfuric acid - a million tons of it each year.
Left behind is a molten copper sulfide called matte. The 70-percent-copper matte is water-quenched to form a sand-like solid, then injected, with oxygen, into a flash-converting furnace that produces molten, 98.6-percent-pure copper. This copper is then cast into 700-pound (320 kg) anode plates and shipped by rail to the refinery.
At the refinery, the anode plates are pressed flat and interleaved with stainless steel cathode blanks. Automated robotic vehicles place the prepared anodes in cells containing an acidic electrolyte. When the cells are electrified, the anodes slowly dissolve, freeing copper ions that are deposited on the cathode as 99.99-percent-pure copper.
Impurities and precious metals settle to the bottom of the electrolytic cells as anode slimes. A chlorination leaching process recovers the gold and silver, which is melted in induction furnaces.
Operations[edit]




Utah Copper Co. Mill, Bingham Canyon, circa 1910


Kennecott’s Bingham Canyon Mine is the largest man-made excavation in the world, and is visible to the naked eye from an orbiting space shuttle.[20][21][22] Employing some 2,000 laborers, 450,000 short tons (400,000 long tons; 410,000 t) of material are removed from the mine daily. Electric shovels can carry up to 56 cubic yards (43 m3) or 98 short tons (88 long tons; 89 t) of ore in a single scoop. Ore is loaded into a fleet of 64 large dump trucks which each carry 255 short tons (228 long tons; 231 t) of ore at a time; the trucks themselves cost about $3 million each. There is a five-mile (8 km) series of conveyors that take ore to the Copperton concentrator and flotation plant. The longest conveyor is 3 miles (4.8 km) long.[23]
As of 2010, Kennecott Utah Copper was the second largest copper producer in the US, and provided about 13-18% percent of the U.S.'s copper needs.[20][21] It is one of the top producing copper mines in the world with production at more than 18.7 million short tons (16.7 million long tons; 17.0 Mt). Every year, Kennecott produces approximately 300 thousand short tons (272 kt or 268 thousand long tons) of copper, along with 400 thousand troy ounces (13.7 short tons 12.4 tonnes, or 12.2 long tons) of gold, 4 million troy ounces (124 tonnes, 137 short tons or 122 long tons) of silver, about 10 thousand short tons (9,100 tonnes or 8,900 long tons) of molybdenum,[20] and about a million short tons (910 kt or 890 thousand long tons) of sulfuric acid, a by-product of the smelting process.[22] Rio Tinto purchased Kennecott Utah Copper in 1989 and has invested about $2 billion in the modernization of KUC’s operations.
The current mine plan will expire in 2019. Rio Tinto has been studying a plan to extend the open pit 1,000 feet (305 m) southward, which would extend the life of the mine into the mid-2030s. The plan has been contingent on approval by the Rio Tinto board of directors and approximately 25 required environmental permits.[24]
Production[edit]
Bingham Canyon has proven to be one of the world's most productive mines. As of 2004, its ore yielded more than 17 million tons (15.4 Mt) of copper, 23 million ounces (715 t) of gold, 190 million ounces (5,900 t) of silver, and 850 million pounds (386 kt) of molybdenum. The value of the resources extracted from the Bingham Canyon Mine is greater than the Comstock Lode, Klondike, and California gold rush mining regions combined. Mines in Chile, Indonesia, Arizona, and New Mexico now[when?] exceed Bingham Canyon's annual production rate. High molybdenum prices in 2005 made the molybdenum produced at Bingham Canyon in that year worth more than the copper.[25] The value of metals produced in 2006 at Bingham Canyon was US$1.8 billion.[26]
Environmental impact[edit]
In 1990, homes that had been built on former flood plains were discovered to be contaminated with high levels of lead and arsenic.[27] Activities to clean up 100 years of accumulated impacts began in the 1990s, under state Utah Department of Environmental Quality and federal oversight and are ongoing.[28]
The EPA lists "Kennecott South Zone/Bingham" on its superfund webpage, because it was proposed to be listed as a superfund site in 1994. The South Zone includes the Bingham Mining District in the Oquirrh Mountains, about 25 miles southwest of Salt Lake City, the open pit, waste rock dumps, Copperton Mill and other historic sites. The company avoided regulatory issues of being on the NPL by voluntarily cleaning up the contaminated lands, the so-called Superfund Alternative Approach. The listing proposal was withdrawn in 2008.[29][30] More than 25 million tons of mining wastes have been removed, sludge with elevated sulfate concentrations was consolidated and capped on site.[citation needed]
1900–1909[edit]
By 1904, there were three large copper smelters and one lead smelter in the Salt Lake valley. The sulfur dioxide gas emissions from the smokestacks caused significant crop damage to neighboring crops. During the 1904-1905 winter, the farmers gathered together and decided to file suit against the smelters in the United States District Court of Utah.[31] In 1906, Federal Court Judge Marshall ruled that the smelters could not smelt ores containing more than 10% sulfur,[32] effectively closing all of the aforementioned smelters.

1910–1979[edit]
Kennecott Copper Mines was formed in 1910 after a merger of Utah Copper and Kennecott copper mining companies.[33] By 1912, environmental protection organizations were complaining about high levels of asbestos being used in the organization. Kennecott Corporation was using asbestos for preventing fires since copper processing requires very high temperatures.[34] Copper has a very high boiling point and also requires use of other chemicals to separate it from other metals and impurities present in the ore. Asbestos has microscopic particles that dispersed into the atmosphere and contributed to illnesses among workers and individuals living near the mines. Asbestos is responsible for illnesses such as pleural fibrosis, skin warts and lung cancer.[34][35]
Kennecott Corporation was also cited as contributing to emissions of heavy metals such as arsenic and mercury.[36] By 1940, arsenic and mercury were also some of the concerns that were raised by environmental protection agencies against Kennecott Corporation.[37] Both mercury and arsenic are dangerous to health in large quantities.[33][38]

Investigations in the 1980s revealed contamination in the groundwater caused by mining operations the release of hazardous materials. The State of Utah proceeded with legal action against Kennecott and filed a damage claim against the mine in October, 1986, for the loss and destruction of the natural resources, specifically the groundwater.[40][41]
There was also a threat due to the tailings dam. An engineering report in March, 1988, gave information that the tailings dam overshadowing the town of Magna had threat of collapse due to an earthquake and that the billion-ton tailings pond would bury the homes nearby if the tailing pond’s embankment failed. The mine responded by proposing various potential strategies including buying up entire subdivisions near the tailings pond, calculating the company’s liability if the embankment failed, investing $500 million to reinforce the embankment, and colluding with state regulators to keep the engineering report out of the public eye.[42]

Starting in the beginning of 1990s, dust emissions from mining began polluting surrounding areas, caused by an area near the mine where PM10 levels (particulate matter larger than 10 µg/m³) began to rise from 28μg/m³ to 50μg/m³, posing a severe health concerns for residents. The first report of PM10 rising was proposed by Schwartz and Dockery in 1992. Then, in 1997, Carter (a professor at Brigham Young University) put forward that the mine discharge of PM10 has caused lung damage to neighboring residents.
In 1995, due to scientific research showing that mining had caused the pollution of groundwater, Utah passed laws to make Kennecott companies pay $37 million to control water pollution.
As a result of mine discharge sewage containing large amounts of arsenic and selenium – selenium being particularly toxic to birds, fish and amphibians – about 30% of the fish population were killed in the early 1990s. In 1995 Kennecott, EPA and the State of Utah signed an agreement saying that Kennecott will continue to clean up the discharge sewage.[43]
2000–2014[edit]
From 2000 through 2011 the Bingham Canyon copper mine has had numerous chemical spills.[44]

The EPA has estimated a 72-mile plume of contaminated groundwater has been created over the course of the mine due to multiple spills and runoff. Long-term effects of the underground water supply contamination may include an increased demand for surface water solutions as the population of the Salt Lake valley grows since the county will not be able to tap into the groundwater supply.[44]
In 2007, Kennecott Utah Copper LLC was considering expanding its land holdings to Rose Canyon Ranch in the southern Oquirrh mountains and Yellow Fork Canyon land in Salt Lake County. Kennecott claims rights to file a mining claim in accordance with the Stock-Raising Homestead Act of 1916.[45]
In 2008, the United States Department of Interior Fish and Wildlife Service sued Kennecott after the release of hazardous substances including selenium, copper, arsenic, zinc, lead, and cadmium. A federal biologist claimed that these chemicals have caused great damage to the ecosystems and resources that support the migrant bird populations, as well as other fish and wildlife habitats.[41]
In the northern zone near Magna, Utah, the extensive southern tailings pond has been collecting the tailings since the mine first started mining production. Kennecott Utah Copper LLC has requested permission for a Tailings Expansion Project (TEP) to expand the tailings pond impoundment in Magna, which is already at 1.8 billion ton capacity,[42] and to expand on 721 new acres of wetlands south of the Great Salt Lake. The company has come under scrutiny for the instability of the structure. The Salt Lake Tribune published a report in 2007 revealing that the company failed to disclose information on possible damages that could occur if the tailings pond collapsed in the event of a major earthquake. From 2001 through 2009 there have been six earthquakes ranging from 2.3 to 3.4 in magnitude with an average epicenter only 3 miles away from Magna.[46]
In popular culture[edit]
Bingham Canyon Mine was featured in the 1973 made-for-TV movie Birds of Prey, with protagonist helicopter pilot Harry Walker (played by David Janssen) piloting his Hughes 500 into the crater to track down three bank robbers and their female hostage in an Aérospatiale SA 315B Lama, which was hiding behind heavy mining machinery. It was also featured prominently in The Fundamentals of Caring.

The Bingham Canyon Mine, more commonly known as Kennecott Copper Mine among locals,[3] is an open-pit mining operation extracting a large porphyry copper deposit southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah, in the Oquirrh Mountains. The mine is the largest man-made excavation in the world[4] and is considered to have produced more copper than any other mine in history – more than 19 million tonnes.[5] The mine is owned by Rio Tinto Group, a British-Australian multinational corporation. The copper operations at Bingham Canyon Mine are managed through Kennecott Utah Copper Corporation which operates the mine, a concentrator plant, a smelter, and a refinery. The mine has been in production since 1906, and has resulted in the creation of a pit over 0.6 miles (970 m) deep, 2.5 miles (4 km) wide, and covering 1,900 acres (770 ha). It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1966 under the name Bingham Canyon Open Pit Copper Mine.[2] The mine experienced a massive landslide in April 2013 and a smaller slide in September 2013.[6]

History[edit]
Minerals, in the form of copper ore, were first discovered in Bingham Canyon in 1848 by two brothers, Sanford and Thomas Bingham, sons of Erastus Bingham, Mormon pioneers of September 1847, who grazed their cattle there. They reported their find to their leader, Brigham Young, who advised against pursuing mining operations because the survival and establishment of settlements was of paramount importance at that time. The brothers applied themselves to that purpose as directed and did not stake a claim. In 1850, the Bingham family went to settle what is now Weber County, leaving the canyon still today known by their name.[7][8]




Bingham Canyon Mine, November 1942. Carr Fork Canyon as seen from "G" bridge.


It was not until 17 Sept. 1863 that extraction of ore began and the potential of the canyon's mineral resources began to be widely recognized. That was when George B. Ogilvie and 23 others "located the West Jordan claim", soon followed by the Vidette claim. At first, mining was confined to placer gold, lead-silver and copper-gold. Porphyry copper required processing and a railroad, which reached the canyon in 1873.[9]:61–62[10]
Enos Andrew Wall started working claims in 1887. His extensive tunnels and test pits, on his 200 acres, indicated ore containing 2% copper.[9]:38,64–65
The canyon's 19th Century mines were relatively small, and it wasn't until the end of the century that very large-scale exploitation of the canyon's ore bodies began to develop with open-pit mining. In 1896, Samuel Newhouse and Thomas Weir acquired the Highland Boy Mine, which was rich in copper, silver and gold. Together they formed the Utah Consolidated Gold Mines, Ltd. with English investors. They then formed the Boston Consolidated Gold and Copper Co., Ltd., for development of low-grade copper ore adjacent to the Utah Copper Company site.[9]:93–94
Another significant development took place in 1903, when Daniel C. Jackling and Enos A. Wall organized the Utah Copper Company. Utah Copper immediately began construction of a pilot mill at Copperton,[9] just beyond the mouth of the canyon, and the company actually started mining in 1906.[10]
The success of Utah Copper in mining the huge but low-grade porphyry copper type ore body at Bingham Canyon was based on Jacklin's 1904 decision to use open-pit mining, steam shovels and the railroad. The mine became a showplace for "railroad-pit operations" and the industrial complex defined by the mine and the ASARCO smelting operation made it the "largest industrial mining complex in the world" by 1912.[9]:168–170
Utah Copper and Boston Consolidated merged after their separate surface operations approached each other in 1906. The Kennecott Copper Corporation, established to operate mines in Kennecott, Alaska, purchased a 25 percent financial interest in Utah Copper in 1915, which they increased to 75 percent in 1923.[9]:82,151
Bingham's Canyon mine expanded rapidly, and by the 1920s the region was a beehive of activity. Some 15,000 people of widely varying ethnicity lived in the canyon, in large residential communities constructed on the steep canyon walls. The population declined rapidly as mining techniques improved, and several of the mining camps were swallowed up by the ever-expanding mine. By 1980, when Lark was dismantled, only Copperton, at the mouth of Bingham Canyon and with a population of 800, remained.
The 21 separate mining operations in existence by 1911 were consolidated into two in 1970: Kennecott and The Anaconda Minerals Company. In 1985 open-pit mining operations were halted by Kennecott's Utah Copper. In 1986, Kennecott discovered gold in nearby Barney's Canyon.[10]
KCC was purchased by Sohio in 1981 and the mine reopened in 1987 after BP Minerals purchased the assets. In 1989 the Rio Tinto Group acquired the asset, who modernized the mine, mill and smelter.[9]:9
The open-pit owners replaced an antiquated 1000-car railroad with conveyor belts and pipelines for transporting the ore and waste, which reduced costs by nearly 30% and returned the operation to profitability.[11]
Landslides[edit]









Bingham Canyon Mine satellite images before (left, July 20, 2011) and after (right, May 2, 2013) a landslide on April 20, 2013


At 9:30 pm on April 10, 2013, a landslide occurred at the mine. It was the largest non-volcanic landslide in the history of North America. Around 65–70 million cubic meters (2.3×10^9–2.5×10^9 cu ft) of dirt and rock thundered down the side of the pit.[12] Understanding that the mine's steep walls made it a high risk for landslides, an interferometric radar system had been installed to monitor the ground's stability. As a result of warnings produced by this system, mining operations were shut down the previous day in anticipation of the slide. There were no injuries.[13] The massive slide is expected to cut production of mined copper by 100,000 tonnes (110,000 short tons).[14] A second slide caused an evacuation of 100 workers on September 11, 2013.[15]
Environmental history[edit]
According to environmental specialists, the mine has had adverse environmental effects on the habitats of fish and wild animals as well as air and water pollution, creating health hazards to the surrounding public.[16] Different federal agencies concerned with environmental conservation have used strict legal rules to pressure the subsidiary of Kennecott copper mine to comply with environmental regulations. Since the early 1990s, Kennecott has spent more than $400 million on clean up efforts on the affected areas to avoid regulatory laws that would have placed them on the Superfund National Priorities List (NPL).[17]
The figure below shows a comparison of two satellite images used to identify the changes in the Bingham Canyon Mine between 1985 and 2016 [1] [18]


Geology[edit]

Geologic map showing bedrock geology and alteration zones, USGS.


The Bingham Canyon ore deposits occur in the Bingham nappe. They are a porphyry copper deposit, formed by a quartz monzonite porphyry intruded into sedimentary rocks. They exhibit a concentric alteration pattern and mineralogic zonation around the Bingham stock. These zones include a central core containing magnetite, followed by "a molybdenite zone low in copper, a bornite-chalcopyrite-gold higher grade copper zone, a pyrite-chalcopyrite zone, a pyrite zone, and an outermost lead-zinc zone."[10]:E1,E8
Structurally, Late Paleozoic rocks were thrust faulted over the Precambrian craton during the Cretaceous Sevier orogeny. These rocks were later intruded and altered in the Tertiary by granitoid rocks. This igneous event was the source of deposition of gold, silver and other base metals.[10]:E4
Copper and molybdenum sulfide minerals are dispersed in the intruded stock and in the adjoining carbonate sedimentary skarns. The main stratigraphic rocks in Bingham Canyon are Upper Pennsylvanian sandstones, quartzites, and limestones known as the Bingham Mine Formation in the Oquirrh Group. The central porphyry ores formed from mantle hydrothermal circulation while the outer vein and deposits in the sedimentary rocks formed at lower temperature when magmatic and meteoric waters mixed.[10]
Recovery process[edit]
The extracted ore is treated at the Kennecott smelter at nearby Magna, Utah. The ore is run through a concentrator, where huge grinding mills reduce it to the consistency of face powder.[19] Flotation then separates the gangue from the metalliferous particles, which float off as a 28-percent concentrate of copper along with lesser amounts of silver, gold, lead, molybdenum, platinum and palladium. A selective flotation step separates the molybdenite (molybdenum disulfide) from the chalcopyrite.
The filtered concentrate slurry is piped 17 miles (27 km) to the smelter, where it is dried, and then injected along with oxygen into a flash smelting furnace to oxidize the iron and sulfur. The oxidized iron is skimmed off, while the sulfur dioxide gas is captured and sent to an on-site acid plant for conversion to valuable sulfuric acid - a million tons of it each year.
Left behind is a molten copper sulfide called matte. The 70-percent-copper matte is water-quenched to form a sand-like solid, then injected, with oxygen, into a flash-converting furnace that produces molten, 98.6-percent-pure copper. This copper is then cast into 700-pound (320 kg) anode plates and shipped by rail to the refinery.
At the refinery, the anode plates are pressed flat and interleaved with stainless steel cathode blanks. Automated robotic vehicles place the prepared anodes in cells containing an acidic electrolyte. When the cells are electrified, the anodes slowly dissolve, freeing copper ions that are deposited on the cathode as 99.99-percent-pure copper.
Impurities and precious metals settle to the bottom of the electrolytic cells as anode slimes. A chlorination leaching process recovers the gold and silver, which is melted in induction furnaces.
Operations[edit]




Utah Copper Co. Mill, Bingham Canyon, circa 1910


Kennecott’s Bingham Canyon Mine is the largest man-made excavation in the world, and is visible to the naked eye from an orbiting space shuttle.[20][21][22] Employing some 2,000 laborers, 450,000 short tons (400,000 long tons; 410,000 t) of material are removed from the mine daily. Electric shovels can carry up to 56 cubic yards (43 m3) or 98 short tons (88 long tons; 89 t) of ore in a single scoop. Ore is loaded into a fleet of 64 large dump trucks which each carry 255 short tons (228 long tons; 231 t) of ore at a time; the trucks themselves cost about $3 million each. There is a five-mile (8 km) series of conveyors that take ore to the Copperton concentrator and flotation plant. The longest conveyor is 3 miles (4.8 km) long.[23]
As of 2010, Kennecott Utah Copper was the second largest copper producer in the US, and provided about 13-18% percent of the U.S.'s copper needs.[20][21] It is one of the top producing copper mines in the world with production at more than 18.7 million short tons (16.7 million long tons; 17.0 Mt). Every year, Kennecott produces approximately 300 thousand short tons (272 kt or 268 thousand long tons) of copper, along with 400 thousand troy ounces (13.7 short tons 12.4 tonnes, or 12.2 long tons) of gold, 4 million troy ounces (124 tonnes, 137 short tons or 122 long tons) of silver, about 10 thousand short tons (9,100 tonnes or 8,900 long tons) of molybdenum,[20] and about a million short tons (910 kt or 890 thousand long tons) of sulfuric acid, a by-product of the smelting process.[22] Rio Tinto purchased Kennecott Utah Copper in 1989 and has invested about $2 billion in the modernization of KUC’s operations.
The current mine plan will expire in 2019. Rio Tinto has been studying a plan to extend the open pit 1,000 feet (305 m) southward, which would extend the life of the mine into the mid-2030s. The plan has been contingent on approval by the Rio Tinto board of directors and approximately 25 required environmental permits.[24]
Production[edit]
Bingham Canyon has proven to be one of the world's most productive mines. As of 2004, its ore yielded more than 17 million tons (15.4 Mt) of copper, 23 million ounces (715 t) of gold, 190 million ounces (5,900 t) of silver, and 850 million pounds (386 kt) of molybdenum. The value of the resources extracted from the Bingham Canyon Mine is greater than the Comstock Lode, Klondike, and California gold rush mining regions combined. Mines in Chile, Indonesia, Arizona, and New Mexico now[when?] exceed Bingham Canyon's annual production rate. High molybdenum prices in 2005 made the molybdenum produced at Bingham Canyon in that year worth more than the copper.[25] The value of metals produced in 2006 at Bingham Canyon was US$1.8 billion.[26]
Environmental impact[edit]
In 1990, homes that had been built on former flood plains were discovered to be contaminated with high levels of lead and arsenic.[27] Activities to clean up 100 years of accumulated impacts began in the 1990s, under state Utah Department of Environmental Quality and federal oversight and are ongoing.[28]
The EPA lists "Kennecott South Zone/Bingham" on its superfund webpage, because it was proposed to be listed as a superfund site in 1994. The South Zone includes the Bingham Mining District in the Oquirrh Mountains, about 25 miles southwest of Salt Lake City, the open pit, waste rock dumps, Copperton Mill and other historic sites. The company avoided regulatory issues of being on the NPL by voluntarily cleaning up the contaminated lands, the so-called Superfund Alternative Approach. The listing proposal was withdrawn in 2008.[29][30] More than 25 million tons of mining wastes have been removed, sludge with elevated sulfate concentrations was consolidated and capped on site.[citation needed]
1900–1909[edit]
By 1904, there were three large copper smelters and one lead smelter in the Salt Lake valley. The sulfur dioxide gas emissions from the smokestacks caused significant crop damage to neighboring crops. During the 1904-1905 winter, the farmers gathered together and decided to file suit against the smelters in the United States District Court of Utah.[31] In 1906, Federal Court Judge Marshall ruled that the smelters could not smelt ores containing more than 10% sulfur,[32] effectively closing all of the aforementioned smelters.

1910–1979[edit]
Kennecott Copper Mines was formed in 1910 after a merger of Utah Copper and Kennecott copper mining companies.[33] By 1912, environmental protection organizations were complaining about high levels of asbestos being used in the organization. Kennecott Corporation was using asbestos for preventing fires since copper processing requires very high temperatures.[34] Copper has a very high boiling point and also requires use of other chemicals to separate it from other metals and impurities present in the ore. Asbestos has microscopic particles that dispersed into the atmosphere and contributed to illnesses among workers and individuals living near the mines. Asbestos is responsible for illnesses such as pleural fibrosis, skin warts and lung cancer.[34][35]
Kennecott Corporation was also cited as contributing to emissions of heavy metals such as arsenic and mercury.[36] By 1940, arsenic and mercury were also some of the concerns that were raised by environmental protection agencies against Kennecott Corporation.[37] Both mercury and arsenic are dangerous to health in large quantities.[33][38]

Investigations in the 1980s revealed contamination in the groundwater caused by mining operations the release of hazardous materials. The State of Utah proceeded with legal action against Kennecott and filed a damage claim against the mine in October, 1986, for the loss and destruction of the natural resources, specifically the groundwater.[40][41]
There was also a threat due to the tailings dam. An engineering report in March, 1988, gave information that the tailings dam overshadowing the town of Magna had threat of collapse due to an earthquake and that the billion-ton tailings pond would bury the homes nearby if the tailing pond’s embankment failed. The mine responded by proposing various potential strategies including buying up entire subdivisions near the tailings pond, calculating the company’s liability if the embankment failed, investing $500 million to reinforce the embankment, and colluding with state regulators to keep the engineering report out of the public eye.[42]

Starting in the beginning of 1990s, dust emissions from mining began polluting surrounding areas, caused by an area near the mine where PM10 levels (particulate matter larger than 10 µg/m³) began to rise from 28μg/m³ to 50μg/m³, posing a severe health concerns for residents. The first report of PM10 rising was proposed by Schwartz and Dockery in 1992. Then, in 1997, Carter (a professor at Brigham Young University) put forward that the mine discharge of PM10 has caused lung damage to neighboring residents.
In 1995, due to scientific research showing that mining had caused the pollution of groundwater, Utah passed laws to make Kennecott companies pay $37 million to control water pollution.
As a result of mine discharge sewage containing large amounts of arsenic and selenium – selenium being particularly toxic to birds, fish and amphibians – about 30% of the fish population were killed in the early 1990s. In 1995 Kennecott, EPA and the State of Utah signed an agreement saying that Kennecott will continue to clean up the discharge sewage.[43]
2000–2014[edit]
From 2000 through 2011 the Bingham Canyon copper mine has had numerous chemical spills.[44]

The EPA has estimated a 72-mile plume of contaminated groundwater has been created over the course of the mine due to multiple spills and runoff. Long-term effects of the underground water supply contamination may include an increased demand for surface water solutions as the population of the Salt Lake valley grows since the county will not be able to tap into the groundwater supply.[44]
In 2007, Kennecott Utah Copper LLC was considering expanding its land holdings to Rose Canyon Ranch in the southern Oquirrh mountains and Yellow Fork Canyon land in Salt Lake County. Kennecott claims rights to file a mining claim in accordance with the Stock-Raising Homestead Act of 1916.[45]
In 2008, the United States Department of Interior Fish and Wildlife Service sued Kennecott after the release of hazardous substances including selenium, copper, arsenic, zinc, lead, and cadmium. A federal biologist claimed that these chemicals have caused great damage to the ecosystems and resources that support the migrant bird populations, as well as other fish and wildlife habitats.[41]
In the northern zone near Magna, Utah, the extensive southern tailings pond has been collecting the tailings since the mine first started mining production. Kennecott Utah Copper LLC has requested permission for a Tailings Expansion Project (TEP) to expand the tailings pond impoundment in Magna, which is already at 1.8 billion ton capacity,[42] and to expand on 721 new acres of wetlands south of the Great Salt Lake. The company has come under scrutiny for the instability of the structure. The Salt Lake Tribune published a report in 2007 revealing that the company failed to disclose information on possible damages that could occur if the tailings pond collapsed in the event of a major earthquake. From 2001 through 2009 there have been six earthquakes ranging from 2.3 to 3.4 in magnitude with an average epicenter only 3 miles away from Magna.[46]
In popular culture[edit]
Bingham Canyon Mine was featured in the 1973 made-for-TV movie Birds of Prey, with protagonist helicopter pilot Harry Walker (played by David Janssen) piloting his Hughes 500 into the crater to track down three bank robbers and their female hostage in an Aérospatiale SA 315B Lama, which was hiding behind heavy mining machinery. It was also featured prominently in The Fundamentals of Caring.

The Bingham Canyon Mine, more commonly known as Kennecott Copper Mine among locals,[3] is an open-pit mining operation extracting a large porphyry copper deposit southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah, in the Oquirrh Mountains. The mine is the largest man-made excavation in the world[4] and is considered to have produced more copper than any other mine in history – more than 19 million tonnes.[5] The mine is owned by Rio Tinto Group, a British-Australian multinational corporation. The copper operations at Bingham Canyon Mine are managed through Kennecott Utah Copper Corporation which operates the mine, a concentrator plant, a smelter, and a refinery. The mine has been in production since 1906, and has resulted in the creation of a pit over 0.6 miles (970 m) deep, 2.5 miles (4 km) wide, and covering 1,900 acres (770 ha). It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1966 under the name Bingham Canyon Open Pit Copper Mine.[2] The mine experienced a massive landslide in April 2013 and a smaller slide in September 2013.[6]

History[edit]
Minerals, in the form of copper ore, were first discovered in Bingham Canyon in 1848 by two brothers, Sanford and Thomas Bingham, sons of Erastus Bingham, Mormon pioneers of September 1847, who grazed their cattle there. They reported their find to their leader, Brigham Young, who advised against pursuing mining operations because the survival and establishment of settlements was of paramount importance at that time. The brothers applied themselves to that purpose as directed and did not stake a claim. In 1850, the Bingham family went to settle what is now Weber County, leaving the canyon still today known by their name.[7][8]




Bingham Canyon Mine, November 1942. Carr Fork Canyon as seen from "G" bridge.


It was not until 17 Sept. 1863 that extraction of ore began and the potential of the canyon's mineral resources began to be widely recognized. That was when George B. Ogilvie and 23 others "located the West Jordan claim", soon followed by the Vidette claim. At first, mining was confined to placer gold, lead-silver and copper-gold. Porphyry copper required processing and a railroad, which reached the canyon in 1873.[9]:61–62[10]
Enos Andrew Wall started working claims in 1887. His extensive tunnels and test pits, on his 200 acres, indicated ore containing 2% copper.[9]:38,64–65
The canyon's 19th Century mines were relatively small, and it wasn't until the end of the century that very large-scale exploitation of the canyon's ore bodies began to develop with open-pit mining. In 1896, Samuel Newhouse and Thomas Weir acquired the Highland Boy Mine, which was rich in copper, silver and gold. Together they formed the Utah Consolidated Gold Mines, Ltd. with English investors. They then formed the Boston Consolidated Gold and Copper Co., Ltd., for development of low-grade copper ore adjacent to the Utah Copper Company site.[9]:93–94
Another significant development took place in 1903, when Daniel C. Jackling and Enos A. Wall organized the Utah Copper Company. Utah Copper immediately began construction of a pilot mill at Copperton,[9] just beyond the mouth of the canyon, and the company actually started mining in 1906.[10]
The success of Utah Copper in mining the huge but low-grade porphyry copper type ore body at Bingham Canyon was based on Jacklin's 1904 decision to use open-pit mining, steam shovels and the railroad. The mine became a showplace for "railroad-pit operations" and the industrial complex defined by the mine and the ASARCO smelting operation made it the "largest industrial mining complex in the world" by 1912.[9]:168–170
Utah Copper and Boston Consolidated merged after their separate surface operations approached each other in 1906. The Kennecott Copper Corporation, established to operate mines in Kennecott, Alaska, purchased a 25 percent financial interest in Utah Copper in 1915, which they increased to 75 percent in 1923.[9]:82,151
Bingham's Canyon mine expanded rapidly, and by the 1920s the region was a beehive of activity. Some 15,000 people of widely varying ethnicity lived in the canyon, in large residential communities constructed on the steep canyon walls. The population declined rapidly as mining techniques improved, and several of the mining camps were swallowed up by the ever-expanding mine. By 1980, when Lark was dismantled, only Copperton, at the mouth of Bingham Canyon and with a population of 800, remained.
The 21 separate mining operations in existence by 1911 were consolidated into two in 1970: Kennecott and The Anaconda Minerals Company. In 1985 open-pit mining operations were halted by Kennecott's Utah Copper. In 1986, Kennecott discovered gold in nearby Barney's Canyon.[10]
KCC was purchased by Sohio in 1981 and the mine reopened in 1987 after BP Minerals purchased the assets. In 1989 the Rio Tinto Group acquired the asset, who modernized the mine, mill and smelter.[9]:9
The open-pit owners replaced an antiquated 1000-car railroad with conveyor belts and pipelines for transporting the ore and waste, which reduced costs by nearly 30% and returned the operation to profitability.[11]

At 9:30 pm on April 10, 2013, a landslide occurred at the mine. It was the largest non-volcanic landslide in the history of North America. Around 65–70 million cubic meters (2.3×10^9–2.5×10^9 cu ft) of dirt and rock thundered down the side of the pit.[12] Understanding that the mine's steep walls made it a high risk for landslides, an interferometric radar system had been installed to monitor the ground's stability. As a result of warnings produced by this system, mining operations were shut down the previous day in anticipation of the slide. There were no injuries.[13] The massive slide is expected to cut production of mined copper by 100,000 tonnes (110,000 short tons).[14] A second slide caused an evacuation of 100 workers on September 11, 2013.[15]
Environmental history[edit]
According to environmental specialists, the mine has had adverse environmental effects on the habitats of fish and wild animals as well as air and water pollution, creating health hazards to the surrounding public.[16] Different federal agencies concerned with environmental conservation have used strict legal rules to pressure the subsidiary of Kennecott copper mine to comply with environmental regulations. Since the early 1990s, Kennecott has spent more than $400 million on clean up efforts on the affected areas to avoid regulatory laws that would have placed them on the Superfund National Priorities List (NPL).[17]

Geology[edit]

The Bingham Canyon ore deposits occur in the Bingham nappe. They are a porphyry copper deposit, formed by a quartz monzonite porphyry intruded into sedimentary rocks. They exhibit a concentric alteration pattern and mineralogic zonation around the Bingham stock. These zones include a central core containing magnetite, followed by "a molybdenite zone low in copper, a bornite-chalcopyrite-gold higher grade copper zone, a pyrite-chalcopyrite zone, a pyrite zone, and an outermost lead-zinc zone."[10]:E1,E8
Structurally, Late Paleozoic rocks were thrust faulted over the Precambrian craton during the Cretaceous Sevier orogeny. These rocks were later intruded and altered in the Tertiary by granitoid rocks. This igneous event was the source of deposition of gold, silver and other base metals.[10]:E4
Copper and molybdenum sulfide minerals are dispersed in the intruded stock and in the adjoining carbonate sedimentary skarns. The main stratigraphic rocks in Bingham Canyon are Upper Pennsylvanian sandstones, quartzites, and limestones known as the Bingham Mine Formation in the Oquirrh Group. The central porphyry ores formed from mantle hydrothermal circulation while the outer vein and deposits in the sedimentary rocks formed at lower temperature when magmatic and meteoric waters mixed.[10]
Recovery process[edit]
The extracted ore is treated at the Kennecott smelter at nearby Magna, Utah. The ore is run through a concentrator, where huge grinding mills reduce it to the consistency of face powder.[19] Flotation then separates the gangue from the metalliferous particles, which float off as a 28-percent concentrate of copper along with lesser amounts of silver, gold, lead, molybdenum, platinum and palladium. A selective flotation step separates the molybdenite (molybdenum disulfide) from the chalcopyrite.
The filtered concentrate slurry is piped 17 miles (27 km) to the smelter, where it is dried, and then injected along with oxygen into a flash smelting furnace to oxidize the iron and sulfur. The oxidized iron is skimmed off, while the sulfur dioxide gas is captured and sent to an on-site acid plant for conversion to valuable sulfuric acid - a million tons of it each year.
Left behind is a molten copper sulfide called matte. The 70-percent-copper matte is water-quenched to form a sand-like solid, then injected, with oxygen, into a flash-converting furnace that produces molten, 98.6-percent-pure copper. This copper is then cast into 700-pound (320 kg) anode plates and shipped by rail to the refinery.
At the refinery, the anode plates are pressed flat and interleaved with stainless steel cathode blanks. Automated robotic vehicles place the prepared anodes in cells containing an acidic electrolyte. When the cells are electrified, the anodes slowly dissolve, freeing copper ions that are deposited on the cathode as 99.99-percent-pure copper.
Impurities and precious metals settle to the bottom of the electrolytic cells as anode slimes. A chlorination leaching process recovers the gold and silver, which is melted in induction furnaces.
Operations[edit]




Utah Copper Co. Mill, Bingham Canyon, circa 1910


Kennecott’s Bingham Canyon Mine is the largest man-made excavation in the world, and is visible to the naked eye from an orbiting space shuttle.[20][21][22] Employing some 2,000 laborers, 450,000 short tons (400,000 long tons; 410,000 t) of material are removed from the mine daily. Electric shovels can carry up to 56 cubic yards (43 m3) or 98 short tons (88 long tons; 89 t) of ore in a single scoop. Ore is loaded into a fleet of 64 large dump trucks which each carry 255 short tons (228 long tons; 231 t) of ore at a time; the trucks themselves cost about $3 million each. There is a five-mile (8 km) series of conveyors that take ore to the Copperton concentrator and flotation plant. The longest conveyor is 3 miles (4.8 km) long.[23]
As of 2010, Kennecott Utah Copper was the second largest copper producer in the US, and provided about 13-18% percent of the U.S.'s copper needs.[20][21] It is one of the top producing copper mines in the world with production at more than 18.7 million short tons (16.7 million long tons; 17.0 Mt). Every year, Kennecott produces approximately 300 thousand short tons (272 kt or 268 thousand long tons) of copper, along with 400 thousand troy ounces (13.7 short tons 12.4 tonnes, or 12.2 long tons) of gold, 4 million troy ounces (124 tonnes, 137 short tons or 122 long tons) of silver, about 10 thousand short tons (9,100 tonnes or 8,900 long tons) of molybdenum,[20] and about a million short tons (910 kt or 890 thousand long tons) of sulfuric acid, a by-product of the smelting process.[22] Rio Tinto purchased Kennecott Utah Copper in 1989 and has invested about $2 billion in the modernization of KUC’s operations.
The current mine plan will expire in 2019. Rio Tinto has been studying a plan to extend the open pit 1,000 feet (305 m) southward, which would extend the life of the mine into the mid-2030s. The plan has been contingent on approval by the Rio Tinto board of directors and approximately 25 required environmental permits.[24]
Production[edit]
Bingham Canyon has proven to be one of the world's most productive mines. As of 2004, its ore yielded more than 17 million tons (15.4 Mt) of copper, 23 million ounces (715 t) of gold, 190 million ounces (5,900 t) of silver, and 850 million pounds (386 kt) of molybdenum. The value of the resources extracted from the Bingham Canyon Mine is greater than the Comstock Lode, Klondike, and California gold rush mining regions combined. Mines in Chile, Indonesia, Arizona, and New Mexico now[when?] exceed Bingham Canyon's annual production rate. High molybdenum prices in 2005 made the molybdenum produced at Bingham Canyon in that year worth more than the copper.[25] The value of metals produced in 2006 at Bingham Canyon was US$1.8 billion.[26]
Environmental impact[edit]
In 1990, homes that had been built on former flood plains were discovered to be contaminated with high levels of lead and arsenic.[27] Activities to clean up 100 years of accumulated impacts began in the 1990s, under state Utah Department of Environmental Quality and federal oversight and are ongoing.[28]
The EPA lists "Kennecott South Zone/Bingham" on its superfund webpage, because it was proposed to be listed as a superfund site in 1994. The South Zone includes the Bingham Mining District in the Oquirrh Mountains, about 25 miles southwest of Salt Lake City, the open pit, waste rock dumps, Copperton Mill and other historic sites. The company avoided regulatory issues of being on the NPL by voluntarily cleaning up the contaminated lands, the so-called Superfund Alternative Approach. The listing proposal was withdrawn in 2008.[29][30] More than 25 million tons of mining wastes have been removed, sludge with elevated sulfate concentrations was consolidated and capped on site.[citation needed]
1900–1909[edit]
By 1904, there were three large copper smelters and one lead smelter in the Salt Lake valley. The sulfur dioxide gas emissions from the smokestacks caused significant crop damage to neighboring crops. During the 1904-1905 winter, the farmers gathered together and decided to file suit against the smelters in the United States District Court of Utah.[31] In 1906, Federal Court Judge Marshall ruled that the smelters could not smelt ores containing more than 10% sulfur,[32] effectively closing all of the aforementioned smelters.

1910–1979[edit]
Kennecott Copper Mines was formed in 1910 after a merger of Utah Copper and Kennecott copper mining companies.[33] By 1912, environmental protection organizations were complaining about high levels of asbestos being used in the organization. Kennecott Corporation was using asbestos for preventing fires since copper processing requires very high temperatures.[34] Copper has a very high boiling point and also requires use of other chemicals to separate it from other metals and impurities present in the ore. Asbestos has microscopic particles that dispersed into the atmosphere and contributed to illnesses among workers and individuals living near the mines. Asbestos is responsible for illnesses such as pleural fibrosis, skin warts and lung cancer.[34][35]
Kennecott Corporation was also cited as contributing to emissions of heavy metals such as arsenic and mercury.[36] By 1940, arsenic and mercury were also some of the concerns that were raised by environmental protection agencies against Kennecott Corporation.[37] Both mercury and arsenic are dangerous to health in large quantities.[33][38]

Investigations in the 1980s revealed contamination in the groundwater caused by mining operations the release of hazardous materials. The State of Utah proceeded with legal action against Kennecott and filed a damage claim against the mine in October, 1986, for the loss and destruction of the natural resources, specifically the groundwater.[40][41]
There was also a threat due to the tailings dam. An engineering report in March, 1988, gave information that the tailings dam overshadowing the town of Magna had threat of collapse due to an earthquake and that the billion-ton tailings pond would bury the homes nearby if the tailing pond’s embankment failed. The mine responded by proposing various potential strategies including buying up entire subdivisions near the tailings pond, calculating the company’s liability if the embankment failed, investing $500 million to reinforce the embankment, and colluding with state regulators to keep the engineering report out of the public eye.[42]

Starting in the beginning of 1990s, dust emissions from mining began polluting surrounding areas, caused by an area near the mine where PM10 levels (particulate matter larger than 10 µg/m³) began to rise from 28μg/m³ to 50μg/m³, posing a severe health concerns for residents. The first report of PM10 rising was proposed by Schwartz and Dockery in 1992. Then, in 1997, Carter (a professor at Brigham Young University) put forward that the mine discharge of PM10 has caused lung damage to neighboring residents.
In 1995, due to scientific research showing that mining had caused the pollution of groundwater, Utah passed laws to make Kennecott companies pay $37 million to control water pollution.
As a result of mine discharge sewage containing large amounts of arsenic and selenium – selenium being particularly toxic to birds, fish and amphibians – about 30% of the fish population were killed in the early 1990s. In 1995 Kennecott, EPA and the State of Utah signed an agreement saying that Kennecott will continue to clean up the discharge sewage.[43]
2000–2014[edit]
From 2000 through 2011 the Bingham Canyon copper mine has had numerous chemical spills.[44]

The EPA has estimated a 72-mile plume of contaminated groundwater has been created over the course of the mine due to multiple spills and runoff. Long-term effects of the underground water supply contamination may include an increased demand for surface water solutions as the population of the Salt Lake valley grows since the county will not be able to tap into the groundwater supply.[44]
In 2007, Kennecott Utah Copper LLC was considering expanding its land holdings to Rose Canyon Ranch in the southern Oquirrh mountains and Yellow Fork Canyon land in Salt Lake County. Kennecott claims rights to file a mining claim in accordance with the Stock-Raising Homestead Act of 1916.[45]
In 2008, the United States Department of Interior Fish and Wildlife Service sued Kennecott after the release of hazardous substances including selenium, copper, arsenic, zinc, lead, and cadmium. A federal biologist claimed that these chemicals have caused great damage to the ecosystems and resources that support the migrant bird populations, as well as other fish and wildlife habitats.[41]
In the northern zone near Magna, Utah, the extensive southern tailings pond has been collecting the tailings since the mine first started mining production. Kennecott Utah Copper LLC has requested permission for a Tailings Expansion Project (TEP) to expand the tailings pond impoundment in Magna, which is already at 1.8 billion ton capacity,[42] and to expand on 721 new acres of wetlands south of the Great Salt Lake. The company has come under scrutiny for the instability of the structure. The Salt Lake Tribune published a report in 2007 revealing that the company failed to disclose information on possible damages that could occur if the tailings pond collapsed in the event of a major earthquake. From 2001 through 2009 there have been six earthquakes ranging from 2.3 to 3.4 in magnitude with an average epicenter only 3 miles away from Magna.[46]
In popular culture[edit]
Bingham Canyon Mine was featured in the 1973 made-for-TV movie Birds of Prey, with protagonist helicopter pilot Harry Walker (played by David Janssen) piloting his Hughes 500 into the crater to track down three bank robbers and their female hostage in an Aérospatiale SA 315B Lama, which was hiding behind heavy mining machinery. It was also featured prominently in The Fundamentals of Caring.

The Bingham Canyon Mine, more commonly known as Kennecott Copper Mine among locals,[3] is an open-pit mining operation extracting a large porphyry copper deposit southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah, in the Oquirrh Mountains. The mine is the largest man-made excavation in the world[4] and is considered to have produced more copper than any other mine in history – more than 19 million tonnes.[5] The mine is owned by Rio Tinto Group, a British-Australian multinational corporation. The copper operations at Bingham Canyon Mine are managed through Kennecott Utah Copper Corporation which operates the mine, a concentrator plant, a smelter, and a refinery. The mine has been in production since 1906, and has resulted in the creation of a pit over 0.6 miles (970 m) deep, 2.5 miles (4 km) wide, and covering 1,900 acres (770 ha). It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1966 under the name Bingham Canyon Open Pit Copper Mine.[2] The mine experienced a massive landslide in April 2013 and a smaller slide in September 2013.[6]

History[edit]
Minerals, in the form of copper ore, were first discovered in Bingham Canyon in 1848 by two brothers, Sanford and Thomas Bingham, sons of Erastus Bingham, Mormon pioneers of September 1847, who grazed their cattle there. They reported their find to their leader, Brigham Young, who advised against pursuing mining operations because the survival and establishment of settlements was of paramount importance at that time. The brothers applied themselves to that purpose as directed and did not stake a claim. In 1850, the Bingham family went to settle what is now Weber County, leaving the canyon still today known by their name.[7][8]

It was not until 17 Sept. 1863 that extraction of ore began and the potential of the canyon's mineral resources began to be widely recognized. That was when George B. Ogilvie and 23 others "located the West Jordan claim", soon followed by the Vidette claim. At first, mining was confined to placer gold, lead-silver and copper-gold. Porphyry copper required processing and a railroad, which reached the canyon in 1873.[9]:61–62[10]
Enos Andrew Wall started working claims in 1887. His extensive tunnels and test pits, on his 200 acres, indicated ore containing 2% copper.[9]:38,64–65
The canyon's 19th Century mines were relatively small, and it wasn't until the end of the century that very large-scale exploitation of the canyon's ore bodies began to develop with open-pit mining. In 1896, Samuel Newhouse and Thomas Weir acquired the Highland Boy Mine, which was rich in copper, silver and gold. Together they formed the Utah Consolidated Gold Mines, Ltd. with English investors. They then formed the Boston Consolidated Gold and Copper Co., Ltd., for development of low-grade copper ore adjacent to the Utah Copper Company site.[9]:93–94
Another significant development took place in 1903, when Daniel C. Jackling and Enos A. Wall organized the Utah Copper Company. Utah Copper immediately began construction of a pilot mill at Copperton,[9] just beyond the mouth of the canyon, and the company actually started mining in 1906.[10]
The success of Utah Copper in mining the huge but low-grade porphyry copper type ore body at Bingham Canyon was based on Jacklin's 1904 decision to use open-pit mining, steam shovels and the railroad. The mine became a showplace for "railroad-pit operations" and the industrial complex defined by the mine and the ASARCO smelting operation made it the "largest industrial mining complex in the world" by 1912.[9]:168–170
Utah Copper and Boston Consolidated merged after their separate surface operations approached each other in 1906. The Kennecott Copper Corporation, established to operate mines in Kennecott, Alaska, purchased a 25 percent financial interest in Utah Copper in 1915, which they increased to 75 percent in 1923.[9]:82,151
Bingham's Canyon mine expanded rapidly, and by the 1920s the region was a beehive of activity. Some 15,000 people of widely varying ethnicity lived in the canyon, in large residential communities constructed on the steep canyon walls. The population declined rapidly as mining techniques improved, and several of the mining camps were swallowed up by the ever-expanding mine. By 1980, when Lark was dismantled, only Copperton, at the mouth of Bingham Canyon and with a population of 800, remained.
The 21 separate mining operations in existence by 1911 were consolidated into two in 1970: Kennecott and The Anaconda Minerals Company. In 1985 open-pit mining operations were halted by Kennecott's Utah Copper. In 1986, Kennecott discovered gold in nearby Barney's Canyon.[10]
KCC was purchased by Sohio in 1981 and the mine reopened in 1987 after BP Minerals purchased the assets. In 1989 the Rio Tinto Group acquired the asset, who modernized the mine, mill and smelter.[9]:9
The open-pit owners replaced an antiquated 1000-car railroad with conveyor belts and pipelines for transporting the ore and waste, which reduced costs by nearly 30% and returned the operation to profitability.[11]
Landslides[edit]

At 9:30 pm on April 10, 2013, a landslide occurred at the mine. It was the largest non-volcanic landslide in the history of North America. Around 65–70 million cubic meters (2.3×10^9–2.5×10^9 cu ft) of dirt and rock thundered down the side of the pit.[12] Understanding that the mine's steep walls made it a high risk for landslides, an interferometric radar system had been installed to monitor the ground's stability. As a result of warnings produced by this system, mining operations were shut down the previous day in anticipation of the slide. There were no injuries.[13] The massive slide is expected to cut production of mined copper by 100,000 tonnes (110,000 short tons).[14] A second slide caused an evacuation of 100 workers on September 11, 2013.[15]
Environmental history[edit]
According to environmental specialists, the mine has had adverse environmental effects on the habitats of fish and wild animals as well as air and water pollution, creating health hazards to the surrounding public.[16] Different federal agencies concerned with environmental conservation have used strict legal rules to pressure the subsidiary of Kennecott copper mine to comply with environmental regulations. Since the early 1990s, Kennecott has spent more than $400 million on clean up efforts on the affected areas to avoid regulatory laws that would have placed them on the Superfund National Priorities List (NPL).[17]

Geology[edit]

Geologic map showing bedrock geology and alteration zones, USGS.


The Bingham Canyon ore deposits occur in the Bingham nappe. They are a porphyry copper deposit, formed by a quartz monzonite porphyry intruded into sedimentary rocks. They exhibit a concentric alteration pattern and mineralogic zonation around the Bingham stock. These zones include a central core containing magnetite, followed by "a molybdenite zone low in copper, a bornite-chalcopyrite-gold higher grade copper zone, a pyrite-chalcopyrite zone, a pyrite zone, and an outermost lead-zinc zone."[10]:E1,E8
Structurally, Late Paleozoic rocks were thrust faulted over the Precambrian craton during the Cretaceous Sevier orogeny. These rocks were later intruded and altered in the Tertiary by granitoid rocks. This igneous event was the source of deposition of gold, silver and other base metals.[10]:E4
Copper and molybdenum sulfide minerals are dispersed in the intruded stock and in the adjoining carbonate sedimentary skarns. The main stratigraphic rocks in Bingham Canyon are Upper Pennsylvanian sandstones, quartzites, and limestones known as the Bingham Mine Formation in the Oquirrh Group. The central porphyry ores formed from mantle hydrothermal circulation while the outer vein and deposits in the sedimentary rocks formed at lower temperature when magmatic and meteoric waters mixed.[10]
Recovery process[edit]
The extracted ore is treated at the Kennecott smelter at nearby Magna, Utah. The ore is run through a concentrator, where huge grinding mills reduce it to the consistency of face powder.[19] Flotation then separates the gangue from the metalliferous particles, which float off as a 28-percent concentrate of copper along with lesser amounts of silver, gold, lead, molybdenum, platinum and palladium. A selective flotation step separates the molybdenite (molybdenum disulfide) from the chalcopyrite.
The filtered concentrate slurry is piped 17 miles (27 km) to the smelter, where it is dried, and then injected along with oxygen into a flash smelting furnace to oxidize the iron and sulfur. The oxidized iron is skimmed off, while the sulfur dioxide gas is captured and sent to an on-site acid plant for conversion to valuable sulfuric acid - a million tons of it each year.
Left behind is a molten copper sulfide called matte. The 70-percent-copper matte is water-quenched to form a sand-like solid, then injected, with oxygen, into a flash-converting furnace that produces molten, 98.6-percent-pure copper. This copper is then cast into 700-pound (320 kg) anode plates and shipped by rail to the refinery.
At the refinery, the anode plates are pressed flat and interleaved with stainless steel cathode blanks. Automated robotic vehicles place the prepared anodes in cells containing an acidic electrolyte. When the cells are electrified, the anodes slowly dissolve, freeing copper ions that are deposited on the cathode as 99.99-percent-pure copper.
Impurities and precious metals settle to the bottom of the electrolytic cells as anode slimes. A chlorination leaching process recovers the gold and silver, which is melted in induction furnaces.
Operations[edit]




Utah Copper Co. Mill, Bingham Canyon, circa 1910


Kennecott’s Bingham Canyon Mine is the largest man-made excavation in the world, and is visible to the naked eye from an orbiting space shuttle.[20][21][22] Employing some 2,000 laborers, 450,000 short tons (400,000 long tons; 410,000 t) of material are removed from the mine daily. Electric shovels can carry up to 56 cubic yards (43 m3) or 98 short tons (88 long tons; 89 t) of ore in a single scoop. Ore is loaded into a fleet of 64 large dump trucks which each carry 255 short tons (228 long tons; 231 t) of ore at a time; the trucks themselves cost about $3 million each. There is a five-mile (8 km) series of conveyors that take ore to the Copperton concentrator and flotation plant. The longest conveyor is 3 miles (4.8 km) long.[23]
As of 2010, Kennecott Utah Copper was the second largest copper producer in the US, and provided about 13-18% percent of the U.S.'s copper needs.[20][21] It is one of the top producing copper mines in the world with production at more than 18.7 million short tons (16.7 million long tons; 17.0 Mt). Every year, Kennecott produces approximately 300 thousand short tons (272 kt or 268 thousand long tons) of copper, along with 400 thousand troy ounces (13.7 short tons 12.4 tonnes, or 12.2 long tons) of gold, 4 million troy ounces (124 tonnes, 137 short tons or 122 long tons) of silver, about 10 thousand short tons (9,100 tonnes or 8,900 long tons) of molybdenum,[20] and about a million short tons (910 kt or 890 thousand long tons) of sulfuric acid, a by-product of the smelting process.[22] Rio Tinto purchased Kennecott Utah Copper in 1989 and has invested about $2 billion in the modernization of KUC’s operations.
The current mine plan will expire in 2019. Rio Tinto has been studying a plan to extend the open pit 1,000 feet (305 m) southward, which would extend the life of the mine into the mid-2030s. The plan has been contingent on approval by the Rio Tinto board of directors and approximately 25 required environmental permits.[24]
Production[edit]
Bingham Canyon has proven to be one of the world's most productive mines. As of 2004, its ore yielded more than 17 million tons (15.4 Mt) of copper, 23 million ounces (715 t) of gold, 190 million ounces (5,900 t) of silver, and 850 million pounds (386 kt) of molybdenum. The value of the resources extracted from the Bingham Canyon Mine is greater than the Comstock Lode, Klondike, and California gold rush mining regions combined. Mines in Chile, Indonesia, Arizona, and New Mexico now[when?] exceed Bingham Canyon's annual production rate. High molybdenum prices in 2005 made the molybdenum produced at Bingham Canyon in that year worth more than the copper.[25] The value of metals produced in 2006 at Bingham Canyon was US$1.8 billion.[26]
Environmental impact[edit]
In 1990, homes that had been built on former flood plains were discovered to be contaminated with high levels of lead and arsenic.[27] Activities to clean up 100 years of accumulated impacts began in the 1990s, under state Utah Department of Environmental Quality and federal oversight and are ongoing.[28]
The EPA lists "Kennecott South Zone/Bingham" on its superfund webpage, because it was proposed to be listed as a superfund site in 1994. The South Zone includes the Bingham Mining District in the Oquirrh Mountains, about 25 miles southwest of Salt Lake City, the open pit, waste rock dumps, Copperton Mill and other historic sites. The company avoided regulatory issues of being on the NPL by voluntarily cleaning up the contaminated lands, the so-called Superfund Alternative Approach. The listing proposal was withdrawn in 2008.[29][30] More than 25 million tons of mining wastes have been removed, sludge with elevated sulfate concentrations was consolidated and capped on site.[citation needed]
1900–1909[edit]
By 1904, there were three large copper smelters and one lead smelter in the Salt Lake valley. The sulfur dioxide gas emissions from the smokestacks caused significant crop damage to neighboring crops. During the 1904-1905 winter, the farmers gathered together and decided to file suit against the smelters in the United States District Court of Utah.[31] In 1906, Federal Court Judge Marshall ruled that the smelters could not smelt ores containing more than 10% sulfur,[32] effectively closing all of the aforementioned smelters.

1910–1979[edit]
Kennecott Copper Mines was formed in 1910 after a merger of Utah Copper and Kennecott copper mining companies.[33] By 1912, environmental protection organizations were complaining about high levels of asbestos being used in the organization. Kennecott Corporation was using asbestos for preventing fires since copper processing requires very high temperatures.[34] Copper has a very high boiling point and also requires use of other chemicals to separate it from other metals and impurities present in the ore. Asbestos has microscopic particles that dispersed into the atmosphere and contributed to illnesses among workers and individuals living near the mines. Asbestos is responsible for illnesses such as pleural fibrosis, skin warts and lung cancer.[34][35]
Kennecott Corporation was also cited as contributing to emissions of heavy metals such as arsenic and mercury.[36] By 1940, arsenic and mercury were also some of the concerns that were raised by environmental protection agencies against Kennecott Corporation.[37] Both mercury and arsenic are dangerous to health in large quantities.[33][38]

Investigations in the 1980s revealed contamination in the groundwater caused by mining operations the release of hazardous materials. The State of Utah proceeded with legal action against Kennecott and filed a damage claim against the mine in October, 1986, for the loss and destruction of the natural resources, specifically the groundwater.[40][41]
There was also a threat due to the tailings dam. An engineering report in March, 1988, gave information that the tailings dam overshadowing the town of Magna had threat of collapse due to an earthquake and that the billion-ton tailings pond would bury the homes nearby if the tailing pond’s embankment failed. The mine responded by proposing various potential strategies including buying up entire subdivisions near the tailings pond, calculating the company’s liability if the embankment failed, investing $500 million to reinforce the embankment, and colluding with state regulators to keep the engineering report out of the public eye.[42]

Starting in the beginning of 1990s, dust emissions from mining began polluting surrounding areas, caused by an area near the mine where PM10 levels (particulate matter larger than 10 µg/m³) began to rise from 28μg/m³ to 50μg/m³, posing a severe health concerns for residents. The first report of PM10 rising was proposed by Schwartz and Dockery in 1992. Then, in 1997, Carter (a professor at Brigham Young University) put forward that the mine discharge of PM10 has caused lung damage to neighboring residents.
In 1995, due to scientific research showing that mining had caused the pollution of groundwater, Utah passed laws to make Kennecott companies pay $37 million to control water pollution.
As a result of mine discharge sewage containing large amounts of arsenic and selenium – selenium being particularly toxic to birds, fish and amphibians – about 30% of the fish population were killed in the early 1990s. In 1995 Kennecott, EPA and the State of Utah signed an agreement saying that Kennecott will continue to clean up the discharge sewage.[43]

The EPA has estimated a 72-mile plume of contaminated groundwater has been created over the course of the mine due to multiple spills and runoff. Long-term effects of the underground water supply contamination may include an increased demand for surface water solutions as the population of the Salt Lake valley grows since the county will not be able to tap into the groundwater supply.[44]
In 2007, Kennecott Utah Copper LLC was considering expanding its land holdings to Rose Canyon Ranch in the southern Oquirrh mountains and Yellow Fork Canyon land in Salt Lake County. Kennecott claims rights to file a mining claim in accordance with the Stock-Raising Homestead Act of 1916.[45]
In 2008, the United States Department of Interior Fish and Wildlife Service sued Kennecott after the release of hazardous substances including selenium, copper, arsenic, zinc, lead, and cadmium. A federal biologist claimed that these chemicals have caused great damage to the ecosystems and resources that support the migrant bird populations, as well as other fish and wildlife habitats.[41]
In the northern zone near Magna, Utah, the extensive southern tailings pond has been collecting the tailings since the mine first started mining production. Kennecott Utah Copper LLC has requested permission for a Tailings Expansion Project (TEP) to expand the tailings pond impoundment in Magna, which is already at 1.8 billion ton capacity,[42] and to expand on 721 new acres of wetlands south of the Great Salt Lake. The company has come under scrutiny for the instability of the structure. The Salt Lake Tribune published a report in 2007 revealing that the company failed to disclose information on possible damages that could occur if the tailings pond collapsed in the event of a major earthquake. From 2001 through 2009 there have been six earthquakes ranging from 2.3 to 3.4 in magnitude with an average epicenter only 3 miles away from Magna.[46]
In popular culture[edit]
Bingham Canyon Mine was featured in the 1973 made-for-TV movie Birds of Prey, with protagonist helicopter pilot Harry Walker (played by David Janssen) piloting his Hughes 500 into the crater to track down three bank robbers and their female hostage in an Aérospatiale SA 315B Lama, which was hiding behind heavy mining machinery. It was also featured prominently in The Fundamentals of Caring.

The Bingham Canyon Mine, more commonly known as Kennecott Copper Mine among locals,[3] is an open-pit mining operation extracting a large porphyry copper deposit southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah, in the Oquirrh Mountains. The mine is the largest man-made excavation in the world[4] and is considered to have produced more copper than any other mine in history – more than 19 million tonnes.[5] The mine is owned by Rio Tinto Group, a British-Australian multinational corporation. The copper operations at Bingham Canyon Mine are managed through Kennecott Utah Copper Corporation which operates the mine, a concentrator plant, a smelter, and a refinery. The mine has been in production since 1906, and has resulted in the creation of a pit over 0.6 miles (970 m) deep, 2.5 miles (4 km) wide, and covering 1,900 acres (770 ha). It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1966 under the name Bingham Canyon Open Pit Copper Mine.[2] The mine experienced a massive landslide in April 2013 and a smaller slide in September 2013.[6]

History[edit]
Minerals, in the form of copper ore, were first discovered in Bingham Canyon in 1848 by two brothers, Sanford and Thomas Bingham, sons of Erastus Bingham, Mormon pioneers of September 1847, who grazed their cattle there. They reported their find to their leader, Brigham Young, who advised against pursuing mining operations because the survival and establishment of settlements was of paramount importance at that time. The brothers applied themselves to that purpose as directed and did not stake a claim. In 1850, the Bingham family went to settle what is now Weber County, leaving the canyon still today known by their name.[7][8]

It was not until 17 Sept. 1863 that extraction of ore began and the potential of the canyon's mineral resources began to be widely recognized. That was when George B. Ogilvie and 23 others "located the West Jordan claim", soon followed by the Vidette claim. At first, mining was confined to placer gold, lead-silver and copper-gold. Porphyry copper required processing and a railroad, which reached the canyon in 1873.[9]:61–62[10]
Enos Andrew Wall started working claims in 1887. His extensive tunnels and test pits, on his 200 acres, indicated ore containing 2% copper.[9]:38,64–65
The canyon's 19th Century mines were relatively small, and it wasn't until the end of the century that very large-scale exploitation of the canyon's ore bodies began to develop with open-pit mining. In 1896, Samuel Newhouse and Thomas Weir acquired the Highland Boy Mine, which was rich in copper, silver and gold. Together they formed the Utah Consolidated Gold Mines, Ltd. with English investors. They then formed the Boston Consolidated Gold and Copper Co., Ltd., for development of low-grade copper ore adjacent to the Utah Copper Company site.[9]:93–94
Another significant development took place in 1903, when Daniel C. Jackling and Enos A. Wall organized the Utah Copper Company. Utah Copper immediately began construction of a pilot mill at Copperton,[9] just beyond the mouth of the canyon, and the company actually started mining in 1906.[10]
The success of Utah Copper in mining the huge but low-grade porphyry copper type ore body at Bingham Canyon was based on Jacklin's 1904 decision to use open-pit mining, steam shovels and the railroad. The mine became a showplace for "railroad-pit operations" and the industrial complex defined by the mine and the ASARCO smelting operation made it the "largest industrial mining complex in the world" by 1912.[9]:168–170
Utah Copper and Boston Consolidated merged after their separate surface operations approached each other in 1906. The Kennecott Copper Corporation, established to operate mines in Kennecott, Alaska, purchased a 25 percent financial interest in Utah Copper in 1915, which they increased to 75 percent in 1923.[9]:82,151
Bingham's Canyon mine expanded rapidly, and by the 1920s the region was a beehive of activity. Some 15,000 people of widely varying ethnicity lived in the canyon, in large residential communities constructed on the steep canyon walls. The population declined rapidly as mining techniques improved, and several of the mining camps were swallowed up by the ever-expanding mine. By 1980, when Lark was dismantled, only Copperton, at the mouth of Bingham Canyon and with a population of 800, remained.
The 21 separate mining operations in existence by 1911 were consolidated into two in 1970: Kennecott and The Anaconda Minerals Company. In 1985 open-pit mining operations were halted by Kennecott's Utah Copper. In 1986, Kennecott discovered gold in nearby Barney's Canyon.[10]
KCC was purchased by Sohio in 1981 and the mine reopened in 1987 after BP Minerals purchased the assets. In 1989 the Rio Tinto Group acquired the asset, who modernized the mine, mill and smelter.[9]:9
The open-pit owners replaced an antiquated 1000-car railroad with conveyor belts and pipelines for transporting the ore and waste, which reduced costs by nearly 30% and returned the operation to profitability.[11]
Landslides[edit]

At 9:30 pm on April 10, 2013, a landslide occurred at the mine. It was the largest non-volcanic landslide in the history of North America. Around 65–70 million cubic meters (2.3×10^9–2.5×10^9 cu ft) of dirt and rock thundered down the side of the pit.[12] Understanding that the mine's steep walls made it a high risk for landslides, an interferometric radar system had been installed to monitor the ground's stability. As a result of warnings produced by this system, mining operations were shut down the previous day in anticipation of the slide. There were no injuries.[13] The massive slide is expected to cut production of mined copper by 100,000 tonnes (110,000 short tons).[14] A second slide caused an evacuation of 100 workers on September 11, 2013.[15]
Environmental history[edit]
According to environmental specialists, the mine has had adverse environmental effects on the habitats of fish and wild animals as well as air and water pollution, creating health hazards to the surrounding public.[16] Different federal agencies concerned with environmental conservation have used strict legal rules to pressure the subsidiary of Kennecott copper mine to comply with environmental regulations. Since the early 1990s, Kennecott has spent more than $400 million on clean up efforts on the affected areas to avoid regulatory laws that would have placed them on the Superfund National Priorities List (NPL).[17]

Geology[edit]

The Bingham Canyon ore deposits occur in the Bingham nappe. They are a porphyry copper deposit, formed by a quartz monzonite porphyry intruded into sedimentary rocks. They exhibit a concentric alteration pattern and mineralogic zonation around the Bingham stock. These zones include a central core containing magnetite, followed by "a molybdenite zone low in copper, a bornite-chalcopyrite-gold higher grade copper zone, a pyrite-chalcopyrite zone, a pyrite zone, and an outermost lead-zinc zone."[10]:E1,E8
Structurally, Late Paleozoic rocks were thrust faulted over the Precambrian craton during the Cretaceous Sevier orogeny. These rocks were later intruded and altered in the Tertiary by granitoid rocks. This igneous event was the source of deposition of gold, silver and other base metals.[10]:E4
Copper and molybdenum sulfide minerals are dispersed in the intruded stock and in the adjoining carbonate sedimentary skarns. The main stratigraphic rocks in Bingham Canyon are Upper Pennsylvanian sandstones, quartzites, and limestones known as the Bingham Mine Formation in the Oquirrh Group. The central porphyry ores formed from mantle hydrothermal circulation while the outer vein and deposits in the sedimentary rocks formed at lower temperature when magmatic and meteoric waters mixed.[10]
Recovery process[edit]
The extracted ore is treated at the Kennecott smelter at nearby Magna, Utah. The ore is run through a concentrator, where huge grinding mills reduce it to the consistency of face powder.[19] Flotation then separates the gangue from the metalliferous particles, which float off as a 28-percent concentrate of copper along with lesser amounts of silver, gold, lead, molybdenum, platinum and palladium. A selective flotation step separates the molybdenite (molybdenum disulfide) from the chalcopyrite.
The filtered concentrate slurry is piped 17 miles (27 km) to the smelter, where it is dried, and then injected along with oxygen into a flash smelting furnace to oxidize the iron and sulfur. The oxidized iron is skimmed off, while the sulfur dioxide gas is captured and sent to an on-site acid plant for conversion to valuable sulfuric acid - a million tons of it each year.
Left behind is a molten copper sulfide called matte. The 70-percent-copper matte is water-quenched to form a sand-like solid, then injected, with oxygen, into a flash-converting furnace that produces molten, 98.6-percent-pure copper. This copper is then cast into 700-pound (320 kg) anode plates and shipped by rail to the refinery.
At the refinery, the anode plates are pressed flat and interleaved with stainless steel cathode blanks. Automated robotic vehicles place the prepared anodes in cells containing an acidic electrolyte. When the cells are electrified, the anodes slowly dissolve, freeing copper ions that are deposited on the cathode as 99.99-percent-pure copper.
Impurities and precious metals settle to the bottom of the electrolytic cells as anode slimes. A chlorination leaching process recovers the gold and silver, which is melted in induction furnaces.
Operations[edit]




Utah Copper Co. Mill, Bingham Canyon, circa 1910


Kennecott’s Bingham Canyon Mine is the largest man-made excavation in the world, and is visible to the naked eye from an orbiting space shuttle.[20][21][22] Employing some 2,000 laborers, 450,000 short tons (400,000 long tons; 410,000 t) of material are removed from the mine daily. Electric shovels can carry up to 56 cubic yards (43 m3) or 98 short tons (88 long tons; 89 t) of ore in a single scoop. Ore is loaded into a fleet of 64 large dump trucks which each carry 255 short tons (228 long tons; 231 t) of ore at a time; the trucks themselves cost about $3 million each. There is a five-mile (8 km) series of conveyors that take ore to the Copperton concentrator and flotation plant. The longest conveyor is 3 miles (4.8 km) long.[23]
As of 2010, Kennecott Utah Copper was the second largest copper producer in the US, and provided about 13-18% percent of the U.S.'s copper needs.[20][21] It is one of the top producing copper mines in the world with production at more than 18.7 million short tons (16.7 million long tons; 17.0 Mt). Every year, Kennecott produces approximately 300 thousand short tons (272 kt or 268 thousand long tons) of copper, along with 400 thousand troy ounces (13.7 short tons 12.4 tonnes, or 12.2 long tons) of gold, 4 million troy ounces (124 tonnes, 137 short tons or 122 long tons) of silver, about 10 thousand short tons (9,100 tonnes or 8,900 long tons) of molybdenum,[20] and about a million short tons (910 kt or 890 thousand long tons) of sulfuric acid, a by-product of the smelting process.[22] Rio Tinto purchased Kennecott Utah Copper in 1989 and has invested about $2 billion in the modernization of KUC’s operations.
The current mine plan will expire in 2019. Rio Tinto has been studying a plan to extend the open pit 1,000 feet (305 m) southward, which would extend the life of the mine into the mid-2030s. The plan has been contingent on approval by the Rio Tinto board of directors and approximately 25 required environmental permits.[24]
Production[edit]
Bingham Canyon has proven to be one of the world's most productive mines. As of 2004, its ore yielded more than 17 million tons (15.4 Mt) of copper, 23 million ounces (715 t) of gold, 190 million ounces (5,900 t) of silver, and 850 million pounds (386 kt) of molybdenum. The value of the resources extracted from the Bingham Canyon Mine is greater than the Comstock Lode, Klondike, and California gold rush mining regions combined. Mines in Chile, Indonesia, Arizona, and New Mexico now[when?] exceed Bingham Canyon's annual production rate. High molybdenum prices in 2005 made the molybdenum produced at Bingham Canyon in that year worth more than the copper.[25] The value of metals produced in 2006 at Bingham Canyon was US$1.8 billion.[26]
Environmental impact[edit]
In 1990, homes that had been built on former flood plains were discovered to be contaminated with high levels of lead and arsenic.[27] Activities to clean up 100 years of accumulated impacts began in the 1990s, under state Utah Department of Environmental Quality and federal oversight and are ongoing.[28]
The EPA lists "Kennecott South Zone/Bingham" on its superfund webpage, because it was proposed to be listed as a superfund site in 1994. The South Zone includes the Bingham Mining District in the Oquirrh Mountains, about 25 miles southwest of Salt Lake City, the open pit, waste rock dumps, Copperton Mill and other historic sites. The company avoided regulatory issues of being on the NPL by voluntarily cleaning up the contaminated lands, the so-called Superfund Alternative Approach. The listing proposal was withdrawn in 2008.[29][30] More than 25 million tons of mining wastes have been removed, sludge with elevated sulfate concentrations was consolidated and capped on site.[citation needed]
1900–1909[edit]
By 1904, there were three large copper smelters and one lead smelter in the Salt Lake valley. The sulfur dioxide gas emissions from the smokestacks caused significant crop damage to neighboring crops. During the 1904-1905 winter, the farmers gathered together and decided to file suit against the smelters in the United States District Court of Utah.[31] In 1906, Federal Court Judge Marshall ruled that the smelters could not smelt ores containing more than 10% sulfur,[32] effectively closing all of the aforementioned smelters.

1910–1979[edit]
Kennecott Copper Mines was formed in 1910 after a merger of Utah Copper and Kennecott copper mining companies.[33] By 1912, environmental protection organizations were complaining about high levels of asbestos being used in the organization. Kennecott Corporation was using asbestos for preventing fires since copper processing requires very high temperatures.[34] Copper has a very high boiling point and also requires use of other chemicals to separate it from other metals and impurities present in the ore. Asbestos has microscopic particles that dispersed into the atmosphere and contributed to illnesses among workers and individuals living near the mines. Asbestos is responsible for illnesses such as pleural fibrosis, skin warts and lung cancer.[34][35]
Kennecott Corporation was also cited as contributing to emissions of heavy metals such as arsenic and mercury.[36] By 1940, arsenic and mercury were also some of the concerns that were raised by environmental protection agencies against Kennecott Corporation.[37] Both mercury and arsenic are dangerous to health in large quantities.[33][38]

Investigations in the 1980s revealed contamination in the groundwater caused by mining operations the release of hazardous materials. The State of Utah proceeded with legal action against Kennecott and filed a damage claim against the mine in October, 1986, for the loss and destruction of the natural resources, specifically the groundwater.[40][41]
There was also a threat due to the tailings dam. An engineering report in March, 1988, gave information that the tailings dam overshadowing the town of Magna had threat of collapse due to an earthquake and that the billion-ton tailings pond would bury the homes nearby if the tailing pond’s embankment failed. The mine responded by proposing various potential strategies including buying up entire subdivisions near the tailings pond, calculating the company’s liability if the embankment failed, investing $500 million to reinforce the embankment, and colluding with state regulators to keep the engineering report out of the public eye.[42]

Starting in the beginning of 1990s, dust emissions from mining began polluting surrounding areas, caused by an area near the mine where PM10 levels (particulate matter larger than 10 µg/m³) began to rise from 28μg/m³ to 50μg/m³, posing a severe health concerns for residents. The first report of PM10 rising was proposed by Schwartz and Dockery in 1992. Then, in 1997, Carter (a professor at Brigham Young University) put forward that the mine discharge of PM10 has caused lung damage to neighboring residents.
In 1995, due to scientific research showing that mining had caused the pollution of groundwater, Utah passed laws to make Kennecott companies pay $37 million to control water pollution.
As a result of mine discharge sewage containing large amounts of arsenic and selenium – selenium being particularly toxic to birds, fish and amphibians – about 30% of the fish population were killed in the early 1990s. In 1995 Kennecott, EPA and the State of Utah signed an agreement saying that Kennecott will continue to clean up the discharge sewage.[43]
2000–2014[edit]
From 2000 through 2011 the Bingham Canyon copper mine has had numerous chemical spills.[44]

The EPA has estimated a 72-mile plume of contaminated groundwater has been created over the course of the mine due to multiple spills and runoff. Long-term effects of the underground water supply contamination may include an increased demand for surface water solutions as the population of the Salt Lake valley grows since the county will not be able to tap into the groundwater supply.[44]
In 2007, Kennecott Utah Copper LLC was considering expanding its land holdings to Rose Canyon Ranch in the southern Oquirrh mountains and Yellow Fork Canyon land in Salt Lake County. Kennecott claims rights to file a mining claim in accordance with the Stock-Raising Homestead Act of 1916.[45]
In 2008, the United States Department of Interior Fish and Wildlife Service sued Kennecott after the release of hazardous substances including selenium, copper, arsenic, zinc, lead, and cadmium. A federal biologist claimed that these chemicals have caused great damage to the ecosystems and resources that support the migrant bird populations, as well as other fish and wildlife habitats.[41]
In the northern zone near Magna, Utah, the extensive southern tailings pond has been collecting the tailings since the mine first started mining production. Kennecott Utah Copper LLC has requested permission for a Tailings Expansion Project (TEP) to expand the tailings pond impoundment in Magna, which is already at 1.8 billion ton capacity,[42] and to expand on 721 new acres of wetlands south of the Great Salt Lake. The company has come under scrutiny for the instability of the structure. The Salt Lake Tribune published a report in 2007 revealing that the company failed to disclose information on possible damages that could occur if the tailings pond collapsed in the event of a major earthquake. From 2001 through 2009 there have been six earthquakes ranging from 2.3 to 3.4 in magnitude with an average epicenter only 3 miles away from Magna.[46]
In popular culture[edit]
Bingham Canyon Mine was featured in the 1973 made-for-TV movie Birds of Prey, with protagonist helicopter pilot Harry Walker (played by David Janssen) piloting his Hughes 500 into the crater to track down three bank robbers and their female hostage in an Aérospatiale SA 315B Lama, which was hiding behind heavy mining machinery. It was also featured prominently in The Fundamentals of Caring.

Mining for modern life
The metals and minerals Rio Tinto Kennecott produces are essential for modern life. Whether it’s the cars we drive or the mobile devices we use daily, most of the items that we rely on for modern living are made from the products we mine. The next time you use a smart phone to text or talk to your family and friends, remember that copper is a vital component that makes your communication possible.

Copper

Copper plays a vital role in many branches of modern society and technology. Copper’s ductility led to its use in contemporary plumbing and heating systems. Its corrosion resistance makes it an excellent roofing material for buildings. Its electrical conductivity remains the key to modern power generation and distribution.
Copper is 100 percent recyclable and retains its quality (its chemical or physical properties) when recycled. To date, it is one of the most recycled metals. In the United States, nearly as much copper is recovered from recycled material as is derived from newly mined ore.
Production
At Rio Tinto Kennecott, we extract ore from the Bingham Canyon Mine by blasting with explosives. Massive trucks carry the ore to a crusher that breaks the rock into pieces less than 10 inches in diameter.
The crushed ore then travels five miles by conveyer belt to the concentrator. There, we mix the ore with an aqueous solution and grind it into a fine powder. We then mix the ore powder with water, chemicals and air in flotation cells. This process causes the copper-bearing minerals to stick to air bubbles in the cells. When the bubbles float off the top, we collect them as a liquid concentrate that is 28 percent copper.
The concentrate travels 17 miles to Kennecott’s smelter. We dry it and send it into a flash-smelting furnace, which separates it into several products, including a copper matte that is 70 percent copper.
After the copper matte cools, we feed it into several furnaces that remove most of the remaining impurities, achieving 99.6 percent purity. We then cast the copper into 750-pound anodes.
We place the anodes in an acid solution, interleaved with stainless steel cathodes. For 10 days, an electric current passes between the anode and the cathode, causing the copper ions to migrate from the anode to the cathode. Other impurities, including gold and silver, drop off into the bottom of the tank where they are collected for further processing.
The electrolytic process forms a plate of 99.99 percent pure copper. One anode will produce two cathodes, each weighing about 300 pounds. These copper cathodes are Kennecott’s finished products. We strap them together in 5,500-pound bundles, load them onto railcars, and ship them to our customers.

Molybdenum

Molybdenum is highly versatile as an alloy in steel, improving strength, hardness, toughness, weldability, elevated temperature strength, and corrosion resistance.
Molybdenum's unique properties also make it ideal for other applications beyond alloys. Many chemical applications such as catalysts, pigments, corrosion inhibitors, smoke suppressants and lubricants use molybdenum.
Production
Many copper mines contain molybdenum, and the Kennecott Bingham Canyon Mine is no exception. We send extracted ore from Bingham Canyon to the concentrator, then mix it with an aqueous solution and ground it to a powdery consistency.
Then we use a process called froth flotation to separate molybdenum, copper, gold and silver minerals. We filter, dry and package the molybdenum concentrate, then ship it to roasting facilities that further process the concentrate into the base finished product — molybdenum oxide.

Precious Metals

Gold
Gold, along with copper, was one of the first metals discovered by human beings. Throughout history, gold has been the most highly sought after precious metal. A wide range of electronic, space aeronautics and medical applications contain gold due to its high conductivity, complete reflectivity and absolute resistance to corrosion and oxidation.
In addition, space vehicles integrate gold-coated film to reflect infrared radiation and stabilize the temperature of the spacecraft. Gold is 100 percent recyclable. Today, about 15 percent of gold consumption is recycled annually.
Silver
Silver’s superior and unique properties make it an indispensable and highly desirable metal. Of all metals, silver is the best electrical conductor. It is beautiful and strong, sensitive to light, malleable and ductile, reflective, and 100 percent recyclable.
Silver has superior conductivity even when tarnished and can endure extreme temperature changes. Because silver can achieve the highest brilliance of any metal when polished and because of its durability, silver has been used to make coins, jewelry, dinnerware, ornaments, and medals since ancient times.
Production
Gold and silver are products of the copper mining and smelting process. They follow the same production pathway as our copper ore from the mine to the smelter.
At the refinery, we lower copper anodes (which contain gold and silver) into an acid solution. Gold and silver drop off into the bottom of the tank as electrolytic slimes. We send these slimes to the Precious Metals plant where we separate the gold from the silver. After the separation, we refine the gold and silver into a dry sand, which we melt and cast into bars.

Sulfuric acid

Sulfuric acid is a corrosive, colorless, odorless, oily liquid that is the largest-volume industrial chemical produced in the world. Sulfuric acid plays some part in the production of nearly all manufactured goods. We produce about 1 million tons of sulfuric acid each year as a product of the smelting process.
We deliver sulfuric acid to gold, copper, uranium, and beryllium metal producers, fertilizer producers, chemical manufacturers, power plants, steel companies, farmers, and companies involved in water treatment across the United States.
Production
Many of the world's most important metal ore bodies are sulfides — that is, mineral compounds that contain sulfur. The Bingham Canyon Mine contains veins of copper sulfide, so the ore extracted contains sulfur, which needs to be separated from the copper.
We upgrade ore from the mine to produce copper concentrate using a flotation process. The copper concentrate entering the smelter is about one-third copper, one-third iron, and one-third sulfur, with other trace minerals. The smelting process breaks the elements apart and the sulfur is driven off as sulfur dioxide gas.
Kennecott’s smelter is one of the most modern and cleanest in the world. It captures 99.9 percent of the sulfur dioxide emissions produced. We clean the sulfur dioxide gas and pipe it to a double-contact acid plant. There, we convert the sulfur dioxide to sulfuric acid.

	Bingham

	Notes
	to the Unaudited






	Condensed
	Consolidated Financial Statements






	March
	31, 2017










	 








	NOTE 1. BASIS
	OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES





	 




	The unaudited
	interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Bingham Canyon Corporation (the “Company”) have been prepared
	in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions
	to Form 10-Q and reflect all adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of our balance
	sheet, statements of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.  The
	results of operations for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for a full year.  




	 




	Certain information
	and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
	accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted. It is suggested that these condensed consolidated financial
	statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s December 31,
	2016 audited financial statements as reported in its Form 10-K, filed on April 14, 2017.




	 







	Nature
	of Operations







	On August
	31, 2016, the Company entered into a Securities Exchange Agreement with Paradigm Convergence Technologies Corporation (“Paradigm”)
	to effect the acquisition of Paradigm as a wholly-owned subsidiary. Under the terms of the agreement, Bingham issued 16,790,625
	restricted common shares of Bingham stock to the shareholders of Paradigm in exchange for all 22,387,500 outstanding common shares
	of Paradigm stock. In addition, Bingham issued options exercisable into 2,040,000 shares of Bingham’s common stock (with
	exercise prices ranging between $0.133 and $0.333) in exchange for 2,720,000 outstanding Paradigm stock options (with exercise
	prices ranging between $0.10 and $0.25). These 2,040,000 options have been adjusted at the same exchange rate of 0.75 that the
	outstanding common shares were exchanged. As a result of this share exchange agreement, Paradigm, the operating company, is considered
	the accounting acquirer.





	 





	Paradigm is
	located in Lenexa, Kansas and was formed June 6, 2012 under the name of EUR-ECA, Ltd. Paradigm also leases office, research and
	development and production space in Little River, South Carolina. Paradigm is a technology licensing company specializing in environmentally
	safe solutions for global sustainability. Paradigm holds patent, intellectual property and/or distribution rights to innovative
	products and technologies. Paradigm provides innovative products and technologies for eliminating biocidal contamination from
	water supplies, industrial fluids, hard surfaces, food processing equipment and medical devices. Paradigm’s overall strategy
	is to market new products and technologies through the use of equipment leasing, joint ventures, licensing, distributor agreements
	and partnerships.




	 







	Principles
	of Consolidations







	The accompanying
	consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Bingham Canyon Corporation (“Parent”) and its wholly owned
	subsidiary, Paradigm Convergence Technologies Corporation (“Paradigm” or “Subsidiary”). All intercompany
	accounts have been eliminated upon consolidation.






	 









	Use
	of Estimates







	The preparation
	of the condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
	amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported
	amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Estimates are based on historical experience and on various other
	market-specific and other relevant assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which
	form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
	sources. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.




	 







	Cash
	and Cash Equivalents







	Cash and
	cash equivalents are considered to be cash and highly liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less. There
	was cash of $58,686 and $21,078 as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. There were no cash equivalents as of
	March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.





	 










	 



	7



	 







	 








	Accounts
	Receivable







	Accounts
	receivable are carried at their estimated collectible amounts. The Company provides allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable
	equal to the estimated collection losses that will be incurred in collection of all receivables. Accounts receivable are periodically
	evaluated for collectability based on past credit history with customers and their current financial condition. The Company’s
	management determines which accounts are past due and if deemed uncollectible, the Company provides an allowance for doubtful
	receivables in the period the determination is made. Based on management’s evaluation, the allowance for doubtful accounts
	was $12,000 at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.




	 







	Inventory







	The inventory
	consists of raw materials ($66,768) and finished goods ($22,000) in the amount of $88,768 at March 31, 2017. Inventory is valued
	using the first-in first-out (“FIFO”) method, at the lower of cost or market value. The Company recorded a reserve
	allowance against inventory of $0 and $0 for the periods ending March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.





	 








	Fair
	Value Measurements







	The
	Company follows ASC 820,

	“Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,”

	which defines fair value as the exchange
	price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous
	market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques
	used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. A fair value
	hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last is considered unobservable,
	is used to measure fair value:




	 








	 




	Level 1:




	Valuations
	for assets and liabilities traded in active markets from readily available pricing sources such as quoted prices in active
	markets for identical assets or liabilities.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	Level 2:




	Observable inputs (other
	than Level 1 quoted prices) such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets
	that are not active for identical or similar assets or liabilities, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated
	by observable market data.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	Level 3:




	Unobservable inputs that are supported by little
	or no market activity and that are significant to determining the fair value of the assets or liabilities, including pricing
	models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques.







	 




	The
	carrying values of our financial instruments, including, cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid expenses,
	accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair value due to the short maturities of these financial instruments.
	We do not have other financial assets or liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of March 31, 2017
	and December 31, 2016.





	 








	Valuation
	of Long-lived Assets







	The carrying
	values of the Company’s long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances
	indicate that they may not be recoverable. When projections indicate that the carrying value of the long-lived asset is not recoverable,
	the carrying value is reduced by the estimated excess of the carrying value over the projected undiscounted cash flows. Under
	similar analysis no impairment was recorded as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Impairment tests are conducted on an annual
	basis and, should they indicate a carrying value in excess of fair value, additional impairment changes may be required.

	Property
	and Equipment







	Property
	and equipment are stated at purchased cost and depreciated on a straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging from
	5 to 15 years. Upon disposition of property and equipment, related gains and losses are recorded in the results of operations.
	Accumulated depreciation for period ending March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were $34,529 and $30,479, respectively. Expenditures
	for major renewals and betterments that extend the useful lives of property and equipment are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance
	and repairs are charged to expenses as incurred.




	 







	Intangible
	Assets







	Costs
	to obtain or develop patents are capitalized and amortized over the remaining life of the patents, and technology rights are amortized
	over their estimated useful lives. These assets are stated at cost, net of accumulated amortization. An impairment charge is recognized
	if the carrying amount is not recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the intangible assets as determined
	by the projected undiscounted net future cash flows. The Company recorded impairment expense of $0 and $0 for the periods ending
	March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 respectively. Accumulated amortization was $132,923 and $107,582 as of March 31, 2017 and
	December 31, 2016, respectively.




	 







	Research
	and Development







	Research
	and development costs are recognized as an expense during the period incurred, which is until the conceptual formulation, design,
	and testing of the process is completed and the process has been determined to be commercially viable.






	 









	Revenue
	Recognition







	Revenue
	is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been provided or goods delivered, the price to
	the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue from the sale of products is recorded at
	the time of shipment to the customers. Revenue from contracts to license technology to others is immediately recognized since
	it is a non-refundable deposit.




	 







	Basic
	and Diluted Loss per Share







	Basic
	loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
	Diluted loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares and dilutive potential
	common shares outstanding during the period. The weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for computing basic EPS
	was 37,350,628 at March 31, 2017 as compared to 15,628,125 at March 31, 2016. At March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016 there were
	1,466,077 and 1,914,516 common stock equivalents from stock options that were excluded from the diluted EPS calculation as their
	effect is anti-dilutive.





	 








	Recent
	Accounting Pronouncements







	In March,
	2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, "Stock Compensation.” ASU 2016-09 was issued to simplify the accounting for stock
	compensation. It focuses on income tax accounting, award classification, estimating forfeitures, and cash flow presentation. For
	public companies, ASU 2016-09 became effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and for interim periods within
	those annual periods. The Company adopted ASU 2016-09 effective January 1, 2017. ASU 2016-09 has no material effect on the Company’s
	financial statements.




	 




	In January,
	2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, “Intangibles, Goodwill & Other.” ASU 2017-04 simplifies how all entities assess
	impairment by implementing a one step test. As amended, the impairment test will compare the fair value with its carrying amount.
	An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. A public company
	which is a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filer should adopt the amendments in ASU 2017-04 for its annual or any interim
	period within its annual period in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for interim or
	annual dates after January 1, 2017. The Company adopted ASU 2017-04 effective January 1, 2017. ASU 2017-04 has no material effect
	in the Company’s financial statements.




	 




	The Company
	has reviewed all other FASB issued ASU accounting pronouncements and interpretations thereof that have effective dates during
	the period reported and in future periods. The Company has carefully considered the new pronouncements that alter previous GAAP
	and do not believe that any new or modified principles will have a material impact on the Company’s reported financial position
	or operations in the near term.

	NOTE 2. GOING
	CONCERN





	 




	The accompanying
	unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.
	The Company has limited assets, has incurred losses since inception of $4,704,338 and has negative cash flows from operations.
	As of March 31, 2017, the Company had a working capital deficit of $260,072. The Company has relied on raising debt and equity
	capital in order to fund its ongoing day-to-day operations and its corporate overhead. The Company will require additional working
	capital from either cash flow from operations, from debt or equity financing, or from a combination of these sources. These factors
	raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include
	any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION
	AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS





	 






	Executive Overview






	 




	On August 10, 2016, Bingham entered
	into a Securities Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with Paradigm Convergence Technologies Corporation,
	a Nevada corporation (“Paradigm”). Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, Paradigm became the wholly-owned
	subsidiary of Bingham after the exchange transaction. Bingham is a holding company, which through Paradigm is engaged in the business
	of marketing new products and technologies through licensing and joint ventures.




	 




	We are a technology development and
	licensing company specializing in environmentally safe solutions for global sustainability. We hold patent, intellectual property
	and/or distribution rights to innovative products and technologies. Our overall strategy is to market new products and technologies
	through the use of equipment leasing, joint ventures, licensing, distributor agreements and partnerships. Generally, it is not
	our intent to be the primary producer and distributor of the technology products: but rather to license the underlying technology
	while developing new opportunities and applications for the products and promoting the brands. We intend to also continue our
	constant pursuit of new technologies (through acquisition or invention) upon which we can build and expand our joint venture and
	licensing core business. However, Paradigm may not be able to identify suitable license or joint venture opportunities, nor guarantee
	that any such agreements will be profitable.




	 




	Bingham had not recorded revenues
	for the two fiscal years prior to its acquisition of Paradigm and was dependent upon financing to continue basic operations. Paradigm
	has recorded revenue since it initiated operations in 2012; however, those revenues have not been sufficient to finance operations.
	The Company recorded a net loss of $681,354 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and accumulated losses of $4,704,338 from
	inception through March 31, 2017.




	 




	Bingham remains dependent upon additional
	financing to continue operations. The Company intends to raise additional equity financing through private placements of its common
	stock. We expect that we would issue such stock pursuant to exemptions to the registration requirements provided by federal and
	state securities laws. The purchasers and manner of issuance will be determined according to our financial needs, as discussed
	below, and the available exemptions to the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We also note that
	if we issue more shares of our common stock, then our stockholders may experience dilution in the value per share of their common
	stock.




	 




	The expected costs for the next twelve
	months include:




	 





	a major commercial launch of non-toxic sanitizing, disinfecting and sterilizing
	products and technologies with a strong emphasis on health care facilities, including hospitals, nursing homes, assisted living
	facilities, clinics and medical, dental and veterinarian offices;










	continued research and development on product generation units including those
	designed for on-site deployment at customers’ facilities;










	accelerated research and development on applications of the products in the
	agricultural sector, most specifically with respect to abatement of a disease crisis caused by a certain bacterium in the U.S.
	and elsewhere;








	acquiring available complementary technology rights;










	payment of short-term debt;








	hiring of additional personnel throughout 2017; and








	general and administrative operating costs.









	Management projects these costs to
	total approximately $1,300,000. To minimize these costs, the Company intends to maintain its practice of controlling operating
	costs with efficient facilities commitments, continuing below market salaries and consulting fees, and rigorous prioritization
	of expenditures.




	 




	Based on its understanding of the
	commercial readiness of its products and technologies, the capabilities of its personnel (current and being hired), established
	business relationships and the general market conditions, management believes that the Company expects to be at or close to profitability
	by the end of 2017.




	 









	 



	16



	 







	 







	Liquidity and Capital Resources






	 




	A critical component of our operating
	plan impacting our continued existence is the ability to obtain additional capital through additional equity and/or debt financing.
	We do not anticipate generating sufficient positive internal operating cash flow until such time as we can deliver our products
	to market and generate substantial revenues, which may take the next full year to fully realize, if ever. In the event we cannot
	obtain the necessary capital to pursue our strategic plan, we may have to significantly curtail our operations. This would materially
	impact our ability to continue operations.

	At March 31, 2017, the Company recorded
	a net loss of $681,354 and a working capital deficit of $260,072. We have recorded a relatively small amount of revenues from
	operations since inception and we have not established an ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover our operating costs. During
	2017 and 2016 we have primarily relied upon advances and loans from a stockholder and third parties to fund our operations. The
	Company has relied on raising debt and equity capital in order to fund its ongoing day-to-day operations and its corporate overhead.
	We had $58,686 in cash at March 31 2017, compared to $ 21,078 in cash at December 31, 2016. We had total liabilities of $615,101
	at March 31, 2017 compared to $555,838 at December 31, 2016.




	 




	Our current cash flow is not sufficient
	to meet our monthly expenses of approximately $80,000 and to fund future research and development. We intend to rely on additional
	debt financing, loans from existing stockholders and private placements of common stock for additional funding; however, there
	is no assurance that additional funding will be available. We do not have material commitments for future capital expenditures.
	However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain short-term financing, or that sources of such financing, if any,
	will continue to be available, and if available, that they will be on favorable terms.




	 




	The decrease in total liabilities
	was primarily the result of conversion of notes payable and accrued interest to equity during December, 2016.




	 




	During the next 12 months we anticipate
	incurring additional costs related to the filing of Exchange Act reports. We believe we will be able to meet these costs through
	funds provided by management, significant stockholders and/or third parties. We may also rely on the issuance of our common stock
	in lieu of cash to convert debt or pay for expenses.

	Commitments and Obligations






	 




	The Company recorded notes payable
	totaling approximately $461,388 at March 31, 2017 compared to notes payable of $488,253 at December 31, 2016. These notes payable
	are the result of loans from five related parties and one unrelated third party. Related party notes payable were $328,028 and
	$358,802 at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. The notes payable are unsecured, non-collateralized, bear interest
	from 3.5% to 5% and are due for periods ranging from “on demand” to 12 months from their original issue dates. The
	unrelated third part note was $150,000 at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. The note bears interest rate of 13% per annum
	and a default interest rate of 19% per annum. The note is secured by a mortgage or deed of trust on a property located in Fuquay
	Varina, North Carolina, owned by a minority stockholder, and by a personal guarantee of the President of the Company.




	 




	During the three months ended March
	31, 2017, the Company paid back $15,610 of the note payable to the Company President, Mr. Gary Grieco. At March 31, 2017 the outstanding
	loan balance on note payable to Mr. Grieco, after the $15,610 payment, was $278,302.




	 




	During the three months ended March
	31, 2017, the Company re-paid $15,500 on two notes payable due to two related entities controlled by a Company stockholder. At
	March 31, 2017, after payments of $15,500, the outstanding balances on these tow notes payable were $0 and $0.




	 




	Paradigm has also entered into two
	leases for office space: one is located in Lenexa, Kansas and the second in Little River, South Carolina. The office space lease
	amounts total $6,300 per month.

	Revenues increased to $11,357 for
	the three months ended March 31, 2017 (the “2017 first quarter”) compared to $9,098 for the three months ended March
	31, 2016 (the “2016 first quarter”). The revenue increase for the period was due to the increased volume of fluids
	sold.




	 




	Cost of sales increased to $11,229
	for the 2017 first quarter compared to $9,255 for the 2016 first quarter. The cost of sales increase during the 2017 first quarter
	was due to the cost associated with the increased volume of fluids sold and depreciation.




	 




	Total operating expenses increased
	to $669,611 during the 2017 first quarter compared to $215,310 during the 2016 first quarter. The increase during the first quarter
	of 2017 was due to an increase in General and administrative expense, net of a decrease in research and development spending.

	General and administrative expenses
	increased to $630,605 for the 2017 first quarter compared to $143,185 during the 2016 first quarter. The increase in general and
	administrative expense increase during the first quarter of 2017 was due to hiring new employees, opening a new facility, and
	recording stock option compensation expense for stock options issued during the quarter.




	 




	Research and development expenses
	decreased to $13,202 for the 2017 first quarter compared to $69,567 during the 2016 first quarter. The decrease in research and
	development expense during the first quarter of 2017 was primarily due to completion of field testing in one area of the Company’s
	business.




	 




	Depreciation and amortization expenses
	increased to $26,344 during the 2017 first quarter compared to $5,607 during the 2016 first quarter. The increase was primarily
	due to an increase in intangible assets and the amortization associated with the increase.




	 




	Total interest expenses increased
	to $11,871 during the 2017 first quarter compared to $4,209 during the 2016 first quarter. Total interest expense increased during
	the 2017 first quarter due to the higher rate of interest per annum on the loan obtained during the quarter from the unrelated
	third party note and the amortization of debt discount.




	 




	Net loss from operations after income
	taxes increased to $681,354 during the 2017 first quarter compared to $219,676 during the 2016 first quarter. Net loss from operations
	after income taxes increased during the 2017 first quarter primarily due to increased operating expenses.






	 








	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements






	 




	We have not entered into any off-balance
	sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in
	financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources and would
	be considered material to investors.

	our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley
	Act;






	 








	•




	Submit certain executive
	compensation matters to stockholder advisory votes, such as “say-on-pay”
	and “say-on-frequency”






	 








	•




	Obtain stockholder approval
	of any golden parachute payments not previously approved; and






	 








	•




	Disclose certain executive
	compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and
	performance and comparisons of the Chief Executives compensation to median employee compensation.






	 




	In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS
	Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B)
	of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay
	the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected
	to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable
	to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.




	 




	We will remain an “emerging
	growth company” until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues
	exceed $1 billion; (ii) the fifth anniversary of our first sale of common equity pursuant to an effective registration statement;
	(iii) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act
	of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as
	of the last business day of our most recently completed third fiscal quarter; or (iv) the date on which we have issued more than
	$1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period.




	 





	Recent Accounting
	Developments





	 




	We reviewed all recent accounting
	pronouncements issued by the FASB (including the Emerging Issues Task Force), the AICPA, and the SEC and we did not or are not
	believed by management to have a material impact on our present or future financial statements.

	ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES





	 






	Evaluation
	of Disclosure Controls and Procedures






	 




	We maintain disclosure controls and
	procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required
	to be disclosed in our filings under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified
	in the rules and forms of the SEC. This information is accumulated to allow our management to make timely decisions regarding
	required disclosure. Our President, who serves as our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated
	the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act)
	as of the end of the period covered by this report. The disclosure controls and procedures ensure that all information required
	to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is: (i) recorded, processed, summarized and
	reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rule and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our President
	as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, our President concluded that
	as of March 31, 2017, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.  




	 




	Notwithstanding this finding of ineffective
	disclosure controls and procedures, we concluded that the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K present
	fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity
	with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.




	 










	Changes
	in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting






	 




	Our management
	is responsible to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our principal executive officer is
	responsible to design or supervise a process that provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
	and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
	The policies and procedures include:




	 





	maintenance of records in reasonable detail to accurately
	and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets,




	provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
	as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
	receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors, and




	provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
	timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on our financial
	statements.







	For the period
	ended March 31, 2017, management has relied on the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), “Internal
	Control - Integrated Framework,” to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Based upon
	that framework, our President has determined that our internal control over financial reporting for period ended March 31, 2017,
	the year ended December 31, 2016, was not effective.




	 




	The material weaknesses relate to
	the limited number of persons responsible for the recording and reporting of financial information, the lack of separation of
	financial reporting duties, and the limited size of our management team in general. We are in the process of evaluating methods
	of improving our internal control over financial reporting, including the possible addition of financial reporting staff and the
	increased separation of financial reporting responsibility, and intend to implement such steps as are necessary and possible to
	correct these material weaknesses.




	 




	Our management determined that there
	were no changes made in our internal controls over financial reporting during the first quarter of 2017 that have materially affected,
	or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.




	 




	There has been no change in the Company’s
	internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably
	likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.




	 




	Internal control systems, no matter
	how well designed and operated, have inherent limitations.  Therefore, even a system which is determined to be effective
	cannot provide absolute assurance that all control issues have been detected or prevented.  Our systems of internal
	controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
