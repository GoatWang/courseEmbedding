I have more than 5 years experience in Product design, stemming from a Masters' degree in which I learned the ways of the CAD programmes and studies the broader spectrum of designers. I am now a CAD designer which gives me plenty of opportunity to practice my CAD skills. The combination of my studies and practice has meant that I now have a versatile skill set and can approach a problem from many different angles, depending on which is the most appropriate at the time and will produce the best results. 
Thanks, James.

Recommendation

The rise and global success of Toyota inspired vast numbers of studies, articles and books on the company’s production system and culture. The authors show how the Japanese auto maker’s system for developing products has contributed to its success. James Morgan and Jeffrey Liker explain Toyota’s insistence on starting projects correctly, applying the best resources to them in a timely fashion and terminating wasteful processes that provide no customer benefit. The authors also portray Toyota’s approach to technology, project management tools, communication and corporate culture and compare Toyota to American auto makers. While this book is most useful to those involved in manufacturing product development, especially engineers and their managers, getAbstract recommends it to anyone who is fascinated by the world’s largest automaker and wants to learn about its integrated approach to creating cars.





					In this summary, you will learn
				


					How Toyota approaches product development;
				

					Why it values learning and organizational knowledge so highly; and
				

					Why cultural change is critical to the creation of a lean product development system.
