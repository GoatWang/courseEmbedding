	Plaintiff BP Products North America Inc. brought this action alleging breach of contract by Premier Oil Company, LLC. According to BP, Defendants M. Kyle Rice, Richard K. Rice, and POC Real Estate Company, LLC guaranteed Premier’s payment to BP under these contracts and were therefore liable as well.


	All Defendants were initially represented by one law firm and filed one Answer to Plaintiff’s complaint on June 1, 2011. The Answer stated, among other things, that Kyle Rice executed guarantees on the contracts. Under the court’s scheduling order, amendments to the pleadings were permitted through August 31, 2011. Kyle eventually obtained his own counsel and, on December 20, 2012, sought leave to amend the original Answer.


	The district court held a hearing on Kyle’s motion. Good cause is required to amend the Answer after the scheduling order’s deadline has passed. According to the court, Kyle knew of the information contained in the amendment at the time the original Answer was filed, had not been diligent in attempting to amend his answer before the scheduling order’s deadline, and therefore did not have good cause to amend. The court denied Kyle’s motion, and Plaintiff and Kyle subsequently reached a settlement.


	Case Highlights


		Complaint filed 3/02/2011 (Doc #1)
	

		Answer filed jointly by Defendants 6/01/2011 (Doc #11)

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
