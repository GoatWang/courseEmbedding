Novan - Company Overview





















Show Nav






Overview
Novan, Inc. is a late-stage pharmaceutical company focused on redefining the standard of care in dermatology through the development and commercialization of innovative therapies using the Company’s nitric oxide platform. Nitric oxide plays a vital role in the natural immune system response against microbial pathogens and is a critical regulator of inflammation. Our ability to harness nitric oxide and its multiple mechanisms of action has enabled us to create a pipeline of differentiated, first-in-class product candidates. We are rapidly advancing programs in five dermatological conditions with significant unmet medical need. We believe that our ability to conveniently deploy nitric oxide on demand in topical formulations allows us the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes in a variety of skin diseases and positions us to be a commercially successful leader in the dermatology market.
The two key components of our nitric oxide platform are our proprietary Nitricil™ technology, which drives the creation of new chemical entities, or NCEs, and our topical formulation science, both of which we use to modulate, or “tune,” our product candidates for specific indications. For more about nitric oxide, Nitricil or our product candidates, please visit the Technology and Product Pipeline sections of our website.

Novan - SB208





















Show Nav






Onychomycosis
Onychomycosis is a chronic fungal infection of the nails that affects approximately 40 million Americans. The infection, caused by dermatophytes such as Trichophyton rubrum, often results in painful thickening and deformation of the nail and sometimes separation of the nail plate from the nail bed, leading to an inability of the nail to perform its natural protective function. Oral therapies used to treat the infection are associated with severe side effects, and topical therapies have modest efficacy profiles with complete cure rates of less than 20%.

















SB208
Novan is developing SB208 as a broad-spectrum antifungal gel for the treatment of superficial cutaneous fungal infections of the skin and nails, such as tinea pedis and onychomycosis. In a Phase 2 clinical trial, SB208 Gel, at both the 4% and 16% concentrations, demonstrated a statistically significant effect (p<0.05) compared to vehicle in a clinical trial in patients with tinea pedis, or athlete’s foot.
Clinical Data

In the primary efficacy analysis of patients with evaluable culture results, 80.6% (p=0.002) of patients treated with SB208 4% and 74.2% (p=0.016) of patients treated with SB208 16% achieved negative fungal culture at day 14 versus 45.5% of patients treated with vehicle.
The percentage of patients achieving mycological cure at the day 14 visit was 50.0% (p=0.009) of the patients treated with SB208 4% and 53.1% (p=0.010) of patients treated with SB208 16% versus 23.5% of patients treated with vehicle.

Mycological cure was maintained at day 42 in both dose groups; 58.8% of patients treated with SB208 16% demonstrated a mycological cure compared to vehicle (p<0.05).



Preclinical Data
In the ChubTur® infected human nail assay, a model utilized previously in the drug development of Kerydin® (tavaborole) Topical Solution, 5%, and Jublia® (efinaconazole) Topical Solution, 10%, nitric oxide-releasing formulations demonstrated rapid penetration of the nail and effective fungal killing of T. rubrum in 24 hours following a single treatment application.

Novan - SB204





















Show Nav






Acne Vulgaris

Acne vulgaris is the most common skin condition in the U.S., affecting approximately 40 million to 50 million Americans annually.  The disease ranges in severity from mild to severe cystic acne and causes both physical and psychological effects, including permanent scarring, anxiety, depression and poor self-esteem.  The complexity of the disease requires treatments that address more than one of the major causes of acne pathogenesis.

















SB204
SB204, the Company’s lead drug candidate for the treatment of acne vulgaris, is in late stage clinical development. We believe that SB204 has the potential to redefine the standard of care in acne vulgaris, and if approved will be the first new chemical entity specifically developed for the treatment of acne vulgaris in more than 20 years. 
SB204 Clinical Trial Results

Statistically significant efficacy with SB204 4% when compared to vehicle in both inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion endpoints
Clear separation between active and vehicle
Good cutaneous tolerability
Once daily treatment that is non-inferior to twice daily
No measureable systemic exposure under maximal use conditions in adults or adolescents with moderate-to-severe acne

ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01844752

Novan - Company Overview





















Show Nav






Overview
Novan, Inc. is a late-stage pharmaceutical company focused on redefining the standard of care in dermatology through the development and commercialization of innovative therapies using the Company’s nitric oxide platform. Nitric oxide plays a vital role in the natural immune system response against microbial pathogens and is a critical regulator of inflammation. Our ability to harness nitric oxide and its multiple mechanisms of action has enabled us to create a pipeline of differentiated, first-in-class product candidates. We are rapidly advancing programs in five dermatological conditions with significant unmet medical need. We believe that our ability to conveniently deploy nitric oxide on demand in topical formulations allows us the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes in a variety of skin diseases and positions us to be a commercially successful leader in the dermatology market.
The two key components of our nitric oxide platform are our proprietary Nitricil™ technology, which drives the creation of new chemical entities, or NCEs, and our topical formulation science, both of which we use to modulate, or “tune,” our product candidates for specific indications. For more about nitric oxide, Nitricil or our product candidates, please visit the Technology and Product Pipeline sections of our website.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
