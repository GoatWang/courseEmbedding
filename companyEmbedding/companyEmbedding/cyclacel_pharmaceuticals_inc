	About Cyclacel Pharmaceuticals

	Research and Development Pipeline

	We are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development and commercialization of novel, mechanism-targeted drugs to treat human cancers and other serious diseases. Our strategy is to build a diversified biopharmaceutical business focused in hematology and oncology based on a portfolio of commercial products and a development pipeline of novel drug candidates.

	Our clinical development priorities are focused on sapacitabine in the following indications:


		Acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, in the elderly;

		Myelodysplastic syndromes, or MDS; and

		Non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC.


	In January 11, 2011, the Company opened enrollment of the SEAMLESS pivotal Phase 3 trial for the Company's sapacitabine oral capsules as a front-line treatment of elderly patients aged 70 years or older with newly diagnosed AML who are not candidates for intensive induction chemotherapy. SEAMLESS is a registration-directed clinical trial and is conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. SEAMLESS is a randomized study against an active control drug with the primary objective of demonstrating an improvement in overall survival. After reviewing data from a pilot study of the active arm of the study, the SEAMLESS Data Safety Monitoring Board, or DSMB, recommended that the trial continue as planned.

	The Company has advanced two additional product candidates, seliciclib in Phase 2 for NSCLC and nasopharyngeal cancer or NPC, and CYC116 in Phase 1 clinical development. The combination of sapacitabine with seliciclib is also being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial. The Company will determine the feasibility of pursuing further development and/or partnering these assets depending on the availability of funding and further clinical data.

About Cyclacel Pharmaceuticals
Company Overview
Cyclacel Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company developing oral therapies that target the various phases of cell cycle control for the treatment of cancer and other serious diseases. Professor Sir David Lane, a recognized leader in the field of tumor suppressor biology, who discovered the p53 protein, founded the Company in 1996. In 1999, Cyclacel Pharmaceuticals was joined by Professor David Glover, a recognized leader in the mechanism of mitosis or cell division, who discovered, among other cell cycle targets, the mitotic kinases, Polo and Aurora, enzymes that act in the mitosis phase of the cell cycle.
Sapacitabine (CYC682), Cyclacel's most advanced product candidate, is the subject of SEAMLESS, a Phase 3 trial, which has completed enrollment and is being conducted under an SPA with the FDA as front-line treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in the elderly, and other indications including myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Cyclacel's pipeline includes an oral regimen of seliciclib in combination with sapacitabine in a Phase 1 study of patients with Homologous Recombination (HR) repair-deficient breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancers, including BRCA positive tumors, and CYC065, a novel CDK2/9 inhibitor in a Phase 1 study of patients with solid tumors with potential utility in both hematological malignancies and solid tumors. Cyclacel's strategy is to build a diversified biopharmaceutical business focused in hematology and oncology based on a development pipeline of novel drug candidates.
Cyclacel Pharmaceuticals' corporate headquarters are in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, where our business development and medical and regulatory functions are also located. The company's primary research facility is located in Dundee, Scotland. Dundee is the main location of our translational research and preclinical activities.

Three product candidates are currently in clinical development. Sapacitabine (CYC682), a cell cycle modulating nucleoside analogue, is in Phase 3 development for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in the elderly under a Special Protocol Assessment agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Phase 2 studies for myelodysplastic syndromes, lung cancer and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Seliciclib (CYC202 or R-roscovitine), a CDK (cyclin dependent kinase) inhibitor, is in Phase 2 studies for the treatment of lung cancer and nasopharyngeal cancer and in a Phase 1 trial in combination with sapacitabine. CYC116, an Aurora kinase and VEGFR2 inhibitor, is in a Phase 1 trial in patients with solid tumors. Cyclacel Pharmaceuticals' strategy is to build a diversified biopharmaceutical business focused in hematology and oncology based on a portfolio of commercial products and a development pipeline of novel drug candidates.
Cyclacel Pharmaceuticals' ALIGN Pharmaceuticals subsidiary markets directly in the U.S. Xclair Cream for radiation dermatitis, Numoisyn® Liquid and Numoisyn® Lozenges for xerostomia.
Expansion[edit]
After becoming the first European spin-out company to raise over $100 million in private equity,[1] the company had to pull out of a stock market listing in July 2004.[2] Cyclacel completed a reverse merger with Xcyte Therapies in December 2005 to acquire Nasdaq listing.[3] This allowed Cyclacel to take advantage of its adopted Nasdaq listing by raising an additional $45 million in April 2006 through a private placement of stock and warrants.

CYC116, an Aurora kinase and VEGFR2 inhibitor, is in a Phase 1 trial in patients with solid tumors. Cyclacel Pharmaceuticals' strategy is to build a diversified biopharmaceutical business focused in hematology and oncology based on a portfolio of commercial products and a development pipeline of novel drug candidates.
Cyclacel Pharmaceuticals' ALIGN Pharmaceuticals subsidiary markets directly in the U.S. Xclair Cream for radiation dermatitis, Numoisyn® Liquid and Numoisyn® Lozenges for xerostomia.
Expansion[edit]
After becoming the first European spin-out company to raise over $100 million in private equity,[1] the company had to pull out of a stock market listing in July 2004.[2] Cyclacel completed a reverse merger with Xcyte Therapies in December 2005 to acquire Nasdaq listing.[3] This allowed Cyclacel to take advantage of its adopted Nasdaq listing by raising an additional $45 million in April 2006 through a private placement of stock and warrants.

Cyclacel Announces Closing of $15.2 Million Underwritten Public Offering and Full Exercise of Over-Allotment OptionBack to CYCC Snapshot

Share Story2:00PM ET 7/21/2017 Globe NewswireBERKELEY HEIGHTS, N.J., July  21, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cyclacel Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:CYCC) (Cyclacel or the Company), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company using cell cycle, transcriptional regulation and DNA damage response biology to develop innovative, targeted medicines for cancer and other proliferative diseases, today announced the closing of an underwritten public offering of units for gross proceeds of $15.2 million, which includes the full exercise of the underwriter's over-allotment option to purchase additional shares and warrants, prior to deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by Cyclacel. Existing and new investors participated in the offering.
The offering was comprised of Class A Units, priced at a public offering price of $2.00 per unit, each unit consisting of one share of common stock and a seven-year warrant (each, a "warrant") to purchase one share of common stock with an exercise price of $2.00 per share, and Class B Units, priced at a public offering price of $1,000 per unit, with each unit comprised of one share of preferred stock, which is convertible into 500 shares of common stock, and a warrant to purchase 500 shares of common stock, also with an exercise price of $2.00 per share. The conversion price of the preferred stock issued in the transaction as well as the exercise price of the warrants are fixed and do not contain any variable pricing features or any price based anti-dilutive features. The preferred stock issued in this transaction includes a beneficial ownership blocker but has no dividend rights (except to the extent that dividends are also paid on the common stock), liquidation preference or other preferences over common stock, and, with certain exceptions, has no voting rights. The securities comprising the units were immediately separable and have been issued separately.
Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., a subsidiary of Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services Inc. (NYSE MKT: LTS), acted as sole book-running manager in connection with the offering.
A total of 3,154,000 shares of common stock, 8,872 shares of preferred stock convertible into 4,436,000 shares of common stock, and total warrants to purchase 7,590,000 shares of common stock were issued in the offering, including the full exercise of the over-allotment option. If exercised in full, the warrants could result in additional net financing proceeds to Cyclacel of $15.2 million.
The securities were offered pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-218305) and an additional registration statement filed pursuant to Rule 462(b), which was declared effective by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").
This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor will there be any sales of these securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. A final prospectus relating to this offering has been filed by Cyclacel with the SEC.
