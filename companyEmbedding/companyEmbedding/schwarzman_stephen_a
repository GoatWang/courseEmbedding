Blackstone Corporate Private Equity


                  Blackstone Corporate Private Equity employs a flexible, opportunistic investment approach that is not focused on any single geography, industry, transaction structure or size. The firm has expertise across all aspects of the capital markets including debt, equity, real estate financing, derivatives and commodities. They focus on situations where their investment can facilitate value-creating strategic transformations of businesses. Their transactions may include large public-to-privates, large private transactions, small and medium sized buyouts, distressed investments, rescue financings, platform build-ups, industry consolidations, minority stakes, structured equity, growth equity and start-ups. Blackstone deploys capital globally over the life of a fund and across a variety of investment environments. Most of Blackstone's investments are in the US, Europe, China and India. Blackstone has significant expertise in all major industries. One of Blackstone's signature forms of private equity investing is corporate partnership transactions in which they invest capital alongside a major corporation.Blackstone tends to be a contrarian private equity investor, focusing on out-of-favor, under-appreciated industries. The firm has successfully invested in industries such as rural telephony, oil refining, commodity chemicals, coal and automotive parts, among others, when they were perceived to be out-of-favor with the markets. The firm also seeks to identify developing industry trends, to capitalize on those trends before they become widely appreciated and to pursue opportunities to change the structure and profit potential of specific industry sectors through consolidation.Blackstone also focuses on investments in distressed securities. Through their restructuring and reorganization advisory business and their GSO credit-oriented business, the firm has access to investment opportunities in companies in financial distress that are trading at significant discounts.

Blackstone Real Estate Advisors


                  Blackstone's real estate investments are made in a variety of sectors, geographic locations and business climates. They make a significant number of investments in the lodging sector, major urban office buildings, residential properties, distribution and warehousing centers and a variety of real estate operating companies. Blackstone bases their investment strategy on identifying well-located institutional quality properties that suffer from temporary or correctable flaws in their tenancy, physical attributes, capital structures, market position or management.The firm's real estate philosophy is generally guided by the fundamental premise that future cash flow, not 'trophy status' or fashion, ultimately determines the value of an asset. Blackstone believes that rigorous due diligence, the use of conservative assumptions in projecting cash flows, and careful assessment of possible downside scenarios are the best methods for consistently achieving its objectives.In evaluating any investment opportunity, one of Blackstone's primary considerations is the potential exit strategy. To that end, the firm focuses on making investments in high quality, well-located assets. In addition, factors that reduce the value of an asset (such as ground leases, preemptive rights, long-term management contracts or other restrictions on the owner's control) are scrutinized during due diligence to determine the effects on value. Finally, the firm seeks investments with multiple exit strategies including private one-off sales, portfolio sales within common asset classes, mergers with existing public entities or initial public offerings of stand-alone operating companies.

John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts

                    President Kennedy's words resonate more strongly than ever for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in the 21st century. The Center, which opened on September 8, 1971, continues its efforts to fulfill President Kennedy's vision by producing and presenting an unmatched variety of theater and musicals, dance and ballet, orchestral, chamber, jazz, popular, world, and folk music, and multimedia performances for all ages. Each year, the institution that bears President Kennedy's name brings his dream to fruition, touching the lives of millions of people through thousands of performances by the greatest artists from across America and around the world. The Center also nurtures new works and young artists, creating performances, broadcasts, and touring productions while serving the nation as a leader in arts and arts management education.
The Eisenhower Theater

The Kennedy Center, located on 17 acres overlooking the Potomac River in Washington, D.C., is America's living memorial to President Kennedy as well as the nation's busiest arts facility. Touring Kennedy Center productions and its television, radio, and Internet broadcasts reach more than 40 million people around the world each year. As part of the Kennedy Center's Performing Arts for Everyone program, more than 400 free performances are offered each year featuring international, national, and local artists. These include daily 6 p.m. concerts on the Millennium Stage—now in its 16th year—which are streamed live over the Internet and digitally archived on Kennedy-Center.org.

The Center has co-produced more than 300 new works of theater over the past 40 years, including Tony Award®-winning shows ranging from Annie in 1977 to A Few Good Men, How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, The King and I, Titanic, and the American premiere of Les Misérables. In 2002, the Center presented the unprecedented, astonishingly successful Sondheim Celebration, featuring new Kennedy Center productions of Sweeney Todd, Company, Sunday in the Park with George, Merrily We Roll Along, Passion, and A Little Night Music. In the spring of 2004, the Center produced three Tennessee Williams classics, A Streetcar Named Desire, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, and The Glass Menagerie. Other Center productions include Mame; Carnival!; August Wilson's 20th Century, the playwright's complete 10-play cycle performed as fully-staged readings; Terrence McNally's Nights at the Opera, which featured three of the author's plays performed concurrently in three of the Center's theaters; a revival production of Ragtime which transferred to Broadway in October 2009 and received six Tony® nominations; and a revival production of Stephen Sondheim and James Goldman's Follies, which transferred to Broadway in 2011 and received eight Tony® nominations, winning one for Best Costume Design of a Musical.

World premiere performances have been offered through a Kennedy Center commissioning program for new ballet and dance works. These works have been created by America's foremost choreographers—Paul Taylor, Lar Lubovitch, and Merce Cunningham—for leading American dance companies including American Ballet Theatre, Ballet West, Houston Ballet, Pacific Northwest Ballet, Pennsylvania Ballet, and the San Francisco Ballet.  Since 2001, the Kennedy Center has supported and produced The Suzanne Farrell Ballet in 11 seasons of performances at the Center and on extended tours. In 2006, the Kennedy Center created Protégés, a ballet festival highlighting rising stars from the world's greatest ballet training academies. The Center's biennial Ballet Across America festival explores the breadth and depth of the art form, showcasing ballet companies in a range of styles from across the country.

The National Symphony Orchestra, the Kennedy Center's artistic affiliate since 1987, has commissioned dozens of works, among them Stephen Albert's RiverRun, which won the Pulitzer Prize for Music; Morton Gould's StringMusic, also a Pulitzer Prize-winner; William Bolcom's Sixth Symphony; and, most recently, Peter Lieberson's Remembering JFK: An American Elegy.  The 2012-2013 season continues under the leadership of Christoph Eschenbach, who serves as Music Director of both the Kennedy Center and the National Symphony Orchestra. In addition to its regular season concerts, the National Symphony Orchestra presents a diverse education program, chamber concerts, and a pops series led by Principal Pops Conductor Steven Reineke.
The Opera House

Washington National Opera, founded in 1956, became a Kennedy Center affiliate in July 2011 and is one of America's largest opera companies. Drawing inspiration from a rich legacy built on the values of artistic excellence, engagement with a broad community, and a thriving future for the art form of opera and its audiences, Washington National Opera performs fall and spring seasons, and offers training, educational, and enrichment programs year-round.The 2012-2013 season features Anna Bolena, Don Giovanni, Manon Lescaut, Norma, and Show Boat, as well as concerts featuring Nathan Gunn, Diana Damrau, and Angela Meade.

The Kennedy Center has also co-produced new operas such as John Adams' Nixon in China, and brought such international opera companies as La Scala in its first-ever visit to the United States and Deutsche Opera Berlin in a complete “Ring” cycle. Beginning in 2001, the Center presented the Mariinsky Opera in annual performances over 10 years and continues to present the Mariinsky Ballet.

The Kennedy Center presents festivals celebrating cities, countries, and regions of the world, including the San Francisco and Texas festivals, France Danse, Festival Australia, the Arts of Japan, the Kennedy Center African Odyssey, Art of the State: Israel at 50, Island: Arts from Ireland, UK/KC, celebrating the arts of the United Kingdom, the Tchaikovsky Festival, the French Festival, and AmericArtes, celebrating the arts of the Americas. Other festivals include Look Both Ways: Street Arts Across America, a free, two-week celebration of street performance that took place throughout Washington, D.C., a month-long salute to the traditional, and contemporary arts of China; Country: A Celebration of America's Music, a highly praised three-week festival; a six-month, citywide celebration Shakespeare in Washington; and an exploration of the culture of Japan entitled JAPAN! culture + hyperculture. Recent seasons have seen an exploration of the culture of the 22 Arab nations entitled Arabesque: Arts of the Arab World, an international festival featuring artists with disabilities titled the 2010 International VSA Festival, and maximum INDIA, which celebrated the cultural heritage of one of the most populated countries in the world.

Kennedy Center Jazz, under the leadership of Artistic Advisor for Jazz Jason Moran, presents both legendary artists who have helped shape the art form as well as artists who are emerging on the jazz scene in more than 100 performances a year. The KC Jazz Club, launched in 2002, hosts many of these artists in an intimate setting. Annual Kennedy Center Jazz events include NPR's A Jazz Piano Christmas and the annual Mary Lou Williams Jazz Festival, the first comprehensive festival of this kind to be presented by a major cultural institution, created in 1996 by Dr. Billy Taylor. One of the largest non-profit jazz programs in the United States, Kennedy Center Jazz has produced numerous CD recordings.

The Center reaches millions of people every year through its television programs. These include Emmy and Peabody Award-winning The Kennedy Center Honors, broadcast annually on the CBS network, and The Kennedy Center Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, broadcast on PBS.   
The Eisenhower Theater

In recent years the Kennedy Center has dramatically expanded its education programs to reach young people, teachers, and families throughout the nation.  A clear sign of the Center's commitment to the arts for young people and families is the Family Theater, which opened in 2005. This state-of-the-art, accessible theater of 320 seats presents performances for young people. The education programs of the Kennedy Center have become models for communities across the country and have unlocked the door to learning for millions of young people. Education at the Kennedy Center produces and presents age appropriate performances and educational events for young people and their families; school- and community-based programs that directly impact teachers, students, artists, and school and arts administrators through professional development; systemic and school improvement through arts integrated curricula, inclusive classrooms, and universal design in facilities and learning; creating partnerships around the issues of arts education and arts integrated education; creating and providing educational materials via print and the Internet; and developing careers in the arts for young people and aspiring professionals.

Kennedy Center President Michael M. Kaiser founded the Kennedy Center Institute for Arts Management—renamed the DeVos Institute of Arts Management at the Kennedy Center following a $22.5 million commitment from the DeVos Foundation in May 2010—which offers practical training to arts managers and board members at all stages of professional development in the United States and around the world. These programs, which stress core competency in strategic planning, artistic planning, marketing, fundraising, and financial management, have reached arts leaders from more than 70 countries.

                    The Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress is a unique nonpartisan, nonprofit policy and education organization that applies strategic thinking and the leadership lessons of history to critical national challenges and opportunities.

Founded in 1965, the Center is the only organization that systematically examines past successes and failures of the Presidency and relates its findings to present challenges and opportunities. Today, both the Executive and Legislative Branches are highly compartmentalized, which is the enemy of strategic thinking, action, and the best use of resources. In addition, the nation is polarized, even though public opinion polls show a desire to break down barriers and face our nation's real public policy issues. Lessons learned from past American experiences offer insights on how to deal with these challenges.

Inner-City Scholarship Fund


                  Even in the best of circumstances, growing up can present real challenges. For inner-city school children these challenges are multiplied many times over and are often overwhelming. Inner-City Scholarship Fund (ICSF) helps remove the fundamental challenge of getting a good education in a safe, secure environment in New York City. Nearly 70% of the students enrolled in the 93 designated elementary and secondary inner-city schools in Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island come from homes living at or below the federal poverty line - the average scholarship recipient's family income is approximately $24,000 per year. Over 50% of ICSF students come from single-parent households. Despite these impediments, our Catholic schools – in partnership with our donors – enable our students and their families to overcome enormous odds and break the cycle of poverty through education.

Early life and education[edit]
Schwarzman was raised in a Jewish family[4][5] in Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania, the son of Arline and Joseph Schwarzman. His father owned Schwarzman's, a former dry-goods store in Philadelphia, and was a graduate of Wharton Business School.[6]
Schwarzman attended the Abington School District in suburban Philadelphia and graduated from Abington Senior High School in 1965.[7] He attended Yale University during the same period as George W. Bush, one year behind him (both were in the Skull and Bones society)[8][9] and graduated in 1969. He then went on to Harvard Business School and graduated in 1972.[10]
Investment career[edit]
Schwarzman's first job in financial services was with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, a now defunct investment bank. After business school, Schwarzman started working at the investment bank Lehman Brothers, where he reached the rank of managing director at age 31.[11] He eventually became the head of Lehman Brothers' global mergers and acquisitions team. In 1985, Schwarzman and his boss Peter Peterson started Blackstone, which originally focused on mergers and acquisitions.[12][13]
When Blackstone went public in June 2007, it revealed in a securities filing that Schwarzman had earned about $398.3 million in fiscal 2006.[14][15] He ultimately received $684 million selling part of his Blackstone stake in the IPO, keeping a stake then worth $9.1 billion.[16]
Schwarzman has served as an adjunct professor at the Yale School of Management and was chairman of the board of Trustees of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts from 2004 to 2010.
In June 2007, Schwarzman described his view on financial markets with the statement: "I want war, not a series of skirmishes... I always think about what will kill off the other bidder."[17]
In August 2010, Schwarzman compared the Obama administration's plan to raise carried interest taxes to Hitler's invasion of Poland in 1939, a comment for which Schwarzman later apologized.[18][19]
In September 2011, Schwarzman was listed as a member of the International Advisory Board of the Russian Direct Investment Fund.[20][21]
Among Blackstone's largest investments were SeaWorld Parks, in 2009. SeaWorld Parks were the focus of the 2013 film Blackfish, a documentary on Killer Whale attacks at these parks and the ethics of keeping them captive. When asked about the film, Schwarzman said on record that SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau should be blamed for her own death, claiming that the veteran animal trainer broke multiple safety rules before she was pulled into a tank and killed by a six-ton orca in February 2010. Blackstone said in a written statement that Schwarzman "misspoke" in response to the question about Blackfish. The firm said its chief executive had not anticipated a question about the film and had not been briefed on the subject. The firm said Schwarzman does not plan to go back on CNBC to correct the record on air.[22][23] SeaWorld, for its part, said unequivocally that Brancheau bore no blame. "Dawn was one of the world's most skilled and experienced marine mammal trainers. Her dedication to safety was among the many reasons she was so respected by her colleagues at SeaWorld and within the worldwide animal training community," the company said in a written statement. "We have never said and do not believe that she was at fault for the events of February 24, 2010."[22][23]
Personal life[edit]
Schwarzman met his first wife, Ellen Philips, during his second year at Harvard Business School, where she worked as a researcher and helped grade essays. She was the daughter of Jesse Philips, a wealthy Ohio industrialist. They were married in 1971 and divorced in 1990. They had two children:[24][25]

Elizabeth (born 1976), married in November 2005 to Andrew Curtis Right.[26]
Edward Frank also known as Teddy (born 1979), married in November 2007 to Ellen Marie Zajac.[27]

In 1995, Schwarzman married Christine Hearst, an intellectual-property lawyer who grew up on Long Island. She was the daughter of Peggie and Peter Mularchuk of Hicksville, New York. Her father was a fireman.[25] She was recently divorced from Austin Hearst, grandson of newspaper tycoon Randolph Hearst. Rabbi Bertram Siegel co-officiated along with the Rev. Sam Matarazzo, a Roman Catholic priest.[6] She has one child from a previous marriage.[17]
He lives in a duplex apartment at 740 Park Avenue previously owned by the Mayflower descendent George Brewster and by John D. Rockefeller Jr. Schwarzman purchased the apartment from Saul Steinberg in 2000 for just under $30 million.[28] However, an article in The New Yorker claims that the apartment was purchased for $37 million.[29]
On February 13, 2007, Schwarzman celebrated his 60th birthday at the Armory on Park Avenue. Guests included Colin Powell, Mayor of New York City Michael Bloomberg, Donald Trump, and Cardinal Edward M. Egan of New York. The climax of the evening was a half-hour live performance by Rod Stewart, for which he was reportedly paid $1 million.[30][31][32][33] In February, 2017, he had lavish 70th birthday party in Florida, estimated to have cost $5–7 million.[34]
Political and economic views[edit]
Schwarzman is a Republican. He is a long-time friend of President Donald Trump and provides outside counsel,[35] and currently chairs President Donald Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum.[3] In response to criticism for his involvement with the Trump administration, Schwarzman penned a letter to current Schwarzman Scholars, arguing that "having influence and providing sound advice is a good thing, even if it attracts criticism or requires some sacrifice."[3]
In early 2016, he said that in a two-candidate race he would prefer Donald Trump to Ted Cruz, saying that the nation needed a "cohesive, healing presidency, not one that's lurching either to the right or to the left".[36] He had previously made a donation to Marco Rubio in 2014. He also endorsed and fundraised for Mitt Romney in 2012.[37]
In 2010, Schwarzman drew controversy for comparing President Obama's proposal to increase taxation on 'carried interest' profits to Hitler's invasion of Poland in 1939. Schwarzman later apologized for the analogy.[38][39]
He raised $100,000 for George W. Bush.[40]
Wealth and philanthropy[edit]
According to Forbes Magazine, he has a net worth of $11.2 billion USD as of January 2017.[41] In 2014, Schwarzman was named as one of Bloomberg's 50 Most Influential people of the year.[42] In 2016, Schwarzman was again named as one of Bloomberg's 50 Most Influential people of the year.[43] In 2004, Schwarzman donated a new football stadium to Abington Senior High School—the Stephen A. Schwarzman Stadium.[44] In 2007, Schwarzman was listed among Time Magazine's 100 Most Influential People in The World.[45]
On March 11, 2008 Schwarzman announced that he contributed $100 million toward the expansion of the New York Public Library, for which he serves as a trustee. The central reference building on 42nd Street and Fifth Avenue was renamed The Stephen A. Schwarzman Building.[46]
On May 11, 2015 Peter Salovey, the President of Yale University, announced that Schwarzman contributed $150 million to fund a campus center in the university's historic "Commons" dining facility.[47][48] Additionally, Schwarzman is also a member of the Berggruen Institute's 21st Century Council.[49]
Schwarzman Scholars[edit]
Main article: Schwarzman Scholars
On April 21, 2013, Schwarzman announced a $100 million personal gift to establish and endow a scholarship program in China, Schwarzman Scholars, modeled after the Rhodes Scholarship program. Schwarzman simultaneously announced a fundraising campaign with a goal of $200 million. The Schwarzman Scholars program will be housed at Tsinghua University, one of China's most prestigious universities. The first class of 100 students is slated for 2016, upon completion of Schwarzman College, designed by Robert A. M. Stern, Dean of the Yale School of Architecture.[50] In January 2016, Schwarzman was on the cover of the Shanghai Business Review to share his vision about the Chinese economy against the backdrop of his scholarship.[51] The story was supported by Kevin Rudd, former Prime Minister of Australia and on the International Advisory Board of Schwarzman Scholars.
President Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum[edit]
Main article: Strategic and Policy Forum
In late 2016, Schwarzman "helped put together a team of corporate executives to advise [President Donald Trump] on jobs and the economy. The group includes JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, Walt Disney (DIS) boss Bob Iger and former GE leader Jack Welch."[52][53] In February, Schwarzman was named as Chair of the 16-member President's Strategic and Policy Forum, which brings together "CEOs of America's biggest corporations, banks and investment firms" to consult with the President on "how to create jobs and improve growth for the U.S. economy".[54]
Infrastructure Funds: Blackstone and Saudi Arabia[edit]
Increasingly large investors such as Blackstone, are investing in infrastructure such as airports, public works, and railways. Blackstone with "$360 billion in assets" is expanding into infrastructure investments.[55] The Blackstone Group joined forces with Saudi Arabia in May 2017, establishing a $40 billion infrastructure fund to invest in stateside infrastructure projects. Saudi Arabia will provide 50% of the fund which could lead to "$100 billion in total infrastructure investments on a leveraged basis".[55]

Early life and education[edit]
Schwarzman was raised in a Jewish family[4][5] in Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania, the son of Arline and Joseph Schwarzman. His father owned Schwarzman's, a former dry-goods store in Philadelphia, and was a graduate of Wharton Business School.[6]
Schwarzman attended the Abington School District in suburban Philadelphia and graduated from Abington Senior High School in 1965.[7] He attended Yale University during the same period as George W. Bush, one year behind him (both were in the Skull and Bones society)[8][9] and graduated in 1969. He then went on to Harvard Business School and graduated in 1972.[10]
Investment career[edit]
Schwarzman's first job in financial services was with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, a now defunct investment bank. After business school, Schwarzman started working at the investment bank Lehman Brothers, where he reached the rank of managing director at age 31.[11] He eventually became the head of Lehman Brothers' global mergers and acquisitions team. In 1985, Schwarzman and his boss Peter Peterson started Blackstone, which originally focused on mergers and acquisitions.[12][13]
When Blackstone went public in June 2007, it revealed in a securities filing that Schwarzman had earned about $398.3 million in fiscal 2006.[14][15] He ultimately received $684 million selling part of his Blackstone stake in the IPO, keeping a stake then worth $9.1 billion.[16]
Schwarzman has served as an adjunct professor at the Yale School of Management and was chairman of the board of Trustees of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts from 2004 to 2010.
In June 2007, Schwarzman described his view on financial markets with the statement: "I want war, not a series of skirmishes... I always think about what will kill off the other bidder."[17]
In August 2010, Schwarzman compared the Obama administration's plan to raise carried interest taxes to Hitler's invasion of Poland in 1939, a comment for which Schwarzman later apologized.[18][19]
In September 2011, Schwarzman was listed as a member of the International Advisory Board of the Russian Direct Investment Fund.[20][21]
Among Blackstone's largest investments were SeaWorld Parks, in 2009. SeaWorld Parks were the focus of the 2013 film Blackfish, a documentary on Killer Whale attacks at these parks and the ethics of keeping them captive. When asked about the film, Schwarzman said on record that SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau should be blamed for her own death, claiming that the veteran animal trainer broke multiple safety rules before she was pulled into a tank and killed by a six-ton orca in February 2010. Blackstone said in a written statement that Schwarzman "misspoke" in response to the question about Blackfish. The firm said its chief executive had not anticipated a question about the film and had not been briefed on the subject. The firm said Schwarzman does not plan to go back on CNBC to correct the record on air.[22][23] SeaWorld, for its part, said unequivocally that Brancheau bore no blame. "Dawn was one of the world's most skilled and experienced marine mammal trainers. Her dedication to safety was among the many reasons she was so respected by her colleagues at SeaWorld and within the worldwide animal training community," the company said in a written statement. "We have never said and do not believe that she was at fault for the events of February 24, 2010."[22][23]
Personal life[edit]
Schwarzman met his first wife, Ellen Philips, during his second year at Harvard Business School, where she worked as a researcher and helped grade essays. She was the daughter of Jesse Philips, a wealthy Ohio industrialist. They were married in 1971 and divorced in 1990. They had two children:[24][25]

Elizabeth (born 1976), married in November 2005 to Andrew Curtis Right.[26]
Edward Frank also known as Teddy (born 1979), married in November 2007 to Ellen Marie Zajac.[27]

In 1995, Schwarzman married Christine Hearst, an intellectual-property lawyer who grew up on Long Island. She was the daughter of Peggie and Peter Mularchuk of Hicksville, New York. Her father was a fireman.[25] She was recently divorced from Austin Hearst, grandson of newspaper tycoon Randolph Hearst. Rabbi Bertram Siegel co-officiated along with the Rev. Sam Matarazzo, a Roman Catholic priest.[6] She has one child from a previous marriage.[17]
He lives in a duplex apartment at 740 Park Avenue previously owned by the Mayflower descendent George Brewster and by John D. Rockefeller Jr. Schwarzman purchased the apartment from Saul Steinberg in 2000 for just under $30 million.[28] However, an article in The New Yorker claims that the apartment was purchased for $37 million.[29]
On February 13, 2007, Schwarzman celebrated his 60th birthday at the Armory on Park Avenue. Guests included Colin Powell, Mayor of New York City Michael Bloomberg, Donald Trump, and Cardinal Edward M. Egan of New York. The climax of the evening was a half-hour live performance by Rod Stewart, for which he was reportedly paid $1 million.[30][31][32][33] In February, 2017, he had lavish 70th birthday party in Florida, estimated to have cost $5–7 million.[34]
Political and economic views[edit]
Schwarzman is a Republican. He is a long-time friend of President Donald Trump and provides outside counsel,[35] and currently chairs President Donald Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum.[3] In response to criticism for his involvement with the Trump administration, Schwarzman penned a letter to current Schwarzman Scholars, arguing that "having influence and providing sound advice is a good thing, even if it attracts criticism or requires some sacrifice."[3]
In early 2016, he said that in a two-candidate race he would prefer Donald Trump to Ted Cruz, saying that the nation needed a "cohesive, healing presidency, not one that's lurching either to the right or to the left".[36] He had previously made a donation to Marco Rubio in 2014. He also endorsed and fundraised for Mitt Romney in 2012.[37]
In 2010, Schwarzman drew controversy for comparing President Obama's proposal to increase taxation on 'carried interest' profits to Hitler's invasion of Poland in 1939. Schwarzman later apologized for the analogy.[38][39]
He raised $100,000 for George W. Bush.[40]
Wealth and philanthropy[edit]
According to Forbes Magazine, he has a net worth of $11.2 billion USD as of January 2017.[41] In 2014, Schwarzman was named as one of Bloomberg's 50 Most Influential people of the year.[42] In 2016, Schwarzman was again named as one of Bloomberg's 50 Most Influential people of the year.[43] In 2004, Schwarzman donated a new football stadium to Abington Senior High School—the Stephen A. Schwarzman Stadium.[44] In 2007, Schwarzman was listed among Time Magazine's 100 Most Influential People in The World.[45]
On March 11, 2008 Schwarzman announced that he contributed $100 million toward the expansion of the New York Public Library, for which he serves as a trustee. The central reference building on 42nd Street and Fifth Avenue was renamed The Stephen A. Schwarzman Building.[46]
On May 11, 2015 Peter Salovey, the President of Yale University, announced that Schwarzman contributed $150 million to fund a campus center in the university's historic "Commons" dining facility.[47][48] Additionally, Schwarzman is also a member of the Berggruen Institute's 21st Century Council.[49]
Schwarzman Scholars[edit]
Main article: Schwarzman Scholars
On April 21, 2013, Schwarzman announced a $100 million personal gift to establish and endow a scholarship program in China, Schwarzman Scholars, modeled after the Rhodes Scholarship program. Schwarzman simultaneously announced a fundraising campaign with a goal of $200 million. The Schwarzman Scholars program will be housed at Tsinghua University, one of China's most prestigious universities. The first class of 100 students is slated for 2016, upon completion of Schwarzman College, designed by Robert A. M. Stern, Dean of the Yale School of Architecture.[50] In January 2016, Schwarzman was on the cover of the Shanghai Business Review to share his vision about the Chinese economy against the backdrop of his scholarship.[51] The story was supported by Kevin Rudd, former Prime Minister of Australia and on the International Advisory Board of Schwarzman Scholars.
President Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum[edit]
Main article: Strategic and Policy Forum
In late 2016, Schwarzman "helped put together a team of corporate executives to advise [President Donald Trump] on jobs and the economy. The group includes JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, Walt Disney (DIS) boss Bob Iger and former GE leader Jack Welch."[52][53] In February, Schwarzman was named as Chair of the 16-member President's Strategic and Policy Forum, which brings together "CEOs of America's biggest corporations, banks and investment firms" to consult with the President on "how to create jobs and improve growth for the U.S. economy".[54]
Infrastructure Funds: Blackstone and Saudi Arabia[edit]
Increasingly large investors such as Blackstone, are investing in infrastructure such as airports, public works, and railways. Blackstone with "$360 billion in assets" is expanding into infrastructure investments.[55] The Blackstone Group joined forces with Saudi Arabia in May 2017, establishing a $40 billion infrastructure fund to invest in stateside infrastructure projects. Saudi Arabia will provide 50% of the fund which could lead to "$100 billion in total infrastructure investments on a leveraged basis".[55]

Stern, Dean of the Yale School of Architecture.[50] In January 2016, Schwarzman was on the cover of the Shanghai Business Review to share his vision about the Chinese economy against the backdrop of his scholarship.[51] The story was supported by Kevin Rudd, former Prime Minister of Australia and on the International Advisory Board of Schwarzman Scholars.
President Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum[edit]
Main article: Strategic and Policy Forum
In late 2016, Schwarzman "helped put together a team of corporate executives to advise [President Donald Trump] on jobs and the economy. The group includes JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, Walt Disney (DIS) boss Bob Iger and former GE leader Jack Welch."[52][53] In February, Schwarzman was named as Chair of the 16-member President's Strategic and Policy Forum, which brings together "CEOs of America's biggest corporations, banks and investment firms" to consult with the President on "how to create jobs and improve growth for the U.S. economy".[54]
Infrastructure Funds: Blackstone and Saudi Arabia[edit]
Increasingly large investors such as Blackstone, are investing in infrastructure such as airports, public works, and railways. Blackstone with "$360 billion in assets" is expanding into infrastructure investments.[55] The Blackstone Group joined forces with Saudi Arabia in May 2017, establishing a $40 billion infrastructure fund to invest in stateside infrastructure projects. Saudi Arabia will provide 50% of the fund which could lead to "$100 billion in total infrastructure investments on a leveraged basis".[55]

Early life and education[edit]
Schwarzman was raised in a Jewish family[4][5] in Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania, the son of Arline and Joseph Schwarzman. His father owned Schwarzman's, a former dry-goods store in Philadelphia, and was a graduate of Wharton Business School.[6]
Schwarzman attended the Abington School District in suburban Philadelphia and graduated from Abington Senior High School in 1965.[7] He attended Yale University during the same period as George W. Bush, one year behind him (both were in the Skull and Bones society)[8][9] and graduated in 1969. He then went on to Harvard Business School and graduated in 1972.[10]
Investment career[edit]
Schwarzman's first job in financial services was with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, a now defunct investment bank. After business school, Schwarzman started working at the investment bank Lehman Brothers, where he reached the rank of managing director at age 31.[11] He eventually became the head of Lehman Brothers' global mergers and acquisitions team. In 1985, Schwarzman and his boss Peter Peterson started Blackstone, which originally focused on mergers and acquisitions.[12][13]
When Blackstone went public in June 2007, it revealed in a securities filing that Schwarzman had earned about $398.3 million in fiscal 2006.[14][15] He ultimately received $684 million selling part of his Blackstone stake in the IPO, keeping a stake then worth $9.1 billion.[16]
Schwarzman has served as an adjunct professor at the Yale School of Management and was chairman of the board of Trustees of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts from 2004 to 2010.
In June 2007, Schwarzman described his view on financial markets with the statement: "I want war, not a series of skirmishes... I always think about what will kill off the other bidder."[17]
In August 2010, Schwarzman compared the Obama administration's plan to raise carried interest taxes to Hitler's invasion of Poland in 1939, a comment for which Schwarzman later apologized.[18][19]
In September 2011, Schwarzman was listed as a member of the International Advisory Board of the Russian Direct Investment Fund.[20][21]
Among Blackstone's largest investments were SeaWorld Parks, in 2009. SeaWorld Parks were the focus of the 2013 film Blackfish, a documentary on Killer Whale attacks at these parks and the ethics of keeping them captive. When asked about the film, Schwarzman said on record that SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau should be blamed for her own death, claiming that the veteran animal trainer broke multiple safety rules before she was pulled into a tank and killed by a six-ton orca in February 2010. Blackstone said in a written statement that Schwarzman "misspoke" in response to the question about Blackfish. The firm said its chief executive had not anticipated a question about the film and had not been briefed on the subject. The firm said Schwarzman does not plan to go back on CNBC to correct the record on air.[22][23] SeaWorld, for its part, said unequivocally that Brancheau bore no blame. "Dawn was one of the world's most skilled and experienced marine mammal trainers. Her dedication to safety was among the many reasons she was so respected by her colleagues at SeaWorld and within the worldwide animal training community," the company said in a written statement. "We have never said and do not believe that she was at fault for the events of February 24, 2010."[22][23]
Personal life[edit]
Schwarzman met his first wife, Ellen Philips, during his second year at Harvard Business School, where she worked as a researcher and helped grade essays. She was the daughter of Jesse Philips, a wealthy Ohio industrialist. They were married in 1971 and divorced in 1990. They had two children:[24][25]

Elizabeth (born 1976), married in November 2005 to Andrew Curtis Right.[26]
Edward Frank also known as Teddy (born 1979), married in November 2007 to Ellen Marie Zajac.[27]

In 1995, Schwarzman married Christine Hearst, an intellectual-property lawyer who grew up on Long Island. She was the daughter of Peggie and Peter Mularchuk of Hicksville, New York. Her father was a fireman.[25] She was recently divorced from Austin Hearst, grandson of newspaper tycoon Randolph Hearst. Rabbi Bertram Siegel co-officiated along with the Rev. Sam Matarazzo, a Roman Catholic priest.[6] She has one child from a previous marriage.[17]
He lives in a duplex apartment at 740 Park Avenue previously owned by the Mayflower descendent George Brewster and by John D. Rockefeller Jr. Schwarzman purchased the apartment from Saul Steinberg in 2000 for just under $30 million.[28] However, an article in The New Yorker claims that the apartment was purchased for $37 million.[29]
On February 13, 2007, Schwarzman celebrated his 60th birthday at the Armory on Park Avenue. Guests included Colin Powell, Mayor of New York City Michael Bloomberg, Donald Trump, and Cardinal Edward M. Egan of New York. The climax of the evening was a half-hour live performance by Rod Stewart, for which he was reportedly paid $1 million.[30][31][32][33] In February, 2017, he had lavish 70th birthday party in Florida, estimated to have cost $5–7 million.[34]
Political and economic views[edit]
Schwarzman is a Republican. He is a long-time friend of President Donald Trump and provides outside counsel,[35] and currently chairs President Donald Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum.[3] In response to criticism for his involvement with the Trump administration, Schwarzman penned a letter to current Schwarzman Scholars, arguing that "having influence and providing sound advice is a good thing, even if it attracts criticism or requires some sacrifice."[3]
In early 2016, he said that in a two-candidate race he would prefer Donald Trump to Ted Cruz, saying that the nation needed a "cohesive, healing presidency, not one that's lurching either to the right or to the left".[36] He had previously made a donation to Marco Rubio in 2014. He also endorsed and fundraised for Mitt Romney in 2012.[37]
In 2010, Schwarzman drew controversy for comparing President Obama's proposal to increase taxation on 'carried interest' profits to Hitler's invasion of Poland in 1939. Schwarzman later apologized for the analogy.[38][39]
He raised $100,000 for George W. Bush.[40]
Wealth and philanthropy[edit]
According to Forbes Magazine, he has a net worth of $11.2 billion USD as of January 2017.[41] In 2014, Schwarzman was named as one of Bloomberg's 50 Most Influential people of the year.[42] In 2016, Schwarzman was again named as one of Bloomberg's 50 Most Influential people of the year.[43] In 2004, Schwarzman donated a new football stadium to Abington Senior High School—the Stephen A. Schwarzman Stadium.[44] In 2007, Schwarzman was listed among Time Magazine's 100 Most Influential People in The World.[45]
On March 11, 2008 Schwarzman announced that he contributed $100 million toward the expansion of the New York Public Library, for which he serves as a trustee. The central reference building on 42nd Street and Fifth Avenue was renamed The Stephen A. Schwarzman Building.[46]
On May 11, 2015 Peter Salovey, the President of Yale University, announced that Schwarzman contributed $150 million to fund a campus center in the university's historic "Commons" dining facility.[47][48] Additionally, Schwarzman is also a member of the Berggruen Institute's 21st Century Council.[49]
Schwarzman Scholars[edit]
Main article: Schwarzman Scholars
On April 21, 2013, Schwarzman announced a $100 million personal gift to establish and endow a scholarship program in China, Schwarzman Scholars, modeled after the Rhodes Scholarship program. Schwarzman simultaneously announced a fundraising campaign with a goal of $200 million. The Schwarzman Scholars program will be housed at Tsinghua University, one of China's most prestigious universities. The first class of 100 students is slated for 2016, upon completion of Schwarzman College, designed by Robert A. M. Stern, Dean of the Yale School of Architecture.[50] In January 2016, Schwarzman was on the cover of the Shanghai Business Review to share his vision about the Chinese economy against the backdrop of his scholarship.[51] The story was supported by Kevin Rudd, former Prime Minister of Australia and on the International Advisory Board of Schwarzman Scholars.
President Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum[edit]
Main article: Strategic and Policy Forum
In late 2016, Schwarzman "helped put together a team of corporate executives to advise [President Donald Trump] on jobs and the economy. The group includes JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, Walt Disney (DIS) boss Bob Iger and former GE leader Jack Welch."[52][53] In February, Schwarzman was named as Chair of the 16-member President's Strategic and Policy Forum, which brings together "CEOs of America's biggest corporations, banks and investment firms" to consult with the President on "how to create jobs and improve growth for the U.S. economy".[54]
Infrastructure Funds: Blackstone and Saudi Arabia[edit]
Increasingly large investors such as Blackstone, are investing in infrastructure such as airports, public works, and railways. Blackstone with "$360 billion in assets" is expanding into infrastructure investments.[55] The Blackstone Group joined forces with Saudi Arabia in May 2017, establishing a $40 billion infrastructure fund to invest in stateside infrastructure projects. Saudi Arabia will provide 50% of the fund which could lead to "$100 billion in total infrastructure investments on a leveraged basis".[55]

Early life and education[edit]
Schwarzman was raised in a Jewish family[4][5] in Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania, the son of Arline and Joseph Schwarzman. His father owned Schwarzman's, a former dry-goods store in Philadelphia, and was a graduate of Wharton Business School.[6]
Schwarzman attended the Abington School District in suburban Philadelphia and graduated from Abington Senior High School in 1965.[7] He attended Yale University during the same period as George W. Bush, one year behind him (both were in the Skull and Bones society)[8][9] and graduated in 1969. He then went on to Harvard Business School and graduated in 1972.[10]
Investment career[edit]
Schwarzman's first job in financial services was with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, a now defunct investment bank. After business school, Schwarzman started working at the investment bank Lehman Brothers, where he reached the rank of managing director at age 31.[11] He eventually became the head of Lehman Brothers' global mergers and acquisitions team. In 1985, Schwarzman and his boss Peter Peterson started Blackstone, which originally focused on mergers and acquisitions.[12][13]
When Blackstone went public in June 2007, it revealed in a securities filing that Schwarzman had earned about $398.3 million in fiscal 2006.[14][15] He ultimately received $684 million selling part of his Blackstone stake in the IPO, keeping a stake then worth $9.1 billion.[16]
Schwarzman has served as an adjunct professor at the Yale School of Management and was chairman of the board of Trustees of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts from 2004 to 2010.
In June 2007, Schwarzman described his view on financial markets with the statement: "I want war, not a series of skirmishes... I always think about what will kill off the other bidder."[17]
In August 2010, Schwarzman compared the Obama administration's plan to raise carried interest taxes to Hitler's invasion of Poland in 1939, a comment for which Schwarzman later apologized.[18][19]
In September 2011, Schwarzman was listed as a member of the International Advisory Board of the Russian Direct Investment Fund.[20][21]
Among Blackstone's largest investments were SeaWorld Parks, in 2009. SeaWorld Parks were the focus of the 2013 film Blackfish, a documentary on Killer Whale attacks at these parks and the ethics of keeping them captive. When asked about the film, Schwarzman said on record that SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau should be blamed for her own death, claiming that the veteran animal trainer broke multiple safety rules before she was pulled into a tank and killed by a six-ton orca in February 2010. Blackstone said in a written statement that Schwarzman "misspoke" in response to the question about Blackfish. The firm said its chief executive had not anticipated a question about the film and had not been briefed on the subject. The firm said Schwarzman does not plan to go back on CNBC to correct the record on air.[22][23] SeaWorld, for its part, said unequivocally that Brancheau bore no blame. "Dawn was one of the world's most skilled and experienced marine mammal trainers. Her dedication to safety was among the many reasons she was so respected by her colleagues at SeaWorld and within the worldwide animal training community," the company said in a written statement. "We have never said and do not believe that she was at fault for the events of February 24, 2010."[22][23]
Personal life[edit]
Schwarzman met his first wife, Ellen Philips, during his second year at Harvard Business School, where she worked as a researcher and helped grade essays. She was the daughter of Jesse Philips, a wealthy Ohio industrialist. They were married in 1971 and divorced in 1990. They had two children:[24][25]

Elizabeth (born 1976), married in November 2005 to Andrew Curtis Right.[26]
Edward Frank also known as Teddy (born 1979), married in November 2007 to Ellen Marie Zajac.[27]

In 1995, Schwarzman married Christine Hearst, an intellectual-property lawyer who grew up on Long Island. She was the daughter of Peggie and Peter Mularchuk of Hicksville, New York. Her father was a fireman.[25] She was recently divorced from Austin Hearst, grandson of newspaper tycoon Randolph Hearst. Rabbi Bertram Siegel co-officiated along with the Rev. Sam Matarazzo, a Roman Catholic priest.[6] She has one child from a previous marriage.[17]
He lives in a duplex apartment at 740 Park Avenue previously owned by the Mayflower descendent George Brewster and by John D. Rockefeller Jr. Schwarzman purchased the apartment from Saul Steinberg in 2000 for just under $30 million.[28] However, an article in The New Yorker claims that the apartment was purchased for $37 million.[29]
On February 13, 2007, Schwarzman celebrated his 60th birthday at the Armory on Park Avenue. Guests included Colin Powell, Mayor of New York City Michael Bloomberg, Donald Trump, and Cardinal Edward M. Egan of New York. The climax of the evening was a half-hour live performance by Rod Stewart, for which he was reportedly paid $1 million.[30][31][32][33] In February, 2017, he had lavish 70th birthday party in Florida, estimated to have cost $5–7 million.[34]
Political and economic views[edit]
Schwarzman is a Republican. He is a long-time friend of President Donald Trump and provides outside counsel,[35] and currently chairs President Donald Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum.[3] In response to criticism for his involvement with the Trump administration, Schwarzman penned a letter to current Schwarzman Scholars, arguing that "having influence and providing sound advice is a good thing, even if it attracts criticism or requires some sacrifice."[3]
In early 2016, he said that in a two-candidate race he would prefer Donald Trump to Ted Cruz, saying that the nation needed a "cohesive, healing presidency, not one that's lurching either to the right or to the left".[36] He had previously made a donation to Marco Rubio in 2014. He also endorsed and fundraised for Mitt Romney in 2012.[37]
In 2010, Schwarzman drew controversy for comparing President Obama's proposal to increase taxation on 'carried interest' profits to Hitler's invasion of Poland in 1939. Schwarzman later apologized for the analogy.[38][39]
He raised $100,000 for George W. Bush.[40]
Wealth and philanthropy[edit]
According to Forbes Magazine, he has a net worth of $11.2 billion USD as of January 2017.[41] In 2014, Schwarzman was named as one of Bloomberg's 50 Most Influential people of the year.[42] In 2016, Schwarzman was again named as one of Bloomberg's 50 Most Influential people of the year.[43] In 2004, Schwarzman donated a new football stadium to Abington Senior High School—the Stephen A. Schwarzman Stadium.[44] In 2007, Schwarzman was listed among Time Magazine's 100 Most Influential People in The World.[45]
On March 11, 2008 Schwarzman announced that he contributed $100 million toward the expansion of the New York Public Library, for which he serves as a trustee. The central reference building on 42nd Street and Fifth Avenue was renamed The Stephen A. Schwarzman Building.[46]
On May 11, 2015 Peter Salovey, the President of Yale University, announced that Schwarzman contributed $150 million to fund a campus center in the university's historic "Commons" dining facility.[47][48] Additionally, Schwarzman is also a member of the Berggruen Institute's 21st Century Council.[49]
Schwarzman Scholars[edit]
Main article: Schwarzman Scholars
On April 21, 2013, Schwarzman announced a $100 million personal gift to establish and endow a scholarship program in China, Schwarzman Scholars, modeled after the Rhodes Scholarship program. Schwarzman simultaneously announced a fundraising campaign with a goal of $200 million. The Schwarzman Scholars program will be housed at Tsinghua University, one of China's most prestigious universities. The first class of 100 students is slated for 2016, upon completion of Schwarzman College, designed by Robert A. M. Stern, Dean of the Yale School of Architecture.[50] In January 2016, Schwarzman was on the cover of the Shanghai Business Review to share his vision about the Chinese economy against the backdrop of his scholarship.[51] The story was supported by Kevin Rudd, former Prime Minister of Australia and on the International Advisory Board of Schwarzman Scholars.
President Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum[edit]
Main article: Strategic and Policy Forum
In late 2016, Schwarzman "helped put together a team of corporate executives to advise [President Donald Trump] on jobs and the economy. The group includes JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, Walt Disney (DIS) boss Bob Iger and former GE leader Jack Welch."[52][53] In February, Schwarzman was named as Chair of the 16-member President's Strategic and Policy Forum, which brings together "CEOs of America's biggest corporations, banks and investment firms" to consult with the President on "how to create jobs and improve growth for the U.S. economy".[54]
Infrastructure Funds: Blackstone and Saudi Arabia[edit]
Increasingly large investors such as Blackstone, are investing in infrastructure such as airports, public works, and railways. Blackstone with "$360 billion in assets" is expanding into infrastructure investments.[55] The Blackstone Group joined forces with Saudi Arabia in May 2017, establishing a $40 billion infrastructure fund to invest in stateside infrastructure projects. Saudi Arabia will provide 50% of the fund which could lead to "$100 billion in total infrastructure investments on a leveraged basis".[55]

Stephen Schwarzman, the chief executive of Blackstone, at the White House on Friday with President Trump.

            Al Drago/The New York Times        



For devotees of President Trump, the first gathering on Friday of his business council, which featured 17 executives, may have looked like a colorized version of “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,” but for those focusing exclusively on the rapport between the two leaders, it resembled “Goodfellas.”Sitting alongside Mr. Trump was the head of the council, Stephen Schwarzman, the chief executive of the private equity firm Blackstone Group, wearing Washington’s newly obligatory red tie. Since its founding in 1985, Blackstone has accumulated more than $361 billion in assets and made Mr. Schwartzman a fortune estimated at $11 billion — a figure that no doubt dwarfs whatever it is that Mr. Trump is worth. In 2015, Mr. Schwarzman was paid $799 million.Mr. Schwarzman has flourished during the four decades that the people Mr. Trump purports to represent have languished. In the pursuit once known as leveraged buyouts — before some marketing genius fastened on “private equity” as a way to disguise the fact that the business still rests on a mountain of debt — Mr. Schwarzman and his brethren have become symbols for the economic inequality that Mr. Trump deplored during his campaign. They are able to borrow billions and deduct interest payments from their corporate tax bills while $75,000-a-year wage earners in Ohio, Michigan or Pennsylvania are unable to secure a mortgage and get no tax break on their monthly rent.

Just like Mr. Trump’s real-estate business, groups like Blackstone rely on enormous debt to prop up their business. The playbook for any of their acquisitions is to gain 100 percent control by financing the purchase of a company with a small down payment and a heap of debt secured not (heaven forbid) by their own savings or houses, but by the business they are looking to acquire. They then cut costs — which almost always means making sizable layoffs at the company they’re taking over — and figure out a way to reward themselves financially.

It’s the equivalent of making a small down payment on your neighbors’ house; paying for the balance by taking out a mortgage secured by their savings, jewelry, silverware and car; selling off the contents of their property; and then siphoning off some of the loan for yourself.

Perhaps, after Friday’s meeting, traveling together aboard Air Force One to Mr. Trump’s club in Florida, Mr. Schwarzman explained to Mr. Trump that he could make America great again by employing the same tactics Blackstone used after its $4.1 billion acquisition in 2006 of Travelport, a travel-reservations business that within a year of the purchase had laid off 841 workers, or 10 percent of its work force.The story of this fiasco is enough to make anyone weep: Laid-off workers were forced to sell their homes; others lost their health insurance and postponed plans to start a family; some were stuck on unemployment lines. Even more brazenly, Blackstone, seven months after its investment, layered more debt on Travelport, which it used to pay itself back for the original purchase. Travelport subsequently underwent two restructurings of its debt.Firms like Blackstone will, with a straight face, argue that they are making American companies more efficient and that we are all better off as a result. Were that it were so. They do not advertise the fact that their principals benefit from an indefensible quirk in the United States tax code that allows them to pay lower taxes on their capital gains. (I also benefit from this quirk, albeit in a very different capacity, as an investor in Silicon Valley. I should stress that the opinions expressed in this piece don’t necessarily reflect those of Sequoia Capital.)In 2010 Mr. Schwarzman denounced an attempt to remove this loophole as comparable to Hitler’s invasion of Poland, a remark for which he later apologized. You will also not find any mention on Blackstone’s website that for the past 14 years all of its buyout funds — which together generate hundreds of millions of dollars a year for Mr. Schwarzman and his partners — have ranked among the top 25 percent of such funds.

This then was the backdrop for the agenda for the inaugural meeting of Mr. Trump’s business council. Little wonder that the agenda appeared to center on deregulation, the loosening of restrictions of the financial industry and stepped-up protectionism. No surprise either that missing from the menu was the abolition of the carried-interest loophole (a loophole Mr. Trump vowed to close during his campaign) and the deductibility of interest payments. It is wishful thinking that this group will ever contemplate anything so daring as to make private equity principals personally liable for the loans they assign to companies — a move that, with the stroke of a pen, would curb many abuses and protect American workers and others whose standard of living has barely budged in a couple of decades.The lower- and middle-income Americans who voted for Mr. Trump in droves would do well to listen hard to what Mr. Schwarzman is advising. They’ll hear the sound of dollars being sucked out of their pockets and slipped into the wallets of the 1 percent.

Early life and education[edit]
Schwarzman was raised in a Jewish family[4][5] in Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania, the son of Arline and Joseph Schwarzman. His father owned Schwarzman's, a former dry-goods store in Philadelphia, and was a graduate of Wharton Business School.[6]
Schwarzman attended the Abington School District in suburban Philadelphia and graduated from Abington Senior High School in 1965.[7] He attended Yale University during the same period as George W. Bush, one year behind him (both were in the Skull and Bones society)[8][9] and graduated in 1969. He then went on to Harvard Business School and graduated in 1972.[10]
Investment career[edit]
Schwarzman's first job in financial services was with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, a now defunct investment bank. After business school, Schwarzman started working at the investment bank Lehman Brothers, where he reached the rank of managing director at age 31.[11] He eventually became the head of Lehman Brothers' global mergers and acquisitions team. In 1985, Schwarzman and his boss Peter Peterson started Blackstone, which originally focused on mergers and acquisitions.[12][13]
When Blackstone went public in June 2007, it revealed in a securities filing that Schwarzman had earned about $398.3 million in fiscal 2006.[14][15] He ultimately received $684 million selling part of his Blackstone stake in the IPO, keeping a stake then worth $9.1 billion.[16]
Schwarzman has served as an adjunct professor at the Yale School of Management and was chairman of the board of Trustees of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts from 2004 to 2010.
In June 2007, Schwarzman described his view on financial markets with the statement: "I want war, not a series of skirmishes... I always think about what will kill off the other bidder."[17]
In August 2010, Schwarzman compared the Obama administration's plan to raise carried interest taxes to Hitler's invasion of Poland in 1939, a comment for which Schwarzman later apologized.[18][19]
In September 2011, Schwarzman was listed as a member of the International Advisory Board of the Russian Direct Investment Fund.[20][21]
Among Blackstone's largest investments were SeaWorld Parks, in 2009. SeaWorld Parks were the focus of the 2013 film Blackfish, a documentary on Killer Whale attacks at these parks and the ethics of keeping them captive. When asked about the film, Schwarzman said on record that SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau should be blamed for her own death, claiming that the veteran animal trainer broke multiple safety rules before she was pulled into a tank and killed by a six-ton orca in February 2010. Blackstone said in a written statement that Schwarzman "misspoke" in response to the question about Blackfish. The firm said its chief executive had not anticipated a question about the film and had not been briefed on the subject. The firm said Schwarzman does not plan to go back on CNBC to correct the record on air.[22][23] SeaWorld, for its part, said unequivocally that Brancheau bore no blame. "Dawn was one of the world's most skilled and experienced marine mammal trainers. Her dedication to safety was among the many reasons she was so respected by her colleagues at SeaWorld and within the worldwide animal training community," the company said in a written statement. "We have never said and do not believe that she was at fault for the events of February 24, 2010."[22][23]
Personal life[edit]
Schwarzman met his first wife, Ellen Philips, during his second year at Harvard Business School, where she worked as a researcher and helped grade essays. She was the daughter of Jesse Philips, a wealthy Ohio industrialist. They were married in 1971 and divorced in 1990. They had two children:[24][25]

Elizabeth (born 1976), married in November 2005 to Andrew Curtis Right.[26]
Edward Frank also known as Teddy (born 1979), married in November 2007 to Ellen Marie Zajac.[27]

In 1995, Schwarzman married Christine Hearst, an intellectual-property lawyer who grew up on Long Island. She was the daughter of Peggie and Peter Mularchuk of Hicksville, New York. Her father was a fireman.[25] She was recently divorced from Austin Hearst, grandson of newspaper tycoon Randolph Hearst. Rabbi Bertram Siegel co-officiated along with the Rev. Sam Matarazzo, a Roman Catholic priest.[6] She has one child from a previous marriage.[17]
He lives in a duplex apartment at 740 Park Avenue previously owned by the Mayflower descendent George Brewster and by John D. Rockefeller Jr. Schwarzman purchased the apartment from Saul Steinberg in 2000 for just under $30 million.[28] However, an article in The New Yorker claims that the apartment was purchased for $37 million.[29]
On February 13, 2007, Schwarzman celebrated his 60th birthday at the Armory on Park Avenue. Guests included Colin Powell, Mayor of New York City Michael Bloomberg, Donald Trump, and Cardinal Edward M. Egan of New York. The climax of the evening was a half-hour live performance by Rod Stewart, for which he was reportedly paid $1 million.[30][31][32][33] In February, 2017, he had lavish 70th birthday party in Florida, estimated to have cost $5–7 million.[34]
Political and economic views[edit]
Schwarzman is a Republican. He is a long-time friend of President Donald Trump and provides outside counsel,[35] and currently chairs President Donald Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum.[3] In response to criticism for his involvement with the Trump administration, Schwarzman penned a letter to current Schwarzman Scholars, arguing that "having influence and providing sound advice is a good thing, even if it attracts criticism or requires some sacrifice."[3]
In early 2016, he said that in a two-candidate race he would prefer Donald Trump to Ted Cruz, saying that the nation needed a "cohesive, healing presidency, not one that's lurching either to the right or to the left".[36] He had previously made a donation to Marco Rubio in 2014. He also endorsed and fundraised for Mitt Romney in 2012.[37]
In 2010, Schwarzman drew controversy for comparing President Obama's proposal to increase taxation on 'carried interest' profits to Hitler's invasion of Poland in 1939. Schwarzman later apologized for the analogy.[38][39]
He raised $100,000 for George W. Bush.[40]
Wealth and philanthropy[edit]
According to Forbes Magazine, he has a net worth of $11.2 billion USD as of January 2017.[41] In 2014, Schwarzman was named as one of Bloomberg's 50 Most Influential people of the year.[42] In 2016, Schwarzman was again named as one of Bloomberg's 50 Most Influential people of the year.[43] In 2004, Schwarzman donated a new football stadium to Abington Senior High School—the Stephen A. Schwarzman Stadium.[44] In 2007, Schwarzman was listed among Time Magazine's 100 Most Influential People in The World.[45]
On March 11, 2008 Schwarzman announced that he contributed $100 million toward the expansion of the New York Public Library, for which he serves as a trustee. The central reference building on 42nd Street and Fifth Avenue was renamed The Stephen A. Schwarzman Building.[46]
On May 11, 2015 Peter Salovey, the President of Yale University, announced that Schwarzman contributed $150 million to fund a campus center in the university's historic "Commons" dining facility.[47][48] Additionally, Schwarzman is also a member of the Berggruen Institute's 21st Century Council.[49]
Schwarzman Scholars[edit]
Main article: Schwarzman Scholars
On April 21, 2013, Schwarzman announced a $100 million personal gift to establish and endow a scholarship program in China, Schwarzman Scholars, modeled after the Rhodes Scholarship program. Schwarzman simultaneously announced a fundraising campaign with a goal of $200 million. The Schwarzman Scholars program will be housed at Tsinghua University, one of China's most prestigious universities. The first class of 100 students is slated for 2016, upon completion of Schwarzman College, designed by Robert A. M. Stern, Dean of the Yale School of Architecture.[50] In January 2016, Schwarzman was on the cover of the Shanghai Business Review to share his vision about the Chinese economy against the backdrop of his scholarship.[51] The story was supported by Kevin Rudd, former Prime Minister of Australia and on the International Advisory Board of Schwarzman Scholars.
President Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum[edit]
Main article: Strategic and Policy Forum
In late 2016, Schwarzman "helped put together a team of corporate executives to advise [President Donald Trump] on jobs and the economy. The group includes JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, Walt Disney (DIS) boss Bob Iger and former GE leader Jack Welch."[52][53] In February, Schwarzman was named as Chair of the 16-member President's Strategic and Policy Forum, which brings together "CEOs of America's biggest corporations, banks and investment firms" to consult with the President on "how to create jobs and improve growth for the U.S. economy".[54]
Infrastructure Funds: Blackstone and Saudi Arabia[edit]
Increasingly large investors such as Blackstone, are investing in infrastructure such as airports, public works, and railways. Blackstone with "$360 billion in assets" is expanding into infrastructure investments.[55] The Blackstone Group joined forces with Saudi Arabia in May 2017, establishing a $40 billion infrastructure fund to invest in stateside infrastructure projects. Saudi Arabia will provide 50% of the fund which could lead to "$100 billion in total infrastructure investments on a leveraged basis".[55]

Early life and education[edit]
Schwarzman was raised in a Jewish family[4][5] in Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania, the son of Arline and Joseph Schwarzman. His father owned Schwarzman's, a former dry-goods store in Philadelphia, and was a graduate of Wharton Business School.[6]
Schwarzman attended the Abington School District in suburban Philadelphia and graduated from Abington Senior High School in 1965.[7] He attended Yale University during the same period as George W. Bush, one year behind him (both were in the Skull and Bones society)[8][9] and graduated in 1969. He then went on to Harvard Business School and graduated in 1972.[10]
Investment career[edit]
Schwarzman's first job in financial services was with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, a now defunct investment bank. After business school, Schwarzman started working at the investment bank Lehman Brothers, where he reached the rank of managing director at age 31.[11] He eventually became the head of Lehman Brothers' global mergers and acquisitions team. In 1985, Schwarzman and his boss Peter Peterson started Blackstone, which originally focused on mergers and acquisitions.[12][13]
When Blackstone went public in June 2007, it revealed in a securities filing that Schwarzman had earned about $398.3 million in fiscal 2006.[14][15] He ultimately received $684 million selling part of his Blackstone stake in the IPO, keeping a stake then worth $9.1 billion.[16]
Schwarzman has served as an adjunct professor at the Yale School of Management and was chairman of the board of Trustees of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts from 2004 to 2010.
In June 2007, Schwarzman described his view on financial markets with the statement: "I want war, not a series of skirmishes... I always think about what will kill off the other bidder."[17]
In August 2010, Schwarzman compared the Obama administration's plan to raise carried interest taxes to Hitler's invasion of Poland in 1939, a comment for which Schwarzman later apologized.[18][19]
In September 2011, Schwarzman was listed as a member of the International Advisory Board of the Russian Direct Investment Fund.[20][21]
Among Blackstone's largest investments were SeaWorld Parks, in 2009. SeaWorld Parks were the focus of the 2013 film Blackfish, a documentary on Killer Whale attacks at these parks and the ethics of keeping them captive. When asked about the film, Schwarzman said on record that SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau should be blamed for her own death, claiming that the veteran animal trainer broke multiple safety rules before she was pulled into a tank and killed by a six-ton orca in February 2010. Blackstone said in a written statement that Schwarzman "misspoke" in response to the question about Blackfish. The firm said its chief executive had not anticipated a question about the film and had not been briefed on the subject. The firm said Schwarzman does not plan to go back on CNBC to correct the record on air.[22][23] SeaWorld, for its part, said unequivocally that Brancheau bore no blame. "Dawn was one of the world's most skilled and experienced marine mammal trainers. Her dedication to safety was among the many reasons she was so respected by her colleagues at SeaWorld and within the worldwide animal training community," the company said in a written statement. "We have never said and do not believe that she was at fault for the events of February 24, 2010."[22][23]
Personal life[edit]
Schwarzman met his first wife, Ellen Philips, during his second year at Harvard Business School, where she worked as a researcher and helped grade essays. She was the daughter of Jesse Philips, a wealthy Ohio industrialist. They were married in 1971 and divorced in 1990. They had two children:[24][25]

Elizabeth (born 1976), married in November 2005 to Andrew Curtis Right.[26]
Edward Frank also known as Teddy (born 1979), married in November 2007 to Ellen Marie Zajac.[27]

In 1995, Schwarzman married Christine Hearst, an intellectual-property lawyer who grew up on Long Island. She was the daughter of Peggie and Peter Mularchuk of Hicksville, New York. Her father was a fireman.[25] She was recently divorced from Austin Hearst, grandson of newspaper tycoon Randolph Hearst. Rabbi Bertram Siegel co-officiated along with the Rev. Sam Matarazzo, a Roman Catholic priest.[6] She has one child from a previous marriage.[17]
He lives in a duplex apartment at 740 Park Avenue previously owned by the Mayflower descendent George Brewster and by John D. Rockefeller Jr. Schwarzman purchased the apartment from Saul Steinberg in 2000 for just under $30 million.[28] However, an article in The New Yorker claims that the apartment was purchased for $37 million.[29]
On February 13, 2007, Schwarzman celebrated his 60th birthday at the Armory on Park Avenue. Guests included Colin Powell, Mayor of New York City Michael Bloomberg, Donald Trump, and Cardinal Edward M. Egan of New York. The climax of the evening was a half-hour live performance by Rod Stewart, for which he was reportedly paid $1 million.[30][31][32][33] In February, 2017, he had lavish 70th birthday party in Florida, estimated to have cost $5–7 million.[34]
Political and economic views[edit]
Schwarzman is a Republican. He is a long-time friend of President Donald Trump and provides outside counsel,[35] and currently chairs President Donald Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum.[3] In response to criticism for his involvement with the Trump administration, Schwarzman penned a letter to current Schwarzman Scholars, arguing that "having influence and providing sound advice is a good thing, even if it attracts criticism or requires some sacrifice."[3]
In early 2016, he said that in a two-candidate race he would prefer Donald Trump to Ted Cruz, saying that the nation needed a "cohesive, healing presidency, not one that's lurching either to the right or to the left".[36] He had previously made a donation to Marco Rubio in 2014. He also endorsed and fundraised for Mitt Romney in 2012.[37]
In 2010, Schwarzman drew controversy for comparing President Obama's proposal to increase taxation on 'carried interest' profits to Hitler's invasion of Poland in 1939. Schwarzman later apologized for the analogy.[38][39]
He raised $100,000 for George W. Bush.[40]
Wealth and philanthropy[edit]
According to Forbes Magazine, he has a net worth of $11.2 billion USD as of January 2017.[41] In 2014, Schwarzman was named as one of Bloomberg's 50 Most Influential people of the year.[42] In 2016, Schwarzman was again named as one of Bloomberg's 50 Most Influential people of the year.[43] In 2004, Schwarzman donated a new football stadium to Abington Senior High School—the Stephen A. Schwarzman Stadium.[44] In 2007, Schwarzman was listed among Time Magazine's 100 Most Influential People in The World.[45]
On March 11, 2008 Schwarzman announced that he contributed $100 million toward the expansion of the New York Public Library, for which he serves as a trustee. The central reference building on 42nd Street and Fifth Avenue was renamed The Stephen A. Schwarzman Building.[46]
On May 11, 2015 Peter Salovey, the President of Yale University, announced that Schwarzman contributed $150 million to fund a campus center in the university's historic "Commons" dining facility.[47][48] Additionally, Schwarzman is also a member of the Berggruen Institute's 21st Century Council.[49]
Schwarzman Scholars[edit]
Main article: Schwarzman Scholars
On April 21, 2013, Schwarzman announced a $100 million personal gift to establish and endow a scholarship program in China, Schwarzman Scholars, modeled after the Rhodes Scholarship program. Schwarzman simultaneously announced a fundraising campaign with a goal of $200 million. The Schwarzman Scholars program will be housed at Tsinghua University, one of China's most prestigious universities. The first class of 100 students is slated for 2016, upon completion of Schwarzman College, designed by Robert A. M. Stern, Dean of the Yale School of Architecture.[50] In January 2016, Schwarzman was on the cover of the Shanghai Business Review to share his vision about the Chinese economy against the backdrop of his scholarship.[51] The story was supported by Kevin Rudd, former Prime Minister of Australia and on the International Advisory Board of Schwarzman Scholars.
President Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum[edit]
Main article: Strategic and Policy Forum
In late 2016, Schwarzman "helped put together a team of corporate executives to advise [President Donald Trump] on jobs and the economy. The group includes JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, Walt Disney (DIS) boss Bob Iger and former GE leader Jack Welch."[52][53] In February, Schwarzman was named as Chair of the 16-member President's Strategic and Policy Forum, which brings together "CEOs of America's biggest corporations, banks and investment firms" to consult with the President on "how to create jobs and improve growth for the U.S. economy".[54]
Infrastructure Funds: Blackstone and Saudi Arabia[edit]
Increasingly large investors such as Blackstone, are investing in infrastructure such as airports, public works, and railways. Blackstone with "$360 billion in assets" is expanding into infrastructure investments.[55] The Blackstone Group joined forces with Saudi Arabia in May 2017, establishing a $40 billion infrastructure fund to invest in stateside infrastructure projects. Saudi Arabia will provide 50% of the fund which could lead to "$100 billion in total infrastructure investments on a leveraged basis".[55]

When Blackstone went public in June 2007, it revealed in a securities filing that Schwarzman had earned about $398.3 million in fiscal 2006.[14][15] He ultimately received $684 million selling part of his Blackstone stake in the IPO, keeping a stake then worth $9.1 billion.[16]
Schwarzman has served as an adjunct professor at the Yale School of Management and was chairman of the board of Trustees of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts from 2004 to 2010.
In June 2007, Schwarzman described his view on financial markets with the statement: "I want war, not a series of skirmishes... I always think about what will kill off the other bidder."[17]
In August 2010, Schwarzman compared the Obama administration's plan to raise carried interest taxes to Hitler's invasion of Poland in 1939, a comment for which Schwarzman later apologized.[18][19]
In September 2011, Schwarzman was listed as a member of the International Advisory Board of the Russian Direct Investment Fund.[20][21]
Among Blackstone's largest investments were SeaWorld Parks, in 2009. SeaWorld Parks were the focus of the 2013 film Blackfish, a documentary on Killer Whale attacks at these parks and the ethics of keeping them captive. When asked about the film, Schwarzman said on record that SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau should be blamed for her own death, claiming that the veteran animal trainer broke multiple safety rules before she was pulled into a tank and killed by a six-ton orca in February 2010. Blackstone said in a written statement that Schwarzman "misspoke" in response to the question about Blackfish. The firm said its chief executive had not anticipated a question about the film and had not been briefed on the subject. The firm said Schwarzman does not plan to go back on CNBC to correct the record on air.[22][23] SeaWorld, for its part, said unequivocally that Brancheau bore no blame. "Dawn was one of the world's most skilled and experienced marine mammal trainers. Her dedication to safety was among the many reasons she was so respected by her colleagues at SeaWorld and within the worldwide animal training community," the company said in a written statement. "We have never said and do not believe that she was at fault for the events of February 24, 2010."[22][23]
Personal life[edit]
Schwarzman met his first wife, Ellen Philips, during his second year at Harvard Business School, where she worked as a researcher and helped grade essays. She was the daughter of Jesse Philips, a wealthy Ohio industrialist. They were married in 1971 and divorced in 1990. They had two children:[24][25]

Elizabeth (born 1976), married in November 2005 to Andrew Curtis Right.[26]
Edward Frank also known as Teddy (born 1979), married in November 2007 to Ellen Marie Zajac.[27]

In 1995, Schwarzman married Christine Hearst, an intellectual-property lawyer who grew up on Long Island. She was the daughter of Peggie and Peter Mularchuk of Hicksville, New York. Her father was a fireman.[25] She was recently divorced from Austin Hearst, grandson of newspaper tycoon Randolph Hearst. Rabbi Bertram Siegel co-officiated along with the Rev. Sam Matarazzo, a Roman Catholic priest.[6] She has one child from a previous marriage.[17]
He lives in a duplex apartment at 740 Park Avenue previously owned by the Mayflower descendent George Brewster and by John D. Rockefeller Jr. Schwarzman purchased the apartment from Saul Steinberg in 2000 for just under $30 million.[28] However, an article in The New Yorker claims that the apartment was purchased for $37 million.[29]
On February 13, 2007, Schwarzman celebrated his 60th birthday at the Armory on Park Avenue. Guests included Colin Powell, Mayor of New York City Michael Bloomberg, Donald Trump, and Cardinal Edward M. Egan of New York. The climax of the evening was a half-hour live performance by Rod Stewart, for which he was reportedly paid $1 million.[30][31][32][33] In February, 2017, he had lavish 70th birthday party in Florida, estimated to have cost $5–7 million.[34]

In early 2016, he said that in a two-candidate race he would prefer Donald Trump to Ted Cruz, saying that the nation needed a "cohesive, healing presidency, not one that's lurching either to the right or to the left".[36] He had previously made a donation to Marco Rubio in 2014. He also endorsed and fundraised for Mitt Romney in 2012.[37]
In 2010, Schwarzman drew controversy for comparing President Obama's proposal to increase taxation on 'carried interest' profits to Hitler's invasion of Poland in 1939. Schwarzman later apologized for the analogy.[38][39]
He raised $100,000 for George W. Bush.[40]

Early life and education[edit]
Schwarzman was raised in a Jewish family[4][5] in Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania, the son of Arline and Joseph Schwarzman. His father owned Schwarzman's, a former dry-goods store in Philadelphia, and was a graduate of Wharton Business School.[6]
Schwarzman attended the Abington School District in suburban Philadelphia and graduated from Abington Senior High School in 1965.[7] He attended Yale University during the same period as George W. Bush, one year behind him (both were in the Skull and Bones society)[8][9] and graduated in 1969. He then went on to Harvard Business School and graduated in 1972.[10]
Investment career[edit]
Schwarzman's first job in financial services was with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, a now defunct investment bank. After business school, Schwarzman started working at the investment bank Lehman Brothers, where he reached the rank of managing director at age 31.[11] He eventually became the head of Lehman Brothers' global mergers and acquisitions team. In 1985, Schwarzman and his boss Peter Peterson started Blackstone, which originally focused on mergers and acquisitions.[12][13]
When Blackstone went public in June 2007, it revealed in a securities filing that Schwarzman had earned about $398.3 million in fiscal 2006.[14][15] He ultimately received $684 million selling part of his Blackstone stake in the IPO, keeping a stake then worth $9.1 billion.[16]
Schwarzman has served as an adjunct professor at the Yale School of Management and was chairman of the board of Trustees of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts from 2004 to 2010.
In June 2007, Schwarzman described his view on financial markets with the statement: "I want war, not a series of skirmishes... I always think about what will kill off the other bidder."[17]
In August 2010, Schwarzman compared the Obama administration's plan to raise carried interest taxes to Hitler's invasion of Poland in 1939, a comment for which Schwarzman later apologized.[18][19]
In September 2011, Schwarzman was listed as a member of the International Advisory Board of the Russian Direct Investment Fund.[20][21]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
