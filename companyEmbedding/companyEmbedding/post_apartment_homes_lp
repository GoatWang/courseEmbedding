BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

J.P.
Morgan Securities LLC

Wells

Deutsche
Bank Securities Inc.

As
Representative of the

several
Underwriters listed

in
Schedule 1 hereto

Ladies and
Gentlemen:

Post
Apartment Homes, L.P., a Georgia limited partnership (the “
Operating Partnership ”), proposes to issue and sell
to the several Underwriters listed in Schedule 1 hereto (the
“ Underwriters ”), for whom J.P. Morgan
Securities LLC, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and Deutsche Bank
Securities Inc. are acting as representatives (the “
Representatives ”), $150,000,000 principal amount of
its 4.75% Senior Notes due 2017 (the “ Securities
”). The Securities will be issued pursuant to an indenture
dated as of September 15, 2000 (the “ Base
Indenture ”) between the Operating Partnership and U.S.
Bank National Association (as successor in interest to SunTrust
Bank), as trustee (the “ Trustee ”), as
supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of
December 1, 2000 (the “ Supplemental Indenture
” and together with the Base Indenture, the “
Indenture ”).

The
Operating Partnership hereby confirms its agreement with the
several Underwriters concerning the purchase and sale of the
Securities, as follows:

1.
Registration Statement. The Operating Partnership has prepared and
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “
Commission ”) under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder
(collectively, the “ Securities Act ”), a
registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-163895-01),
including a prospectus, relating to the Securities. Such
registration statement, as amended at the time it became effective,
including the information, if any, deemed pursuant to Rule 430A,
430B or 430C under the Securities Act to be part of the
registration statement at the time of its effectiveness (“
Rule 430 Information ”), is referred to herein as the
“ Registration Statement ”; and as used herein,
the term “ Preliminary Prospectus ” means each
prospectus included in such 

 


 


registration
statement (and any amendments thereto) before it becomes effective,
any prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(a)
under the Securities Act and the prospectus included in the
Registration Statement at the time of its effectiveness that omits
Rule 430 Information, and the term “ Prospectus
” means the prospectus in the form first used (or made
available upon request of purchasers pursuant to Rule 173 under the
Securities Act) in connection with confirmation of sales of the
Securities. Any reference in this Agreement to the Registration
Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be
deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by
reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the
Securities Act, as of the effective date of the Registration
Statement or the date of such Preliminary Prospectus or the
Prospectus, as the case may be, and any reference to
“amend”, “amendment” or
“supplement” with respect to the Registration
Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be
deemed to refer to and include any documents filed after such date
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the
rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (collectively,
the “ Exchange Act ”) that are deemed to be
incorporated by reference therein. Capitalized terms used but not
defined herein shall have the meanings given to such terms in the
Registration Statement and the Prospectus.

At or
prior to the time when sales of the Securities were first made (the
“ Time of Sale ”), the Operating Partnership had
prepared the following information (collectively, the “
Time of Sale Information ”): a Preliminary Prospectus
dated October 13, 2010, and each “free-writing
prospectus” (as defined pursuant to Rule 405 under the
Securities Act) listed on Annex B hereto as constituting part of
the Time of Sale Information.

2.
Purchase of the Securities by the Underwriters .
(a) The Operating Partnership agrees to issue and sell the
Securities to the several Underwriters as provided in this
Agreement, and each Underwriter, on the basis of the
representations, warranties and agreements set forth herein and
subject to the conditions set forth herein, agrees, severally and
not jointly, to purchase from the Operating Partnership the
respective principal amount of Securities set forth opposite such
Underwriter’s name in Schedule 1 hereto at a price equal to
99.2340% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest, if
any, from October 18, 2010 to the Closing Date (as defined
below). The Operating Partnership will not be obligated to deliver
any of the Securities except upon payment for all the Securities to
be purchased as provided herein.

(b) The
Operating Partnership understands that the Underwriters intend to
make a public offering of the Securities as soon after the
effectiveness of this Agreement as in the judgment of the
Representatives is advisable, and initially to offer the Securities
on the terms set forth in the Prospectus. The Operating Partnership
acknowledges and agrees that the Underwriters may offer and sell
Securities to or through any affiliate of an Underwriter and that
any such affiliate may offer and sell Securities purchased by it to
or through any Underwriter.

(c)
Payment for and delivery of the Securities will be made at the
offices of Hogan Lovells US LLP, 555 13th Street, N.W., Washington,
D.C. 20004 at 10:00 A.M., New York City time, on October 18,
2010, or at such other time or place on the same or such other
date, not later than the fifth business day thereafter, as the
Representatives and the Operating Partnership may agree upon in
writing. The time and date of such payment and delivery is referred
to herein as the “ Closing Date ”.

(d)
Payment for the Securities shall be made by wire transfer in
immediately available funds to the account(s) specified by the
Operating Partnership to the Representatives against delivery to
the nominee of The Depository Trust Operating Partnership, for the
account of the Underwriters, of one or more global notes
representing the Securities (collectively, the “ Global
Note ”), with any transfer taxes payable in connection
with the sale of the Securities duly paid by the Operating
Partnership. The Global Note will be made available for inspection
by the Representatives not later than 1:00 P.M., New York City
time, on the business day prior to the Closing Date.

(e) The
Operating Partnership acknowledges and agrees that the Underwriters
are acting solely in the capacity of an arm’s length
contractual counterparty to the Operating Partnership with respect
to the offering of Securities contemplated hereby (including in
connection with determining the terms of the offering) and not as a
financial advisor or a fiduciary to, or an agent of, the Operating
Partnership or any other person. Additionally, neither the
Representatives nor any other Underwriter is advising the Operating
Partnership or any other person as to any legal, tax, investment,
accounting or regulatory matters in any jurisdiction. The Operating
Partnership shall consult with its own advisors concerning such
matters and shall be responsible for making its own independent
investigation and appraisal of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and the Underwriters shall have no responsibility or
liability to the Operating Partnership with respect thereto. Any
review by the Underwriters of the Operating Partnership, the
transactions contemplated hereby or other matters relating to such
transactions will be performed solely for the benefit of the
Underwriters and shall not be on behalf of the Operating
Partnership.

3.
Representations and Warranties of the Operating Partnership
. The Operating Partnership represents and warrants to each
Underwriter that:

(a)
Preliminary Prospectus. No order preventing or suspending
the use of any Preliminary Prospectus has been issued by the
Commission, and each Preliminary Prospectus, at the time of filing
thereof, complied in all material respects with the Securities Act
and did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
provided that the Operating Partnership makes no
representation and warranty with respect to any statements or
omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with information
relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Operating

in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives
expressly for use in any Preliminary Prospectus.

(b)
Time of Sale Information . The Time of Sale Information, at
the Time of Sale did not, and at the Closing Date will not, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading; provided that the Operating Partnership makes no
representation and warranty with respect to any statements or
omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with information
relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Operating Partnership
in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives
expressly for use in such Time of Sale Information. No statement of
material fact included in the Prospectus has been omitted from the
Time of Sale Information and no statement of material fact included

(including its agents and representatives, other than the
Underwriters in their capacity as such) has not prepared, made,
used, authorized, approved or referred to and will not prepare,
make, use, authorize, approve or refer to any “written
communication” (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities
Act) that constitutes an offer to sell or solicitation of an offer
to buy the Securities (each such communication by the Operating
Partnership or its agents and representatives (other than a
communication referred to in clauses (i) (ii) and
(iii) below) an “ Issuer Free Writing Prospectus

Act or Rule 134 under the Securities Act, (ii) the Preliminary
Prospectus, (iii) the Prospectus, (iv) the documents

in all material respects with the Securities Act, has been or will
be (within the time period specified in Rule 433) filed in
accordance with the Securities Act (to the extent required thereby)
and, when taken together with the Preliminary Prospectus
accompanying, or delivered prior to delivery of, such Issuer Free
Writing Prospectus, did not, and at the Closing Date will not,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading; provided that the Operating Partnership makes no
representation and warranty with respect to any statements or
omissions made in each such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus in

under the Securities Act has been received by the Operating
Partnership. No order suspending the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement has been issued by the Commission and no
proceeding for that purpose or pursuant to Section 8A of the
Securities Act against the Operating Partnership or related to the
offering has been initiated or, to the knowledge of the Operating
Partnership, threatened by the Commission; as of the applicable
effective date of the Registration Statement and any amendment
thereto, the Registration Statement complied and will comply in all
material respects with the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture
Act of 1939, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the
Commission thereunder (collectively, the “ Trust Indenture
Act ”), and did not and will not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein not misleading; and as of the date of the
Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto and as of the
Closing Date, the Prospectus will not contain any untrue statement

therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading; provided that the Operating
Partnership makes no representation and warranty with respect to
(i) that part of the Registration Statement that constitutes
the Statement of Eligibility and Qualification (Form T-1) of the
Trustee under the Trust Indenture Act or (ii) any statements
or omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with
information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Operating
Partnership in writing by such Underwriter through the
Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement and

(e)
Incorporated Documents. The documents incorporated by
reference in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and the
Time of Sale Information, when they were filed with the Commission
conformed in all material respects to the requirements of the
Exchange Act, of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulation of
the Commission thereunder (collectively, the “ Exchange
Act ”) and none of such documents contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading; and any further documents so filed and
incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the

the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make

Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Time of Sale
Information are independent public accountants with respect to the
Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries within the applicable
rules and regulations adopted by the Commission and the Public
Operating Partnership Accounting Oversight Board (United
States).

(g)
Financial Statements. The financial statements incorporated
by reference in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and the
Time of Sale Information, together with the related schedules and
notes, present fairly in all material respects the financial
position of each of Post Properties, Inc. (“ Post
Properties ”) and the Operating Partnership and their
consolidated subsidiaries at the dates indicated and the statement
of operations, shareholders’ or partners’ equity (as
applicable) and cash flows of Post Properties and the Operating
Partnership and their consolidated subsidiaries for the periods
specified; except as may otherwise be stated in the Registration
Statement, the Prospectus or the Time of Sale Information, said
financial statements have been prepared in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles (“ GAAP
”) applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
involved. The selected financial data and the summary financial
information included in the Prospectus and the Time of Sale
Information present fairly the information shown therein and have
been compiled on a basis consistent with that of the audited
financial statements included in the Registration
Statement.

(h)
Disclosure Controls . The Operating Partnership maintains a
system of “ disclosure controls and procedures ”
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) that is
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the
Operating Partnership in reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and
forms, including controls and procedures designed to ensure that
such information is accumulated and communicated to the Operating
Partnership’s management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. The Operating Partnership
and its subsidiaries have carried out evaluations of the
effectiveness of their disclosure controls and procedures as
required by Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, and as of the end
of the Operating Partnership’s most recent fiscal quarter,
such disclosure controls and procedures were effective to perform
the functions for which they were established.

(i)
Accounting Controls. The Operating Partnership maintains
systems of “ internal control over financial reporting
” (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act)
that comply with the requirements of the Exchange Act and have been
designed by, or under the supervision of, their respective
principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP. The Operating Partnership maintains internal
accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that
(i) transactions are executed in accordance with
management’s general or specific authorizations;
(ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to
maintain asset accountability; (iii) access to assets is
permitted only in accordance with management’s general or
specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded accountability
for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable
intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any
differences. Except as disclosed in the Registration Statement, the
Prospectus or the Time of Sale Information, there are no material
weaknesses in the Operating Partnership’s internal controls.
The Operating

 

6


 


 


Partnership’s
auditors and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the
Operating Partnership have been advised of: (x) all
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal controls over financial reporting which have
adversely affected or are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
Operating Partnership’s ability to record, process, summarize
and report financial information; and (y) any fraud, whether
or not material, that involves management or other employees who
have a significant role in the Operating Partnership’s
internal controls over financial reporting.

(j) No
Material Adverse Change in Business. Since the respective dates
as of which information is given in the Registration Statement, the
Prospectus and the Time of Sale Information, except as otherwise
stated therein, (A) there has been no material adverse change
in the financial condition, or in the earnings or business affairs
of the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries considered as one
enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of
business (a “ Material Adverse Effect ”);
(B) there have been no transactions entered into by the
Operating Partnership or any of its subsidiaries, other than those
in the ordinary course of business, which are material with respect
to the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries considered as one
enterprise; and (C) there has been no material change in the
short-term debt or long-term debt of the Operating Partnership and
its consolidated subsidiaries.

(k)
Organization and Good Standing of the Operating Partnership.
The Operating Partnership has been duly organized and is validly
existing as a limited partnership in good standing under the laws
of the State of Georgia and has the limited partnership power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct
its business as described in the Registration Statement, the Time
of Sale Information and the Prospectus and to enter into and
perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Indenture and the
Securities; and the Operating Partnership is duly qualified as a
foreign entity to transact business and is in good standing in each
other jurisdiction in which such qualification is required, whether
by reason of the ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of
business, except where the failure so to qualify or to be in good
standing could not be reasonably expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect.

(l)
Organization and Good Standing of Subsidiaries . Each
“significant subsidiary” of the Operating Partnership
(as such term is defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X)
(each a “ Significant Subsidiary ” and,
collectively, the “ Significant Subsidiaries ”)
has been duly organized and is validly existing in good standing
under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, has power
and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to
conduct its business as described in the Registration Statement,
the Prospectus and the Time of Sale Information and is duly
qualified to transact business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which such qualification is required, whether by
reason of the ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of
business, except where the failure so to qualify or to be in good
standing could not be reasonably expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect; except as otherwise disclosed in the Registration
Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus, all of
the issued and outstanding capital stock, limited liability company
interest or partnership interest, as the case may be, of each such
Significant Subsidiary

has been
duly authorized and validly issued, is fully paid and
non-assessable and is owned by the Operating Partnership, directly
or through subsidiaries, free and clear of any security interest,
mortgage, pledge, lien, encumbrance, claim or equity; no
outstanding capital stock, limited liability company interest or
partnership interest of any Significant Subsidiary was issued in

Table of Contents





POST APARTMENT HOMES

      
In this prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus, we
refer to Post Apartment Homes, L.P. as Post Apartment
Homes and Post Properties, Inc. as Post
Properties. Unless the context requires otherwise, the
words we, us and our used in
this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus refer
to Post Apartment Homes, Post Properties and their
subsidiaries.

      
We are one of the largest operators of upscale multifamily
communities in the United States. At March 31, 2005, we
owned 63 apartment communities containing approximately 24,523
apartment units, including 545 apartment units in two
communities held in unconsolidated entities and 205 apartment
units in one community currently under development. We are also
developing 145 for-sale condominium homes and are converting 382
apartment units in three communities (one in an unconsolidated
entity) into for-sale condominium homes through a taxable REIT
subsidiary. As of May 3, 2005, we had sold four apartment
communities containing approximately 1,102 apartment units that
were held for sale at March 31, 2005 and had entered into
an agreement to purchase an apartment community located in
Charlotte, North Carolina containing approximately 319 apartment
units. We also had two additional apartment communities
containing approximately 1,945 apartment units held for sale.
There can be no assurance that apartment communities under
contract to purchase or held for sale will close. At
March 31, 2005, approximately 51.9%, 17.4%, 8.6% and 8.1%
(on a unit basis) of our communities were located in the
Atlanta, Georgia, Dallas, Texas, Tampa, Florida and the greater
Washington, D.C. metropolitan areas, respectively. For the
three month period ended March 31, 2005, the average
economic occupancy rate, defined as gross potential rent less
vacancy losses, model expenses and bad debt expenses divided by
gross potential rent for the period, of all of our stabilized
(same store) communities was 93.5%. The average monthly rental
rate per apartment unit at these communities for the three month
period ended March 31, 2005 was $1,043.

      
Our business strategy is to deliver superior satisfaction and
value to our residents, associates and investors, with a vision
to be the first choice in quality multifamily living. Key
elements of our business strategy are as follows:


Investment, Disposition and Acquisition Strategy

      
Our investment, disposition and acquisition strategy is to shape
and rebalance our real estate portfolio to achieve uniformly
high quality, low average age properties and cash flow
diversification. We plan to achieve our objectives by reducing
our asset concentration in Atlanta, Georgia and Dallas, Texas,
while at the same time, building critical mass in other core
markets where we may currently lack the portfolio size to
achieve operating efficiencies and the full value of the
Post® brand. We define critical mass for this purpose as at
least 2,000 apartment units or $200 million of investment
in a particular market. Our goal ultimately is to reduce our
concentration in Atlanta, Georgia, measured by dollars invested,
to not more than 30% of the portfolio.

      
We plan to achieve our objectives by selling our oldest and
least competitively located properties, and we may also consider
selling joint venture interests in some of our core properties
or selectively converting some of these properties to for-sale
(condominium) housing. We expect that this strategy will provide
capital to reinvest in new communities in dynamic neighborhoods
and may also allow for leveraged returns through joint venture
structures that preserve Post® branded property and asset
management.

      
We are focusing on a limited number of major cities and have
substantially re-established our regional value creation
capabilities. We have added skilled personnel to more
effectively pursue acquisitions, development, dispositions and
select multifamily for-sale (condominium) opportunities that are
consistent with our market strategy. Our value creation
capabilities include regional value creation teams in Atlanta,
Georgia (focusing on the Southeast), Washington, DC (focusing on
that market and New York, New York) and Dallas, Texas (focusing
on the Southwest). We have reduced the number of markets where
we operate from thirteen to nine, and we may exit one or more
additional markets in the future if we do not believe we can
achieve critical mass within a reasonable period of time. We may
also consider entering new markets in the future.

S-1



Table of Contents
      
Key elements of our investment and acquisition strategy include
instilling a disciplined team approach to development and
acquisition decisions and selecting sites and properties in
infill suburban and urban locations in strong primary markets
that serve the higher-end multifamily consumer. We will focus
development on the product types that are more affordable to the
deepest segment of the upper end market in each city. We will,
therefore, look to develop more infill garden style communities
in our sunbelt markets and urban and mixed-use communities in
those markets and submarkets with existing density and barriers
to entry to warrant such communities. We plan to develop,
construct and continually maintain and improve our apartment
communities consistent with quality standards management
believes are synonymous with the Post® brand. New
acquisitions will be limited to properties that meet or that are
expected to be repositioned and improved to meet our quality and
location requirements. We will generally pursue acquisitions
either to rebalance our property portfolio, using the proceeds
of asset sales to redeploy capital in markets where critical
mass is desired, or to pursue opportunistic purchases on a
selective basis where market conditions warrant.


Post® Brand Name Strategy

      
The Post® brand name has been cultivated for more than
30 years, and its promotion has been integral to our
success. Management believes that the Post® brand name is
synonymous with quality upscale apartment communities that are
situated in desirable locations and that provide a high level of
resident service. We believe that we provide our residents with
a high level of service, including attractive landscaping and
numerous amenities, including controlled access, high-speed
internet connectivity, on-site business centers, on-site
courtesy officers, urban vegetable gardens and fitness centers
at a number of our communities.

      
Key elements in implementing our brand name strategy include
extensively utilizing the trademarked brand name and
coordinating our advertising programs to increase brand name
recognition. During 2004, we initiated a new marketing campaign,
initiated new customer service programs designed to raise
resident satisfaction and provided employees and residents new
opportunities for community involvement, all intended to enhance
what we believe is a valuable asset.

      
In early 2005, we announced the launch of a new for-sale housing
brand, Post Preferred
Homestm,
which will serve as the unified marketing umbrella for our
for-sale ventures, including developing new communities and
converting existing assets into upscale for-sale (condominium)
housing in several key markets. Our for-sale ventures will be
marketed under the Post Preferred
Homestm
brand to differentiate for-sale product from our rental
portfolio while capitalizing on our unique brand heritage.


Service and Associate Development Strategy

      
Our service orientation strategy includes utilizing independent
third parties to regularly measure resident satisfaction and
providing performance incentives to our associates linked to
delivering a high level of service and enhancing resident
satisfaction. We also plan to achieve our objective by investing
in the development and implementation of training programs
focused on associate development, improving the quality of our
operations and the delivery of resident service.


Operating Strategy

      
Our operating strategy includes striving to be an innovator and
a leader in anticipating customer needs while achieving
operating consistency across our properties. We also will
continue to explore opportunities to improve processes and
technology that drive efficiency in our business. In 2005, we
intend to implement new property operating and centralized
procurement software for this purpose.


Financing Strategy

      
Our financing strategy is to maintain a strong balance sheet and
to maintain our investment grade credit rating. We plan to
achieve our objectives by generally maintaining total effective
leverage (debt and preferred equity) as a percentage of
undepreciated real estate assets in a range of 50% to 55%, by
generally limiting variable rate indebtedness as a percentage of
total indebtedness to not more than 20% to 25% of aggregate

S-2



Table of Contents

indebtedness, and by maintaining adequate liquidity through our
unsecured lines of credit. We used borrowings available under
our revolving credit facilities to pay off $125 million of
our unsecured notes, including our 6.85% Mandatory Par Put
Remarketed Securities on March 16, 2005, which caused our
variable rate indebtedness as a percentage of total indebtedness
to exceed 25% as of March 31, 2005. However, on an as
adjusted basis after giving effect to this offering and the
application of the proceeds therefrom, as of March 31,
2005, our total variable rate indebtedness as a percentage of
total indebtedness would have been below 20%. At March 31,
2005, our total effective leverage (debt and preferred equity)
as a percentage of undepreciated real estate assets was below
50%.

      
Post Properties is a self-administered and self-managed equity
real estate investment trust, or REIT. Through its wholly owned
subsidiaries, Post Properties is the sole general partner of
Post Apartment Homes and it held 94.3% of the common units in
Post Apartment Homes as of March 31, 2005. Post Properties
conducts all of its business through Post Apartment Homes and
subsidiaries of Post Apartment Homes.

      
Our executive offices are located at One Riverside,
4401 Northside Parkway, Suite 800, Atlanta, Georgia
30327 and our telephone number is (404) 846-5000.






USE OF PROCEEDS

      
The net proceeds to Post Apartment Homes from this offering,
after payment of the underwriting discount and all expenses of
the offering, are expected to be approximately
$99.0 million. We intend to use the net proceeds from this
offering to reduce amounts outstanding under our revolving
credit facilities and for general corporate purposes. At
March 31, 2005, our revolving credit facilities had an
aggregate outstanding balance of $208.6 million and bore
interest at an average rate of 3.46%. The revolving credit
facilities will mature in January 2007. Affiliates of Wachovia
Capital Markets, LLC, PNC Capital Markets, Inc., SunTrust
Capital Markets, Inc. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC are
lenders under our revolving credit facilities and will,
therefore, receive a portion of the proceeds from the sale of
the notes in this offering.

DESCRIPTION OF NOTES

      
This description of particular terms of the notes supplements
the description of the general terms and provisions of debt
securities under the caption Description of Debt
Securities in the accompanying prospectus. To the extent
the following description is not consistent with the description
contained in the accompanying prospectus, you should rely on the
following description.


General

      
The notes will be issued as a series of securities under an
Indenture dated as of September 15, 2000 between Post
Apartment Homes and SunTrust Bank, as trustee, as amended by the
First Supplemental Indenture.

      
The notes will be issued in the aggregate principal amount of
$100,000,000. Post Apartment Homes may, from time to time,
without the consent of the holders of the notes, issue notes
under the Indenture in addition, and with identical terms, to
the $100,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the notes offered
by this prospectus supplement.

      
The notes will mature on June 1, 2012 and will bear
interest from May 31, 2005 at the rate of 5.45% per
year, payable semiannually on June 1 and December 1 of
each year, beginning on December 1, 2005. Interest on the
notes will be payable to the persons in whose names the notes
are registered at the close of business on the applicable
preceding May 18 and November 17. If any interest
payment date or maturity date falls on a day that is not a
business day, the required payment will be made on the next
business day as if it were made on the date the payment was due
and no interest will accrue on the amount payable for the period
from and after the interest payment date or maturity date, as
the case may be. Post Apartment Homes will issue the notes only
in book-entry form, in denominations of $1,000 and integral
multiples of $1,000.

      
There will be no sinking fund.


Optional Redemption

      
The notes will be redeemable, as a whole or in part, at Post
Apartment Homes option, at any time or from time to time,
by mailing notice to the registered address of each holder of
such notes at least 30 days but not more than 60 days
prior to the redemption. The redemption prices will be equal to
the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the
notes to be redeemed or (2) the sum of the present values
of the Remaining Scheduled Payments, as defined below, on those
securities discounted, on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day
year consisting of twelve 30-day months), at a rate equal to the
sum of the applicable Treasury Rate, as defined below, plus 25
basis points. In either case, accrued interest will be paid to
the date of redemption.

      
On and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue
on the notes or any portion of the notes called for redemption
(unless Post Apartment Homes defaults in the payment of the
redemption price and accrued interest). On or before the
redemption date, Post Apartment Homes will deposit with a paying
agent (or the trustee) money sufficient to pay the redemption
price of and accrued interest on the notes to be redeemed on
that date. If less than all of the notes of any series are to be
redeemed, the notes to be redeemed shall be selected by the
trustee by a method the trustee deems to be fair and appropriate.


Ranking

      
The notes will be unsecured senior notes, ranking the same as
other unsecured, unsubordinated obligations of Post Apartment
Homes. The notes will be effectively subordinated to mortgages
and other secured indebtedness of Post Apartment Homes and to
indebtedness of its subsidiaries. As of March 31, 2005, on
an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the sale of the
notes and the application of net proceeds therefrom, Post
Apartment Homes and its subsidiaries had approximately
$480.6 million of secured debt that would rank senior to
the notes and $681.7 of unsecured debt that would rank equally
with the notes. Subject to limitations set forth in the
Indenture, and as described under the heading Specific
Covenants 

S-5



Table of Contents

Limitations on Incurrence of Debt below, Post Apartment
Homes may incur additional secured and unsecured debt.


Specific Covenants

      
Limitations on Incurrence of Debt. Post Apartment
Homes will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary, as defined
below, to incur any Debt, as defined below, other than
intercompany Debt (representing Debt to which the only parties
are Post Apartment Homes, Post Properties and any Subsidiaries,
but only so long as such debt is held solely by any of Post
Apartment Homes, Post Properties and any Subsidiaries), if,
immediately after giving effect to the incurrence of such
additional Debt, the aggregate principal amount of all
outstanding Debt of Post Apartment Homes and its Subsidiaries on
a consolidated basis determined in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles is greater than 60% of the sum of:









 
 

    Total Assets, as defined below, as of the end of the fiscal
    quarter covered in Post Apartment Homes annual report on
    Form 10-K or quarterly report on Form 10-Q, as the
    case may be, most recently filed with the Securities and
    Exchange Commission (or, if such filing is not permitted under
    the Exchange Act, with the trustee) prior to the incurrence of
    such additional Debt; and


 


 
 

    the increase in Total Assets from the end of such quarter
    including, without limitation, any increase in Total Assets
    resulting from the incurrence of such additional Debt (such
    increase together with Post Apartment Homes Total Assets
    is referred to as the Adjusted Total Assets).


      
In addition to the foregoing limitation on the incurrence of
Debt, Post Apartment Homes will not, and will not permit any
Subsidiary to, incur any Secured Debt, as defined below, other
than intercompany Debt, if, immediately after giving effect to
the incurrence of the additional Secured Debt, the aggregate
principal amount of all outstanding Secured Debt of Post
Apartment Homes and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis is
greater than 40% of Adjusted Total Assets.

      
In addition to the foregoing limitations on the incurrence of
Debt, Post Apartment Homes will not, and will not permit any
Subsidiary to, incur any Debt, other than intercompany Debt, if
the ratio of Post Apartment Homes Consolidated Income
Available for Debt Service, as defined below, to the Annual Debt
Service Charge, as defined below, for the period consisting of
the four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended prior
to the date on which such additional Debt is to be incurred will
have been less than 1.5 to 1, on a pro forma basis after
giving effect to the incurrence of the Debt and to the
application of the proceeds from the Debt, and calculated on the
assumption that:








 
      
    (1) the incurrence of the Debt and any other Debt by Post
    Apartment Homes or its Subsidiaries since the first day of the
    four-quarter period and the application of the proceeds from
    that Debt, including to refinance other Debt, had occurred at
    the beginning of that period;


 


 
      
    (2) the repayment or retirement of any other Debt by Post
    Apartment Homes or its Subsidiaries since the first day of the
    four-quarter period had been repaid or retired at the beginning
    of that period (except that, in making such computation, the
    amount of Debt under any revolving credit facility will be
    computed based upon the average daily balance of that Debt
    during that period); and


 


 
      
    (3) in the case of any increase or decrease in Total
    Assets, or any other acquisition or disposition by Post
    Apartment Homes or any of its Subsidiaries of any asset or group
    of assets, since the first day of that four-quarter period,
    including, without limitation, by merger, stock purchase or
    sale, or asset purchase or sale, such increase, decrease, or
    other acquisition or disposition or any related repayment of
    Debt had occurred as of the first day of that period with the
    appropriate adjustments to net income and Debt levels with
    respect to that increase, decrease, or other acquisition or
    disposition being included in that pro forma calculation.


      
For purposes of the adjustments referred to in (3) above,
any income earned or loss incurred as a result of any such
increase, decrease or other acquisition or disposition referred
to in (3) above for a period less than such four-quarter
period will be annualized for such four-quarter period. Debt is
deemed to be incurred by

covenants applicable to the notes. Compliance with the covenants
described in this prospectus supplement and such additional
covenants with respect to the notes generally may not be waived
by Post GP Holdings, as Post Apartment Homes general
partner, or by the trustee unless the holders of at least a
majority in principal amount of all outstanding notes consent to

Defeasance in the accompanying prospectus will apply to

this prospectus supplement.

Except as described under the heading Specific
Covenants  Limitations on Incurrence of Debt
below and under the heading Description of Debt
Securities  Consolidation, Merger or Sale in
the accompany-

S-9



Table of Contents

ing prospectus, the Indenture does not contain any other
provisions that would limit the ability of Post Apartment Homes
to incur indebtedness or that would afford holders of the notes
protection in the event of:








 
      
    (1) a highly leveraged or similar transaction involving
    Post Apartment Homes, Post Properties or any affiliate of any of
    them;


 


 
      
    (2) a change of control of Post Apartment Homes or Post
    Properties; or


 


 
      
    (3) a reorganization, restructuring, merger or similar
    transaction involving Post Apartment Homes that may adversely
    affect the holders of the notes.


      
In addition, subject to the limitations set forth under the
heading Description of Debt Securities 
Consolidation, Merger or Sale in the accompanying
prospectus, Post Apartment Homes may, in the future, enter into
transactions such as the sale of all or substantially all of its
assets or the consolidation or merger of Post Apartment Homes
that would increase the amount of Post Apartment Homes
indebtedness or substantially reduce or eliminate Post Apartment
Homes assets, which may have an adverse effect on Post
Apartment Homes ability to service its indebtedness,
including the notes. Post Apartment Homes and its management
have no present intention of engaging in a highly leveraged or
similar transaction.


Book-Entry System

      
Post Apartment Homes has established a depositary arrangement
with The Depository Trust Company with respect to the notes, the
terms of which are summarized below.

      
Upon issuance, the notes will be represented by a single global
security. The global security representing the notes will be
deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC and will be registered in
the name of DTC or a nominee of DTC. The global security may not
be transferred except as a whole by a nominee of DTC to DTC or
to another nominee of DTC, or by DTC or another nominee of DTC
to a successor of DTC or a nominee of a successor to DTC.

      
So long as DTC or its nominee is the registered holder of the
global security, DTC or its nominee, as the case may be, will be
the sole owner of the notes represented thereby for all purposes
under the Indenture. Except as otherwise provided below, the
beneficial owners of the global security representing the notes
will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of
certificated notes and will not be considered the registered
holders thereof for any purpose under the Indenture, and the
global security representing the notes will be exchangeable or
transferable. Accordingly, each beneficial owner must rely on
the procedures of DTC and, if that beneficial owner is not a
Participant, on the procedures of the Participant through which
that beneficial owner owns its interest in order to exercise any
rights of a registered holder under the Indenture. The laws of
some jurisdictions require that certain purchasers of securities
take physical delivery of securities in certificated form. Such
limits and laws may impair the ability to transfer beneficial
interests in the global security representing the notes.

      
The global security representing the notes will be exchangeable
for certificated notes of like tenor and terms and of differing
authorized denominations in a like aggregate principal amount,
only if:









 
 

    DTC notifies Post Apartment Homes that it is unwilling or unable
    to continue as depositary for the global securities or Post
    Apartment Homes becomes aware that DTC has ceased to be a
    clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of
    1934 (the Exchange Act) and, in any such case Post
    Apartment Homes fails to appoint a successor to DTC within 60
    calendar days;


 


 
 

    Post Apartment Homes, in its sole discretion, determines that
    the global security will be exchangeable for certificated
    notes; or


 


 
 

    an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing with respect
    to the notes under the Indenture.


      
Upon any such exchange, the certificated notes will be
registered in the names of the beneficial owners of the global
security representing the notes, which names will be provided by
DTCs relevant Participants as identified by DTC to the
trustee.

S-10



Table of Contents
      
The following is based on information furnished by DTC:








 
     
    DTC will act as securities depository for the notes. The notes
    will be issued as fully registered securities registered in the
    name of Cede & Co. Cede & Co. is DTCs
    partnership nominee. One fully registered global security will
    be issued for the issue of the notes in the aggregate principal
    amount of the issue, and will be deposited with DTC. DTC is:










 
 

    a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York
    Banking Law;


 


 
 

    a banking organization within the meaning of the New
    York Banking Law;


 


 
 

    a member of the Federal Reserve System;


 


 
 

    a clearing corporation within the meaning of the New
    York Uniform Commercial Code; and


 


 
 

    a clearing agency registered pursuant to the
    provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act.


      
DTC holds securities that its participants (Direct
Participants) deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the
settlement among Direct Participants of securities transactions,
such as transfers and pledges, in deposited securities through
electronic computerized book-entry changes in Direct
Participants accounts, thereby eliminating the need for
physical movement of securities certificates.

      
Direct Participants of DTC include securities brokers and
dealers, including the underwriters, banks, trust companies,
clearing corporations and certain other organizations. DTC is
owned by a number of its Direct Participants and by the New York
Stock Exchange, Inc., the American Stock Exchange LLC, and the
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Access to the
DTC system is also available to others such as securities
brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies that clear
through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Direct
Participant, either directly or indirectly (Indirect
Participants). The rules applicable to DTC and its Direct
and Indirect Participants are on file with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.

      
Purchases of the notes under DTCs system must be made by
or through Direct Participants, which will receive a credit for
such notes on DTCs records. The ownership interest of each
beneficial owner is in turn to be recorded on the records of
Direct Participants and Indirect Participants. Beneficial owners
will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their
purchase, but beneficial owners are expected to receive written
confirmations providing details of the transaction, as well as
periodic statements of their holdings, from the Direct
Participants or Indirect Participants through which such
beneficial owner entered into the transaction. Transfers of
ownership interests in the global security representing the
notes are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of
Direct and Indirect Participants acting on behalf of beneficial
owners. Beneficial owners of the global security representing
the notes will not receive certificated notes representing their
ownership interests therein, except in the event that use of the
book-entry system for the notes is discontinued.

      
To facilitate subsequent transfers, the global security
representing the notes which is deposited by Direct Participants
with DTC is registered in the name of DTCs nominee,
Cede & Co. or such other name as may be requested by an
authorized representative of DTC. The deposit of the global
security with DTC and its registration in the name of
Cede & Co. or such other nominee has no effect on
beneficial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual
beneficial owners of the global security representing the notes;
DTCs records reflect only the identity of the Direct
Participants to whose accounts such notes are credited, which
may or may not be the beneficial owners. The Direct and Indirect
Participants will remain responsible for keeping account of
their holdings on behalf of their customers.

      
Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to Direct
Participants, by Direct Participants to Indirect Participants,
and by Direct Participants and Indirect Participants to
beneficial owners will be governed by arrangements among them,
subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in
effect from time to time.

S-11



Table of Contents
      
Principal and/or interest, if any, payments on the global
security representing the notes will be made in immediately
available funds to Cede & Co., or such other nominee as
may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC.
DTCs practice is to credit Direct Participants
accounts upon DTCs receipt of principal and/or interest on
the applicable payment date in accordance with their respective
holdings shown on DTCs records. Payments by Participants
to beneficial owners will be governed by standing instructions
and customary practices, as is the case with securities held for
the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in
street name, and will be the responsibility of such
Participant and not of DTC, the trustee or Post Apartment Homes,
subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in
effect from time to time. Payment of principal and/or interest,
if any, to Cede & Co. (or such other nominee as may be
requested by an authorized representative of DTC) is the
responsibility of Post Apartment Homes and the trustee,
disbursement of such payments to Direct Participants will be the
responsibility of DTC, and disbursement of such payments to the
beneficial owners will be the responsibility of Direct
Participants and Indirect Participants.

      
DTC may discontinue providing its services as securities
depository with respect to the notes at any time by giving
reasonable notice to Post Apartment Homes or the trustee. Under
such circumstances, in the event that a successor securities
depository is not obtained, certificated notes are required to
be printed and delivered.

      
Post Apartment Homes may decide to discontinue use of the system
of book-entry transfers through DTC or a successor securities
depository. In that event, certificated notes will be printed
and delivered.

      
The information in this section concerning DTC and DTCs
system has been obtained from sources that Post Apartment Homes
believes to be reliable, but neither Post Apartment Homes nor
any underwriter takes any responsibility for the accuracy
thereof.


Settlement Procedures

      
Interests in a global note will trade in DTCs settlement
system. Secondary market trading activity in these interests
will therefore settle in immediately available funds, subject to
the rules and procedures of DTC and its participants. Transfers
between participants in DTC will be effected in accordance with
DTCs procedures and will be settled in same-day funds.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

      
The following discussion supplements, and if inconsistent with
it replaces, the discussion under the caption Federal
Income Tax Considerations in the accompanying prospectus.

      
This discussion also includes a summary of certain United States
federal income tax consequences relating to the purchase,
ownership and disposition of the notes. It is based upon laws,
regulations, rulings and decisions in effect as of the date of
this prospectus supplement, all of which are subject to change
(possibly retroactively) by legislation, administrative action
or judicial decision. It does not address the application of the
tax laws of any state, local or non-U.S. jurisdiction. In
addition, it applies only to those persons who will hold notes
as a capital asset (within the meaning of
Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code) and does not
address federal income tax considerations applicable to
taxpayers subject to special rules (such as dealers in
securities and currencies, traders in securities who elect a
mark-to-market method of tax accounting, financial institutions,
tax-exempt organizations or insurance companies), taxpayers with
a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, taxpayers
who will hold notes as a position in a straddle, as part of a
synthetic security or hedge, or as part of a conversion
transaction or other integrated investment, or taxpayers
investing in notes through an entity that is classified as a
partnership for federal income tax purposes. If a partnership
holds notes, the tax treatment of each partner generally will
depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the
partnership.


Qualification and Taxation of Post Properties as a
REIT

      
In 2002, a limited liability company in which Post Apartment
Homes owns a 35% equity interest formed a new corporation named
1499 Massachusetts Avenue, Inc., or 1499 Inc. 1499 Inc. owns
(through an entity that is disregarded for federal income tax
purposes) a 15-story apartment building located in
Washington, D.C. 1499 Inc. has made an election to be taxed
as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal
Revenue Code, effective commencing with its taxable year that
ended on December 31, 2002. 1499 Inc.s qualification
and taxation as a REIT depend upon its ability to meet on a
continuing basis, through actual annual operating results,
distribution levels, and diversity of stock ownership, each of
the various qualification tests and organizational requirements
for REIT qualification that is described in the accompanying
prospectus under the caption Federal Income Tax
Considerations  Requirements for Qualification.
Post Apartment Homes believes that 1499 Inc. has been organized
and has operated in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as
a REIT for its taxable years ended December 31, 2002
through 2004, and Post Apartment Homes intends to cause 1499
Inc. to continue to operate in such a manner. No assurance can
be given, however, that 1499 Inc. will operate in a manner so as
to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT.

      
So long as 1499 Inc. continues to qualify for taxation as a
REIT, Post Properties allocable share of any dividends
distributed by 1499 Inc., as well as any gain recognized from
the sale or other disposition of the stock of 1499 Inc., will
constitute qualifying gross income to Post Properties under both
the 75% and the 95% gross income tests, and the stock of 1499
Inc. will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset under the
75% asset test. If, however, 1499 Inc. were to fail to qualify
as a REIT for any reason, the stock of 1499 Inc. would no longer
be treated as a qualifying real estate asset. In that event,
Post Properties would cease to qualify as a REIT (unless certain
relief provisions were to apply) because Post Properties
indirect ownership of the stock of 1499 Inc. would represent
more than 10% of the voting power and more than 10% of the value
of the outstanding securities of 1499 Inc. See Federal
Income Tax Considerations  Failure to Qualify
below and in the accompanying prospectus for a discussion of the
consequences of Post Properties failure to qualify as a
REIT.

      
In the opinion of King & Spalding LLP, Post Properties
met the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT
for its taxable years ended December 31, 1993 through 2004,
and its current and proposed method of operation will enable it
to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and
taxation as a REIT. The opinion is based on various assumptions
relating to the organization and operation of Post Properties,
Post Apartment Homes and the entities in which Post Apartment
Homes owns or has owned an interest (including 1499 Inc.) and is

as to certain relevant factual matters relating to the
organization and expected manner of operation of Post

S-13



Table of Contents

Properties, Post Apartment Homes, and the entities in which they
own interests (including 1499 Inc.). King & Spalding
LLP is not aware of any facts or circumstances that are
inconsistent with these assumptions and representations.
Moreover, Post Properties qualification and taxation as a
REIT will depend upon Post Properties and 1499 Inc.s
ability to meet on a continuing basis, through actual annual
operating results, distribution levels and diversity of stock
ownership, the various qualification tests imposed under the
Internal Revenue Code (which tests are discussed in detail in
the accompanying prospectus). King & Spalding LLP will
not review compliance with these tests on a continuing basis. No
assurance can be given that Post Properties and 1499 Inc. will
satisfy these tests on a continuing basis. See Federal
Income Tax Considerations  Failure to Qualify
below and in the accompanying prospectus.


Requirements for Qualification

      
On October 22, 2004, the President signed into law the
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, which amended certain rules
relating to REITs. The changes made that relate to Post
Properties qualification as a REIT include:









 
 

    If Post Properties fails to satisfy the 95% gross income test
    after its 2004 taxable year, as described under Federal
    Income Tax Considerations  Requirements for
    Qualification in the accompanying prospectus, but
    nonetheless continues to qualify as a REIT because it meets
    other requirements, Post Properties will be subject to a 100%
    tax on (1) the excess of 95% (rather than 90%) of its gross
    income over its qualifying income multiplied by (2) a
    fraction intended to reflect Post Properties overall
    profitability.


 


 
 

    For purposes of the 10% asset test (i.e., the requirement that
    Post Properties not own more than 10% of the value of the
    securities of any issuer other than a taxable REIT subsidiary, a
    qualified REIT subsidiary, or another REIT), as described under
    Federal Income Tax Considerations  Requirements
    for Qualification in the accompanying prospectus, the
    American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 expanded the straight
    debt safe harbor exception to the 10% asset test to
    include debt subject to certain contingencies.


 


 
 

    In addition to straight debt securities, loans to individuals
    and estates, debt and equity securities issued by REITs, and
    accrued obligations to pay rents from real property will not be
    considered securities for purposes of the 10% asset test.
    Additionally, a security issued by a state or any political
    subdivision thereof, the District of Columbia, a foreign
    government or any political subdivision thereof, or the
    Commonwealth of Puerto Rico shall not be considered a security
    for purposes of the 10% asset test provided that the amounts
    received or accrued under the security do not depend in whole or
    in part on the profits of any non-governmental entity or on
    payments on an obligation issued by any non-governmental entity.
    Finally, a debt instrument issued by a partnership that does not
    meet one of the safe harbors mentioned above shall not be
    considered a security (1) to the extent of Post
    Properties interest as a partner in the partnership or
    (2) if at least 75% of the partnerships gross income
    is derived from sources that meet the 75% gross income test.


 


 
 

    For purposes of the 10% asset test, holding a de minimis amount
    of an issuers securities that do not qualify for the
    straight debt safe harbor (either directly or through a taxable
    REIT subsidiary) will not prevent straight debt of a partnership
    or corporation from qualifying for the safe harbor.
    Specifically, Post Properties or a controlled taxable REIT
    subsidiary in which Post Properties owns more than 50% of the
    voting power or value of the stock could hold such non-straight
    debt securities with a value of up to 1% of a partnerships
    or corporations outstanding securities. There is no
    limitation on the amount of an issuers securities that a
    non-controlled taxable REIT subsidiary can own.


      
The provisions described above relating to the expansion of the
straight debt safe harbor and the additional classes
of securities that are exempt from the 10% asset test apply to
taxable years beginning after December 31, 2000. The
provision relating to the penalty for failing to meet the 95%
gross income test applies to taxable years beginning after
December 31, 2004.

Table of Contents

Failure to Qualify

      
The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 also made several changes
to relief provisions available for violations of the REIT asset
and gross income tests. These changes include:









 
 

    In the event that, at the end of a calendar quarter after its
    2004 taxable year, Post Properties violates the 5% or 10% asset
    tests, it will not lose its REIT status if (1) the failure
    is de minimis (i.e., is due to the ownership of assets the value
    of which does not exceed the lesser of 1% of the value of all of
    Post Properties assets or $10 million) and
    (2) Post Properties disposes of assets or otherwise
    complies with the asset tests within six months after the last
    day of the quarter in which it identifies such failure.


 


 
 

    In the event of a more than de minimis failure of any of the
    asset tests after its 2004 taxable year, as long as the failure
    is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect, Post
    Properties will not lose its REIT status if it (1) disposes
    of assets or otherwise complies with the asset tests within six
    months after the last day of the quarter in which it identifies
    such failure, (2) files a schedule with the IRS that
    identifies each asset that caused it to fail such test and
    (3) pays a tax equal to the greater of $50,000 or 35% of
    the net income from the nonqualifying assets during the period
    in which it failed to satisfy the asset tests.


 


 
 

    In the event that Post Properties fails to satisfy a REIT
    requirement after its 2004 taxable year, other than a gross
    income or asset test, Post Properties will not lose its REIT
    status but will incur a penalty of $50,000 if it establishes
    reasonable cause for failure to satisfy such a requirement.


      
The provisions described above relating to the expansion of
relief provisions relating to a REIT qualification failure apply
for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2004.


U.S. Holders of Notes

      
As used in this prospectus supplement, the term
U.S. holder means a beneficial owner of a note
that for United States federal income tax purposes is:









 
 

    a citizen or resident of the United States;


 


 
 

    a corporation or association taxable as a corporation that was
    created or organized in or under the laws of the United States,
    any State or the District of Columbia;


 


 
 

    an estate the income of which is subject to United States
    federal income taxation regardless of its source; or


 


 
 

    a trust if (1) a court within the United States is able to
    exercise primary supervision of its administration and
    (2) one or more United States persons have the authority to
    control all of its substantial decisions.


      
Payments of Interest. Payments of interest on a
note generally will be taxable to a U.S. holder as ordinary
interest income at the time the interest payments are accrued or
are received, in accordance with the U.S. holders
regular method of tax accounting.

      
Market Discount. A U.S. holder who purchases
a note for an amount that is less than its stated principal
amount will be treated as having purchased the note with
market discount unless the discount is less than a
specified de minimis amount. Under the market discount rules, a
U.S. holder generally will be required to treat any gain
realized on the sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition
of a note as ordinary income to the extent of any accrued market
discount which has not previously been included in income. For
this purpose, market discount will be considered to accrue
ratably during the period from the date of the
U.S. holders acquisition of the note to the maturity
date of the note, unless the U.S. holder has made an
election to accrue market discount on a constant yield basis. A
U.S. holder may be required to defer the deduction of all
or a portion of the interest paid or accrued on any indebtedness
incurred or maintained to purchase or carry a note with market
discount until the maturity date of the note or certain earlier
dispositions.

S-15



Table of Contents
      
A U.S. holder may elect to include market discount income
in income currently as it accrues (on either a ratable or
constant yield basis), in which case the rules described above
regarding (1) the treatment as ordinary income of gain upon
the disposition of the note and (2) the deferral of
interest deductions will not apply. Generally, currently
included market discount is treated as ordinary interest income
for federal income tax purposes. An election to include market
discount in income as it accrues will apply to all debt
instruments with market discount acquired by the
U.S. holder on or after the first day of the taxable year
to which the election applies and may be revoked only with the
consent of the IRS.

      
Amortizable Bond Premium. A U.S. holder who
purchases a note for an amount that is greater than the sum of
all remaining payments on the note (other than stated interest)
will be treated as having purchased the note with
amortizable bond premium equal in amount to such
excess. A U.S. holder may elect to amortize this premium
using a constant yield method over the remaining term of the
note and may offset interest otherwise required to be included
in income in respect of the note by the amortized amount of the
premium for the taxable year. Under a special rule that applies
solely for purposes of determining the amount of amortizable
bond premium on a note, Post Apartment Homes will be deemed to
exercise its optional redemption rights in a manner that
maximizes the holders yield. The application of this
special rule generally will result in the deferral of a
U.S. holders deduction of some of the bond premium
until later in the term of the note. An election to amortize
bond premium applies to all taxable debt obligations then owned
and thereafter acquired by the U.S. holder on or after the
first day of the taxable year to which the election applies, and
may be revoked only with the consent of the IRS.

      
Sale, Exchange, Redemption or Retirement of Notes.
Upon the sale, exchange, redemption or retirement of a note, a
U.S. holder generally will recognize taxable gain or loss
equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale,
exchange or retirement (other than amounts representing accrued
and unpaid interest) and the U.S. holders adjusted
tax basis in the note. A U.S. holders adjusted tax
basis in a note generally will equal the U.S. holders
initial investment in the note, increased by any accrued market
discount (if the U.S. holder has included such market
discount in income), and decreased by any amortizable bond
premium taken with respect to the note. Subject to the market
discount rules discussed above, any gain or loss recognized
generally will be capital gain or loss. The maximum long-term
capital gain rate for non-corporate taxpayers was reduced to 15%
through 2008 by the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation
Act of 2003.

      
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding.
Information returns may be filed with the IRS in connection with
payments on the notes and the proceeds from a sale, exchange or
other disposition of notes. A backup withholding tax (at a rate
of 28% through 2010 and at a rate of 31% in 2011 and 2012) will
apply to these amounts only if a U.S. holder, who is not
otherwise exempt from backup withholding, fails to furnish its
taxpayer identification number within a reasonable time after it
is requested, furnishes an incorrect taxpayer identification
number, fails to report properly interest or dividend income to
the IRS, or fails under certain circumstances to provide a
certification under penalties of perjury that the taxpayer
identification number provided is correct and that the holder is
not subject to backup withholding. The amount of any backup
withholding from a payment to a U.S. holder of a note will
be allowed as a credit against the U.S. holders
federal income tax liability and may entitle the holder to a
refund, provided that the required information is furnished to
the IRS in a timely manner.


Non-U.S. Holders of Notes

      
As used in this prospectus supplement, the term
non-U.S. holder means a beneficial owner of a
note that is not treated as a U.S. holder.

      
Payment of Interest. Generally, payments of
interest on a note to a non-U.S. holder will not be subject
to U.S. federal withholding taxes, provided that:









 
 

    the non-U.S. holder does not actually or constructively own
    10% or more of the capital or profits interest in Post Apartment
    Homes;


 


 
 

    the non-U.S. holder is not a controlled foreign corporation
    that is related to Post Apartment Homes;


S-16



Table of Contents








 
 

    the non-U.S. holder is not a bank described in
    Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code; and


 


 
 

    either (1) the non-U.S. holder provides its name and
    address on an IRS Form W-8BEN (or suitable substitute form)
    and certifies, under penalties of perjury, that it is not a
    U.S. holder or (2) the non-U.S. holder holds its
    notes through certain intermediaries and it satisfies the
    certification requirements of applicable regulations.


      
If the non-U.S. holder cannot satisfy the requirements set
forth above, payments of interest made to the
non-U.S. holder will be subject to U.S. federal
withholding tax at a 30% rate, unless the non-U.S. holder
provides a properly executed (1) IRS Form W-8BEN (or
suitable substitute form) claiming an exemption from or
reduction in the rate of withholding under an applicable tax
treaty or (2) IRS Form W-8ECI (or suitable substitute
form) stating that interest paid on the notes is effectively
connected with a trade or business carried on by the
non-U.S. holder in the United States (in which case the
non-U.S. holder generally will be subject to the tax
consequences described below).

      
Sale, Exchange, Redemption or Retirement of Notes.
If a non-U.S. holder sells or exchanges notes, or if the
notes are redeemed or retired, the non-U.S. holder will not
be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain realized
unless either of the following conditions applies:









 
 

    the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business that
    the non-U.S. holder conducts in the United States; or


 


 
 

    the non-U.S. holder is an individual, is present in the
    United States for at least 183 days during the year in
    which the notes are sold, exchanged, redeemed or retired, and
    certain other conditions are satisfied.


      
U.S. Trade or Business. If a
non-U.S. holder holds notes in connection with a trade or
business that is conducted in the United States:









 
 

    any interest or market discount, and any gain from a taxable
    disposition of notes, will be subject to U.S. federal
    income tax as if the non-U.S. holder were a
    U.S. holder; and


 


 
 

    a corporate non-U.S. holder may be subject to the
    branch profits tax (at a 30% rate or a lower rate or
    exemption as may be specified by an applicable tax treaty) on
    its earnings that are effectively connected with the
    holders U.S. trade or business.


      
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding.
Information reporting to the IRS on Form 1042-S generally
will apply to a payment of interest on a note that can be
reliably associated with certain documentation provided by a
non-U.S. holder (such as an IRS Form W-8BEN).
Information reporting with respect to interest paid to a
non-U.S. holder generally does not apply, however, if the
non-U.S. holder holds notes directly through a qualified
intermediary and required procedures are satisfied. Backup
withholding generally will not apply to payments of interest to
a non-U.S. holder if the requirements for a withholding tax
exemption described above are satisfied.

      
Information reporting requirements and backup withholding will
not apply to any payment of the proceeds of the sale of notes
effected outside the United States by a foreign office of a
broker (as defined in applicable regulations),
unless the broker is a United States person or has certain
connections to the United States. Payment of the proceeds of any
such sale effected outside the United States by a foreign office
of a broker described in the preceding sentence will not be
subject to backup withholding, but will be subject to
information reporting requirements, unless the broker has
documentary evidence in its records that the beneficial owner of
the note is a non-U.S. holder and certain other conditions
are met or the non-U.S. holder otherwise establishes an
exemption. Payment of the proceeds of any such sale to or
through the United States office of a broker will be subject to
information reporting and backup withholding unless the
beneficial owner of the note provides an IRS Form W-8BEN
(or suitable substitute form) or otherwise establishes an
exemption.

The underwriters have agreed to purchase all of the notes sold
pursuant to the underwriting agreement if any of the notes are
purchased.

      
The underwriters are offering the notes, subject to prior sale,
when, as and if issued to and accepted by them, subject to
approval of legal matters by their counsel, including the
validity of the notes, and other conditions contained in the
underwriting agreement, such as the receipt by the underwriters
of officers certificates and legal opinions. The
underwriters reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify
offers to the public and to reject orders in whole or in part.

      
The underwriters have advised Post Apartment Homes that they
propose initially to offer the notes to the public at the public
offering price on the cover page of this prospectus supplement,
and to dealers at that price less a concession not in excess of
0.375% of the principal amount of the notes. The underwriters
may allow, and the dealers may reallow, a discount not in excess
of 0.250% of the principal amount of the notes to other dealers.
After the initial public offering, the public offering price,
concession and discount may be changed.

      
The expenses of the offering, not including the underwriting
discount, are estimated to be $300,000 and are payable by Post
Apartment Homes.

      
The notes are a new issue of securities with no established
trading market. Post Apartment Homes does not intend to apply
for listing of the notes on any national securities exchange or
for quotation of the notes on any automated dealer quotation
system. Post Apartment Homes has been advised by the
underwriters that they presently intend to make a market in the
notes after completion of the offering. However, they are under
no obligation to do so and may discontinue any market-making
activities at any time without any notice. Post Apartment Homes
cannot assure the liquidity of the trading market for the notes
or that an active public market for the notes will develop. If
an active public trading market for the notes does not develop,
the market price and liquidity of the notes may be adversely
affected.

      
Post Apartment Homes has agreed to indemnify the underwriters
against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the
Securities Act of 1933, or to contribute to payments the
underwriters may be required to make in respect of those
liabilities.

      
In connection with the offering, the underwriters are permitted
to engage in transactions that stabilize the market price of the
notes. Such transactions consist of bids or purchases to peg,
fix or maintain the price of the notes. If the underwriters
create a short position in the notes in connection with the
offering, i.e., if they sell more notes than are on the cover
page of this prospectus supplement, the underwriters may reduce

S-18



Table of Contents

that short position by purchasing notes in the open market.
Purchases of a security to stabilize the price or to reduce a
short position could cause the price of the security to be
higher than it might be in the absence of such purchases.

      
Neither Post Apartment Homes nor the underwriters make any
representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of
any effect that the transactions described above may have on the
price of the notes. In addition, neither Post Apartment Homes
nor the underwriters make any representation that the
underwriters will engage in these transactions or that these
transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without
notice.

      
The underwriters and their affiliates have engaged in, and may
in the future engage in, investment banking and other commercial
dealings in the ordinary course of business with us. They have
received customary fees and commissions for these transactions.
Wachovia Bank, N.A., an affiliate of Wachovia Capital Markets,
LLC, PNC Bank, National Association, an affiliate of PNC Capital
Markets, Inc., SunTrust Bank, an affiliate of SunTrust Capital
Markets, Inc., and Wells Fargo Bank, an affiliate of Wells Fargo
Securities, LLC are also lenders under the revolving credit
facility. Wachovia Bank, N.A., PNC Bank, National Association,
SunTrust Bank and Wells Fargo Bank will each receive their
proportionate share of the amounts repaid under the revolving
credit facility with the net proceeds of this offering. More
than ten percent of the net proceeds of the offering will be
paid to a member or affiliates of a member of the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. participating in the
offering.

Homes by King & Spalding LLP. Certain matters will be
passed upon for the underwriters by Mayer, Brown,
Rowe & Maw LLP. In addition, the description of Federal

USE OF PROCEEDS
     
Post is required, by the terms of the partnership agreement of
Post Apartment Homes, to invest the net proceeds of any sale of
common stock, preferred stock or depositary shares in Post

preferences and rights that reflect the security to be issued.
Unless otherwise indicated in any prospectus supplement, Post
Apartment Homes intends to use such net proceeds and the net
proceeds from the sale of debt securities for general corporate
purposes including, without limitation, the acquisition and
development of multi-family communities and the repayment of
debt. Pending application of the net proceeds, Post Apartment
Homes will invest the proceeds in interest-bearing accounts and
short-term, interest-bearing securities, which are consistent

as a REIT. Such investments may include, for example,
obligations of the Government National Mortgage Association,
other government and government agency securities, certificates
of deposit, interest-bearing bank deposits and mortgage loan
participations.

DESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES
     
This section describes the general terms and provisions of the
debt securities. The prospectus supplement will describe the
specific terms of the debt securities offered through that
prospectus supplement and any general terms outlined in this
section that will not apply to those debt securities.

     
The debt securities will be issued under an Indenture, dated as
of September 15, 2000, between Post Apartment Homes and
SunTrust Bank, as trustee, as amended by the First Supplemental
Indenture. The Indenture is subject to, and governed by, the
Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. As used in this
prospectus, debt securities means the debentures, notes, bonds
and other evidences of indebtedness that Post Apartment Homes
issues and the Trustee authenticates and delivers under the
Indenture.

     
We have summarized selected terms and provisions of the
Indenture in this section. The summary is not complete. We have
also filed the Indenture and the First Supplemental Indenture as
an exhibit to the registration statement. You should read the
Indenture and the First Supplemental Indenture for additional
information before you buy any debt securities. The summary that
follows includes references to section numbers of the Indenture
so that you can more easily locate these provisions. Capitalized
terms used but not defined in this summary have the meanings
specified in the Indenture.


General
     
The debt securities will be direct unsecured obligations of Post
Apartment Homes. The debt securities will rank equally with all
other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of Post
Apartment Homes. The Indenture does not limit the amount of debt
securities that Post Apartment Homes may issue and permits Post
Apartment Homes to issue debt securities from time to time. Debt
securities issued under the Indenture will be issued as part of
a series that has been established by Post Apartment Homes
pursuant to the Indenture. (Section 301) Unless a
prospectus supplement relating to debt securities states
otherwise, the Indenture and the terms of the debt securities
will not contain any covenants designed to afford holders of any
debt securities protection in a highly leveraged or other
transaction involving Post Apartment Homes that may adversely
affect holders of the debt securities. If Post Apartment Homes
ever issues bearer securities Post Apartment Homes will
summarize provisions of the Indenture that relate to bearer
securities in the applicable prospectus supplement.

     
A prospectus supplement relating to a series of debt securities
being offered will include specific terms relating to the
offering. (Section 301) These terms will include some or
all of the following:








 
 

    the title and type of the debt securities;


 


 
 

    any limit on the total principal amount of the debt securities;


 


 
 

    the price at which the debt securities will be issued;


 


 
 

    the date or dates on which the principal of and premium, if any,
    on the debt securities will be payable;


 


 
 

    the maturity date of the debt securities;


 


 
 

    if the debt securities will bear interest:










 
 

    the interest rate on the debt securities;


 


 
 

    the date from which interest will accrue;


 


 
 

    the record and interest payment dates for the debt securities;
    and


 


 
 

    the first interest payment date;










 
 

    any circumstances under which Post Apartment Homes may defer
    interest payments;


 


 
 

    any optional redemption provisions that would permit Post
    Apartment Homes or the Holders (as defined below) of debt
    securities to elect redemption of the debt securities prior to
    their final maturity;


 


 
 

    any sinking fund provisions that would obligate Post Apartment
    Homes to redeem the debt securities prior to their final
    maturity;

Table of Contents








 
 

    the currency or currencies in which the debt securities will be
    denominated and payable, if other than U.S. dollars;


 


 
 

    any provisions that would permit Post Apartment Homes or the
    Holders of the debt securities to elect the currency or
    currencies in which the debt securities are paid;


 


 
 

    whether the provisions described under the heading
    Defeasance below apply to the debt securities;


 


 
 

    any changes to or additional Events of Default (as defined
    below) or covenants;

    in the form of Global Securities and, if so, the Depositary for
    those Global Securities (as defined below);


 


 
 

    any special tax implications of the debt securities; and


 


 
 

    any other terms of the debt securities.



A Holder, with respect to a registered security,
means the person in whose name the registered security is
registered in Post Apartment Homes security register.
(Section 101) Global Security means a debt
security that Post Apartment Homes issues in accordance with the
Indenture to represent all or part of a series of debt
securities.


Trustee
     
There may be more than one Trustee under the Indenture, each
with respect to one or more series of debt securities. Any
Trustee under the Indenture may resign or be removed with
respect to one or more series of debt securities, and a
successor Trustee may be appointed to act with respect to such
series. (Section 608) In the event that two or more persons
are acting as Trustee with respect to different series of debt
securities, each Trustee shall be a trustee of a trust under the
Indenture separate and apart from the trust administered by any
other Trustee. (Section 609) Except as otherwise indicated,
any action described herein to be taken by a Trustee may be
taken by each Trustee with respect to, and only with respect to,
the one or more series of debt securities for which it is
Trustee under the Indenture.


Payment; Transfer
     
Post Apartment Homes will designate a place of payment where you
can receive payment of the principal of and any premium and
interest on the debt securities or where you can transfer the
debt securities. Even though Post Apartment Homes will designate
a place of payment, Post Apartment Homes may elect to pay any
interest on the debt securities by mailing a check to the person
listed as the owner of the debt securities in the security
register or by wire transfer to an account designated by that
person in writing not less than ten days before the date of the
interest payment. (Sections 305, 307, 1002) There will be
no service charge for any registration of transfer or exchange
of the debt securities, but Post Apartment Homes may require you
to pay any tax or other governmental charge payable in
connection with a transfer or exchange of the debt securities.
(Section 305)


Denominations
     
Unless the prospectus supplement states otherwise, the debt
securities will be issued only in registered form, without
coupons, in denominations of $1,000 each or multiples of $1,000.


Original Issue Discount
     
Debt securities may be issued under the Indenture as Original
Issue Discount Securities and sold at a substantial discount
below their stated principal amount. If a debt security is an
Original Issue Discount Security, that means that an
amount less than the principal amount of the debt security will
be due and payable upon a declaration of acceleration of the
maturity of the debt security pursuant to the Indenture.

Table of Contents

(Section 101) The applicable prospectus supplement will
describe the federal income tax consequences and other special
factors which should be considered prior to purchasing any
Original Issue Discount Securities.


Consolidation, Merger or Sale
     
The Indenture generally permits a consolidation or merger
between Post Apartment Homes and another entity. It also permits
the sale or transfer by Post Apartment Homes of all or
substantially all of its property and assets and the purchase by
it of all or substantially all of the property and assets of
another entity. These transactions are permitted if:








 
 

    Post Apartment Homes is the continuing entity or, if not, the
    resulting or acquiring entity assumes all of its
    responsibilities and liabilities under the Indenture, including
    the payment of all amounts due on the debt securities and
    performance of the covenants in the Indenture;


 


 
 

    immediately after the transaction, no Event of Default exists;
    and


 


 
 

    an officers certificate and legal opinion covering these
    conditions are delivered to the Trustee. (Section 801 and
    803)


     
If Post Apartment Homes consolidates or merges with or into any
other company or sells all or substantially all of its assets
according to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the
resulting or acquiring company will be substituted for Post
Apartment Homes in the Indenture with the same effect as if it
had been an original party to the Indenture. As a result, such
successor company may exercise the rights and powers of Post
Apartment Homes under the Indenture, in the name of Post
Apartment Homes or in its own name and Post Apartment Homes will
be released from all of its liabilities and obligations under
the Indenture and under the debt securities. (Section 802)


Restrictive Covenants
     
Existence. Except as permitted under
 Consolidation, Merger or Sale above,
Post Apartment Homes is required to do or cause to be done all
things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect
its existence, rights and franchises unless it determines that
the preservation of its existence, rights and franchises is no
longer desirable in the conduct of its business and that the
loss of the preservation is not disadvantageous in any material
respect to the Holders of the debt securities.
(Section 1006)

     
Maintenance of Properties. Post Apartment Homes is
required to cause all of its material properties used or useful
in the conduct of its business to be maintained and kept in good
condition, repair and working order and supplied with all
necessary equipment. Post Apartment Homes is also required to
cause to be made all necessary repairs, renewals, replacements,
betterments and improvements on its material properties, so that
the business carried on in connection with the properties may be
properly and advantageously conducted at all times. Post
Apartment Homes will not be prevented from selling or otherwise
disposing for value its properties in the ordinary course of
business. (Section 1007)

     
Insurance. Post Apartment Homes is required to keep all
of its insurable properties insured against loss or damage at
least equal to their then full insurable value with financially
sound and reputable insurance companies (Section 1008).

is required to pay or discharge or cause to be paid or
discharged, before they become delinquent, (1) all taxes,
assessments and governmental charges levied or imposed upon it
or upon its income, profits or property, and (2) all lawful
claims for labor, materials and supplies which, if unpaid, might
by law become a lien upon its property. Post Apartment Homes is
not required to pay or discharge or cause to be paid or
discharged any tax, assessment, charge or claim whose amount,
applicability or validity is being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings. (Section 1009)

     
Provision of Financial Information. The Holders of debt
securities will be provided with copies of the annual reports
and quarterly reports of Post Apartment Homes. Whether or not
Post Apartment Homes is subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of
the Exchange Act and for so long as any debt securities are

Act, be required to file with the Commission the annual reports,
quarterly reports and other documents which Post Apartment Homes
would have been required to file with the Commission pursuant to
Section 13 or 15(d) if it were so subject. All of these
documents are required to be filed with the Commission on or
prior to the respective dates (the Required Filing

Required Filing Date, transmit by mail to all Holders of debt
securities, as their names and addresses appear in the security
register for the debt securities, without cost to them, and file
with the Trustee copies of the annual reports and quarterly
reports which it would have been required to file with the
Commission pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange

Additional Covenants. Any additional or different
covenants of Post Apartment Homes with respect to any series of
debt securities will be set forth in the prospectus supplement
relating to the specific debt securities.


Modification and Waiver
     
Under the Indenture, some of the rights and obligations of Post
Apartment Homes and some of the rights of Holders of the debt
securities may be modified or amended with the consent of the
Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding debt securities of each series of debt securities
affected by the modification or amendment. The following
modifications and amendments will not be effective against any
Holder without its consent:








 
 

    a change in the stated maturity date of any payment of principal
    or interest;


 


 
 

    a reduction in payments due on the debt securities;


 


 
 

    a change in the place of payment or currency in which any
    payment on the debt securities is payable;


 


 
 

    a limitation of a Holders right to sue Post Apartment
    Homes for the enforcement of certain payments due on the debt
    securities;


 


 
 

    a reduction in the percentage of outstanding debt securities
    required to consent to a modification or amendment of the
    Indenture; and


 


 
 

    a modification of any of the foregoing requirements.
    (Section 902)


     
Under the Indenture, the Holders of a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of any
series of debt securities may, on behalf of all Holders of that
series:








 
 

    waive compliance by Post Apartment Homes with certain
    restrictive covenants of the Indenture; and


 


 
 

    waive any past default under the Indenture, except:










 
 

    a default in the payment of the principal of or any premium or
    interest on any debt securities of that series; or


 


 
 

    a default under any provision of the Indenture which itself
    cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holders
    of each outstanding debt security of that series.
    (Sections 1013, 513)



Events of Default
     
Event of Default, when used in the Indenture with
respect to any series of debt securities, means any of the
following:








 
 

    failure to pay interest on any debt security of that series for
    30 days after the payment is due;


 


 
 

    failure to pay the principal of or any premium on any debt
    security of that series when due;


8



Table of Contents








 
 

    failure to deposit any sinking fund payment when due on debt
    securities of that series;


 


 
 

    failure to perform any other covenant in the Indenture that
    applies to debt securities of that series for 60 days after
    Post Apartment Homes has received written notice of the failure
    to perform in the manner specified in the Indenture;


 


 
 

    default with respect to over $20 million of recourse
    indebtedness, or with respect to over $20 million under any
    mortgage, lien or other similar encumbrance, indenture or
    instrument, including the Indenture, which secures any
    indebtedness or borrowed money, and which results in
    acceleration of the maturity of the outstanding principal amount
    of the indebtedness unless such acceleration is rescinded or the
    indebtedness is discharged;


 


 
 

    certain events in bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization; or


 


 
 

    any other Event of Default that may be specified for the debt
    securities of that series when that series is created. (Section
    501)



If an Event of Default for any series of debt securities occurs
and continues, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in
aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of
the series may declare the entire principal of all the debt
securities of that series to be due and payable immediately. If
such a declaration occurs, the Holders of a majority of the
aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of
that series can, subject to certain conditions, rescind the
declaration. (Sections 502, 513)

     
The prospectus supplement relating to each series of debt
securities which are Original Issue Discount Securities will
describe the particular provisions that relate to the
acceleration of maturity of a portion of the principal amount of
such series when an Event of Default occurs and continues.

     
An Event of Default for a particular series of debt securities
does not necessarily constitute an Event of Default for any
other series of debt securities issued under the Indenture. The
Indenture requires Post Apartment Homes to file an
officers certificate with the Trustee each year that
states that defaults do not exist under the terms of the
Indenture. (Section 1011) The Trustee may withhold notice
to the Holders of debt securities of any default, except
defaults in the payment of principal, premium, interest or any
sinking fund installment, if it considers such withholding of
notice to be in the best interests of the Holders.
(Section 601)

     
Other than its duties in the case of a default, a Trustee is not
obligated to exercise any of its rights or powers under the
Indenture at the request, order or direction of any Holders,
unless the Holders offer the Trustee reasonable indemnification.
(Sections 602, 603) If reasonable indemnification is
provided, then, subject to certain other rights of the Trustee,
the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding
debt securities of any series may, with respect to the debt
securities of that series, direct the time, method and place of:








 
 

    conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the
    Trustee; or


 


 
 

    exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee.
    (Sections 512)


     
The Holder of a debt security of any series will have the right
to begin any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for any
remedy only if:








 
 

    the Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice of a
    continuing Event of Default with respect to that series;


 


 
 

    the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the
    outstanding debt securities of that series have made a written
    request of, and offered reasonable indemnification to, the
    Trustee to begin such proceeding;


 


 
 

    the Trustee has not started such proceeding within 60 days
    after receiving the request; and


9



Table of Contents








 
 

    the Trustee has not received directions inconsistent with such
    request from the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal
    amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series during
    those 60 days. (Section 507)



However, the Holder of any debt security will have an absolute
right to receive payment of principal of and any premium and
interest on the debt security when due and to institute suit to
enforce such payment. (Section 508)


Defeasance
     
Defeasance and Discharge. At the time that Post Apartment
Homes establishes a series of debt securities under the
Indenture, it can provide that the debt securities of that
series are subject to the defeasance and discharge provisions of
the Indenture. If Post Apartment Homes so provides, it will be
discharged from its obligations on the debt securities of that
series if it deposits with the Trustee, in trust, sufficient
money or Government Obligations (as defined below) to pay the
principal, interest, any premium and any other sums due on the
debt securities of that series on the dates such payments are
due under the Indenture and the terms of the debt securities.
(Sections 1401 and 1404) As used above, Government
Obligations mean:








 
 

    securities of the same government which issued the currency in
    which the series of debt securities are denominated and in which
    interest is payable; or


 


 
 

    securities of government agencies backed by the full faith and
    credit of such government. (Section 101)


     
In the event that Post Apartment Homes deposits funds in trust
and discharges its obligations under a series of debt securities
as described above, then:








 
 

    the Indenture will no longer apply to the debt securities of
    that series, except for certain obligations to compensate,
    reimburse and indemnify the Trustee, to register the transfer
    and exchange of debt securities, to replace lost, stolen or
    mutilated debt securities and to maintain paying agencies and
    the trust funds; and


 


 
 

    Holders of debt securities of that series can only look to the
    trust fund for payment of principal, any premium and interest on
    the debt securities of that series. (Section 1402)


     
Defeasance of Certain Covenants and Certain Events of
Default. At the time that Post Apartment Homes establishes a
series of debt securities under the Indenture, it can provide
that the debt securities of that series are subject to the
covenant defeasance provisions of the Indenture. If Post
Apartment Homes so provides and makes the deposit described
under the heading  Defeasance and
Discharge above:

    it will not have to comply with the following restrictive
    covenants contained in the Indenture:










 
 

    Existence (Sections 1006);


 


 
 

    Maintenance of Properties (Section 1007);


 


 
 

    Insurance (Section 1008);


 


 
 

    Payment of Taxes and Other Claims (Section 1009);


 


 
 

    Provision of Financial Information (Section 1010); and


 


 
 

    any other covenant Post Apartment Homes designates when it
    establishes the series of debt securities; and










 
 

    it will not have to treat the events described in the fourth
    bullet point under the heading  Events of
    Default as they relate to the covenants listed above that
    have been defeased and no longer are in effect and the events
    described in the last bullet point under the heading
     Events of Default as Events of Default
    under the Indenture in connection with that series.



In the event of a defeasance, the obligations of Post Apartment
Homes under the Indenture and the debt securities, other than
with respect to the covenants and the Events of Default
specifically referred to above, will remain in effect.
(Sections 1402 and 1403)

If Post Apartment Homes exercises its option not to comply with
the covenants listed above and the debt securities of such
series become immediately due and payable because an Event of
Default has occurred, other than as a result of an Event of
Default specifically referred to above, the amount of money
and/or Government Obligations on deposit with the Trustee will
be sufficient to pay the principal, interest, any premium and
any other sums, due on the debt securities of such series on the
date such payments are due under the Indenture and the terms of
the debt securities, but may not be sufficient to pay amounts
due at the time of acceleration. However, Post Apartment Homes
would remain liable for the balance of the payments.

     
Condition. Such a trust will only be permitted to be
established if, among other things, Post Apartment Homes has
delivered to the Trustee an opinion of counsel (as specified in
the Indenture) to the effect that the Holders of the debt
securities will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S.
federal income tax purposes as a result of such defeasance or
covenant defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income
tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same
times as would have been the case if such defeasance or covenant
defeasance had not occurred, and such opinion of counsel, in the
case of defeasance, must refer to and be based upon a ruling of
the Internal Revenue Service or a change in applicable U. S.
federal income tax law occurring after the date of the Indenture
(Section 1404).


No Conversion Rights
     
The debt securities will not be convertible into or exchangeable
for any capital stock of Post or equity interest in Post
Apartment Homes.

DESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK
     
We have summarized certain terms and provisions of Posts
common stock in this section. The summary is not complete. We
have also filed Posts Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws
as exhibits to the registration statement. You should read
Posts Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws for additional
information before you buy any common stock.


General
     
Shares Outstanding. Posts authorized common stock
consists of 100,000,000 shares, par value $.01 per share. As of
December 31, 2000, 38,853,596 shares were issued and
outstanding, 808,596 shares were held in treasury, 5,181,411
shares were reserved for issuance upon exchange of outstanding
Units and 6,000,000 shares were reserved for issuance upon
exercise of outstanding stock options.

     
Dividends. Holders of common stock may receive dividends
when declared by Posts board of directors out of funds
that Post can legally use to pay dividends. Post may pay
dividends in cash, stock or other property. In certain cases,
holders of common stock may not receive dividends until Post has
satisfied its obligations to any holders of outstanding
preferred stock.

     
Voting Rights. Holders of common stock have the exclusive
power to vote on all matters presented to Posts
shareholders unless Georgia law or the certificate of
designations for an outstanding series of preferred stock gives
the holders of that series of preferred stock the right to vote
on specified matters. Each holder of common stock is entitled to
one vote per share. Holders of common stock have no cumulative
voting rights for the election of directors. This means that a
holder of a single share of common stock cannot cast more than
one vote for each position to be filled on the board of
directors.

     
Other Rights. If Post voluntarily or involuntarily
liquidates, dissolves or winds up its business, holders of
common stock will receive pro rata, according to shares held by
them, any remaining assets distributable to Posts
shareholders after Post has provided for any liquidation
preference for outstanding shares of preferred stock. When Post
issues securities in the future, holders of common stock have no
preemptive rights. This means that the holders of common stock
have no right, as holders of common stock, to buy any portion of
those issued securities.

     
Listing. Posts outstanding shares of common stock
are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol
PPS. Post intends to list with the New York Stock
Exchange any additional shares of common stock to be sold
pursuant to any prospectus supplement. EquiServe serves as the
transfer agent and registrar for the common stock.

     
Fully Paid. Posts outstanding shares of common
stock are fully paid and nonassessable. This means that the full
purchase price for the outstanding shares of common stock has
been paid and the holders of such shares will not be assessed
any additional monies for such shares. Any additional common
stock that Post may issue in the future pursuant to any
prospectus supplement or upon the conversion or exercise of
other securities offered under this prospectus will also be
fully paid and nonassessable.


Anti-Takeover Provisions Contained in Posts Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws
     
Certain provisions of Posts Articles of Incorporation and
Bylaws may make it less likely that management would be changed
or someone would acquire voting control of Post without consent
by the board of directors. These provisions may delay, deter or
prevent tender offers or takeover attempts that shareholders may
believe are in their best interests, including tender offers or
attempts that might allow shareholders to receive premiums over
the market price of their common stock.

     
Preferred Stock. Posts board of directors can at
any time, under its Articles of Incorporation and without
shareholder approval, issue one or more new series of preferred
stock. In some cases, the issuance of preferred stock without
shareholder approval could discourage or make more difficult
attempts to take control of Post through a merger, tender offer,
proxy contest or otherwise. Preferred stock with special voting
rights or other

12



Table of Contents

features issued to persons favoring management could stop a
takeover by preventing the person trying to take control of Post
from acquiring enough voting shares necessary to take control.

     
Classified Board. Members of Posts board of
directors are divided into three classes and serve staggered
three-year terms under Posts Bylaws. This means that only
approximately one-third of the directors are elected at each
annual meeting of shareholders and that it would take two years
to replace a majority of the directors unless they are removed.
Directors may be removed from office at any time with or without
cause.

     
Nomination Procedures. Shareholders, as well as
Posts board of directors, can nominate candidates for the
board of directors. However, a shareholder must follow the
advance notice procedures described in the Bylaws. In general, a
shareholder must submit a written notice of the nomination to
Posts corporate secretary at least 60 days before the
date set for the annual meeting of shareholders.

     
Proposal Procedures. Shareholders can propose that
business other than nominations to the board of directors be
considered at an annual meeting of shareholders only if a
shareholder follows the advance notice procedures described in
Posts Bylaws. In general, a shareholder must submit a
written notice of the proposal and the shareholders
interest in the proposal at least 60 days before the date
set for the annual meeting of shareholders.

     
Amendment of Bylaws. Under Posts Bylaws, the board
of directors can adopt, amend or repeal the bylaws, subject to
limitations under the Georgia Business Corporation Act.
Posts shareholders also have the power to change or repeal
Posts Bylaws.


Georgia Anti-Takeover Statutes
     
The Georgia Business Combination Code restricts certain business
combinations with interested shareholders and
contains fair price requirements applicable to certain mergers
with certain interested shareholders that are
summarized below. The restrictions imposed by these statutes
will not apply to a corporation unless it elects to be governed
by these statutes. Post has not elected to be covered by such
restrictions. The Georgia business combination statute regulates
business combinations such as mergers, consolidations, share
exchanges and asset purchases where the acquired business has at
least 100 shareholders residing in Georgia and has its principal
office in Georgia, and where the acquiror became an
interested shareholder of the corporation, unless
either (1) the transaction resulting in such acquiror
becoming an interested shareholder or the business
combination received the approval of the corporations
board of directors prior to the date on which the acquiror
became an interested shareholder, or (2) the
acquiror became the owner of at least 90% of the outstanding
voting stock of the corporation, excluding shares held by
directors, officers and affiliates of the corporation and shares
held by certain other persons, in the same transaction in which
the acquiror became an interested shareholder. For
purposes of this statute, an interested shareholder
generally is any person who directly or indirectly, alone or in
concert with others, beneficially owns or controls 10% or more
of the voting power of the outstanding voting shares of the
corporation. The statute prohibits business combinations with an
unapproved interested shareholder for a period of
five years after the date on which such person became an
interested shareholder. The statute restricting
business combinations is broad in its scope and is designed to
inhibit unfriendly acquisitions.

     
The Georgia fair price statute prohibits certain business
combinations between a Georgia business corporation and an
interested shareholder unless:








 
 

    certain fair price criteria are satisfied;


 


 
 

    the business combination is unanimously approved by the
    continuing directors;


 


 
 

    the business combination is recommended by at least two-thirds
    of the continuing directors and approved by a majority of the
    votes entitled to be cast by holders of voting shares, other
    than voting shares beneficially owned by the interested
    shareholder; or


 


 
 

    the interested shareholder has been such for at least three
    years and has not increased his ownership position in such
    three-year period by more than one percent in any twelve-month
    period.


13



Table of Contents

The fair price statute is designed to inhibit unfriendly
acquisitions that do not satisfy the specified fair
price requirements.


Limitation on Mergers and Asset Sales
     
Post may not engage in any merger, consolidation or other
combination with or into another person or sale of all or
substantially all of its assets unless such transaction includes
the merger of Post Apartment Homes or sale of substantially all
of the assets of Post Apartment Homes, which sale or merger must
be approved by the holders of a majority of the outstanding
Units. If Post were ever to hold less than a majority of the
Units, this voting requirement might limit the possibility for
acquisition or change in the control of Post. The foregoing
limitation may have the effect of precluding a merger,
consolidation or other combination of Post without the consent
of Posts board of directors.


Restrictions on Transfer
     
Ownership Limits. Posts Articles of Incorporation
contain restrictions on the number of shares of common stock
that a single shareholder may own. For Post to qualify as a REIT
under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, no more than 50% in value
of its outstanding shares of common stock may be owned, actually
and constructively under the applicable attribution provisions
of the Code, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the
Code to include certain entities) during the last half of a
taxable year or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable
year. The common stock must also be beneficially owned by 100 or
more persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year or
during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year. Because
Post has elected to be treated as a REIT, Posts Articles
of Incorporation contain restrictions on the acquisition of
common stock intended to ensure compliance with these
requirements.

     
Subject to exceptions specified in the Articles of
Incorporation, no person other than Messrs. Williams and
Glover may own, or be deemed to own by virtue of the applicable
attribution provisions of the Code, more than 6% (the
Ownership Limit) of the outstanding shares of common
stock. Messrs. Williams and Glover are subject to a separate
limitation (referred to as the Excluded Holder
Limit) pursuant to which they are prohibited from owning,
actually and constructively under the applicable attribution
provisions of the Code, more than 31%, in the aggregate, of the
outstanding shares of common stock. In addition,
Messrs. Williams and Glover are prohibited from acquiring
any shares of common stock if their acquisition would cause five
or fewer individuals to own, actually and constructively under
the applicable attribution provisions of the Code, in the
aggregate more than 50% in value of Posts outstanding
stock.

     
If any shareholder purports to transfer shares to a person and
either the transfer would result in Post failing to qualify as a
REIT, or the shareholder knows that the transfer would cause the
transferee to hold more than the applicable Ownership Limit or
Excluded Holder Limit, the purported transfer will be null and
void as to that number of shares the transfer of which would
cause a violation of the applicable limit, and the shareholder
will be deemed not to have transferred such excess shares. In
addition, if any person holds shares of common stock in excess
of the applicable Ownership Limit or Excluded Holder Limit, that
person will be deemed to hold the shares that cause the
applicable limit to be exceeded in trust for Post, and will not
receive dividends or distributions with respect to such shares
and will not be entitled to vote such shares. The person will be
required to sell such shares to Post for the lesser of the
amount paid for the shares and the average of the last reported
sales prices for the ten trading days immediately preceding the
sale or to sell such shares at the direction of Post, in which
case Post will be reimbursed for its expenses in connection with
the sale plus any remaining amount of such proceeds that exceeds
the amount such person paid for the shares and such person will
be entitled to receive only the balance of the proceeds. If Post
repurchases such shares, it may elect to pay for the shares with
Units.

     
All certificates representing shares of common stock will bear a
legend referring to the restrictions described above.

14



Table of Contents
     
Every owner of more than 5%, or such lower percentage as may be
required by the Code or the related regulations, of the issued
and outstanding shares of common stock must file a written
notice with Post containing the information specified in the
Articles of Incorporation no later than January 30 of each
year. In addition, each shareholder shall upon demand be
required to disclose to Post in writing such information as Post
may request in good faith in order to determine Posts
status as a REIT. The foregoing ownership limitations may have
the effect of precluding acquisition of control of Post without
the consent of the board of directors.

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED STOCK
     
This section describes the general terms and provisions of
preferred stock of Post that may be offered by this prospectus.
The prospectus supplement will describe the specific terms of
the series of the preferred stock offered through that
prospectus supplement and any general terms outlined in this
section that will not apply to that series of preferred stock.

     
We have summarized the terms and provisions of the preferred
stock in this section. The summary is not complete. We have also
filed Posts Articles of Incorporation as an exhibit to the
registration statement. You should read Posts Articles of
Incorporation and the Certificate of Designation, Preferences
and Rights (Certificate of Designation) relating to
the applicable series of the preferred stock for additional
information before you buy any preferred stock.


General
     
Pursuant to Posts Articles of Incorporation, Posts
board of directors has the authority, without further
shareholder action, to issue a maximum of 20,000,000 shares of
Preferred Stock, including shares issued or reserved for
issuance. As of December 31, 2000, Post had 1,150,000
shares designated as 8 1/2% Series A cumulative
redeemable preferred stock, of which 1,000,000 shares were
outstanding, 2,300,000 shares designated as 7 5/8%
Series B cumulative redeemable preferred stock, of which
2,000,000 shares were outstanding, and 2,300,000 shares
designated as 7 5/8% Series C cumulative redeemable
preferred stock, of which 2,000,000 shares were outstanding. The
board of directors has the authority to determine or fix the
following terms with respect to shares of any series of
preferred stock:








 
 

    the number of shares and designation or title of the shares;


 


 
 

    dividend rights;


 


 
 

    whether and upon what terms the shares will be redeemable;


 


 
 

    the rights of the holders upon Posts dissolution or upon
    the distribution of its assets;


 


 
 

    whether and upon what terms the shares will have a purchase,
    retirement or sinking fund;


 


 
 

    whether and upon what terms the shares will be convertible;


 


 
 

    the voting rights, if any, which will apply; and


 


 
 

    any other preferences, rights, limitations or restrictions of
    the series.



If Post purchases, redeems or converts shares of preferred
stock, it will retire and cancel them and restore them to the
status of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock.
These shares will not be part of any particular series of
preferred stock and may be reissued by Post.

     
As described under Description of Depositary Shares
below, Post may elect to offer depositary shares represented by
depositary receipts. If Post so elects, each depositary share
will represent a fractional interest to be specified in the
applicable prospectus supplement in a share of preferred stock.
If Post issues depositary shares representing interests in
preferred stock, the preferred stock will be deposited with a
depositary.

     
The preferred stock will have the dividend, liquidation,
redemption, voting and conversion rights described in this
section unless the applicable prospectus supplement provides
otherwise. You should read the prospectus supplement relating to
the particular series of the preferred stock it offers for
specific terms, including:








 
 

    the title and liquidation preference of the preferred stock and
    the number of shares offered;


 


 
 

    the initial public offering price at which Post will issue the
    preferred stock;


 


 
 

    the dividend rate or rates (or method of calculation), the
    dividend periods, the dates on which dividends will be payable
    and whether the dividends will be cumulative or noncumulative
    and, if cumulative, the dates from which the dividends will
    start to cumulate;


16



Table of Contents








 
 

    any redemption or sinking fund provisions;


 


 
 

    any conversion provisions;


 


 
 

    whether Post has elected to offer depositary shares as described
    under Description of Depositary Shares below; and


 


 
 

    any additional dividend, liquidation, redemption, sinking fund
    and other rights, preferences, privileges, limitations and
    restrictions.


     
When Post issues the preferred stock, the shares will be fully
paid and nonassessable. This means that the full purchase price
for the outstanding preferred stock will have been paid and the
holders of such preferred stock will not be assessed any
additional monies for such preferred stock. Unless the
applicable prospectus supplement specifies otherwise:








 
 

    each series of preferred stock will rank senior to Posts
    common stock and equally in all respects with the outstanding
    shares of each other series of preferred stock; and


 


 
 

    the preferred stock will have no preemptive rights to subscribe
    for any additional securities which Post may issue in the
    future. This means that the holders of preferred stock will have
    no right, as holders of preferred stock, to buy any portion of
    those issued securities.



Dividends
     
The holders of the preferred stock of each series will be
entitled to receive cash dividends, if declared by Posts
board of directors or its duly authorized committee, out of
assets that Post can legally use to pay dividends. The
prospectus supplement relating to a particular series of
preferred stock will set forth the dividend rates and dates on
which dividends will be payable. The rates may be fixed or
variable or both. If the dividend rate is variable, the
applicable prospectus supplement will describe the formula used
for determining the dividend rate for each dividend period. Post
will pay dividends to the holders of record as they appear on
Posts stock books on the record dates fixed by the board
of directors or its duly authorized committee.

     
The applicable prospectus supplement will also state whether the
dividends on any series of the preferred stock are cumulative or
non-cumulative. Dividends, if cumulative, will be cumulative
from and after the date set forth in the applicable prospectus
supplement. If Posts board of directors does not declare a
dividend payable on a dividend payment date on any
non-cumulative series of preferred stock, then the holders of
that series will not be entitled to receive a dividend for that
dividend period and Post will not be obligated to pay the
dividend for that dividend period even if the board of directors
declares a dividend on that series payable in the future.

     
Posts board of directors will not declare and pay a
dividend on any of its stock ranking, as to dividends, equal
with or junior to any series of the preferred stock unless full
dividends on such series of the preferred stock have been
declared and paid or declared and sufficient money is set aside
for payment. Until full dividends are paid, or declared and
payment is set aside, on each series of preferred stock ranking
equal as to dividends, then:








 
 

    Post will declare any dividends pro rata among the preferred
    stock of each series and any preferred stock ranking equal to
    the preferred stock as to dividends. This means that the
    dividends Post declares per share on each series of such
    preferred stock will bear the same relationship to each other
    that the full accrued dividends per share on each such series of
    the preferred stock bear to each other;


 


 
 

    other than such pro rata dividends, Post will not declare or pay
    any dividends or declare or make any distributions upon any
    security ranking junior to or equal with the preferred stock as
    to dividends or upon liquidation except dividends or
    distributions paid for with securities ranking junior to the
    preferred stock as to dividends and upon liquidation; and


 


 
 

    Post will not redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire, or set
    aside money for a sinking fund for, any securities ranking
    junior to or equal with the preferred stock as to dividends or
    upon liquidation except by conversion into or exchange for stock
    junior to the preferred stock as to dividends and upon
    liquidation.


17



Table of Contents

Post will not owe any interest, or any money in lieu of
interest, on any dividend payment(s) on any series of the
preferred stock which may be past due.


Redemption
     
A series of the preferred stock may be redeemable, in whole or
in part, at Posts option, and may be subject to mandatory
redemption pursuant to a sinking fund or otherwise, as described
in the applicable prospectus supplement. Redeemed preferred
stock will become authorized but unissued shares of preferred
stock that Post may issue in the future.

     
If a series of the preferred stock is subject to mandatory
redemption, the applicable prospectus supplement will specify
the number of shares that Post will redeem each year and the
redemption price. If preferred stock is redeemed, Post will pay
all accrued and unpaid dividends on the preferred stock up to,
but excluding, the redemption date. The prospectus supplement
will also specify whether the redemption price will be paid in
cash or other property. If (1) Post is only permitted to
pay the redemption price for a series of preferred stock from
the proceeds of a capital stock issuance and (2) the
proceeds from the issuance are insufficient or no such issuance
has occurred, then the terms of that series may provide that the
preferred stock will automatically and mandatorily be converted
into such capital stock.

     
If fewer than all of the outstanding shares of any series of the
preferred stock are to be redeemed, Posts board of
directors will determine the number of shares to be redeemed.
Post will redeem the shares pro rata from the holders of record
in proportion to the number of shares held by them, with
adjustments to avoid redemption of fractional shares.

     
Even though the terms of a series of preferred stock may permit
redemption of the preferred stock in whole or in part, if any
dividends, including accumulated dividends, on that series are
past due:








 
 

    Post will not redeem any preferred stock of that series unless
    Post simultaneously redeems all outstanding preferred stock of
    that series; and


 


 
 

    Post will not purchase or otherwise acquire any preferred stock
    of that series.



The prohibition discussed in the prior sentence will not
prohibit Post from purchasing or acquiring preferred stock of
that series to preserve its REIT status or pursuant to a
purchase or exchange offer if Post makes the offer on the same
terms to all holders of that series.

     
Unless the applicable prospectus supplement specifies otherwise,
Post will give notice of a redemption by mailing a notice to
each record holder of the shares to be redeemed, between 30 to
60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption. If Post
issues depositary shares representing interests in preferred
stock, it will send a notice to the depositary between 40 to
70 days prior to the date fixed for redemption. Post will
mail the notices to the holders addresses as they appear
on its stock records. Each notice will state:








 
 

    the redemption date;


 


 
 

    the number of shares and the series of the preferred stock to be
    redeemed;


 


 
 

    the redemption price;


 


 
 

    the place or places where holders can surrender the certificates
    for the preferred stock for payment of the redemption price;


 


 
 

    that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue
    on the redemption date; and


 


 
 

    the date when the holders conversion rights, if any, will
    terminate.



If Post redeems fewer than all shares of any series of the
preferred stock held by any holder, it will also specify the
number of shares to be redeemed from the holder in the notice.

18



Table of Contents
     
If Post has given notice of the redemption and has provided the
funds for the payment of the redemption price, then beginning on
the redemption date:








 
 

    the dividends on the preferred stock called for redemption will
    no longer accrue;


 


 
 

    such shares will no longer be considered outstanding; and


 


 
 

    the holders will no longer have any rights as shareholders
    except to receive the redemption price.



When the holder properly surrenders the redeemed shares, the
redemption price will be paid out of the funds provided by Post.
If Post redeems fewer than all of the shares represented by any
certificate, Post will issue a new certificate representing the
unredeemed shares without cost to the holder.

     
In the event that a redemption described above is deemed to be a
Tender Offer within the meaning of Rule 14e-1
under the Exchange Act, Post will comply with all applicable
provisions of the Exchange Act.


Conversion
     
The applicable prospectus supplement relating to a series of
convertible preferred stock will describe the terms and
conditions upon which shares of that series are convertible into
shares of common stock or a different series of preferred stock.


Rights Upon Liquidation
     
Unless the applicable prospectus states otherwise, if Post
voluntarily or involuntarily liquidates, dissolves or wind ups
its business, the holders of shares of each series of the
preferred stock will be entitled to receive:








 
 

    liquidation distributions in the amount stated in the applicable
    prospectus supplement; and


 


 
 

    all accrued and unpaid dividends, whether or not earned or
    declared.


     
Post will pay these amounts to the holders of shares of each
series of the preferred stock, and all amounts owing on any
preferred stock ranking equally with such series of preferred
stock as to distributions upon liquidation, out of Posts
assets available for distribution to shareholders before any
distribution is made to holders of any securities ranking junior
to the preferred stock upon liquidation.

     
The sale of all or substantially all of Posts property and
assets, its merger into or consolidation with any other
corporation or the merger of any other corporation into Post
will not be considered a dissolution, liquidation or winding up
of Posts business.

     
If (1) Post voluntarily or involuntarily liquidates,
dissolves or wind ups its business and (2) the assets
available for distribution to the holders of the preferred stock
of any series and any other shares of its stock ranking equal
with such series as to any such distribution are insufficient to
pay all amounts to which the holders are entitled, then Post
will only make pro rata distributions to the holders of all
shares ranking equal as to distributions upon dissolution,
liquidation or winding up of its business. This means that the
distributions Post pays to the holders of all shares ranking
equal as to distributions upon dissolution, liquidation or
winding up of its business will bear the same relationship to
each other that the full distributable amounts for which such
holders are respectively entitled upon such dissolution,
liquidation or winding up of Posts business bear to each
other.

     
After Post pays the full amount of the liquidation distribution
to which the holders of a series of the preferred stock are
entitled, such holders will have no right or claim to any of
Posts remaining assets.


Voting Rights
     
Except as described in this section or in the applicable
prospectus supplement, or except as expressly required by
applicable law, the holders of the preferred stock will not be
entitled to vote. If the holders of a series of preferred stock
are entitled to vote and the applicable prospectus supplement
does not state otherwise, then each share of preferred stock
will be entitled to one vote.

share of preferred stock, the holders of each depositary share
will be entitled to a fraction of a vote.

     
For any series of preferred stock having one vote per share, the
voting power of the series, on matters on which holders of such
series and holders of any other series of preferred stock are
entitled to vote as a single class, will solely depend on the
total number of shares in such series, and not on the aggregate
liquidation preference or initial offering price.

     
Whenever dividends on any shares of preferred stock are in
arrears for six or more consecutive fiscal quarters, the holders
of such shares of preferred stock, voting separately as a class
with all other series of preferred stock that have similar
voting rights, will be entitled to vote for the election of two
additional directors of Post a special meeting called by the
holders of record of at least 10% of any series of preferred
stock so in arrears or, if such request is received less than
90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or
special meeting of the shareholders, then at the next annual
meeting of shareholders, and at each subsequent annual meeting.
This right will continue until (1) if such series of
preferred stock has a cumulative dividend, all dividends
accumulated on such shares of preferred stock for the past
dividend periods and the then current dividend period shall have
been fully paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment
thereof set aside for payment or (2) if such series of
preferred stock does not have a cumulative dividend, four
consecutive quarterly dividends shall have been fully paid or
declared and a sum sufficient for the payment of the dividends
set aside. In such case, the entire board of directors of Post
will be increased by two directors.

     
Unless Post receives the consent of the holders of an
outstanding series of preferred stock and the outstanding shares
of all other series of preferred stock which (1) rank
equally with such series either as to dividends or the
distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding
up of Posts business and (2) have voting rights that
are exercisable and that are similar to those of such series,
Post will not:








 
 

    authorize, create or issue, or increase the authorized or issued
    amount of, any class or series of stock ranking prior to such
    outstanding preferred stock with respect to payment of dividends
    or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or
    winding up of Posts business; or


 


 
 

    amend, alter or repeal, whether by merger, consolidation or
    otherwise, the provisions of Posts Articles of
    Incorporation or of the resolutions contained in a Certificate
    of Designation creating such series of the preferred stock so as
    to materially and adversely affect any right, preference,
    privilege or voting power of such outstanding preferred stock.



This consent must be given by the holders of at least two-thirds
of all such outstanding preferred stock described in the
preceding sentence, voting together as a single class. Post will
not be required to obtain this consent with respect to the
actions listed in the second bullet point above, however, if it
only (1) increases the amount of the authorized preferred
stock, (2) creates and issues another series of preferred stock,
or (3) increases the amount of authorized shares of any
series of preferred stock, if such preferred stock in each case
ranks equal with or junior to the preferred stock with respect
to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of its business.

     
Under Georgia law, holders of each series of preferred stock
will be entitled to vote as a class upon any proposed merger and
any proposed amendment to the Articles of Incorporation, whether
or not the Articles of Incorporation so state, if the merger or
amendment would:








 
 

    increase or decrease the aggregate number of authorized shares
    of such series;


 


 
 

    effect an exchange or reclassification of all or part of the
    shares of the series into shares of another series;


 


 
 

    effect an exchange or reclassification, or create the right of
    exchange, of all or part of the shares of another class or
    series into shares of the series;


 


 
 

    change the designation, rights, preferences or limitations of
    all or a part of the shares of the series;


 


 
 

    change the shares of all or part of the series into a different
    number of shares of the same series;


20



Table of Contents








 
 

    create a new series having rights or preferences with respect to
    distributions or dissolution that are prior, superior or
    substantially equal to the shares of the series;


 


 
 

    increase the rights, preferences or number of authorized shares
    of any class or series that, after giving effect to the
    amendment, have rights or preferences with respect to
    distributions or to dissolution that are prior, superior or
    substantially equal to the shares of the series;


 


 
 

    limit or deny an existing preemptive right of all or part of the
    shares of the series;


 


 
 

    cancel or otherwise affect rights to distributions or dividends
    that have accumulated but have not yet been declared on all or
    part of the shares of the series; or


 


 
 

    cancel, redeem or repurchase all or part of the shares of the
    series.



Shareholder Liability
     
As discussed above under Description of Common
Stock  General, applicable Georgia law provides
that no shareholder, including holders of preferred stock, shall
be personally liable for the acts and obligations of Post and
that the funds and property of Post shall be the only recourse
for such acts or obligations.


Restrictions on Ownership
     
As discussed above under Description of Common
Stock  Restrictions on Transfer, for Post to
qualify as a REIT under the Code, not more than 50% in value of
its outstanding capital shares may be owned, directly or
indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Code
to include certain entities) during the last half of a taxable
year. To assist Post in meeting this requirement, Post may take
certain actions to limit the beneficial ownership, directly or
indirectly, by a single person of Posts outstanding equity
securities, including any preferred stock of Post. Therefore,
the Certificate of Designations for each series of preferred
stock may contain provisions restricting the ownership and
transfer of the preferred stock. The applicable prospectus
supplement will specify any additional ownership limitation
relating to a series of preferred stock.


Registrar and Transfer Agent
     
The Registrar and Transfer Agent for the preferred stock will be
set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement.

DESCRIPTION OF DEPOSITARY SHARES

General
     
This section describes the general terms and provisions of the
depositary shares. The prospectus supplement will describe the
specific terms of the depositary shares offered through that
prospectus supplement and any general terms outlined in this
section that will not apply to those depositary shares.

     
Post may offer fractional interests in preferred stock, rather
than full preferred stock. If Post does, it will provide for the
issuance by a depositary to the public of receipts for
depositary shares, each of which will represent a fractional
interest in a share of a particular series of preferred stock.

     
The shares of any series of preferred stock underlying the
depositary shares will be deposited under a separate deposit
agreement between us and a depositary which will be a bank or
trust company having its principal office in the United States
and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $50
million. Post will name the depositary in the applicable
prospectus supplement. Subject to the terms of the deposit
agreement, each owner of a depositary share will have a
fractional interest in all the rights and preferences of the
share of preferred stock underlying such depositary share. Those
rights include any dividend, voting, redemption, conversion and
liquidation rights.

     
The depositary shares will be evidenced by depositary receipts
issued under the deposit agreement. If you purchase fractional
interests in shares of the related series of preferred stock,
you will receive depositary receipts as described in the
applicable prospectus supplement. While the final depositary
receipts are being prepared, Post may order the depositary to
issue temporary depositary receipts substantially identical to
the final depositary receipts although not in final form. The
holders of the temporary depositary receipts will be entitled to
the same rights as if they held the depositary receipts in final
form. Holders of the temporary depositary receipts can exchange
them for the final depositary receipts at Posts expense.

     
If you surrender depositary receipts at the principal office of
the depositary (unless the related depositary shares have
previously been called for redemption), you are entitled to
receive at such office the number of preferred stock and any
money or other property represented by such depositary shares.
Post will not issue partial preferred stock. If you deliver
depositary receipts evidencing a number of depositary shares
that represent more than a whole number of preferred stock, the
depositary will issue you a new depositary receipt evidencing
such excess number of depositary shares at the same time that
the preferred stock are withdrawn. Holders of preferred stock
received in exchange for depositary shares will no longer be
entitled to deposit such shares under the deposit agreement or
to receive depositary shares in exchange for such preferred
stock.

     
We have summarized selected terms and provisions of the deposit
agreement, the depositary shares and the depositary receipts in
this section. The summary is not complete. We will file the form
of deposit agreement, including the form of depositary receipt,
as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K before Post
issues the depositary shares. You should read the forms of
deposit agreement and depositary receipt relating to a series of
preferred stock for additional information before you buy any
depositary shares that represent preferred stock of such series.


Dividends
     
The depositary will distribute all cash dividends received with
respect to the preferred stock to the record holders of
depositary shares representing the preferred stock in proportion
to the numbers of depositary shares owned by the holders on the
relevant record date. The depositary will distribute only the
amount that can be distributed without attributing to any holder
of depositary shares a fraction of one cent. The balance not
distributed will be added to and treated as part of the next sum
received by the depositary for distribution to record holders of
depositary shares.

22



Table of Contents

Redemption of Depositary Shares
     
If the series of the preferred stock underlying the depositary
shares is subject to redemption, the depositary shares will be
redeemed from the redemption proceeds, in whole or in part, of
such series of the preferred stock held by the depositary. The
depositary will mail notice of redemption between 30 to
60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption to the
record holders of the depositary shares to be redeemed at their
addresses appearing in the depositarys records. The
redemption price per depositary Share will bear the same
relationship to the redemption price per share of preferred
stock that the depositary share bears to the underlying share of
preferred stock. Whenever Post redeems preferred stock held by
the depositary, the depositary will redeem, as of the same
redemption date, the number of depositary shares representing
the preferred stock redeemed. If less than all the depositary
shares are to be redeemed, the depositary shares to be redeemed
will be selected pro rata or by any other equitable method
determined by Post that preserves Posts REIT status.

     
After the date fixed for redemption, the depositary shares
called for redemption will no longer be outstanding. When the
depositary shares are no longer outstanding, all rights of the
holders will cease, except the right to receive money or other
property that the holders of the depositary shares were entitled
to receive upon such redemption. Such payments will be made when
holders surrender their depositary receipts to the depositary.


Conversion
     
If any series of preferred stock underlying the depositary
shares is subject to conversion, the applicable prospectus
supplement will describe the rights or obligations of each
record holder of depositary receipts to convert the depositary
shares.


Voting the Preferred Stock
     
Upon receipt of notice of any meeting at which the holders of
the preferred stock are entitled to vote, the depositary will
mail information about the meeting contained in the notice to
the record holders of the depositary shares relating to such
preferred stock. Each record holder of such depositary shares on
the record date, which will be the same date as the record date
for the preferred stock, will be entitled to instruct the
depositary as to how the preferred stock underlying the
holders depositary shares should be voted.

     
The depositary will to vote the number of shares of preferred
stock underlying the depositary shares according to the
instructions received. Post will agree to take all action
requested by and deemed necessary by the depositary in order to
enable the depositary to vote the preferred stock in that
manner. The depositary will not vote any shares of preferred
stock for which it does not receive specific instructions from
the holders of the depositary shares relating to such preferred
stock.


Liquidation Preference
     
In the event of the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of
Post, whether voluntary or involuntary, the applicable
prospectus supplement will set forth the fraction of the
liquidation preference accorded each share of preferred stock
represented by the depositary share evidenced by a depositary
receipt.


Taxation
     
Owners of depositary shares will be treated for federal income
tax purposes as if they were owners of the preferred stock
represented by the depositary shares. Accordingly, for federal
income tax purposes they will have the income and deductions to
which they would be entitled if they were holders of the
preferred stock. In addition:








 
 

    no gain or loss will be recognized for federal income tax
    purposes upon the withdrawal of preferred stock in exchange for
    depositary shares as provided in the deposit agreement;


23



Table of Contents








 
 

    the tax basis of each share of preferred stock to an exchanging
    owner of depositary shares will, upon the exchange, be the same
    as the aggregate tax basis of the depositary shares exchanged
    for such share; and


 


 
 

    the holding period for the preferred stock, in the hands of an
    exchanging owner of depositary shares who held the depositary
    shares as a capital asset at the time of the exchange, will
    include the period that the owner held such depositary shares.



Amendment and Termination of the Deposit Agreement
     
The form of depositary receipt evidencing the depositary shares
and any provision of the deposit agreement may be amended by
agreement between us and the depositary at any time. However,
any amendment that materially and adversely alters the rights of
the existing holders of depositary shares will not be effective
unless approved by the record holders of at least two-thirds of
the depositary shares then outstanding. A deposit agreement will
automatically terminate if:








 
 

    all outstanding depositary shares relating to the deposit
    agreement have been redeemed; or


 


 
 

    there has been a final distribution on the preferred stock of
    the relevant series in connection with Posts liquidation,
    dissolution or winding up of its business and the distribution
    has been distributed to the holders of the related depositary
    shares.


     
A deposit agreement may be terminated by Post upon not less than
30 days prior written notice to the applicable
preferred stock depositary if (1) termination is necessary
to preserve Posts status as a REIT or (2) a majority of
each series of preferred stock affected by such termination
consents to such termination, whereupon such preferred stock
depositary will be required to deliver or make available to each
holder of depositary receipts, upon surrender of the depositary
receipts held by such holder, such number of whole shares of
preferred stock as are represented by the depositary shares
evidenced by such depositary receipts together with any other
property held by such preferred stock depositary with respect to
such depositary receipts. Post will agree that if a deposit
agreement is terminated to preserve its status as a REIT, then
Post will use its best efforts to list the preferred stock
issued upon surrender of the related depositary shares on a
national securities exchange.


Charges of Depositary
     
Post will pay all transfer and other taxes and governmental
charges arising solely from the existence of the depositary
arrangements. Post will pay associated charges of the depositary
for the initial deposit of the preferred stock and any
redemption of the preferred stock. Holders of depositary shares
will pay transfer and other taxes and governmental charges and
any other charges that are stated to be their responsibility in
the deposit agreement.


Resignation and Removal of Depositary
     
The depositary may resign at any time by delivering notice to
us. Post may also remove the depositary at any time.
Resignations or removals will take effect upon the appointment
of a successor depositary and its acceptance of the appointment.
The successor depositary must be appointed within 60 days
after delivery of the notice of resignation or removal and must
be a bank or trust company having its principal office in the
United States and having a combined capital and surplus of at
least $50 million.


Miscellaneous
     
Post will forward to the holders of depositary shares all
reports and communications that it must furnish to the holders
of the preferred stock.

     
Neither the depositary nor Post will be liable if the depositary
is prevented or delayed by law or any circumstance beyond its
control in performing its obligations under the deposit
agreement. Posts obligations and the depositarys
obligations under the deposit agreement will be limited to
performance in good faith of duties set forth in the deposit
agreement. Neither the depositary nor Post will be obligated to
prosecute or defend any legal proceeding connected with any
depositary shares or preferred stock unless satisfactory
indemnity is furnished to us and/or the depositary. Post and the
depositary may rely upon written advice of counsel or

24



Table of Contents

accountants, or information provided by persons presenting
preferred stock for deposit, holders of depositary shares or
other persons believed to be competent and on documents believed
to be genuine.


Restrictions on Ownership
     
As discussed above under Description of Common
Stock  Restrictions on Transfer, for Post to
qualify as a REIT under the Code, not more than 50% in value of
its outstanding capital shares may be owned, directly or
indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Code
to include certain entities) during the last half of a taxable
year. To assist Post in meeting this requirement, Post may take
certain actions to limit the beneficial ownership, directly or
indirectly, by a single person of Posts outstanding equity
securities, including any preferred stock of Post. Therefore,
the Certificate of Designations for each series of preferred
stock underlying the depositary shares may contain provisions
restricting the ownership and transfer of the preferred stock.
The deposit agreement may contain similar provisions. The
applicable prospectus supplement will specify any additional
ownership limitation relating to a series of preferred stock and
any depositary shares.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS

Introductory Notes
     
This discussion summarizes the material federal income tax
considerations under current law that may be relevant to a
prospective holder of the securities. It is not exhaustive of
all possible tax considerations and does not give a detailed
discussion of any state, local, or foreign tax considerations.
It also does not discuss all of the aspects of federal income
taxation that may be relevant to a prospective holder of
securities in light of his particular circumstances or to
certain types of holders (including insurance companies,
tax-exempt entities, financial institutions or broker-dealers,
foreign corporations and persons who are not citizens or
residents of the United States) who are subject to special
treatment under the federal income tax laws. As used in this
section, the term Post refers solely to Post
Properties, Inc.

     
Each prospective purchaser is advised to consult with his or
her own tax advisor regarding the specific tax consequences to
him or her of the purchase, ownership and sale of securities in
an entity electing to be taxed as a real estate investment
trust, including the federal, state, local, foreign and other
tax consequences of such purchase, ownership, sale and election
and of potential changes in applicable tax laws.

Qualification and Taxation of Post as a REIT
     
Post has made an election to be taxed as a REIT under
Sections 856 through 860 of the Code effective for its
short taxable year ending on December 31, 1993. Posts
qualification and taxation as a REIT depends upon Posts
ability to meet on a continuing basis, through actual annual
operating results, distribution levels and diversity of stock
ownership, the various qualification tests and organizational
requirements imposed under the Code, as discussed below. Post
believes that it is organized and has operated in such a manner
as to qualify under the Code for taxation as a REIT commencing
with its 1993 taxable year, and Post intends to continue to
operate in such a manner. No assurance, however, can be given
that Post will operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain
qualified as a REIT. See Failure to Qualify below.

     
In the opinion of King & Spalding, Post met the requirements
for qualification and taxation as a REIT for its taxable years
ended December 31, 1993 through 2000, and its current and
proposed method of operation should enable it to continue to
meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT.
This opinion is based on various assumptions relating to the
organization and operation of Post, Post Apartment Homes and the
partnerships and limited liability companies in which Post
Apartment Homes owns or has owned an interest and is conditioned
upon certain representations made by Post as to certain relevant
factual matters relating to the organization and expected manner
of operation of Post, Post Apartment Homes, and their
subsidiaries. King & Spalding is not aware of any facts or
circumstances that are inconsistent with these assumptions and
representations. Moreover, such qualification and taxation as a
REIT will depend upon Posts ability to meet on a
continuing basis, through actual annual operating results,
distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership, the
various qualification tests imposed under the Code discussed
below. King & Spalding will not review compliance with these
tests on a continuing basis. No assurance can be given that Post
will satisfy such tests on a continuing basis. See Failure
to Qualify below.

     
The sections of the Code relating to qualification and operation
as a REIT are highly technical and complex. The following
discussion sets forth certain material aspects of the Code
sections that govern the federal income tax treatment of a REIT
and its shareholders. The discussion is qualified in its
entirety by the applicable Code provisions, Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder and administrative and judicial
interpretations thereof, all of which are subject to change
prospectively or retroactively.

     
So long as Post continues to qualify for taxation as a REIT, it
generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax on
its net income that is distributed currently to its
shareholders. That treatment substantially eliminates the
double taxation (i.e., taxation at both the
corporate and shareholder levels) that generally results from
investment in a corporation. However, Post will be subject to
federal income tax in the following circumstances. First, Post
will be taxed at regular corporate rates on any undistributed
REIT taxable

26



Table of Contents

income, including undistributed net capital gains. Second, under
certain circumstances, Post may be subject to the
alternative minimum tax on items of tax preference,
if any. Third, if Post has (1) net income from the sale or
other disposition of foreclosure property (which is,
in general, property acquired by foreclosure or otherwise on
default of a loan or lease secured by the property) that is held
primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of
business or (2) other nonqualifying income from foreclosure
property, it will be subject to tax at the highest corporate
rate on such income. Fourth, if Post has net income from
prohibited transactions (which are, in general, certain sales or
other dispositions of property (other than foreclosure property)
held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of
business), such income will be subject to a 100% tax. Fifth, if
Post should fail to satisfy the 75% gross income test or the 95%
gross income test (as discussed below), and nonetheless has
maintained its qualification as a REIT because certain other
requirements have been met, it will be subject to a 100% tax on
the net income attributable to the greater of the amounts by
which it fails the 75% or 95% gross income test (or for taxable
years beginning after December 31, 2000, a 90% test).
Sixth, if Post should fail to distribute during each calendar
year at least the sum of:









 
 

    85% of its REIT ordinary income for such year,


 


 
 

    95% of its REIT capital gain net income for such year and


 


 
 

    any undistributed taxable income from prior periods,



it would be subject to a 4% excise tax on the excess of such
required distribution over the sum of the amounts actually
distributed and amounts retained for which federal income tax
was paid. Seventh, Post may be subject to a 100% excise tax with
respect to certain redetermined rents,
redetermined deductions, and excess
interest to ensure arms length (1) pricing for
certain services provided by taxable REIT subsidiaries of Post
to Posts tenants and (2) allocation of shared
expenses between Post and its taxable REIT subsidiaries.
Finally, if Post acquires any asset from a C corporation
(i.e., a corporation generally subject to full corporate-level
tax) in a transaction in which the basis of the asset in
Posts hands is determined by reference to the basis of the
asset (or any other property) in the hands of the corporation,
and Post recognizes gain on the disposition of such asset during
the ten-year period beginning on the date on which such asset
was acquired by Post, then, to the extent of such
propertys built-in gain (the excess of the
fair market value of such property at the time of acquisition by
Post over the adjusted basis of such property at such time),
such gain will be subject to the highest corporate rate
applicable, provided an election is made by Post to apply the
principles of Section 1374 of the Code to such gain (a
Section 1374 election).

     
When Columbus Realty Trust (Columbus), which Post
acquired by merger in 1997, was formed in 1993, it acquired
certain built-in gain assets from a C corporation in a carryover
basis transaction. Post believes that the aggregate net built-in
gain with respect to such assets as of the date hereof is
approximately $2.1 million. Post has filed a timely
Section 1374 election with respect to the built-in gain
assets acquired from Columbus. Accordingly, Post should be
subject to a Section 1374 corporate-level tax if Post
Apartment Homes sells a built-in gain asset in a taxable
transaction during the ten-year period commencing on the date
such assets were originally acquired by Columbus. Although Post
has previously disposed of some of the built-in gain assets
acquired from Columbus, Post has no current intention to incur
the built-in gain tax with respect to the remaining assets that
were acquired from Columbus.


Requirements for Qualification
     
The Code defines a REIT as a corporation, trust or association:







 
     
    (1) that is managed by one or more trustees or directors;


 


 
     
    (2) the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by
    transferable shares, or by transferable certificates of
    beneficial interest;


 


 
     
    (3) that would be taxable as a domestic corporation, but
    for Sections 856 through 859 of the Code;


 


 
     
    (4) that is neither a financial institution nor an
    insurance company subject to certain provisions of the Code;


27



Table of Contents







 
     
    (5) the beneficial ownership of which is held by 100 or
    more persons;


 


 
     
    (6) not more than 50% in value of the outstanding shares of
    which is owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer
    individuals (as defined in the Code to include certain entities)
    (the 5/50 Rule);


 


 
     
    (7) that makes an election to be a REIT (or has made such
    election for a previous taxable year which has not been revoked
    or terminated) and satisfies all relevant filing and other
    administrative requirements established by the IRS that must be
    met in order to elect and maintain REIT status;


 


 
     
    (8) that uses a calendar year for federal income tax
    purposes; and


 


 
     
    (9) that meets certain other tests, described below,
    regarding the nature of its income and assets.


     
The Code provides that conditions (1) to (4), inclusive,
must be met during the entire taxable year, that condition
(5) must be met during at least 335 days of a taxable
year of 12 months, or during a proportionate part of a
taxable year of less than 12 months, and that condition
(6) must be met during the last half of the taxable year.
For purposes of determining stock ownership under the 5/50 Rule,
a supplemental unemployment compensation benefits plan, a
private foundation or a portion of a trust permanently set aside
or used exclusively for charitable purposes generally is
considered an individual. A trust that is a qualified trust
under Section 401(a) of the Code, however, generally is not
considered an individual, and beneficiaries of such trust are
treated as holding shares of a REIT in proportion to their
actuarial interests in such trust. Finally, Post will be treated
as having met condition (6) above if it has complied with
certain Treasury Regulations for ascertaining the ownership of
its stock for such year and if it did not know (or after the
exercise of reasonable diligence would not have known) that its
stock was sufficiently closely held during such year to cause it
to fail condition (6).

     
Posts Articles of Incorporation contain restrictions
regarding the transfer of its shares that are intended to assist
Post in continuing to satisfy the share ownership requirements
described in clauses (5) and (6) above. See
Description of Common Stock  Restrictions on
Transfer.

     
Section 856(i) of the Code provides that a corporation that
is a qualified REIT subsidiary shall not be treated
as a separate corporation for federal income tax purposes, and
all assets, liabilities and items of income, deduction and
credit of a qualified REIT subsidiary shall be
treated as assets, liabilities and items of income, deduction
and credit of the REIT. A qualified REIT subsidiary
is a corporation, all of the capital stock of which is owned
directly by the REIT. Certain subsidiaries of Post constitute
qualified REIT subsidiaries. Accordingly, in applying the income
and asset tests described below, such subsidiaries will be
ignored for federal income tax purposes, and all assets,
liabilities and items of income, deduction and credit of such
subsidiaries will be treated as assets, liabilities and items of
income, deduction, and credit of Post. Such subsidiaries
therefore will not be subject to federal corporate income
taxation, although they may be subject to state and local
taxation.

     
In the case of a REIT that is a partner in an entity that is
classified for federal income tax purposes as a partnership,
Treasury Regulations provide that the REIT will be deemed to own
its proportionate share of the assets of the partnership (based
on the REITs capital interest in the partnership) and will
be deemed to be entitled to the gross income of the partnership
attributable to such share. In addition, the assets and gross
income of the partnership will retain the same character in the
hands of the REIT for purposes of Section 856 of the Code,
including satisfying the gross income and asset tests described
below. The ownership of interests in Post Apartment Homes by
Post will result in its proportionate share of the assets,
liabilities and items of income of Post Apartment Homes being
treated as assets, liabilities and items of income of Post for
purposes of the asset and income tests described below.

     
Income Tests. In order for Post to maintain its
qualification as a REIT, two requirements relating to gross
income must be satisfied annually. First, at least 75% of its
gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited
transactions) for each taxable year must consist of defined
types of income derived directly or indirectly from investments
relating to real property or mortgages on real property
(including rents from real property and, in certain
circumstances, interest) or temporary investment income. Second,
at least 95% of its

28



Table of Contents

gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited
transactions) for each taxable year must be derived from such
real property or temporary investments, and from dividends,
other types of interest and gain from the sale or disposition of
stock or securities, or from any combination of the foregoing.

     
The rent received by Post from its tenants will qualify as
rents from real property in satisfying the gross
income requirements for a REIT described above only if several
conditions are met. First, the amount of rent must not be based,
in whole or in part, on the income or profits of any person.
However, an amount received or accrued generally will not be
excluded from the term rents from real property
solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage or
percentages of receipts or sales. Second, the Code provides that
rents received from a tenant of Post will not qualify as
rents from real property in satisfying the gross
income tests if Post, or a direct or indirect owner of 10% or
more of Post, directly or constructively owns 10% or more of
such tenant (a Related Party Tenant) unless such
tenant is a taxable REIT subsidiary of the REIT and
certain other conditions are satisfied. Third, if rent
attributable to personal property that is leased in connection
with a lease of real property is greater than 15% of the total
rent received under the lease, then the portion of rent
attributable to such personal property will not qualify as
rents from real property. Finally, for the rent to
qualify as rents from real property, Post generally
must not operate or manage its properties or furnish or render
services to the tenants of such properties, other than through
an independent contractor who is adequately
compensated and from whom Post derives or receives no income.
The independent contractor requirement, however,
does not apply to the extent the services provided by Post are
usually or customarily rendered in connection with
the rental of space for occupancy only and are not otherwise
considered rendered to the occupant. In addition,
the independent contractor requirement will not
apply to noncustomary services provided by Post, the annual
value of which does not exceed 1% of the gross income derived
from the property with respect to which the services are
provided (the 1% de minimis exception). For
this purpose, such services may not be valued at less than 150%
of Posts direct cost of providing the services, and any
gross income deemed to have been derived by Post from the
performance of noncustomary services pursuant to the 1% de
minimis exception will constitute nonqualifying gross income
under the 75% and 95% gross income tests. In addition, in
taxable years beginning after December 31, 2000, a
taxable REIT subsidiary of a REIT may provide
noncustomary services to the tenants of the REIT without causing
the rents paid by such tenants to be disqualified as rents
from real property.

     
Post does not charge rent for any portion of any property that
is based, in whole or in part, on the income or profits of any
person. In addition, Post does not receive any material rent
from a Related Party Tenant. Finally, Post intends to provide
any noncustomary services through qualifying independent
contractors or its taxable REIT subsidiaries or in compliance
with the 1% de minimis exception.

     
Post Apartment Homes receives fees in consideration of the
performance of management, landscaping and administrative
services with respect to properties that are not wholly owned,
directly or indirectly, by Post Apartment Homes. A portion of
such fees (corresponding to that portion of any such property
owned by a third party) generally will not qualify under the 75%
or 95% gross income tests. Post will also receive certain other
types of non-qualifying income, including its allocable share of
any dividends paid by Post Services to Post Apartment Homes
(which will qualify under the 95% gross income test but not
under the 75% gross income test). Post believes, however, that
the aggregate amount of such fees and other non-qualifying
income in any taxable year will not cause Post to exceed the
limits on non-qualifying income under the 75% and 95% gross
income tests.

     
If Post fails to satisfy one or both of the 75% or 95% gross
income tests for any taxable year, it nevertheless may qualify
as a REIT for such year if it is entitled to relief under
certain provisions of the Code. Those relief provisions
generally will be available if the failure to meet such tests is
due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, Post
attaches a schedule of the sources of its income to its return,
and any incorrect information on the schedule was not due to
fraud with intent to evade tax. It is not possible, however, to
state whether in all circumstances Post would be entitled to the
benefit of those relief provisions. As discussed above in
 Qualification and Taxation of Post as a
REIT, even if those relief provisions apply, a 100% tax
would be

29



Table of Contents

imposed on the net income attributable to the greater of the
amount by which Post fails the 75% and 95% gross income tests
(or a 90% test for taxable years beginning after
December 31, 2000).

     
Asset Tests. At the close of each quarter of its taxable
year, Post also must satisfy several tests relating to the
nature of its assets. First, at least 75% of the value of
Posts total assets must be represented by real estate
assets (including its allocable share of real estate assets held
by Post Apartment Homes and any subsidiary partnerships or
limited liability companies), stock or debt instruments held for
not more than one year that are purchased with the proceeds of a
stock offering or long-term public debt offering of Post, cash,
cash items and government securities. Second, of the investments
not included in the 75% asset class, the value of any one
issuers debt and equity securities owned by Post
(including its allocable share of such securities owned by Post
Apartment Homes) may not exceed 5% of the value of Posts
total assets. Third, Post may not own more than 10% of any one
issuers outstanding voting securities, and, with respect
to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2000, more than
10% of the total value of any one issuers outstanding debt
and equity securities. Debt of an issuer that is secured by real
estate assets does not constitute a security for
purposes of the 5% and 10% asset tests.

     
For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2000, the 5%
and 10% asset tests described above do not apply to the
securities of a taxable REIT subsidiary of the REIT,
although the value of the debt and equity securities of all
taxable REIT subsidiaries owned by the REIT cannot represent
more than 20% of the value of the REITs total assets. Any
corporation in which a REIT directly or indirectly owns stock
(other than another REIT, a corporation which directly or
indirectly operates or manages a lodging facility or a health
care facility, and, with certain exceptions, a corporation which
directly or indirectly provides to any other person (under a
franchise, license, or otherwise) rights to any brand name under
which any lodging facility or health care facility is operated)
may be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary if the
REIT and the corporation file a joint election with the Internal
Revenue Service for the corporation to be treated as a taxable
REIT subsidiary of the REIT.

     
Post has filed joint elections with each of Post Services and
Addison Circle Access, Inc. to have such corporations, as well
as the corporate subsidiaries of Post Services, treated as
taxable REIT subsidiaries of Post as of January 1, 2001.
Accordingly, the debt and equity securities of Post Services and
Addison Circle Access that are held by Post Apartment Homes are
no longer subject to the 5% asset test or the 10% asset tests.
In addition, because the 10% voting securities test does not
apply to the securities of a taxable REIT subsidiary, Post
Apartment Homes intends to acquire the voting stock of Post
Services and Addison Circle Access, which is currently held by
executive officers of Post.

     
Post believes that its pro rata share of the debt and equity
securities of Post Services and Addison Circle Access represents
less than 20% of the value of Posts total assets, and,
with respect to taxable years ending on or before
December 31, 2000, represented less than 5% of the value of
Posts total assets. In addition, Post believes that it
satisfies the 5% and 10% asset tests with respect to Post
Apartment Homes ownership of the stock of certain
corporations that have not elected to become taxable REIT
subsidiaries of Post. No independent appraisals have been
obtained, however, to support these conclusions, and King &
Spalding, in rendering its opinion as to Posts
qualification as a REIT, is relying on Posts
representation as to the value of Posts assets. Although
Post plans to take steps to ensure that it continues to satisfy
all of the applicable REIT asset tests, there can be no
assurance that such steps will always be successful or will not
require a reduction in Post Apartment Homes overall
interest in the taxable REIT subsidiaries or its other
investments.

     
A number of constraints are imposed on REITs and their taxable
REIT subsidiaries to ensure that REITs cannot, through taxable
REIT subsidiaries, engage in substantial non-real estate
activities and also to ensure that taxable REIT subsidiaries pay
an appropriate corporate-level tax on their income. For example,
a taxable REIT subsidiary will be subject to the earnings
stripping rules of the Code with respect to interest paid
to the REIT, which could disallow a portion of the taxable REIT
subsidiarys interest deductions under certain
circumstances. In addition, a 100% excise tax may be imposed on
the REIT with respect to certain redetermined rents,
redetermined deductions, and excess
interest to ensure arms length (1) pricing for
services provided by the taxable REIT subsidiary to REIT tenants
and (2) allocation of shared expenses between the REIT and
the taxable REIT subsidiary.

Distribution Requirements. In order to qualify as a REIT,
Post is required to distribute with respect to each taxable year
dividends (other than capital gain dividends) to its
shareholders in an aggregate amount at least equal to
(1) the sum of (A) 95% (90% beginning in 2001) of its
REIT taxable income (computed without regard to the
dividends paid deduction and its net capital gain) and
(B) 95% (90% beginning in 2001) of the net income (after
tax), if any, from foreclosure property, minus (2) the sum
of certain items of non-cash income. Such distributions must be
paid in the taxable year to which they relate, or in the
following taxable year if declared before Post timely files its
federal income tax return for such year and if paid on or before
the first regular dividend payment date after such declaration.
To the extent that Post does not distribute all of its net
capital gain or distributes at least 95% (90% beginning in
2001), but less than 100%, of its REIT taxable
income, as adjusted, it will be subject to tax thereon at
regular ordinary and capital gains corporate tax rates.
Furthermore, if Post should fail to distribute during each
calendar year at least the sum of:








 
 

    85% of its REIT ordinary income for such year,


 


 
 

    95% of its REIT capital gain income for such year and


 


 
 

    any undistributed taxable income from prior periods,



it would be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the
excess of such required distribution over the sum of the amounts
actually distributed and amounts retained for which federal
income tax was paid.

     
Post has made and intends to continue to make timely
distributions sufficient to satisfy the annual distribution
requirements. In this regard, the partnership agreement of Post
Apartment Homes authorizes a qualified REIT subsidiary of Post,
as general partner, to take such steps as may be necessary to
cause Post Apartment Homes to distribute to its partners an
amount sufficient to permit Post to meet these distribution
requirements. It is possible, however, that Post, from time to
time, may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to
meet the distribution requirements due to timing differences
between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of
deductible expenses and the inclusion of such income and
deduction of such expenses in arriving at Posts taxable
income, or if the amount of nondeductible expenses (such as
principal amortization or capital expenses) exceeds the amount
of noncash deductions. In the event that such timing differences
occur, in order to meet the distribution requirements, Post may
cause Post Apartment Homes to arrange for short-term, or
possibly long-term, borrowing to permit the payment of required
dividends. If the amount of nondeductible expenses exceeds
noncash deductions, Post Apartment Homes may refinance its
indebtedness to reduce principal payments and borrow funds for
capital expenditures.

     
Under certain circumstances, Post may be able to rectify a
failure to meet the distribution requirements for a year by
paying deficiency dividends to its shareholders in a
later year, which may be included in its deduction for dividends
paid for the earlier year. Although Post may be able to avoid
being taxed on amounts distributed as deficiency dividends, it
will be required to pay to the IRS interest based upon the
amount of any deduction taken for deficiency dividends.

     
Recordkeeping Requirements. Pursuant to applicable
Treasury Regulations, Post must maintain certain records and
request on an annual basis certain information from its
shareholders designed to disclose the actual ownership of its
outstanding shares. Post intends to comply with these
requirements.


Failure to Qualify
     
If Post fails to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any taxable
year, and the relief provisions do not apply, it will be subject
to tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on its
taxable income at regular corporate rates. Distributions to
shareholders in any year in which Post fails to qualify will not
be deductible nor will they be required to be made. In such
event, to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and
profits, all distributions to shareholders will be taxable as
ordinary income and, subject to certain limitations of the Code,
corporate distributees may be eligible for the dividends
received deduction. Unless entitled to relief under specific
statutory provisions, Post also will be disqualified from
taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years

31



Table of Contents

following the year during which it ceased to qualify as a REIT.
It is not possible to predict whether in all circumstances Post
would be entitled to such statutory relief.


Other Tax Considerations
     
Tax Status of Post Apartment Homes and Other Pass-Through
Entities. All of Posts investments have been made
through Post Apartment Homes, which in turn holds an interest in
a number of subsidiary partnerships. In the opinion of King
& Spalding, Post Apartment Homes and the subsidiary
partnerships (other than any subsidiary partnerships that are
100% beneficially owned by Post Apartment Homes and disregarded
for federal income tax purposes) qualify as partnerships for
federal income tax purposes and not as associations taxable as
corporations or as publicly traded partnerships taxable as
corporations.

     
A publicly traded partnership is a partnership whose interests
are traded on an established securities market or are readily
tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent of
a secondary market. Treasury Regulations, which are effective
for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1995 (the
PTP Regulations), provide limited safe harbors,
which, if satisfied, will prevent a partnerships interests
from being treated as readily tradable on a secondary market or
the substantial equivalent thereof. The private
placement safe harbor applies if (1) all interests in
the partnership were issued in a transaction (or transactions)
that was not required to be registered under the Securities Act
and (2) the partnership does not have more than 100
partners at any time during the partnerships taxable year.
Post Apartment Homes does not currently meet the private
placement safe harbor of the PTP Regulations because it has more
than 100 partners.

     
Under a special grandfather rule, an existing partnership may
continue to rely on safe harbors contained in IRS Notice 88-75
until its first taxable year beginning after December 31,
2005, unless the partnership adds a substantial new line
of business after December 4, 1995. Post believes
that Post Apartment Homes has satisfied, and will continue to
satisfy, the private placement safe harbor under such Notice
because, in part, it has fewer than 500 direct and indirect
partners. In addition, Post believes that it has not added a
substantial new line of business since
December 4, 1995. Upon expiration of the grandfather
period, if Post Apartment Homes does not at that time satisfy
the private placement safe harbor of the PTP Regulations, it is
possible that Post Apartment Homes could be classified as a
publicly traded partnership. In that event, Post Apartment Homes
should satisfy a special passive income exception
provided in Section 7704(c) of the Code and therefore
should not be subject to federal income tax at the corporate
level. However, if Post Apartment Homes were classified as a
publicly traded partnership, the partners of Post Apartment
Homes would nevertheless be subject to special passive loss
limitation rules in Section 469(k) of the Code.

     
If Post Apartment Homes were treated as an association taxable
as a corporation, Post would fail the 75% asset test. Further,
if the subsidiary partnerships were treated as taxable
corporations, then Post would cease to qualify as a REIT if
Posts ownership interest in such partnership exceeded 10%
of the partnerships voting interests or the value of such
interest exceeded 5% of the value of Posts assets or,
beginning in 2001, 10% of the value of the outstanding interests
in the partnership. Furthermore, in such a situation,
distributions from the subsidiary partnerships to Post would be
treated as dividends, which are not qualifying income under the
75% gross income test described above and which could therefore
make it more difficult for Post to meet such test. See
 Failure to Qualify above for a
discussion of the effect of Posts failure to meet such
tests for a taxable year. Finally, Post would not be able to
deduct its share of losses generated by any of the subsidiary
partnerships in computing its taxable income.

     
Taxation of Post Services and Operating Subsidiaries.
Post Services and its existing subsidiaries file a corporate
consolidated return for federal income tax purposes. The
consolidated taxable income of these companies is subject to tax
at regular corporate rates. To the extent such entities are
required to pay federal, state and local income taxes, the cash
available for distribution to shareholders will be
correspondingly reduced.

     
State and Local Taxes. Post, Post Apartment Homes and its
subsidiaries may be subject to state or local taxation in
various state or local jurisdictions, including those in which
it or they transact business or own property. The state and
local tax treatment of Post, Post Apartment Homes and its
subsidiaries may not

32



Table of Contents

conform to the federal income tax consequences discussed above.
Consequently, prospective shareholders should consult their own
tax advisors regarding the effect of state and local tax laws on
an investment in the Securities.


Taxation of Taxable U.S. Shareholders
     
As long as Post qualifies as a REIT, distributions made to
taxable U.S. Shareholders (as hereinafter defined) out of
current or accumulated earnings and profits (and not designated
as capital gain dividends) will be taken into account by such
U.S. Shareholders (as hereinafter defined) as ordinary income
and will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction
generally available to corporations. As used herein, the term
U.S. Shareholder means a holder of Posts
shares that for United States federal income tax purposes is:







 
     
    (1) a citizen or resident of the United States,


 


 
     
    (2) a corporation, partnership or other entity created or
    organized in or under the laws of the United States, any State
    or the District of Columbia,


 


 
     
    (3) an estate the income of which is subject to United
    States federal income taxation regardless of its source, or


 


 
     
    (4) a trust if (A) a court within the United States is
    able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of
    the trust, and (B) one or more United States persons have
    the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust.


     
Distributions that are designated as capital gain dividends will
be taxed as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset
held for more than one year (to the extent they do not exceed
Posts actual net capital gain for the taxable year)
without regard to the period for which the U.S. Shareholder has
held his or her shares. The tax rates applicable to such capital
gain are discussed below. However, corporate U.S. Shareholders
may be required to treat up to 20% of certain capital gain
dividends as ordinary income. Distributions in excess of current
and accumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable to a
U.S. Shareholder to the extent that they do not exceed the
adjusted basis of the U.S. Shareholders shares, but will
reduce the adjusted basis of such shares. To the extent that
such distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings
and profits exceed the adjusted basis of a U.S.
Shareholders shares, such distributions will be included
in income as capital gain, assuming that such shares are capital
assets in the hands of the U.S. Shareholder. The tax rate to
which such capital gain will be subject will depend on the U.S.
Shareholders holding period for his shares. In addition,
any distribution declared by Post in October, November or
December of any year and payable to a U.S. Shareholder of record
on a specified date in any such month shall be treated as both
paid by Post and received by the U.S. Shareholder on
December 31 of such year, provided that the distribution is
actually paid by Post during January of the following calendar
year.

     
Post may make an election to treat all or part of its
undistributed net capital gain as if it had been distributed to
its shareholders. As described above, these undistributed
amounts would be subject to corporate level tax payable by Post.
If Post should make such an election, its shareholders would be
required to include in their income as long-term capital gain
their proportionate share of Posts undistributed net
capital gain as designated by Post. Each such shareholder would
be deemed to have paid his proportionate share of the income tax
imposed on Post with respect to such undistributed net capital
gain, and this amount would be credited or refunded to the
shareholder. In addition, the tax basis of the
shareholders stock would be increased by his proportionate
share of undistributed net capital gains included in his income
less his proportionate share of the income tax imposed on Post
with respect to such gains.

     
U.S. Shareholders may not include in their individual income tax
returns any net operating losses or capital losses of Post.
Instead, such losses would be carried over by Post for potential
offset against its future income (subject to certain
limitations). Taxable distributions from Post and gain from the
disposition of its shares will not be treated as passive
activity income and, therefore, U.S. Shareholders generally will
not be able to apply any passive activity losses
(such as losses from certain types of limited partnerships in
which a shareholder is a limited partner) against such income.
In addition, taxable distributions from Post generally will be
treated as

33



Table of Contents

investment income for purposes of the investment interest
limitations. Capital gains from the disposition of Posts
shares (or distributions treated as such), however, will be
treated as investment income only if the U.S. Shareholder so
elects, in which case such capital gains will be taxed at
ordinary income rates. Post will notify shareholders after the
close of Posts taxable year as to the portions of the
distributions attributable to that year that constitute ordinary
income, return of capital and capital gain.

     
In general, any gain or loss realized upon a taxable disposition
of Posts shares by a U.S. Shareholder who is not a dealer
in securities will be treated as a capital gain or loss. Lower
marginal tax rates for individuals may apply in the case of
capital gains, depending on the holding period of Posts
shares that are sold. However, any loss upon a sale or exchange
by a U.S. Shareholder who has held such shares for six months or
less (after applying certain holding period rules), will be
treated as a long-term capital loss to the extent of
distributions from Post required to be treated by such U.S.
Shareholder as long-term capital gain. All or a portion of any
loss realized upon a taxable disposition of Posts shares
may be disallowed if other Post shares are purchased within
30 days before or after the disposition.

     
For non-corporate taxpayers, the tax rate differential between
capital gain and ordinary income may be significant. The highest
marginal non-corporate income tax rate applicable to ordinary
income is 39.6%, but any capital gain generally will be taxed to
a non-corporate taxpayer at a maximum rate of 20% with respect
to capital assets held for more than one year. The tax rates
applicable to ordinary income apply to gain from the sale or
exchange of capital assets held for one year or less. In the
case of capital gain attributable to the sale or exchange of
certain real property held for more than one year, an amount of
such gain equal to the amount of all prior depreciation
deductions not otherwise required to be taxed as ordinary
depreciation recapture income will be taxed at a maximum rate of
25%. With respect to distributions designated by a REIT as
capital gain dividends (including any deemed distributions of
retained capital gains), the REIT also may designate and will
notify shareholders, subject to certain limits, whether the
dividend is taxable to non-corporate shareholders as a 20% rate
gain distribution or an unrecaptured depreciation distribution
taxed at a 25% rate.

     
The characterization of income as capital or ordinary may affect
the deductibility of capital losses. Capital losses not offset
by capital gains may be deducted against a non-corporate
taxpayers ordinary income only up to a maximum annual
amount of $3,000. Non-corporate taxpayers may carry forward
their unused capital losses. All net capital gain of a corporate
taxpayer is subject to tax at ordinary corporate rates. A
corporate taxpayer may deduct capital losses only to the extent
of its capital gains, with unused losses eligible to be carried
back three years and forward five years.


Information Reporting Requirements and Backup Withholding
     
Post will report to its U.S. Shareholders and to the IRS the
amount of distributions paid during each calendar year and the
amount of tax withheld, if any. Under the backup withholding
rules, a U.S. Shareholder may be subject to backup withholding
at the rate of 31% with respect to distributions paid unless
such holder (1) is a corporation or comes within certain
other exempt categories and, when required, demonstrates this
fact or (2) provides a taxpayer identification number,
certifies as to no loss of exemption from backup withholding and
otherwise complies with the applicable requirements of the
backup withholding rules. A U.S. Shareholder who does not
provide Post with his correct taxpayer identification number
also may be subject to penalties imposed by the IRS. Any amount
paid as backup withholding will be creditable against the U.S.
Shareholders income tax liability. In addition, Post may
be required to withhold a portion of capital gain distributions
to any U.S. Shareholders who fail to certify their nonforeign
status to Post. See  Taxation of Non-U.S.
Shareholders.


Taxation of Tax-Exempt Shareholders
     
Tax-exempt entities, including qualified employee pension and
profit sharing trusts and individual retirement accounts
(Exempt Organizations), generally are exempt from
federal income taxation. However, they are subject to taxation
on their unrelated business taxable income (UBTI).
While many investments in real estate generate UBTI, the IRS has
issued a published ruling that dividend distributions from a
REIT to an exempt

34



Table of Contents

employee pension trust do not constitute UBTI, provided that the
shares of the REIT are not otherwise used in an unrelated trade
or business of the exempt employee pension trust. Based on that
ruling, amounts distributed by Post to Exempt Organizations
generally should not constitute UBTI. However, if an Exempt
Organization finances its acquisition of shares with
acquisition indebtedness, a portion of its income
from distributions on such shares will constitute UBTI pursuant
to the debt-financed property rules. Furthermore,
social clubs, voluntary employee benefit associations,
supplemental unemployment benefit trusts and qualified group
legal service plans that are exempt from taxation under
paragraphs (7), (9), (17) and (20), respectively, of Code
section 501(c) are subject to different UBTI rules, which
generally will require them to characterize distributions from
Post as UBTI. In addition, in certain circumstances, a pension
trust that owns more than 10% (by value) of the shares of a REIT
would be required to treat a percentage of the dividends on its
shares as UBTI (the UBTI Percentage). The UBTI
Percentage is the gross income, less related direct expenses,
derived by Post from an unrelated trade or business (determined
as if Post were a pension trust) divided by the gross income,
less related direct expenses, of Post for the year in which the
dividends are paid. The UBTI rule applies to a pension trust
holding more than 10% of the Common Stock only if (1) the
UBTI Percentage is at least 5%, (2) Post qualifies as a
REIT by reason of the modification of the 5/50 Rule that allows
the beneficiaries of the pension trust to be treated as holding
shares of Post, in proportion to their actuarial interests in
the pension trust and (3) either (A) one pension trust owns
more than 25% of the value of such shares or (B) a group of
pension trusts individually holding more than 10% of the value
of shares collectively owns more than 50% of the value of the
shares.


Taxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders
     
The rules governing United States federal income taxation of
nonresident alien individuals and foreign corporations, foreign
partnerships and other foreign holders of Posts shares
that are not U.S. Shareholders as defined above (collectively,
Non-U.S. Shareholders) are complex and no attempt
will be made herein to provide more than a summary of such
rules. Non-U.S. Shareholders should consult with their own
tax advisors to determine the impact of federal, state and local
income tax laws with regard to an investment in the securities,
including any reporting requirements.
     
Distributions to Non-U.S. Shareholders that are not attributable
to gain from sales or exchanges by Post of United States real
property interests and are not designated by Post as capital
gain dividends will be treated as dividends of ordinary income
to the extent that they are made out of Posts current or
accumulated earnings and profits. Such distributions ordinarily
will be subject to a withholding tax equal to 30% of the gross
amount of the distribution unless an applicable tax treaty
reduces or eliminates that tax. However, if income from the
investment in shares is treated as effectively connected with
the Non-U.S. Shareholders conduct of a United States trade
or business, the Non-U.S. Shareholder generally will be subject
to federal income tax at graduated rates, in the same manner as
U.S. Shareholders are taxed with respect to such distributions
(subject to applicable alternative minimum tax and a special
alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien
individuals). In addition, a foreign corporation receiving
income that is treated as effectively connected income may be
subject to an additional 30% branch profits tax,
unless an applicable tax treaty reduces or eliminates that tax.
Post expects to withhold United States income tax at the rate of
30% on the gross amount of any such distributions made to a
Non-U.S. Shareholder unless (1) a lower treaty rate applies
and any required form (e.g., IRS Form W-88EN) evidencing
eligibility for that reduced rate is filed with Post or
(2) the Non-U.S. Shareholder files an IRS Form W-8ECI
with Post.

     
Distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and
profits of Post will not be taxable to a shareholder to the
extent that such distributions do not exceed the adjusted basis
of the shareholders shares but rather will reduce the
adjusted basis of such shares. To the extent that distributions
in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits exceed
the adjusted basis of a Non-U.S. Shareholders shares, such
distributions will give rise to tax liability if the Non-U.S.
Shareholder otherwise would be subject to tax on any gain from
the sale or disposition of his shares as described below.
Because it generally cannot be determined at the time a
distribution is made whether or not such distribution will be in
excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits, the
entire amount of any distribution normally will be subject to
withholding at the same

35

rate as a dividend. However, amounts so withheld are refundable
to the extent it is determined subsequently that such
distribution was, in fact, in excess of the payors current
and accumulated earnings and profits.

     
Post is required to withhold 10% of any distribution in excess
of its current and accumulated earnings and profits to the
extent that its shares constitute U.S. real property
interests under Section 897(c) of the Code.
Consequently, although Post intends to withhold at a rate of 30%
on the entire amount of any distribution to a Non-U.S.
Shareholder, to the extent that Post does not do so, any portion
of a distribution not subject to 30% withholding may be subject
to 10% withholding under certain circumstances.

     
For any year in which Post qualifies as a REIT, distributions
that are attributable to gain from sales or exchanges of U.S.
real property interests will be taxed to a Non-U.S. Shareholder
under the provisions of the Foreign Investment in Real Property
Tax Act of 1980 (FIRPTA). Under FIRPTA,
distributions attributable to gain from sales of United States
real property interests are taxed to a Non-U.S. Shareholder as
if such gain were effectively connected with a United States
business. Non-U.S. Shareholders thus would be taxed at the
normal capital gain rates applicable to U.S. Shareholders
(subject to applicable alternative minimum tax and a special
alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien
individuals). Distributions subject to FIRPTA also may be
subject to the 30% branch profits tax in the hands of a
corporate Non-U.S. Shareholder not entitled to treaty relief or
exemption. Post is required to withhold 35% of any distribution
that is designated by it as a capital gains dividend. The amount
withheld is creditable against the Non-U.S. Shareholders
U.S. tax liability.

     
Gain recognized by a Non-U.S. Shareholder upon a sale of shares
generally will not be taxed under FIRPTA if Post is a
domestically controlled REIT, defined generally as a
REIT in which at all times during a specified testing period
less than 50% in value of the stock was held directly or
indirectly by foreign persons. Post believes that it is
currently a domestically-controlled REIT and,
therefore, the sale of Common Stock will not be subject to
taxation under FIRPTA. However, because Posts shares are
publicly traded, no assurance can be given that Post is or will
continue to be a domestically-controlled REIT. In
addition, a Non-U.S. Shareholder that owned (actually or
constructively under certain constructive ownership rules) 5% or
less of Posts outstanding shares at all times during a
specified testing period will not be subject to tax under FIRPTA
if such shares are regularly traded on an established securities
market (e.g., the NYSE, on which the shares are currently
traded). Furthermore, gain not subject to FIRPTA will be taxable
to a Non-U.S. Shareholder if (1) investment in shares is
effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Shareholders
United States trade or business, in which case the Non-U.S.
Shareholder will be subject to the same treatment as U.S.
Shareholders with respect to such gain, or (2) the Non-U.S.
Shareholder is a nonresident alien individual who was present in
the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable
year and certain other conditions apply, in which case the
nonresident alien individual will be subject to a 30% tax on the
individuals capital gains. If the gain on the sale of
shares were to be subject to taxation under FIRPTA, the Non-U.S.
Shareholder would be subject to the same treatment as U.S.
Shareholders with respect to such gain (subject to a special
alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien
individuals).


Other Tax Consequences
     
Posts shareholders may be subject to state or local
taxation in various state or local jurisdictions, including
those in which they own property, transact business or reside.
The state and local tax treatment of Posts shareholders
may not conform to the federal income tax consequences discussed
above (although shareholders who are individuals generally
should not be required to file state income tax returns outside
of their state of residence with respect to Posts
operations and distributions).


Taxation of Holders of Preferred Stock, Depositary Shares and
Debt Securities
     
If Post offers one or more series of preferred stock or
depositary shares, or if Post Apartment Homes offers one or more
series of debt securities, then there may be tax consequences
for the holders of such securities not discussed herein. For a
discussion of any such additional consequences, see the
applicable prospectus supplement.

PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION
     
We may sell any securities:








 
 

    through underwriters or dealers;


 


 
 

    through agents; or


 


 
 

    directly to one or more purchasers.


     
The distribution of the securities may be effected from time to
time in one or more transactions:








 
 

    at a fixed price or prices, which may be changed from time to
    time;


 


 
 

    at market prices prevailing at the time of sale; or


 


 
 

    at prices related to such prevailing market prices, or at
    negotiated prices.


     
For each series of securities, the prospectus supplement will
set forth the terms of the offering including:








 
 

    the initial public offering price;


 


 
 

    the names of any underwriters, dealers or agents;


 


 
 

    the purchase price of the securities;


 


 
 

    our proceeds from the sale of the securities;


 


 
 

    any underwriting discounts, agency fees, or other compensation
    payable to underwriters or agents;


 


 
 

    any discounts or concessions allowed or reallowed or repaid to
    dealers; and


 


 
 

    the securities exchanges on which the securities will be listed,
    if any.


     
If we use underwriters in the sale, they will buy the securities
for their own account. The underwriters may then resell the
securities in one or more transactions at a fixed public
offering price or at varying prices determined at the time of
sale or thereafter. The obligations of the underwriters to
purchase the securities will be subject to certain conditions.
The underwriters will be obligated to purchase all the
securities offered if they purchase any securities. Any initial
public offering price and any discounts or concessions allowed
or re-allowed or paid to dealers may be changed from time to
time. In connection with an offering, underwriters and selling
group members and their affiliates may engage in transactions to
stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the
securities in accordance with applicable law.

     
If we use dealers in the sale, we will sell securities to such
dealers as principals. The dealers may then resell the
securities to the public at varying prices to be determined by
such dealers at the time of resale. If we use agents in the
sale, they will use their reasonable best efforts to solicit
purchases for the period of their appointment. If we sell
directly, no underwriters or agents would be involved. We are
not making an offer of securities in any state that does not
permit such an offer.

     
Underwriters, dealers and agents that participate in the
securities distribution may be deemed to be underwriters as
defined in the Securities Act of 1933. Any discounts,
commissions, or profit they receive when they resell the
securities may be treated as underwriting discounts and
commissions under that Act. We may have agreements with
underwriters, dealers and agents to indemnify them against
certain civil liabilities, including certain liabilities under
the Securities Act of 1933, or to contribute with respect to
payments that they may be required to make.

     
We may authorize underwriters, dealers or agents to solicit
offers from certain institutions whereby the institution
contractually agrees to purchase the securities from us on a
future date at a specific price. This type of contract may be
made only with institutions that we specifically approve. Such
institutions could include banks, insurance companies, pension
funds, investment companies and educational and charitable
institutions. The underwriters, dealers or agents will not be
responsible for the validity or performance of these contracts.

of securities with no established trading market and unless
otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, we

has not presently been established whether the underwriters, if
any, of the securities will make a market in the securities. If
the underwriters make a market in the securities, such market
making may be discontinued at any time without notice. No
assurance can be given as to the liquidity of the trading market
for the securities.

Underwriting
Agreement

October 13, 2010

J.P. Morgan Securities
LLC
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.
As Representative of the
several Underwriters listed
in Schedule 1 hereto

Ladies and Gentlemen:

Post Apartment Homes, L.P., a
Georgia limited partnership (the “ Operating
Partnership ”), proposes to issue and sell to the several
Underwriters listed in Schedule 1 hereto (the “
Underwriters ”), for whom J.P. Morgan Securities LLC,
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. are
acting as representatives (the “ Representatives
”), $150,000,000 principal amount of its 4.75% Senior Notes
due 2017 (the “ Securities ”). The Securities
will be issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of
September 15, 2000 (the “ Base Indenture ”)
between the Operating Partnership and U.S. Bank National
Association (as successor in interest to SunTrust Bank), as trustee
(the “ Trustee ”), as supplemented by the First
Supplemental Indenture, dated as of December 1, 2000 (the
“ Supplemental Indenture ” and together with the
Base Indenture, the “ Indenture ”).

The Operating Partnership hereby
confirms its agreement with the several Underwriters concerning the
purchase and sale of the Securities, as follows:

1. Registration Statement. The
Operating Partnership has prepared and filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the “ Commission ”)
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and
regulations of the Commission thereunder (collectively, the “
Securities Act ”), a registration statement on Form
S-3 (File No. 333-163895-01), including a prospectus, relating
to the Securities. Such registration statement, as amended at the
time it became effective, including the information, if any, deemed
pursuant to Rule 430A, 430B or 430C under the Securities Act to be
part of the registration statement at the time of its effectiveness
(“ Rule 430 Information ”), is referred to
herein as the “ Registration Statement ”; and as
used herein, the term “ Preliminary Prospectus ”
means each prospectus included in such


registration statement (and any amendments
thereto) before it becomes effective, any prospectus filed with the
Commission pursuant to Rule 424(a) under the Securities Act and the
prospectus included in the Registration Statement at the time of
its effectiveness that omits Rule 430 Information, and the term
“ Prospectus ” means the prospectus in the form
first used (or made available upon request of purchasers pursuant
to Rule 173 under the Securities Act) in connection with
confirmation of sales of the Securities. Any reference in this
Agreement to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus
or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the
documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to
Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Securities Act, as of the
effective date of the Registration Statement or the date of such
Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be, and
any reference to “amend”, “amendment” or
“supplement” with respect to the Registration
Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be
deemed to refer to and include any documents filed after such date
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the
rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (collectively,
the “ Exchange Act ”) that are deemed to be
incorporated by reference therein. Capitalized terms used but not
defined herein shall have the meanings given to such terms in the
Registration Statement and the Prospectus.

At or prior to the time when sales
of the Securities were first made (the “ Time of Sale
”), the Operating Partnership had prepared the following
information (collectively, the “ Time of Sale
Information ”): a Preliminary Prospectus dated
October 13, 2010, and each “free-writing
prospectus” (as defined pursuant to Rule 405 under the
Securities Act) listed on Annex B hereto as constituting part of
the Time of Sale Information.

2. Purchase of the Securities by
the Underwriters . (a) The Operating Partnership agrees to
issue and sell the Securities to the several Underwriters as
provided in this Agreement, and each Underwriter, on the basis of
the representations, warranties and agreements set forth herein and
subject to the conditions set forth herein, agrees, severally and
not jointly, to purchase from the Operating Partnership the
respective principal amount of Securities set forth opposite such
Underwriter’s name in Schedule 1 hereto at a price equal to
99.2340% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest, if
any, from October 18, 2010 to the Closing Date (as defined
below). The Operating Partnership will not be obligated to deliver
any of the Securities except upon payment for all the Securities to
be purchased as provided herein.

(b) The Operating Partnership
understands that the Underwriters intend to make a public offering
of the Securities as soon after the effectiveness of this Agreement
as in the judgment of the Representatives is advisable, and
initially to offer the Securities on the terms set forth in the
Prospectus. The Operating Partnership acknowledges and agrees that
the Underwriters may offer and sell Securities to or through any
affiliate of an Underwriter and that any such affiliate may offer
and sell Securities purchased by it to or through any
Underwriter.

(c) Payment for and delivery of the
Securities will be made at the offices of Hogan Lovells US LLP, 555
13th Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20004 at 10:00 A.M., New York
City time, on October 18, 2010, or at such other time or place
on the same or such other date, not later than the fifth business
day thereafter, as the Representatives and the Operating
Partnership may agree upon in writing. The time and date of such
payment and delivery is referred to herein as the “
Closing Date ”.

(d) Payment for the Securities shall
be made by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the
account(s) specified by the Operating Partnership to the
Representatives against delivery to the nominee of The Depository
Trust Operating Partnership, for the account of the Underwriters,
of one or more global notes representing the Securities
(collectively, the “ Global Note ”), with any
transfer taxes payable in connection with the sale of the
Securities duly paid by the Operating Partnership. The Global Note
will be made available for inspection by the Representatives not
later than 1:00 P.M., New York City time, on the business day prior
to the Closing Date.

(e) The Operating Partnership
acknowledges and agrees that the Underwriters are acting solely in
the capacity of an arm’s length contractual counterparty to
the Operating Partnership with respect to the offering of
Securities contemplated hereby (including in connection with
determining the terms of the offering) and not as a financial
advisor or a fiduciary to, or an agent of, the Operating
Partnership or any other person. Additionally, neither the
Representatives nor any other Underwriter is advising the Operating
Partnership or any other person as to any legal, tax, investment,
accounting or regulatory matters in any jurisdiction. The Operating
Partnership shall consult with its own advisors concerning such
matters and shall be responsible for making its own independent
investigation and appraisal of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and the Underwriters shall have no responsibility or
liability to the Operating Partnership with respect thereto. Any
review by the Underwriters of the Operating Partnership, the
transactions contemplated hereby or other matters relating to such
transactions will be performed solely for the benefit of the
Underwriters and shall not be on behalf of the Operating
Partnership.

3. Representations and Warranties
of the Operating Partnership . The Operating Partnership
represents and warrants to each Underwriter that:

(a) Preliminary Prospectus.
No order preventing or suspending the use of any Preliminary
Prospectus has been issued by the Commission, and each Preliminary
Prospectus, at the time of filing thereof, complied in all material
respects with the Securities Act and did not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading; provided that the Operating
Partnership makes no representation and warranty with respect to
any statements or omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity
with information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the
Operating

Partnership in writing by such Underwriter
through the Representatives expressly for use in any Preliminary
Prospectus.

(b) Time of Sale Information
. The Time of Sale Information, at the Time of Sale did not, and at
the Closing Date will not, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading; provided that
the Operating Partnership makes no representation and warranty with
respect to any statements or omissions made in reliance upon and in
conformity with information relating to any Underwriter furnished
to the Operating Partnership in writing by such Underwriter through
the Representatives expressly for use in such Time of Sale
Information. No statement of material fact included in the
Prospectus has been omitted from the Time of Sale Information and
no statement of material fact included in the Time of Sale
Information that is required to be included in the Prospectus has
been omitted therefrom.

(c) Issuer Free Writing
Prospectus. The Operating Partnership (including its agents and
representatives, other than the Underwriters in their capacity as
such) has not prepared, made, used, authorized, approved or
referred to and will not prepare, make, use, authorize, approve or
refer to any “written communication” (as defined in
Rule 405 under the Securities Act) that constitutes an offer to
sell or solicitation of an offer to buy the Securities (each such
communication by the Operating Partnership or its agents and
representatives (other than a communication referred to in clauses
(i) (ii) and (iii) below) an “ Issuer Free
Writing Prospectus ”) other than (i) any document
not constituting a prospectus pursuant to Section 2(a)(10)(a)
of the Securities Act or Rule 134 under the Securities Act,
(ii) the Preliminary Prospectus, (iii) the Prospectus,
(iv) the documents listed on Annex B hereto as constituting
the Time of Sale Information and (v) any electronic road show
or other written communications, in each case approved in writing
in advance by the Representatives. Each such Issuer Free Writing
Prospectus complied in all material respects with the Securities
Act, has been or will be (within the time period specified in Rule
433) filed in accordance with the Securities Act (to the extent
required thereby) and, when taken together with the Preliminary
Prospectus accompanying, or delivered prior to delivery of, such
Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, did not, and at the Closing Date
will not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading; provided that the Operating
Partnership makes no representation and warranty with respect to
any statements or omissions made in each such Issuer Free Writing
Prospectus in reliance upon and in conformity with information
relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Operating Partnership
in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives
expressly for use in any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.

(d) Registration Statement and
Prospectus. The Registration Statement is an “
automatic shelf registration statement ” as defined
under Rule 405 of the Securities Act that has been filed with the
Commission not earlier than three years prior to the date hereof;
and no notice of objection of the Commission to the use of such
registration statement or any post-effective amendment thereto
pursuant to Rule

401(g)(2) under the Securities Act has been
received by the Operating Partnership. No order suspending the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued by the
Commission and no proceeding for that purpose or pursuant to
Section 8A of the Securities Act against the Operating
Partnership or related to the offering has been initiated or, to
the knowledge of the Operating Partnership, threatened by the
Commission; as of the applicable effective date of the Registration
Statement and any amendment thereto, the Registration Statement
complied and will comply in all material respects with the
Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and
the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder
(collectively, the “ Trust Indenture Act ”), and
did not and will not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein not
misleading; and as of the date of the Prospectus and any amendment
or supplement thereto and as of the Closing Date, the Prospectus
will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
provided that the Operating Partnership makes no
representation and warranty with respect to (i) that part of
the Registration Statement that constitutes the Statement of
Eligibility and Qualification (Form T-1) of the Trustee under the
Trust Indenture Act or (ii) any statements or omissions made
in reliance upon and in conformity with information relating to any
Underwriter furnished to the Operating Partnership in writing by
such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in
the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and any amendment or
supplement thereto.

(e) Incorporated Documents.
The documents incorporated by reference in the Registration
Statement, the Prospectus and the Time of Sale Information, when
they were filed with the Commission conformed in all material
respects to the requirements of the Exchange Act, of 1934, as
amended, and the rules and regulation of the Commission thereunder
(collectively, the “ Exchange Act ”) and none of
such documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and any
further documents so filed and incorporated by reference in the
Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Time of Sale
Information, when such documents become effective or are filed with
the Commission, as the case may be, will conform in all material
respects to the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange
Act, as applicable, and will not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

(f) Independent Accountants.
The accountants who certified the financial statements and
supporting schedules included in the Registration Statement, the
Prospectus or the Time of Sale Information are independent public
accountants with respect to the Operating Partnership and its
subsidiaries within the applicable rules and regulations adopted by
the Commission and the Public Operating Partnership Accounting
Oversight Board (United States).

(g) Financial Statements. The
financial statements incorporated by reference in the Registration
Statement, the Prospectus and the Time of Sale Information,
together with the related schedules and notes, present fairly in
all material respects the financial position of each of Post
Properties, Inc. (“ Post Properties ”) and the
Operating Partnership and their consolidated subsidiaries at the
dates indicated and the statement of operations,
shareholders’ or partners’ equity (as applicable) and
cash flows of Post Properties and the Operating Partnership and
their consolidated subsidiaries for the periods specified; except
as may otherwise be stated in the Registration Statement, the
Prospectus or the Time of Sale Information, said financial
statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles (“ GAAP ”) applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods involved. The selected
financial data and the summary financial information included in
the Prospectus and the Time of Sale Information present fairly the
information shown therein and have been compiled on a basis
consistent with that of the audited financial statements included
in the Registration Statement.

(h) Disclosure Controls . The
Operating Partnership maintains a system of “ disclosure
controls and procedures ” (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by the Operating
Partnership in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms,
including controls and procedures designed to ensure that such
information is accumulated and communicated to the Operating
Partnership’s management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. The Operating Partnership
and its subsidiaries have carried out evaluations of the
effectiveness of their disclosure controls and procedures as
required by Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, and as of the end
of the Operating Partnership’s most recent fiscal quarter,
such disclosure controls and procedures were effective to perform
the functions for which they were established.

(i) Accounting Controls. The
Operating Partnership maintains systems of “ internal

This depends on our partner sites. Most of them fetch our listings every 30 minutes or sooner. A few come by just once a day. You should see your listing go live on all sites within 24 hours though.





How do tenants contact me if they're interested?


Tenants can reply to your posting directly to you. You'll receive emails to the email address with which you created your Rentalutions account. If you provided a phone number, prospective tenants will be able to call you.





How do I know that my listing is being posted?


You should begin receiving tenant interest within 24 - 48 hours. If you do not, contact us and we can have our rental listing expert review your profile. No charge.
