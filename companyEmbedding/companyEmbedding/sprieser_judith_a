CEO, Transora



Judith Sprieser turned a lot of heads when she decided last summer to take on the role of chief executive of Transora, a marketplace formed by 50 of the worlds largest consumer products companies.Sprieser was a leading contender to eventually take the top job at Sara Lee, a Chicago-based consumer products powerhouse with more than $20 billion in annual sales. At 46, she was CEO of Sara Lees food division and one of the highest-profile female executives in the U.S."The bottom line is I felt this was too great an opportunity, and too important to our industry to pass up," she says. "It would have to be that important to derail me from the track I was on."Six months into her job, Sprieser says she has been continually surprised by the level of cooperation she gets from members of the exchange. Companies like Johnson & Johnson, Kraft Foods and Procter & Gamble — fierce competitors for more than a century — regularly send top executives and strategists to Transoras main offices to collaborate on the project.Further reading



                                                                    Arista Stops Importing Switches Involved in Dispute            



                                                                    AT&T Modernizing Network With White Box Switches            


More challenging has been the task of evaluating technology to deploy on the exchange. "Based on the sales presentations, youre led to believe the technology is a lot further along," she says. "Its been a constant surprise and frustration to discover just how young the technology is."The companies backing the exchange are confident, however, in Spriesers ability to not only see through the smoke and mirrors, but to ensure Transora is a financial success. "Shes jumped into (the job) with supreme confidence," says Stephen David, chief information officer at Procter & Gamble, who was part of the CEO selection committee. "Thats going to spread down to everyone working with her."

Sprieser to head Transora


The defection of high ranking executives to dot-com companies continues, the latest being veteran Sara Lee Corp. executive Judith Sprieser, who is leaving her post in the bricks-and-mortar consumer products sector to head up the industry's largest business-to-business electronic purchasing exchange.
Ms. Sprieser, 46, will become the chief executive officer of Transora on July 17.
Transora operates Transora.com, a Web site where consumer products companies can buy materials and supplies. The company said its members represent more than half of the industry, accounting for $400 billion in purchasing power. In addition to Chicago-based Sara Lee, the exchange counts Kraft Foods Inc., Coca-Cola Co. and Unilever plc among its more than 50 industry members.
Ms. Sprieser spent 20 years working in the consumer products industry, 13 of them with Sara Lee. She currently is the CEO of Sara Lee Foods and Sara Lee Foodservice.
In a statement, Ms. Sprieser said, "I am looking forward to combining the strengths and knowledge of the old economy with the technology and opportunity of the new economy."
