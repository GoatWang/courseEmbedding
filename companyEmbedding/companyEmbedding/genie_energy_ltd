NEWARK, N.J., May 3, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Genie Energy Ltd. (NYSE:   GNE, GNEPRA) reported first quarter 2017 revenue of $69.4 million and net income attributable to common stockholders of $3.1 million -- $0.13 per basic and diluted share.








1Q17 OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS

Genie Retail Energy (GRE) returned to organic customer growth, increasing its meter and RCE base by six thousand and four thousand, respectively, compared to December 31, 2016.  Over the past two quarters, GRE has increased its meter count by 9%; 
GRE increased revenue to $69.4 million from $58.9 million in 1Q16, an increase of 17.9%.  It was GRE's fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue increases; 
GRE reported $7.7 million in income from operations and $8.3 million in Adjusted EBITDA* compared to $10.7 million and $10.9 million, respectively, in 1Q16; 
In Israel, subsequent to the close of the quarter, Genie Energy's Afek subsidiary initiated drilling of the Ness 10 exploratory well in the Northern region of its license area and expects to complete the well early this summer; 
Genie Energy's Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.075 per share on Genie Energy's Class A and Class B common stock to be paid on or about May 19, 2017.  

COMMENTS OF HOWARD JONAS, CHAIRMAN AND CEO OF GENIE ENERGY"Genie Retail Energy continued its string of solid operational and financial results.  We returned to organic meter growth by aggressively ramping up our meter acquisition activities in the territories we entered with our acquisition of Town Square Energy while delivering strong revenue growth and positive bottom line results. In Israel, drilling of our Ness 10 exploratory well – the first in the Northern portion of our license area and the sixth overall - is underway. Our models suggest that the resource identified in the South may be present in the North at significantly greater depths, and we are hopeful that the results from Ness 10, when fully analyzed, will validate that theory."

** Revenue and cost of revenue were adjusted in the amount of $0.7 million in 1Q16 for a correction in treatment of gross receipt tax that was previously recorded as a reduction in electricity revenue.

*** Genie Energy's Afek Oil & Gas subsidiary accounts for its oil and gas exploration activities under the "successful efforts" method of accounting.  Under this method, acquisition costs, costs of drilling exploratory wells, and exploratory-type stratigraphic test wells are capitalized on the balance sheet as "Capitalized exploration costs – unproved oil and gas property" pending determination of whether the well has found proved reserves.  Exploration costs, other than exploration drilling costs, are charged to expense in the statement of operations as "Exploration expense".  
BALANCE SHEET AND CASH FLOW HIGHLIGHTS At March 31, 2017, Genie Energy had $123.2 million in total assets, including $47.9 million in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (short and long term).  Liabilities totaled $41.5 million, and working capital (current assets less current liabilities) totaled $57.1 million.  
Net cash provided by operating activities in 1Q17 was $3.6 million compared to $9.1 million in the year ago quarter. 
On April 4, 2017, GRE entered into a credit agreement for a $20 million revolving loan facility and borrowed $4.3 million under this facility. 
DIVIDEND ON GENIE ENERGY COMMON STOCK |On May 2, 2017, Genie Energy's Board of Directors declared a 1Q17 dividend of $0.075 per share of Class A and Class B common stock with a record date of May 15, 2017.  The dividend will be paid on or about May 19, 2017.  The ex-dividend date will be May 11, 2017. The distribution will be treated as a return of capital for income tax purposes.

Genie Retail Energy
Genie Retail Energy – 1Q17 Results of OperationsGenie Retail Energy's RCEs increased to 287,000 at March 31, 2017, while meters served increased to 418,000.  The increases in both RCEs and meters served were primarily due to the initiation, during the first quarter, of GRE sales and marketing programs in the utility territories added through the acquisition of Town Square Energy (TSE).

Gross meter acquisitions in 1Q17 increased to 84,000 from 65,000 in the year ago quarter.  Meters enrolled in offerings with fixed rate characteristics constituted approximately 31% of GRE's electric load during March, 2017 compared to 32% of GRE's electric load during December, 2016.  
GRE's average monthly customer churn increased to 6.1% in 1Q17 from 5.9% in the year ago quarter, and improved from 6.4% in 4Q16. Note that GRE has modified its method of calculating churn and the figures for all periods presented reflect the revised methodology.
As in prior quarters, GRE generated all of Genie Energy's revenue and gross profit.  
GRE's revenue increased to $69.4 million in 1Q17 from $58.9 million in 1Q16 on increased sales of both electricity and natural gas. Electricity revenue increased to $52.5 million in 1Q17 from $45.1 million in 1Q16.  Kilowatt hours sold increased substantially, primarily on an increase in electricity meters served, more than offsetting a decrease in average revenue per kilowatt hour sold. Per meter electricity consumption also increased slightly.
Natural gas sales increased to $16.5 million in 1Q17 from $13.4 million in 1Q16.  Average revenue per therm sold increased significantly and consumption per meter increased slightly, more than offsetting a decline in therms sold resulting primarily from a reduction in natural gas meters served. 
GRE's gross margin percentage decreased to 34.0% in 1Q17 from 40.8% in 1Q16.  The gross margin on electricity sales declined to 36.1% in 1Q17 from 46.1% in 1Q16.  The average revenue per kilowatt hour sold declined even as the underlying commodity cost increased -- reflecting intensification of competition in key markets, and an increase in the proportion of customers on plans with fixed rate characteristics.  The gross margin on natural gas sales increased to 26.5% from 22.8% in 1Q16 as an increase in average revenue per therm outpaced an increase in average cost per therm. 
GRE's gross profit in 1Q17 was $23.6 million compared to $24.0 million in 1Q16 primarily driven by the narrowing of the gross margin percentage on sales of electricity, partially offset by the increases in kilowatt hours sold and improvement in the gross margin percentage on gas sales.  
GRE's SG&A expense increased to $15.9 million in 1Q17 from $13.3 million in 1Q16 as a result of increased meter acquisition costs generated by the higher level of meter acquisitions, payroll and related expense and amortization of the intangible assets acquired in the TSE acquisition. 
GRE's income from operations decreased to $7.7 million in 1Q17 from $10.7 million in the year ago quarter reflecting the reduced gross profit on electricity sales and the increased pace of customer acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA decreased to $8.3 million in 1Q17 from $10.9 million in 1Q16.
Genie Retail Energy – New York Regulatory Update\In December 2016, the New York State Public Service Commission (NY PSC) issued an order prohibiting retail energy providers from serving customers enrolled in utility low-income assistance programs (low-income customers) throughout New York State.  The December order largely replicated a NY PSC order issued in July of 2016 that was subsequently stayed by a ruling of a New York court on procedural grounds.  The REP industry has filed a legal challenge to the NY PSC's December order. On January 25, 2017, the NY PSC granted an industry request to delay implementation of the order until May 26, 2017 to allow time for judicial review.
The NY PSC has also undertaken a broader examination of the role played by REPs in retail energy markets which may result in additional restrictions on REP operations in New York State.  In February 2016, the NY PSC issued an order barring REPs from serving any customer unless their price was equal to or below the incumbent utility provider's price except where the offering met certain renewable energy requirements. In July 2016, a New York court struck down key provisions of that February order.  
Afek Subsequent to the close of the quarter, in April of this year, Afek spudded its sixth exploratory well, Ness 10, which is the first located north of the Sheikh-Ali Fault.  Reprocessed seismic and other data indicate that the source rock that contains the resource in the southern portion of the license area extends north of the fault, but at significantly greater depths than in the southern portion.  The planned drilling at Ness 10 seeks to confirm the presence of organics at the site and to determine whether the geological conditions necessary to convert early-stage maturated organics to light crude are present.  Drilling is expected to be completed early this summer.
G&A expense at Afek was $434 thousand in 1Q17 compared to $136 thousand in 1Q16.  Exploration expense was $851 thousand compared to $1.7 million in the comparable period.  
Afek's loss from operations and negative Adjusted EBITDA improved to $1.3 million in 1Q17 from $1.8 million in 1Q16 reflecting the reduction in exploration expense. 
During 1Q17, Afek's capitalized exploration costs were $1.1 million compared to $8.0 million in 1Q16. 
Genie Oil and Gas (GOGAS) The GOGAS segment is comprised of inactive oil shale projects.  The GOGAS segment's loss from operations in 1Q17 was $97 thousand compared to $469 thousand in 1Q16.
CorporateGenie Energy's consolidated results include corporate overhead.  In 1Q17, corporate G&A expense was $2.4 million including $1.1 million in non-cash compensation, the same as in the year ago period.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures for the First Quarter 2017 and 2016 
In addition to disclosing financial results that are determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP), Genie Energy also disclosed for the first quarter of 2017, as well as for comparable periods, Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. 
Genie Energy's measure of Adjusted EBITDA consists of gross profit less selling, general and administrative expense, research and development expense, exploration expense and equity in the net loss of AMSO, LLC, plus depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation (which are included in selling, general and administrative expense). Another way of calculating Adjusted EBITDA is to start with income (loss) from operations, and add depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and other operating loss, net.
Management believes that Genie Energy's Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses that may not be indicative of Genie Energy's or the relevant segment's core operating results. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA, among other measures, as a relevant indicator of core operational strengths in its financial and operational decision making. In addition, management uses Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate operating performance in relation to Genie Energy's competitors. Disclosure of this financial measure may be useful to investors in evaluating performance and allows for greater transparency to the underlying supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. In addition, Genie Energy has historically reported Adjusted EBITDA and believes it is commonly used by readers of financial information in assessing performance, therefore the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in financial reporting at this time.
Management refers to Adjusted EBITDA, as well as the GAAP measures gross profit, income (loss) from operations and net income (loss), on a segment and/or consolidated level to facilitate internal and external comparisons to the segments' and Genie Energy's historical operating results, in making operating decisions, for budget and planning purposes, and to form the basis upon which management is compensated.
Although depreciation and amortization are considered operating costs under GAAP, they primarily represent the non-cash current period allocation of costs associated with long-lived assets acquired or constructed in prior periods. While Genie Energy's oil and gas exploration business may be capital intensive, Genie Energy does not expect to incur significant depreciation or depletion expense for the foreseeable future. Genie Energy's operating results exclusive of depreciation and amortization is therefore a useful indicator of its current performance. 
Stock-based compensation recognized by Genie Energy and other companies may not be comparable because of the various valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of types of awards that are permitted under GAAP. Stock-based compensation is excluded from Genie Energy's calculation of Adjusted EBITDA because management believes this allows investors to make more meaningful comparisons of the operating results of Genie Energy's core business with the results of other companies. However, stock-based compensation will continue to be a significant expense for Genie Energy for the foreseeable future and an important part of employees' compensation that impacts their performance.
Other operating loss, net, was incurred from drilling and related operations for the Mei Golan Water Cooperative, a water cooperative of agricultural settlements in the Golan Heights. Since this was a non-routine event, and drilling for water is not part of Genie Energy's or the relevant segments core operations, the loss was excluded from Adjusted EBITDA.
Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, gross profit, income (loss) from operations, cash flow from operating activities, net income (loss), basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share or other measures of liquidity and financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, Genie Energy's measurements of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
Following is the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is income (loss) from operations for Genie Energy's reportable segments and net income (loss) for Genie Energy on a consolidated basis.

NEWARK, N.J., March 8, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Genie Energy Ltd. (NYSE:   GNE, GNEPRA) reported fourth quarter 2016 revenue of $51.5 million and a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $1.2 million -- $0.05 per basic and diluted share.  For the full year 2016, Genie Energy reported revenue of $212.1 million and a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $26.0 million -- $1.14 per basic and diluted share.
HIGHLIGHTS










Genie Energy's Board of Directors has increased the quarterly dividend on Genie Energy's Class A and Class B common stock by 25% and declared a 4Q16 dividend of $0.075 to be paid on or about March 24, 2017.  The Board also named Michael Stein as the company's Chief Operating Officer. 


Genie Retail Energy (GRE) generated $2.7 million in income from operations in 4Q16 compared to $0.9 million in the year ago quarter.  Full year 2016 income from operations was $26.5 million compared to $11.1 million in 2015; 


In November 2016, GRE acquired a privately held retail energy provider operating as Town Square Energy (TSE) for cash of $9.5 million plus $1.6 million for TSE's net working capital.


TSE contributed approximately 51 thousand electric-only RCEs and 44 thousand electric meters at December 31, 2016, more than offsetting more modest organic declines in GRE's RCEs and meters compared to September 30, 2016. Including TSE's customer base, GRE added 42 thousand RCEs and 29 thousand net meters in the fourth quarter.  For the full year 2016, Genie Retail Energy added 24 thousand RCEs and 20 thousand net meters served;


Including the acquisition of TSE, GRE expanded its geographic footprint to five new states during 2016– Ohio, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Connecticut. 


In Israel, Genie Energy's Afek subsidiary expects to spud the Ness 10 exploratory well in the Northern region of its license area later this month and complete the well during the second quarter.  Afek's exploratory license has been extended until April, 2018.

COMMENTS OF HOWARD JONAS, CHAIRMAN AND CEO OF GENIE ENERGY"GRE racked up another strong quarter, including a significant expansion of its customer base and geographic footprint through the acquisition of Town Square Energy.  GRE's revenue, income from operations and Adjusted EBITDA all increased substantially compared to the year ago quarter. For the full year, GRE greatly improved its bottom line performance, generating $26.5 million in income from operations compared to $11.1 million in 2015.  In Israel, our Afek Oil and Gas subsidiary will soon begin drilling an exploratory well in the northern portion of our license area where the geology may be more favorable to the development of mature hydrocarbons.
"Genie Energy's Board of Directors has raised the quarterly dividend on our common stock to $0.075 in light of our retail energy business's continued robust performance and positive outlook as well as the sharpened focus of our oil and gas exploration effort in northern Israel. These developments have enhanced our free cash flow generation and, in combination with our strong and liquid balance sheet, position us to return more cash to our stockholders even as we explore new growth opportunities."

   *Adjusted EBITDA for all periods is a non-GAAP measure intended to provide useful information that supplements the core operating results in accordance with GAAP of Genie Energy or the relevant segment.  Please refer to the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures at the end of this release for a complete explanation of Adjusted EBITDA and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. ** Revenue and cost of revenue were adjusted for a correction in treatment of Gross Receipts Tax that was previously reported as a reduction in electricity revenue, in the amount of $0.7 million in 4Q15 and $2.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. *** Genie Energy's Afek Oil & Gas subsidiary accounts for its oil and gas exploration activities under the "successful efforts" method of accounting.  Under this method, acquisition costs, costs of drilling exploratory wells, and exploratory-type stratigraphic test wells are capitalized on the balance sheet as "Capitalized exploration costs – unproved oil and gas property" pending determination of whether the well has found proved reserves.  Exploration costs, other than exploration drilling costs, are charged to expense in the statement of operations as "Exploration expense".       




BALANCE SHEET AND CASH FLOW HIGHLIGHTS At December 31, 2016, Genie Energy had $121.8 million in total assets, including $47.1 million in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (short and long term).  Liabilities totaled $41.9 million, and working capital (current assets less current liabilities) totaled $56.7 million.  
Net cash provided by operating activities in 4Q16 was $3.9 million compared to net cash used in operating activities of $3.6 million in the year ago quarter.  For the full year 2016, net cash provided by operating activities totaled $15.6 million compared to net cash used in operating activities of $3.1 million in 2015.
DIVIDEND ON GENIE ENERGY COMMON STOCK On March 7, 2017, Genie Energy's Board of Directors declared a 4Q16 dividend of $0.075 for the holders of Class A and Class B common stock of record on March 20, 2017.  The dividend will be paid on March 24, 2017.  The ex-dividend date will be March 16, 2017. The distribution will be treated as an ordinary dividend for income tax purposes.
GENIE ENERGY NAMES MICHAEL STEIN AS CHIEF OPERATING OFFICERThe Board of Directors of Genie Energy has appointed Michael Stein as the company's Chief Operating Officer. In addition to his new responsibilities, Mr. Stein will continue to serve as Chief Executive Officer of Genie Retail Energy, a position he has held since May of 2015.

   *Adjusted EBITDA for all periods is a non-GAAP measure intended to provide useful information that supplements the core operating results in accordance with GAAP of Genie Energy or the relevant segment.  Please refer to the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measure at the end of this release for a complete explanation of Adjusted EBITDA and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.   ** Revenue and cost of revenue were adjusted for a correction in treatment of Gross Receipts Tax that was previously reported as a reduction in electricity revenue, in the amount of $0.7 million in 4Q15 and $2.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2015.   *** Genie Energy's Afek Oil & Gas subsidiary accounts for its oil and gas exploration activities under the "successful efforts" method of accounting.  Under this method, acquisition costs, costs of drilling exploratory wells, and exploratory-type stratigraphic test wells are capitalized on the balance sheet as "Capitalized exploration costs – unproved oil and gas property" pending determination of whether the well has found proved reserves.  Exploration costs, other than exploration drilling costs, are charged to expense in the statement of operations as "Exploration expense".     




Genie Retail Energy
Genie Retail Energy – 4Q16 and Full Year 2016 Results of OperationsGenie Retail Energy's RCEs increased from the prior quarter's end to 283,000 at December 31, 2016, while meters served increased to 412,000.  The increase was primarily due to the impact of the TSE acquisition in November 2016 which more than offset organic decreases in REC's and meters at the other brands. At December 31, 2016, TSE accounted for approximately 51,000 electric RCEs and 44,000 electric meters.

Meters enrolled in offerings with fixed rate characteristics constituted approximately 32% of GRE's electric load during December, 2016 compared to 15% of GRE's electric load during September, 2016.  The increase resulted from the addition of TSE's electric meters, a significant portion of which have fixed rate characteristics.
GRE's average monthly customer churn increased to 6.7% in 4Q16 compared to 6.3% in the year ago quarter, and increased from 6.4% in 3Q16. For the full year 2016, average monthly churn increased to 6.4% compared to 6.3% in 2015.
As in prior quarters, GRE generated all of the Genie Energy's revenue and gross profit.  
GRE's 4Q16 revenue increased to $51.5 million from $44.6 million in 4Q15 on increased sales of both electricity and natural gas. Electricity revenue increased to $41.0 million in 4Q16 from $37.5 million in 4Q15.  Kilowatt hours sold increased substantially on increases in both average consumption per meter and electricity meters served, more than offsetting a decrease in average revenue per kilowatt hour sold.
Gas sales in 4Q16 increased to $10.1 million from $7.3 million in 4Q15 on higher consumption per meter and increased average revenue per therm sold.
Full year 2016 revenue was $212.1 million, a slight decrease from $213.1 million in 2015 as an increase in electricity revenue was narrowly offset by a decrease in gas revenue.
Electricity revenue increased to $179.5 million in 2016 from $170.3 million in 2015.   Increases in the electric meter base drove an increase in kilowatt hours sold, which more than offset a decrease in average revenue per kilowatt hour sold.
Natural gas revenue decreased to $31.0 million in 2016 from $40.8 million in 2015 as both average revenue per therm sold and therms sold declined. 
GRE's gross margin percentage in 4Q16 was 28.3% compared to 34.8% in 4Q15.  The gross margin on electricity sales declined from 39.3% in 4Q15 to 27.1% in 4Q16.  The average revenue per kilowatt hour sold declined even as the underlying commodity cost increased reflecting intensification of competition in key markets, and an increase in the proportion of customers on plans with fixed rate characteristics.  The gross margin on natural gas sales more than doubled from 15.8% to 31.9% over the same period mostly due to an increase in average revenue per therm. 
For the full year 2016, GRE's gross margin percentage increased to 36.3% from 31.3% in 2015.  The full year gross margin on electricity sales increased to 37.0% from 33.8%, and the gross margin on gas sales jumped to 30.5% from 22.7%.
GRE's gross profit in 4Q16 was $14.6 million compared to $15.5 million in 4Q15.  Gross profit for the full year 2016 increased to $76.9 million from $66.6 million in 2015. 
GRE's SG&A expense decreased to $11.8 million in 4Q16 from $14.6 million in 4Q15 driven by reductions in employee compensation and customer acquisition costs.  Full year 2016 SG&A expense decreased to $50.4 million from $55.6 million in 2015 reflecting a decrease in regulatory and legal expense, reduced employee compensation, and reduced customer acquisition costs. In 2015, SG&A expense included an accrual of $2.7 million for regulatory and legal matters.
GRE's income from operations increased to $2.7 million in 4Q16 from $894 thousand in the year ago quarter reflecting the reduction in SG&A expense that more than offset the decline in gross profit. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $3.1 million in 4Q16 from $1.0 million in 4Q15.  Full year income from operations jumped to $26.5 million in 2016 from $11.1 million in 2015 on increased gross profit and decreased SG&A expense.  Full year 2016 Adjusted EBITDA was $27.3 million compared to $11.8 million the year before.
Genie Retail Energy – New York Regulatory UpdateIn December 2016, the New York State Public Service Commission (NY PSC) issued an order prohibiting retail energy providers from serving customers enrolled in New York's utility low-income assistance programs (low-income customers) throughout New York State.  The December order largely replicated a NY PSC order issued in July of 2016 that was subsequently stayed by a ruling of a New York court on procedural grounds.  The REP industry has filed a legal challenge to the NY PSC's December order. On January 25, 2017, the NY PSC granted an industry request to delay implementation of the order until May 26, 2017 to allow time for judicial review.
The NY PSC has also undertaken a broader examination of the role played by REPs in retail energy markets which may result in additional restrictions on REP operations in New York State.  In July 2016, a New York court struck down key provisions of a NY PSC order barring REPs from serving any customer unless their price was equal to or below the incumbent utility provider's price except where the offering met certain renewable energy requirements.  
Afek 
In April 2013, the Israeli Ministry of Energy and Water awarded Genie Energy's Afek Oil and Gas subsidiary an exclusive, three-year, petroleum exploration license covering 396.5 square kilometers in the southern portion of the Golan Heights in Northern Israel. The license has now been extended through April, 2018.
Afek has completed drilling five exploratory wells in the southern portion of its license area.  Analysis of the results confirms the presence of a consistent and substantial resource of early-stage maturated organics, primarily bitumen and heavy oil. 
Afek is preparing to drill a sixth exploratory well, Ness 10 which will be the first well located north of the Sheikh-Ali Fault.  Reprocessed seismic and other data indicate that the source rock that contained the resource in the southern portion of the license area extends north of the fault, but at significantly greater depths than in the southern portion.  The planned drilling at Ness 10 seeks to confirm the presence of organics at the site and to determine whether the geological conditions necessary to convert early-stage maturated organics to light crude are present.
Also in Israel, Genie Energy's newly formed drilling services subsidiary, Atid Drilling, is proceeding to purchase the rig utilized to drill Afek's exploratory wells. Atid will be conducting the drilling of Ness 10 following the successful completion of a water well for Mei Golan, the water authority cooperative in northern Israel.
G&A expense at Afek in 4Q16 was $277 thousand compared to $214 thousand in 4Q15.  Full year 2016 G&A expense was $1.1 million compared to $811 thousand in 2015.
Exploration expense in 4Q16 was $1.6 million compared to $2.2 million in the year ago quarter reflecting the slower rate of drilling activity.  Full year exploration expense was $6.1 million in 2016 compared to $6.6 million in 2015.
Afek's loss from operations in 4Q16 was $2.0 million compared to a loss from operations of $2.4 million in 4Q15.  The year over year improvement primarily reflected the reduction in exploration expense.  Adjusted EBITDA in 4Q16 was negative $1.9 million compared to Adjusted EBITDA of negative $2.4 million in 4Q15.
The full year 2016 loss from operations of $48.3 million included a $41.0 million write-off of capitalized exploration costs.   The loss from operations in 2015 was $7.5 million.  Adjusted EBITDA in 2016 was negative $7.0 million compared to negative $7.4 million in 2015.
During 4Q16, Afek did not capitalize exploration costs.  In 4Q15, capitalized exploration costs totaled $9.2 million.  For the full year 2016, Afek capitalized $12.9 million in exploration costs compared to $27.0 million in the prior year. 
Genie Oil and Gas (GOGAS) The GOGAS segment is comprised of inactive oil shale projects in Israel's Shfela Basin, Mongolia and Western Colorado's Piceance Basin.  
The GOGAS segment's income from operations in 4Q16 was $217 thousand including the reversal of accrued expenses related to the dissolution of the AMSO, LLC oil shale development project compared to a loss from operations of $635 thousand in 4Q15. Income from operations for the full year 2016 was $438 thousand including a $1.3 million gain on the consolidation of AMSO, LLC in 2Q16.  The loss from operations in 2015 was $3.1 million.
CorporateGenie Energy's consolidated results include corporate overhead.  In 4Q16, corporate G&A expense was $2.3 million including $1.2 million in non-cash compensation.  The comparable results for 4Q15 were $2.1 million and $1.1 million respectively.  For the full year 2016, corporate G&A expense was $9.2 million including $4.4 million in non-cash compensation.  In 2015, corporate G&A expense was $8.9 million including $4.5 million in non-cash compensation.

   In the consolidated statement of operations, Pennsylvania gross receipt tax was previously recorded as a reduction to electricity revenue instead of as cost of revenues. Electricity revenues and cost of revenues were adjusted to correct the classification by reflecting additional revenue and cost of revenues in the consolidated statement of operations in the amounts of $2.9 million and $5.9 million in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures for the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2016 and 2015
In addition to disclosing financial results that are determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP), Genie Energy also disclosed for the full year and fourth quarter of 2016, as well as for comparable periods, Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. 
Genie Energy's measure of Adjusted EBITDA consists of gross profit less selling, general and administrative expense, research and development expense, exploration expense and equity in the net loss of AMSO, LLC, plus depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation (which are included in selling, general and administrative expense). Another way of calculating Adjusted EBITDA is to start with (loss) income from operations, add depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and the write-off of capitalized exploration costs, and deduct the gain from the consolidation of AMSO, LLC.
Management believes that Genie Energy's Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses that may not be indicative of Genie Energy's or the relevant segment's core operating results. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA, among other measures, as a relevant indicator of core operational strengths in its financial and operational decision making. In addition, management uses Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate operating performance in relation to Genie Energy's competitors. Disclosure of this financial measure may be useful to investors in evaluating performance and allows for greater transparency to the underlying supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. In addition, Genie Energy has historically reported Adjusted EBITDA and believes it is commonly used by readers of financial information in assessing performance, therefore the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in financial reporting at this time.
Management refers to Adjusted EBITDA, as well as the GAAP measures gross profit, (loss) income from operations and net (loss) income, on a segment and/or consolidated level to facilitate internal and external comparisons to the segments' and Genie Energy's historical operating results, in making operating decisions, for budget and planning purposes, and to form the basis upon which management is compensated.
Although depreciation and amortization are considered operating costs under GAAP, they primarily represent the non-cash current period allocation of costs associated with long-lived assets acquired or constructed in prior periods. While Genie Energy's oil and gas exploration business may be capital intensive, Genie Energy does not expect to incur significant depreciation or depletion expense for the foreseeable future. Genie Energy's operating results exclusive of depreciation and amortization is therefore a useful indicator of its current performance. 
Stock-based compensation recognized by Genie Energy and other companies may not be comparable because of the various valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of types of awards that are permitted under GAAP. Stock-based compensation is excluded from Genie Energy's calculation of Adjusted EBITDA because management believes this allows investors to make more meaningful comparisons of the operating results of Genie Energy's core business with the results of other companies. However, stock-based compensation will continue to be a significant expense for Genie Energy for the foreseeable future and an important part of employees' compensation that impacts their performance.
The write-off of capitalized exploration costs, which is a component of (loss) income from operations, is also excluded from the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA. The write-off of capitalized exploration costs is primarily dictated by events and circumstances outside the control of management that trigger an impairment analysis. While there may be similar charges in other periods, the nature and magnitude of these charges can fluctuate markedly and do not reflect the performance of Genie Energy's continuing operations.
The gain from the consolidation of AMSO, LLC, which is a component of (loss) income from operations, is excluded from the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA. Genie Energy's equity in the net loss of AMSO, LLC was included in Adjusted EBITDA because it was the result of ongoing operations of AMSO, LLC. The gain from the consolidation of AMSO, LLC was a non-routine result of Total's withdrawal from AMSO, LLC. The gain is not part of Genie Energy's or the relevant segment's core operating results.
Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, gross profit, income (loss) from operations, cash flow from operating activities, net income (loss), basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share or other measures of liquidity and financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, Genie Energy's measurements of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
Following is the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is (loss) income from operations for Genie Energy's reportable segments and net (loss) income for Genie Energy on a consolidated basis.

Reports First Quarter 2016 ResultsMarketwiredMay 4, 2016ReblogShareTweetShareNEWARK, NJ--(Marketwired - May 04, 2016) - Genie Energy Ltd. (GNE) (NYSE:GNEPRA) reported first quarter 2016 revenue of $58.1 million, Adjusted EBITDA* of $8.1 million and net income attributable to common stockholders of $6.1 million -- $0.26 per diluted share. 1Q16 HIGHLIGHTS  Afek Oil and Gas Ltd. ("Afek") applied for and was granted a one year extension of its multi-well oil and gas exploration license in Northern Israel from the Israeli Ministry of Energy and Water through April 9, 2017.   Afek is currently conducting flow tests at the Devorah 1(Ness 2) well. To date, the flow tests in certain intervals have yielded gaseous hydrocarbons and Afek has extracted small amounts of heavy hydrocarbons.  Afek's scientific team, in conjunction with leading international experts, continues to analyze the flow test and other data.   Genie Retail Energy increased its meter base for the fourth consecutive quarter and generated $11.7 million in Adjusted EBITDA on the strength of improved margins and reduced SG&A expense.  The Genie Energy Board of Directors has approved a 1Q16 dividend of $0.06 per share for on its Class A and Class B common stock. The dividend will be paid on or about May 20, 2016 to common stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 16, 2016. The ex-dividend date is May 12, 2016. The distribution will be treated as a return of capital for income tax purposes.  MANAGEMENT COMMENTS Howard Jonas, Genie Energy's Chairman and CEO, said, "Genie Energy had a very strong quarter, both operationally and financially. Our retail energy provider business was firing on all cylinders and achieved the highest level of Adjusted EBITDA since we were spun-off from IDT. Genie Retail Energy increased its meter base for the fourth consecutive quarter and continued to diversify its portfolio of product offerings. Afek is currently conducting well flow tests on a second well to enhance our knowledge of the license area's subsurface geology and lithology. Based on the data gathered to date and our preliminary analysis, we remain optimistic that the target reservoir system contains significant oil and gas resources."

Please refer to the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measure at the end of this release for a complete explanation of Adjusted EBITDA and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.  ** Genie Retail Energy reclassified $0.7 million and $0.6 million previously included in "Financing fees" in the three months ended March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2015, respectively, to "Cost of revenues" to conform to the current year's presentation.  *** Genie Energy's Afek subsidiary accounts for its oil and gas exploration activities under the "successful efforts" method of accounting. Under this method, acquisition costs, costs of drilling exploratory wells, and exploratory-type stratigraphic test wells are capitalized on the balance sheet as "Capitalized exploration costs -- unproved oil and gas property" pending determination of whether the well has found proved reserves. Exploration costs, other than exploration drilling costs, are charged to expense in the statement of operations as "Exploration expense."

Genie Retail Energy  Genie Retail Energy increased its base of meters served for the fourth consecutive quarter. Meters served increased slightly to 393,000 at March 31, 2016. Genie Retail Energy added 65,000 gross meters in 1Q16 compared to 52,000 meters in 1Q15 and 70,000 meters in 4Q15.RCEs increased year over year while declining on a sequential basis to 247,000 at March 31, 2016. The average temperature in the first quarter of this year was significantly higher than the year ago quarter resulting in lower average per meter consumption over the trailing twelve months.                           Meters and RCEs at End of Quarter (in thousands)      March 31,  2016     December 31, 2015     September 30, 2015     June 30,  2015     March 31,  2015      Electricity meters   267   264   261   250   232     Natural gas meters   126   128   127   127   126      Total meters    393   392   388   377   358                               Electricity RCEs   175   178   178   168   158     Natural gas RCEs   72   81   82   83   83      Total RCEs    247   259   260   251   241                          Meters enrolled in offerings with fixed rate characteristics constituted approximately 16% of GRE's electric load at March 31, 2015.Genie Retail Energy's average monthly customer churn increased to 6.4% in 1Q16 from 6.3% in 4Q15 and 5.9% in 1Q15.Genie Retail Energy's quarterly revenue decreased $16.3 million year over year to $58.1 million primarily on reduced gas sales as the winter was considerably warmer than the year ago period. In addition, market rates for both natural gas and electricity decreased significantly.Sales of electricity in 1Q16 decreased to $44.4 million from $47.3 million in 1Q15 driven primarily by a decrease in revenue per kilowatt hour sold partially offset by an increase in kilowatt hours sold reflecting the year over year increase in the meters served.Read MoreSales of natural gas in 1Q16 decreased to $13.4 million from $26.2 million in 1Q15 driven by decreases in both therms sold resulting from the milder winter weather compared to the year ago and a decrease in average revenue per therm sold resulting from market-wide reductions in gas rates.Genie Retail Energy's gross margin in 1Q16 was 42.8% compared to 22.1% in the year ago quarter reflecting substantial reductions in wholesale commodity costs.Genie Retail Energy's SG&A expense in 1Q16 decreased to $13.3 million from $13.7 million in 1Q15 primarily due to a decrease in regulatory and legal costs which was partially offset by higher customer acquisition spending.Genie Retail Energy generated Adjusted EBITDA of $11.7 million in 1Q16 compared to $2.9 million in the year ago quarter. The increase primarily reflects the improved gross profit and gross margin augmented by the reduction in SG&A expense.Genie Retail Energy's income from operations in 1Q16 was $11.5 million, compared to $2.8 million in 1Q15.On February 23, 2016, the New York Public Service Commission (PSC) issued an order enacting new regulations that would impose significant new restrictions on retail energy providers (REPs) operating in New York, including Genie Retail Energy. A group of parties from the REP industry subsequently sought and obtained a temporary restraining order (TRO) to block implementation of the PSC's order pending a definitive judicial review of the industry's challenges. The TRO is in effect until May 20, 2016 and discussions between industry representatives and the PSC are on-going.  Afek  Afek continues to execute on its oil and gas exploration program in Northern Israel. Well flow testing within the second test well -- Devorah 1 (Ness 2) -- is currently underway, with testing completed on three of five planned depth level zones. To date, the flow tests at Devorah 1 have yielded gaseous hydrocarbons and Afek has extracted small amounts of heavy hydrocarbons. The gaseous hydrocarbons at Devorah 1 were sufficiently concentrated to flare. Testing at the first site, Ness 3, provided valuable data that has enhanced the quality of subsequent testing and ongoing exploration activities without yielding hydrocarbons demonstrative of a commercially viable resource.Preliminary results from the analysis conducted to date are consistent with Afek's initial model for the basin and suggest that there may be large resources of gas. Additionally, robust amounts of light liquid hydrocarbons may be concentrated in regional "sweet spots" within a complex, multifaceted reservoir. Afek has engaged leading experts to conduct further analysis and additional exploratory work in order to better understand the resource and its commercial potential.Afek's scientific team, in conjunction with leading international experts, continues to analyze the well test and other data to enhance its model of the reservoir, optimize the well flow tests and determine the next steps in the exploration program. Potential next steps may include flow testing at additional completed wells, undertaking additional seismic work, drilling new exploratory wells or initiating other activities.The exploration program's next steps are intended to enhance the understanding of the geology and resources present in the license area, identify the locations of the "sweet spots" within the basin, suggest potential approaches to production engineering of the identified reservoir and explore other plays within the license area. The ultimate goal of the exploratory program is to prove that the license area contains commercially viable hydrocarbons and support the declaration of a "discovery" under Israel's Petroleum Law.Afek has begun to seek additional financing to support further exploration activities, potentially by accessing the public markets, which could spearhead a process by which Afek would become an independent entity.In 1Q16, Afek's loss from operations was $1.8 million, substantially unchanged from 1Q15.Afek capitalized $8.0 million of drilling costs in 1Q16 compared to $4.3 million in the year ago quarter.  Genie Oil and Gas (GOGAS)   The GOGAS segment is comprised of oil shale projects in Mongolia and Israel's Shfela Basin, as well as Genie Energy's minority stake in a joint venture for in situ development of oil shale in Colorado's Piceance Basin, AMSO, LLC. GOGAS has suspended operations in the Shfela and in Mongolia.In February 2016, Total notified AMSO, LLC that it had discontinued its share of funding of the project. On March 23, 2016, Total gave AMSO its notice of withdrawal from AMSO, LLC. The effective date of the withdrawal was April 30, 2016. GOGAS is currently decommissioning the project.GOGAS's AMSO subsidiary and Total are obligated to fund certain remediation and reclamation costs upon ending operations. AMSO estimates that its share of such costs will be under $2 million.The GOGAS segment's loss from operations in 1Q16 was $469 thousand compared to $904 thousand in 1Q15.  Corporate  Genie Energy's corporate loss from operations in 1Q16 was $2.4 million including stock-based compensation expense of $1.1 million. The loss from operations in 1Q15 was $2.5 million including stock based compensation of $1.1 million.

Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.Genie Energy's measure of Adjusted EBITDA consists of gross profit less selling, general and administrative expense, research and development expense, exploration expense and equity in the net loss of AMSO, LLC, plus depreciation and stock-based compensation (which are included in selling, general and administrative expense). Another way of calculating Adjusted EBITDA is to start with income (loss) from operations and add depreciation and stock-based compensation.Management believes that Genie Energy's Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses that may not be indicative of Genie Energy's or the relevant segment's core operating results. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA, among other measures, as a relevant indicator of core operational strengths in its financial and operational decision making. In addition, management uses Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate operating performance in relation to Genie Energy's competitors. Disclosure of this financial measure may be useful to investors in evaluating performance and allows for greater transparency to the underlying supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. In addition, Genie Energy has historically reported Adjusted EBITDA and believes it is commonly used by readers of financial information in assessing performance, therefore the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in financial reporting at this time.Management refers to Adjusted EBITDA, as well as the GAAP measures gross profit, income (loss) from operations and net income (loss), on a segment and/or consolidated level to facilitate internal and external comparisons to the segments' and Genie Energy's historical operating results, in making operating decisions, for budget and planning purposes, and to form the basis upon which management is compensated.Although depreciation is considered an operating cost under GAAP, it primarily represents the non-cash current period allocation of costs associated with long-lived assets acquired or constructed in prior periods. While Genie Energy's oil and gas exploration business may be capital intensive, Genie Energy does not expect to incur significant depreciation or depletion expense for the foreseeable future. Genie Energy's operating results exclusive of depreciation is therefore a useful indicator of its current performance.Stock-based compensation recognized by Genie Energy and other companies may not be comparable because of the various valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of types of awards that are permitted under GAAP. Stock-based compensation is excluded from Genie Energy's calculation of Adjusted EBITDA because management believes this allows investors to make more meaningful comparisons of the operating results of Genie Energy's core business with the results of other companies. However, stock-based compensation will continue to be a significant expense for Genie Energy for the foreseeable future and an important part of employees' compensation that impacts their performance.Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, gross profit, income (loss) from operations, cash flow from operating activities, net income (loss), basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share or other measures of liquidity and financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, Genie Energy's measurements of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.Following is the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is income (loss) from operations for Genie Energy's reportable segments and net income (loss) for Genie Energy on a consolidated basis.       Genie Energy Ltd.
