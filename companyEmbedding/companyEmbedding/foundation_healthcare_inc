Foundation Consumer Healthcare was created with the goal of building a comprehensive portfolio of over-the-counter health and wellness brands, marketed to all classes of trade. The present Foundation family consists of two proven and established upper respiratory brands, Bronkaid® and Neo-Synephrine®, and is actively seeking to acquire and partner with additional brands.   
Why Foundation?
Industry expertise. Foundation is aligned with Advantage Consumer Healthcare, a trusted advisor to the OTC healthcare marketplace led by a suite of accomplished industry veterans. Our team offers a wide range of core capabilities, and experience growing new and mature brands in both large multi-national and start-up environments.

In so doing, we build upon each brand’s unique history, while also creating a path for a vibrant, healthy future.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Company Overview  Our primary business is the ownership of surgical hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers (ASCs) in targeted regional markets in the Southeastern United States. We currently have three majority-owned hospitals (Consolidated Hospitals) in Texas. We have seven minority-owned ASCs located in Texas, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland and Ohio. In addition to our ownership interests, we provide management services under contract to most of our minority-owned facilities. Finally, we have a legacy business that provides sleep testing management services.  Our strategy is to create a regional network of high-quality, yet cost effective, surgical facilities that meet the needs of patients, physicians and payors. We believe our facilities provide a friendly and convenient environment for our patients to receive high quality care. We operate our facilities, structure our strategic relationships and adopt staffing, scheduling and clinical systems and protocols with the goal of increasing physician productivity and satisfaction. In light of the efficiency of our facilities, we believe we are competitively positioned among payors to generate good clinical outcomes while containing costs. Our commitment to the needs of all relevant parties coupled with the strong growth dynamics of our markets lead us to believe that the number of procedures performed at our facilities each year will increase.  Going Concern and Management's Plan  As of June 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $43.8 million and a working capital deficit of $5.4 million (adjusted for redemption payments of $0.9 million payable to preferred noncontrolling interest holders in October 2016). During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we generated a net loss attributable to Foundation Healthcare common stock of $11.7 million and used $5.3 million in cash flow from operating activities from continuing operations. As of June 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1.1 million and no availability under a $15.5 million line of credit from its senior lender. Given the due dates of certain liability and debt payments and preferred noncontrolling interests redemption requirements, management projects that we may not be able to meet all of our obligations as they become due over the next twelve months. We plan to meet the projected cash flow shortage from the sale of certain assets and projected increase in revenues and decreases in expenses at our hospitals.  If we are unable to sell assets, increase revenue or reduce expenses as described above, we may be forced to obtain extensions on existing debt and other obligations as they become due over the next twelve months. Although we have historically been successful in obtaining extensions, there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain them in the future. In addition, we may choose to raise additional funds through the sale of equity or assets, but there is no assurance that we will be successful in completing such actions.  If we are not able to sell certain assets, generate additional revenue or reduce expenses at our hospitals, do not obtain extensions on some of our debt or other obligations during the next twelve months or if we are not able to raise additional funds through the sale of equity or assets, we may not have sufficient cash on hand or be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in order to meet our cash requirements over the next twelve months. These uncertainties raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern.  Senior Credit Facility Modification and Waiver  We are required to maintain compliance with certain financial covenants imposed by its Senior Lenders. As of June 30, 2016, we were not in compliance with those covenants. On August 19, 2016, the Senior Lenders waived the financial covenant violations and modified the financial covenant requirements for the remainder of 2016 and first quarter of 2017. In addition, the Senior Lenders extended the due date of a required $3 million principal payment on the Revolving Loan to January 15, 2017. There is no assurance that the Senior Lenders will waive any future covenant violations. See Liquidity and Capital Resources - Senior Credit Facility for additional information.  Hospital and ASC Business Overview  At our Consolidated Hospitals, we serve as a majority owner, day-to-day manager, and we have significant influence over the operations of such facilities. When we have control of the facility, we account for our investment in the facility as a consolidated subsidiary. For our Equity Owned facilities, our influence does not represent control of the facility, but we do have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, we account for our investment in the facility under the equity method, and treat the facility as a nonconsolidated affiliate.  For our Consolidated Hospitals, our financial statements reflect 100% of the revenues and expenses for these subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany transactions and accounts. The net income attributable to our physician partners who have ownership in our Consolidated Hospitals is included in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in our consolidated statements of operations.  For our Equity Owned facilities, our share of the net income of each Equity Owned facility is based on the facility's net income and our percentage of ownership in the facility and is included in our consolidated statements as equity in earnings of affiliates. We earn management fees from most of our Equity Owned facilities for our management of the day-to-day operations. We also provide management services to one ASC that we don't own any equity interest.  The following summarizes certain key metrics for our surgical hospital and ASC business:   Number of Number of Percentage Mgmt.

Our facilities are licensed at the state level and are accredited by either the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Healthcare (AAAHC) or the Det Norske Veritas (DNV). The only exception is our ASC in Nacogdoches, Texas which meets the accreditation standards, but the governing board of this ASC has elected to not seek accreditation. We recognize that accreditation is a crucial quality benchmark for payors since many managed care organizations will not contract with a facility until it is accredited. We believe that our historical success in obtaining and retaining accreditation for our facilities reflects our commitment to providing high quality care in our facilities.  Generally, each facility is owned and operated by either a limited partnership or limited liability company in which ownership interests are held by our local physician partners who practice at the facility and by us. Our partnership and limited liability company agreements typically provide for the monthly or quarterly pro rata distribution of cash equal to net profits from operations, less amounts held in reserve for expenses and working capital. These limited partnership or limited liability company agreements generally grant us representation on the facility's governing board and ensure our participation in fundamental decisions. Our influence over the businesses of our facilities is further enhanced by our management agreements with such facilities.  Our surgical hospitals and ASC facilities depend upon third-party reimbursement programs to pay for our services rendered to patients, including governmental Medicare and managed Medicare programs, a broad mix of private insurance programs, and co-pays, deductibles and cash payments from patients. Private payors typically employ reimbursement methodologies similar to those used by government providers. Under Medicare, our facilities are reimbursed for the services rendered through the payment of facility fees which vary depending on the type of facility (hospital, HOPD or ASC), and type of procedure. Hospitals and HOPDs are reimbursed for outpatient procedures in a manner similar to most ASCs except that the methodologies employed to calculate reimbursement rates generally result in rates that are higher than those for comparable procedures at free-standing ASCs. ASCs are reimbursed through the payment of a composite "ASC rate" which is set by us based on a survey of comparative rates, which includes payment for most of the expenses associated with the performance of a procedure such as nursing services, supplies, and staffing costs. Reimbursement rates for inpatient hospital services are determined using Medicare severity diagnosis related groups which are intended to compensate hospitals according to the estimated intensity of hospital resources necessary to furnish care for a particular diagnosed illness.  Our surgical hospital and ASC facilities depend upon third-party reimbursement programs, including governmental and private insurance programs, to pay for the preponderance of the services rendered to patients. Our surgical hospital and ASC facilities derive a portion of their revenues from governmental healthcare programs, primarily Medicare and managed Medicare programs, and the remainder from a wide mix of commercial payors and patient co-pays and deductibles. Private payors typically follow the method in which the government reimburses healthcare providers. Under the government's methodology our surgical hospital and ASC facilities are reimbursed for the performance of services through the payment of facility fees which vary according to whether the facility is a hospital or an ASC and the type of procedure that is performed. Hospitals are reimbursed for outpatient procedures in a manner similar to ASCs except that the methodologies employed to calculate reimbursement generally result in hospitals being reimbursed in this setting at a higher rate than free-standing ASCs. ASCs are reimbursed through the payment of a composite "ASC rate" which includes payment for most of the expenses associated with the performance of a procedure such as nursing services, supplies, and staffing costs. The reimbursement rates for inpatient hospital services are determined using Medicare severity diagnosis related groups which are intended to compensate hospitals according to the estimated intensity of hospital resources necessary to furnish care for a particular diagnosed illness.  Our revenues from the ASC and surgical hospital facilities are derived from  Changes in Consolidated Hospitals and Equity Owned Investments  On June 30, 2016, we sold our 8% interest in Summit Hospital, an Equity Owned Hospital located in Edmond, Oklahoma. We received $2.2 million in proceeds from the sale of Summit.  On May 11, 2016, we acquired 51% of the outstanding membership interests of Ninety Nine Healthcare Management, LLC ("99 Management"). 99 Management is a healthcare management located in Dallas, Texas. We believe the purchase of 99 Management will allow us to provide practice management services for our physician partners. We paid $440,000 in cash and issued 700,000 shares of our common stock for the purchase of the membership interests in 99 Management. We will issue an additional 200,000 shares of our common stock upon the execution by 99 Management of a signed contract between 99 Management and Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Texas for a narrow network program covering the Houston, Texas market  On December 31, 2015, we purchased substantially all of the hospital assets and hospital operating entity of University General Health Systems, Inc., consisting primarily of a sixty-nine bed acute care hospital located in the Medical City area of Houston, Texas ("UGH"). The purchase price of the UGH was $25.1 million, net of liabilities assumed. The UGH hospital is now operated as Foundation Surgical Hospital of Houston and referred to as "FSH Houston."  On July 15, 2015, we sold our 10% interest in the Kirby Glen Surgery, LLC, one of our Equity Owned ASCs located in Houston, Texas. We received $0.2 million in combined proceeds for the sale of the equity interest and termination of our management agreement.  On June 12, 2015, we sold a portion of our 20% equity investment in Grayson County Physician Property, LLC ("GCPP"), our Equity Owned hospital in Sherman, Texas, through a series of transactions. In conjunction with the sale, the management agreement under which we provided certain services including billing and collections, general management services, legal support, and accounting services was terminated. Our decision to sell the assets of GCPP was part of our overall strategic plan to focus on the growth of our majority owned surgical hospital businesses and divest any minority interest holdings. We received $7.8 million in proceeds as a result of the sale and $0.5 million in additional proceeds for the termination our management agreement. We used $7.0 million of these proceeds to reduce our principal balance of the note held by Bank SNB (our senior lender).  On March 31, 2015, Houston Orthopedic Surgical Hospital, L.L.C. ("HOSH"), our Equity Owned hospital in Houston, Texas, sold substantially all of its assets under an asset purchase agreement. Given that we do not exhibit control with our 20% investment in HOSH, we account for our investment on a cost or cash basis. As a result of the HOSH sale, we received a distribution on May 12, 2015 for $1.8 million, of which $0.6 million is being held in escrow until October 2016.  On January 1, 2015, Foundation Surgery Affiliates of Northwest Oklahoma City, LLC, or FSA OKC, our Equity Owned ASC located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma was sold to Summit Medical Center LLC, or Summit Hospital, in exchange for unit ownership in Summit Hospital. As part of the transaction, the units of Summit Hospital were distributed to the individual FSA OKC investors including us. As a result of the transaction, we received an 8% ownership interest in Summit Hospital. In addition, the ASC facility in Oklahoma City is now operated as an HOPD for Summit Hospital. On June 30, 2016, we sold the 8% interest in Summit Hospital for $2.2 million.  Results of Operations The following table sets forth selected results of our operations for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. The following information was derived and taken from our unaudited financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report. For the Three Months For the Six Months Ended June 30, Ended June 30, 2016 2015 2016 2015 Net Revenues: Patient services $ 28,609,556 $ 30,152,597 $ 67,045,799 $ 58,090,495 Provision for doubtful accounts (2,598,924 ) (2,177,522 ) (4,520,909 ) (2,598,546 ) Net patient services revenue 26,010,632 27,975,075 62,524,890 55,491,949 Management fee from affiliates 1,639,679 1,973,754 2,552,712 3,223,076 Other revenue (307,828 ) 1,914,125 901,959 2,690,079 Revenue 27,342,483 31,862,954 65,979,561 61,405,104 Equity in earnings from affiliates 334,388 319,673 723,758 731,072 Operating Expenses: Salaries and benefits 12,424,992 7,915,961 26,167,540 15,655,824 Supplies 9,500,381 7,390,390 17,123,144 13,460,051 Other operating expenses 13,334,836 13,398,977 30,127,633 27,482,454 Depreciation and amortization 2,660,038 1,345,948 5,408,900 2,727,455 Net other (income) expense (1,174,705 ) 311,488 (212,324 ) 620,205 Income (loss) from continuing operations, before taxes (9,068,671 ) 1,819,863 (11,911,574 ) 2,190,187 (Provision) Benefit for income taxes (1,200,000 ) 114,038 - 114,038 Income (loss) from continuing operations, net of taxes (10,268,671 ) 1,933,901 (11,911,574 ) 2,304,225 Discontinued operations, net of tax (4,320 ) 3,857,135 (16,081 ) 3,771,057 Net income (loss) (10,272,991 ) 5,791,036 (11,927,655 ) 6,075,282 Less: Noncontrolling interests (1,271,443 ) 1,074,022 (543,348 ) 2,494,916 Net loss attributable to Foundation Healthcare $ (9,001,548 ) $ 4,717,014 $ (11,384,307 ) $ 3,580,366  Discussion of Three Month Period Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015  Patient services revenue decreased $1.6 million, or 5.3%, during the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared with the second quarter of 2015. The decrease was primarily due to:  ? A decrease in average reimbursement per surgical case at FSH El Paso driven by a reduced case mix of lower revenue surgical cases, primarily spine procedures, which resulted in a decrease of $9.0 million. Revenue per case at FSH El Paso decreased by $4,500 per inpatient case and $3,300 per outpatient case during the second quarter of 2016 compared to average revenue per case in the second quarter of 2015;  ? A change in the billing codes for toxicology tests at our reference lab at FSH El Paso resulted in a reduction in revenue per test of $550 on approximately 5,400 tests resulting in a reduction in toxicology revenue of $3.2 million for the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015; and  ? A decrease in surgical case volume at Foundation Bariatric Hospital of San Antonio, LLC ("FSH San Antonio") resulting in a decrease of $0.7 million.  These decreases were partially offset by the addition of FSH Houston in 2016, which provided $11.3 million in patient service revenue in the second quarter of 2016.  Provision for doubtful accounts increased $0.4 million, or 18.2%, during the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared with the second quarter of 2015. Provision for doubtful accounts as a percent of patient services revenue was 9.1% and 7.2% for the second quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively. The addition of the FSH Houston also resulted in an increase of $2.1 million and there was a $0.1 million increase at FSH San Antonio. The increases were offset by a decrease in provision for doubtful accounts at FSH El Paso of $1.8 million related the lower revenues in the second quarter of 2016.  Management fees from affiliates decreased $0.4 million, or 20.0%, during the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared with the second quarter of 2015. The decrease is due to lower collections at FSH San Antonio and FSH El Paso resulting in $0.8 million and lower collections at the ASC facilities resulting in $0.3 million. This was offset by fees from 99 Mgmt. of $0.7 million in the second quarter of 2016.  Other revenue decreased $2.2 million, or 115.8%, during the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared with the second quarter of 2015. The decrease is due to a $1.0 million Medicare EHR recoupment in the second quarter of 2016 at FSH El Paso, related to a 2013 meaningful use payment and a $1.2 million gain recorded in May 2015 resulting from the sale of our equity interest in Houston Orthopedic Surgical Hospital ("HOSH").  Income from equity investments in affiliates in the second quarter of 2016 approximated the second quarter of 2015.  Salaries and benefits increased $4.5 million, or 57.0%, to $12.4 million from $7.9 million during the three months ended June 30, 2016, compared with the second quarter of 2015. The increase is due to the addition of the FSH Houston resulting in $5.1 million, offset by decreases of $0.2 million, $0.3 million and $0.1 million at FSH San Antonio, FSH El Paso and corporate, respectively, due to lower staff levels.  Supplies expense increased $2.1 million, or 28.4 %, to $9.5 million from $7.4 million during the three months ended June 30 2016, compared with the second quarter of 2015. The increase is due to the addition of the FSH Houston adding in $3.3 million which was offset by a decrease of $0.6 million at both FSH El Paso and FSH San Antonio primarily due to case mix at FSH El Paso and lower volumes at FSH San Antonio.  Other operating expenses decreased $0.1 million, or 0.7%, to $13.3 million from $13.4 million during the three months ended June 30, 2016, compared with the second quarter of 2015. The decrease is due to a $5.9 million reduction in outsource fees related to the toxicology reference laboratory services at FSH El Paso offset by an increase due to the addition of FSH Houston and 99 Mgmt resulting in $4.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively. Additionally, corporate overhead increased by $0.5 million due to legal costs incurred related to the acquisition of FSH Houston and consulting fees related to the review of central billing office procedures at FSH Houston and increases in various operating expenses at FSH San Antonio of $0.2 million.  Depreciation and amortization represents the depreciation expense associated with our fixed assets and the amortization attributable to our intangible assets. Depreciation and amortization increased $1.4 million, or 107.7%, to $2.7 million from $1.3 million during the three months ended June 30, 2016, compared with the second quarter of 2015. The increase is due to the addition of the FSH Houston.  Net other (income) expense represents primarily interest expense on borrowings reduced by interest income earned on cash and the gain or loss on the sale of equity investments in affiliates and gains or losses on certain asset dispositions. During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we had net other income of $1.2 million versus net other expense of $0.3 million during the second quarter of 2015. The increase is due to the gain on the sale of our equity investment in Summit hospital of $2.2 million offset by an increase in interest expense of $0.7 million. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to the addition of FSH Houston.  Discontinued operations represent the equity in earnings of GCCP and the operations of our independent diagnostic testing facilities ("IDTF") which were classified as held for sale in 2013. Our equity investment in GCCP and the related earnings were classified as discontinued in 2015 as the sale of our GCCP interest was part of our strategic shift to focus on majority owned investments. The results from our discontinued operations for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 are summarized below:   2016 2015 Revenues: Equity in earnings of GCCP $ - $ 24,784 Sleep operations - - Total revenues $ - $ 24,784 Net income (loss) before taxes: GCCP $ - $ 24,784 Sleep operations (4,320 ) 15,341 Gain on sale of equity investment in GCCP - 6,331,048 Income tax (provision) benefit - (2,514,038 ) Net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax $ (4,320 ) $ 3,857,135  Noncontrolling interests were allocated $1.3 million of net loss during the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $1.1 million of net income during the second quarter of 2015. Noncontrolling interests are the equity ownership interests, held by outside investors, in our majority owned hospital subsidiaries, FSH El Paso and FSH San Antonio.
