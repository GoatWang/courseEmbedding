        Why Clean Energy Fuels Corp. Shareholders Have Something to Worry About
    


newsfeedback@fool.com (Travis Hoium)

            Jul 27, 2017
        Updated 8 hrs ago





























































































A few years ago, Clean Energy Fuels (NASDAQ: CLNE) was looked upon as the future of the trucking industry. Long-haul trucks were being built to run on natural gas, with the help of Westport Innovations' (NASDAQ: WPRT) technology, and it made financial sense for both long- and short-haul trucks and local buses to make the switch. As the fueling station infrastructure expanded, it would get progressively easier for vehicle operators to go with natural gas fuel, and the industry was anticipated to experience explosive growth. But that's not exactly what's happened. Natural gas as a vehicle fuel has hit a wall in the marketplace, and batteries are now becoming a viable power option for environmentally focused customers that Clean Energy Fuels might once have expected to land. Here's why the future may look even darker for the company and its fuel source. Image source: Getty Images.
Electric is taking a big step forwardIt's logical for bus and truck owners to consider natural gas when you compare it to their traditional diesel options. But in 2017, electric drivetrains are making a play for this market, and their business case could prove devastating to Clean Energy Fuels. Proterra is the most advanced competitor, already producing electric buses with ranges of up to 350 miles per charge. As the company lowers costs and proves its vehicles' lower overall cost structure, cities will recognize that it makes financial sense to buy electric rather than natural gas buses. Image source: Fuso.Local trucking offers a similar dynamic. Daimler has developed the Fuso eCanter e-Cell, which is expected to debut in 2019. The truck only gets 62 miles per charge, but with its short recharge time of under an hour, it's a solid choice for certain types of local needs. Long-haul trucking is really where Clean Energy Fuels and its natural gas offerings should have an advantage over batteries. But again, that advantage may be evaporating. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has discussed building an electric semi truck, and Toyota (NYSE: TM) and Nikola Motor Company are building hydrogen-fuel-cell semis. Since semi trucks spend far more hours at a stretch on the road than smaller trucks, charging times become an issue. But hydrogen fuel cells may be the answer: An electric drivetrain could be powered by rapidly dispensable hydrogen. Up and down the truck market, electric drivetrains seem to be gaining momentum. And if battery costs continue to come down, they'll only grow more compelling for owners. Energy drawn from the electric grid costs a fraction of what customers pay for diesel or natural gas, so as long as the upfront costs of electric or hydrogen-fueled trucks are competitive, they could kill the natural gas truck market. A rough position long term
You can see below that Clean Energy Fuels has cleaned up some of the debt that was dragging on it a few years ago, but revenue has stagnated, and it has been losing money for most of the last five years. Without a gain of $70.6 million from a sale of assets in the first quarter of 2017, the profit that appears below wouldn't even exist. CLNE Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts
As competing technologies improve, it will get harder to increase the market share for natural gas vehicles. And without a profitable foundation to rely on, Clean Energy Fuels may be in trouble.

        Why Clean Energy Fuels Corp. Shareholders Have Something to Worry About
    


newsfeedback@fool.com (Travis Hoium)

            Jul 27, 2017
        Updated 8 hrs ago





























































































A few years ago, Clean Energy Fuels (NASDAQ: CLNE) was looked upon as the future of the trucking industry. Long-haul trucks were being built to run on natural gas, with the help of Westport Innovations' (NASDAQ: WPRT) technology, and it made financial sense for both long- and short-haul trucks and local buses to make the switch. As the fueling station infrastructure expanded, it would get progressively easier for vehicle operators to go with natural gas fuel, and the industry was anticipated to experience explosive growth. But that's not exactly what's happened. Natural gas as a vehicle fuel has hit a wall in the marketplace, and batteries are now becoming a viable power option for environmentally focused customers that Clean Energy Fuels might once have expected to land. Here's why the future may look even darker for the company and its fuel source. Image source: Getty Images.
Electric is taking a big step forwardIt's logical for bus and truck owners to consider natural gas when you compare it to their traditional diesel options. But in 2017, electric drivetrains are making a play for this market, and their business case could prove devastating to Clean Energy Fuels. Proterra is the most advanced competitor, already producing electric buses with ranges of up to 350 miles per charge. As the company lowers costs and proves its vehicles' lower overall cost structure, cities will recognize that it makes financial sense to buy electric rather than natural gas buses. Image source: Fuso.Local trucking offers a similar dynamic. Daimler has developed the Fuso eCanter e-Cell, which is expected to debut in 2019. The truck only gets 62 miles per charge, but with its short recharge time of under an hour, it's a solid choice for certain types of local needs. Long-haul trucking is really where Clean Energy Fuels and its natural gas offerings should have an advantage over batteries. But again, that advantage may be evaporating. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has discussed building an electric semi truck, and Toyota (NYSE: TM) and Nikola Motor Company are building hydrogen-fuel-cell semis. Since semi trucks spend far more hours at a stretch on the road than smaller trucks, charging times become an issue. But hydrogen fuel cells may be the answer: An electric drivetrain could be powered by rapidly dispensable hydrogen. Up and down the truck market, electric drivetrains seem to be gaining momentum. And if battery costs continue to come down, they'll only grow more compelling for owners. Energy drawn from the electric grid costs a fraction of what customers pay for diesel or natural gas, so as long as the upfront costs of electric or hydrogen-fueled trucks are competitive, they could kill the natural gas truck market. A rough position long term
You can see below that Clean Energy Fuels has cleaned up some of the debt that was dragging on it a few years ago, but revenue has stagnated, and it has been losing money for most of the last five years. Without a gain of $70.6 million from a sale of assets in the first quarter of 2017, the profit that appears below wouldn't even exist. CLNE Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts
As competing technologies improve, it will get harder to increase the market share for natural gas vehicles. And without a profitable foundation to rely on, Clean Energy Fuels may be in trouble. Natural gas fuel just isn't a great source of clean transportation energy we thought it would be just a few years ago. 10 stocks we like better than Clean Energy FuelsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

CLNE: Insiders vs. Shorts
The most recent short interest data was recently released for the 04/28/2017 settlement date, and Clean Energy Fuels Corp is one of the most shorted stocks of the Russell 3000, based on 8.47 "days to cover" versus the median component at 4.80. There are a number of ways to look at short data, but one metric that we find particularly useful is the "days to cover" because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded.

Top Buys By Top Brass: CEO And President Littlefair's $199K Bet On CLNE
A company's own top management tend to have the best inside view into the business, so when company officers make major buys, investors are wise to take notice. Presumably the only reason an insider would take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock of their company in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both.

How Risky Is Clean Energy Fuels Corp.?
The stock looks like a relative bargain, but a closer look is warranted.











                Maxx Chatsko
            

                (TMFBlacknGold)



            
            Jan 27, 2017 at 11:13AM
            
            





Shares of natural gas transportation fuels leader Clean Energy Fuels (NASDAQ:CLNE) have lost 42% of their value since September 2016. In fact, the stock is threatening its 52-week -- and all-time -- low of just $2.15 per share. Then again, you're always told to buy low. Investors wondering if now is a good time to buy should answer another question first: How risky is Clean Energy Fuels?

By the numbers
The company has several attractive attributes. Sales volumes have grown like clockwork in recent years. In the first nine months of last year, Clean Energy Fuels sold 245 million gasoline gallon equivalents, or GGE, compared to 230 million GGE in the year-ago period. That's a remarkable change from 2013, when only 214 million GGE were sold for the entire year. The market potential is large and the market is largely untapped -- something the company has been able to exploit. 
Despite increasing volumes of product sold, depressed selling prices have taken a toll on revenue. Full-year revenue slipped in 2015 compared to the prior year. And although 2016 revenue will likely be higher than the previous year, it will be unlikely to match the watermark set in 2014.
But management is banking on a turnaround. It slashed capital expenditures last year to help boost the bottom line to a net loss of just $0.07 per share through the first nine months, much improved from a net loss of $0.92 per share in the year-ago period. It also cleaned up the balance sheet by retiring debt with proceeds from a share offering. Dilution, perhaps more so than market conditions, has played a major role in the stock's dismal performance in the last several years.

CLNE data by YCharts.





The recently sliding stock price means Clean Energy Fuels is historically cheap on the basis of price-to-book value. Investors could rarely pick up shares without paying a premium for growth, but can now enjoy a 17% discount to shareholders' equity.

CLNE Price to Book Value data by YCharts.
Of course, heavy dilution and years of sacrificing profits for growth can erode Mr. Market's faith in a stock. So how does Clean Energy Fuels compare to publicly traded peers? Admittedly, there aren't many direct comparisons, but we can stack the company up against other alternative fuel stocks that have had a similarly rough going since commodity prices tanked in late 2014.

All three companies trade below book value, with Clean Energy Fuels presenting a decent bargain. This hints that investors could see upside from current prices, barring a sudden decrease in assets or increase in debt. However, investors need to consider that money-burning operations mean the company's cash could disappear in several quarters -- dragging down the total asset balance. The only way for the company to get its hands on more cash is through a debt or share offering, which has gotten investors into the current mess.
Clean Energy Fuels is also the most expensive company of the three based on price-to-sales ratio, although that shouldn't be too surprising given that it has grown revenue the fastest and growth usually comes at a premium. Plus, the other two stocks boast an unusually low ratio. Beta, or the measure of a stock's volatility relative to the overall market, is also the highest for the natural gas transportation fuels leader, but only slightly.
Overall, these metrics provide a murky view of Clean Energy Fuels' risk level moving forward. What's telling is that both Renewable Energy Group and Pacific Ethanol have handily beaten the stock market in the past year and should be profitable in 2017, while our stock in question has lagged the market and isn't expected to post profits this year. That, in the end, could say enough about where the stock is headed.

CLNE data by YCharts.





What does it mean for investors?
While traditional valuation metrics are important, investors also need to keep their eyes on developments in the real world that ultimately influence a stock. For instance, the recent increase in natural gas prices could result in an increase in Clean Energy Fuels' input costs. If the increase in costs isn't offset by an increase in selling prices, then the company could see margins shrink and losses widen. That could lead to a further deterioration of the share price and jeopardize an already fragile balance sheet.
Market unknowns, coupled with mediocre financial metrics -- book value is the only positive -- make the stock appear to be relatively risky, and certainly too risky for me.

					Full Description



Clean Energy Fuels Corp. (Clean Energy), incorporated on April 17, 2001, is a provider of natural gas as an alternative fuel for vehicle fleets in the United States and Canada. The Company is engaged in supplying compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied natural gas (LNG) and renewable natural gas (RNG) for light, medium and heavy-duty vehicles, and providing operation and maintenance (O&M) services for natural gas fueling stations.The Company designs, builds, operates and maintains fueling stations; manufactures, sells and services non-lubricated natural gas fueling compressors and other equipment used in CNG stations and LNG stations; offers assessment, design and modification solutions to provide operators with code-compliant service and maintenance facilities for natural gas vehicle fleets; transports and sells CNG and LNG to industrial and institutional energy users having no direct access to natural gas pipelines; processes and sells RNG; sells tradable credits generated by selling natural gas and RNG as a vehicle fuel, including credits under the California and the Oregon Low Carbon Fuel Standards (collectively, LCFS Credits) and Renewable Identification Numbers (RIN Credits or RINs) under the federal Renewable Fuel Standard Phase 2; helps its customers acquire and finance natural gas vehicles, and obtains federal, state and local credits, grants and incentives. It caters to various markets, including heavy-duty trucking, airports, refuse, public transit, government fleets, and industrial and institutional energy users.CNG SalesThe Company sells CNG for use as a vehicle fuel through fueling stations located on its customers' properties and through its network of public access fueling stations. Its CNG vehicle fuel sales are made primarily through contracts with its customers. The Company delivers CNG by obtaining natural gas from local utilities or third-party marketers and then compressing, storing and dispensing it into its customers' vehicles. As of December 31, 2016, its subsidiary, NG Advantage, LLC (NG Advantage), used a fleet of 70 high-capacity tube trailers to deliver CNG to institutions and industrial energy users, such as hospitals, food processors, manufacturers and paper mills that do not have direct access to natural gas pipelines.LNG Production and SalesThe Company obtains LNG from its own liquefaction plants and from third party suppliers. It owns and operates LNG liquefaction plants near Houston, Texas and Boron, California, which it calls the Pickens Plant and the Boron Plant, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, the Pickens Plant had a capacity to produce 35 million gallons of LNG per year and included tanker trailer loading system and a one million gallon storage tank with a capacity to hold up to 840,000 usable gallons. As of December 31, 2016, the Boron Plant had a capacity to produce 60 million gallons of LNG per year and dual tanker trailer loading system and a 1.8 million gallon storage tank with a capacity to hold up to 1.5 million usable gallons. It sells LNG on a bulk basis to fleet customers owning and operating their fueling stations, and through its network of public access fueling stations. The Company also sells LNG for non-vehicle purposes, including to customers using LNG in oil fields, and for industrial, utility, marine and rail applications. As of December 31, 2016, it delivered through its fleet of 84 tanker trailers to fueling stations, where it is stored and dispensed in liquid form into vehicles.O&M ServicesThe Company performs O&M services for CNG and LNG fueling stations that are not owned by it. For these services, it generally charges a fixed or a per-gallon fee based on the volume of fuel dispensed at the station.Station Construction and EngineeringThe Company designs and constructs fueling stations and facility modifications, and sells or leases some of these stations to its customers. The Company uses a combination of custom designed and off-the-shelf equipment to build fueling stations. It also offers assessment, design and modification solutions to provide operators with ode-compliant service and maintenance facilities for natural gas vehicle fleets. Its NGV Easy Bay product is a natural gas vapor leak barrier developed specifically for natural gas vehicle facilities. Many of its fueling stations have separate public access areas for retail customers, which generally have the look, feel and dispensing rates of traditional gasoline and diesel fueling stations.RNG Production and SalesThe Company obtains RNG through its own production plants, as well as through third-party producers. The Company's subsidiary Clean Energy Renewables, owns RNG production facilities located at Republic Services landfills in Canton, Michigan, and North Shelby, Tennessee. It sells some of the RNG it produces through its natural gas fueling infrastructure for use as a vehicle fuel. It also purchases RNG from third party producers and sells that RNG for vehicle fuel use through its fueling infrastructure. The RNG it sells for vehicle fuel is distributed under the name, Redeem.Sales of RINs and LCFS CreditsThe Company generates LCFS Credits when it sells RNG, and conventional natural gas for use as a vehicle fuel in California and Oregon, and it generates RINs when it sells RNG for use as a vehicle fuel in the United States.

Our story




Gu-ru / ‘goroō /
Noun:
1. A mentor, a teacher, one who helps you move forward.
2. A source of inspiration and good energy.


GURU
A Story of Organic Growth
Ever since the early days, GURU has always been driven by this idea of crafting the best natural energy drink out there. Founded in Montreal during the summer of 1999 by four college friends, the company marketed the world's first all-natural energy drink.
More than 15 years later, this vision is not only fulfilled but is also thriving and expanding worldwide. GURU has become the #1 Organic Energy Drink in Canada and the US in the Health Channel thanks to a strong network of distribution partnerships and a passionate sales team. 
With research & development at the forefront of our expansion, GURU now tackles a new market and adventure with the recent introduction of our Energy Waters. This new line of product arrives just in time to satisfy a growing demand for organic sugar and calorie-free energy beverages.
In short, GURU has and will always believe that energy should not come at the expense of health. That is what has brought our company a steady and organic growth.
Our Philosophy
Through its corporate philosophy and its beverages, GURU gives good energy for people to make great things, reminding that, with the right dose of will, inspiration and energy, achieving great results is within everyone's reach. 
People today define themselves less by what they have and more by what they do and contribute to the world. Resourcefulness, imagination, inventiveness is today’s new currency. Whether using technology, natural ingredients or just plain common sense, people who Make it Good are the ones who seek to make everything better. We call them Makers.
They are pioneers that never settle. Makers, not followers. Crafters not manufacturers. Some may call them obsessed, exceptional or extraordinary people. But these are men and women who are true innovators, thought leaders and doers in their respective communities. They make the impossible possible.

Reviews




 


Amanda B.
California





has a slight citrus taste, gave me the boost i needed without the crash.  much rather drink this than red bull, rockstar or monster as this is organic!  found my new favorite energy drink pre-workout or just when i'm dragging on certain days.  also it doesn't have a ton of calories, big plus! 
Would you purchase again? -  Yes!

I like the taste ! but bI don't drink energy drunk too often. That's why I'm not going to purchase the product.  But I do recommend people to try and  then they can decide for themselves.
Would you purchase again? -  No

This product was tasting and refreshing. It helped provide energy. I'm not sure of the importance of it being vegan for an energy drink though.
Would you purchase again? -  Yes!

The good things I like about this energy drink is very low in calorie and it is organic which I really love because I don't really see any energy drink that is organic. 
Would you purchase again? -  Yes!

Unfortunately I did not receive the coupon for this in the mail. However, I did try it when I saw it at Sprouts. I liked the flavor but I am not so sure if it helped with my levels of energy.

jeremy G.
California





I don't usually drink energy drinks, but this one is an exception to the rule. It's organic, low calorie, non-GMO and contains ingredients that I can actually trust.  I did not experience a crash afterwards. I read that this has to do with the fact that they use naturally-occurring caffeine from Green Tea and Guarana. I don't know why you would drink any other energy drink than this. Definitely loading up on these again soon! Great price not expensive at all!
Would you purchase again? -  Yes!

Erob J.

Great Taste and quite a Boost. Perfect for tired driving or late night Study! Have quite a few friends that love GURU also and it's Organic.
Would you purchase again? -  Yes!
original review



  


Tiffany M.
California





Definitely better tasting than something like Red Bull---and just as importantly, better smelling.  I can't be the only person who gags at the smell of Red Bull....  In contrast, this stuff is much more palatable, less artificially sweet, and doesn't leave that horrendous aftertaste coating your tongue.    It's harder to find than Red Bull, so when you see it, stock up.
Would you purchase again? -  Yes!

I liked the taste and the fact there was no after taste. Seems like a healthier alternative to the rock star drinks I usually drink. The ingredients make it for a less guilty feeling when drinking an energy drink.

Delicious with minimal to no crash! I did not feel jittery like I did with other energy drinks! Will definitely purchase again, especially for the 3PM slow...

I thought the taste was wonderful. It is nice to see an organic energy drink that burst of flavor.  And is lightly carbonated this is definitely a great drink when you need that extra pep.

original review



  


Talia H.

The energy drink is great to drink in the morning to get rid of the grogginess after a late night. I doesn't bring you up as high as caffeine, but it settles in with your current mood as a stabilizer.
Would you purchase again? -  Yes!

CHARLES B.

Having only tried this once in my life, i was shocked at how well it tasted! It didn't feel super heavy with sugars and carbs like alot of energy drinks can feel like after consuming. I let my coworker try some, he said he really enjoyed how well it tasted. I would probably purchase in the future.
Would you purchase again? -  Yes!

Purchased at Vons. Metallic taste and didn't notice an energy boost at all. A bit overpriced and more of a niche product, than a nutritional function type beverage.

Great taste! I love organic energy drinks. 
Very low calories and vegan. Also gluten free so whoever needs the gluten free energy drinks, it's here.

original review






Deborah R.
California





I don't drink energy drinks often, mostly because they don't typically taste great and I drink coffee already. However, I was impressed with Guru. I couldn't put my finger on the flavor at first, but reading the ingredients it was the green tea that leaves a mild aftertaste, kind of like matcha. The nose is citrusy and refreshing. That said, although I stayed perky after drinking it; I would say it's safe for people who only drink caffeine moderately to drink it too, and if you're dead tired it might not make much of a difference. It only has caffeine from the tea, so not at all the "crack" type of artificial energy drink like a Monster or Red Bull, which I think taste gross and are horrible for you!
Would you purchase again? -  Yes!

It had a taste like nothing I've tasted before. For being organic, and I'm not a big health nut or would remotely grab anything off a shelf that said organic on it, but it wasn't half bad. I'd purchase again if I needed a pick me upper and health drink in one:0

Honestly, I much rather drink this organic energy drink rather then regular energy drinks any day! However, I do not normally drink energy drinks. I prefer to drink my regular vitamins and eat healthy food to get my source of energy for  my days. The taste was okay, I do recommend for those who like to drink their source of energy.

LeShaunese F.

I was great tasting. I went and purchased myself because I never recieved any thing from social nature for this product. But I did enjoy the product. It gave me a good push of energy.
Would you purchase again? -  Yes!
original review






Brotin D.
California





I was extremely pleased with the taste of this drink. There was no bitterness unlike other artificially sweet drinks. The plus point of this drink is that its organic, low calorie and contains ingredients that are not harmful to the body. The caffeine in this drink is derived from natural sources like green tea. So I can have as many drinks I desire without feeling guilty. I tried the Lite version of the drink. The only negative point for this product is the price. Costing around $2 per can is quite expensive!
Would you purchase again? -  Yes!

When it comes to energy drinks, I always prefer to have a more natural drink. With the chemicals and fake flavor of many competitors, this is definitely a healthy alternative to give you that boost you need in your day.  This drink did not give my an amped up feeling or jitters, which I always appreciate. It honestly is a drink I would purchase again. I hope this can pops up on more stores' shelves.

This was actually the first energy drink I ever tried! I was a little skeptical at first but I thought it was delicious! It was a lovely soda, lots of carbonation, no aftertaste (kind of like a citrus apple cider with tea) but there was a little too much sugar. I pay attention to carb intake as I am Type 1 Diabetic and there was quite a bit of sugar...too much for my taste. I don't even think it needed it but it was still yummy!

I'm not big on mainstream energy drinks, so I'm happy that there's a more natural organic variation. I probably won't drink a ton of them, but I would probably try to convert people from drinking big brand energy drinks to drinking GURU. I was happy to find the product provided being sold at Sprouts.

I really enjoyed drinking this energy drink, i love how it has only 10 calories! Everyone should try this organic, vegan and non-gmo drink. Why isn't this the new thing ? Gatorade should not be the energy drink people chose.  I loved how it boosted me up when I'm trying to get things done without having to worry about the down fall.

I was a bit hesitant to try an energy drink as I'd heard some of them make people jittery or make their heart race as side effects. But I decided to give this one a try.

I was pleasantly surprised with the overall energy factor of this drink. It tastes much like that of Redbull, but without the tendency of giving you a throbbing headache. I was quite thrilled with the amount of energy I obtained from a single 8.4 fl oz serving. It does taste much like most traditional energy drinks, a bit canny and tin-like but the energy you get is well worth the metallic taste. I can actually see myself purchasing this on a regular basis. 5/5 stars for sure!

As someone who is always on the run, I like having a large variety of different energy drinks to fuel my day as a substitute for coffee. I tried the GURU organic energy drink out and liked that it didn't taste like the typical energy beverage with the taurine flavor that is so prevalent. Generally if you're putting caffeine into your body, you'd like it to be as unadulterated as possible. I like that the ingredients used in the drink are organic, gluten-free, and NON=GMO verified.

I'm not much an engery drinks kind of person but when I do need a lift of engery I like to drink something that is not super high in sugar or have a list of ingredients I can barely pronounce. Guru engery drinks did the job for when I needed an extra boost. As far as taste go I find it similar to the other drinks I had before. If one is in need of an extra boost of energy and prefer something that is organic Guru is the way to.

The first thing I did when I bought this product was read the ingredients. To my surprise I could read all the ingredients and there was no caffeine. I wake up at 5 o'clock in the morning everyday for work. I'm usually a little tired. About two hours into the workday, this particular work day,  the first thing I did was drink the guru light. I did not feel tired all day and did not feel overly energized.  Plainly said, I felt normal and this was good for me.  That means the drink did what it was supposed to do.  I don't think I'D  drink it everyday but I will definitely keep a few spares around for days when I play hockey until midnight and have to work at 5 in the morning or days where I'm working all day and I need that extra push to get me through. #trynatural

I would definitely buy this and recommend to a friend.

I was somewhat skeptical about this product, being a consumer of the energy drink that gives you "wings".  But I was very surprised when I took that first sip.  Yummy!  And unlike that shaky, jittery feeling I get from that other product I just felt alert. I tried the original GURU, and I loved the taste and I will definitely be buying GURU in the future!  Yummy!  #trynatural

Wow, this is definitely one of the best tasting energy drinks out on the market.  It has a really nice, sweet flavor to it, and has zero aftertaste.  You can definitely taste the white grape juice, but it's not overpowering   I definitely felt it starting to work immediately, which I also enjoy with energy drinks, as I like to sip them over the course of my afternoon.  I would definitely buy this one again as it was in the same price point as my other usual energy drinks.  I would also recommend it to a friend if they wanted a sweet, pick-me-up to keep them going,

I usually don't use energy drinks because of the flavor but I tried the Guru Organic energy drink and thought it was a step above the usual Red Bull or Monster drinks.  Upon reading the list of ingredients, I was pleased to see that they were all natural.  I was surprised to see echinacea listed as an ingredient, which I felt was a nice alternative to unpleasant tasting vitamin supplements.  My store did not carry the sugar free variety, so I had to settle for the 30 grams of sugar that came with the regular version.  It was very sweet, but the actual taste was good and I liked the level of carbonation.  I didn't get the jitters nor did I have the "crash and burn" that I would have expected with this type of drink.  I did not drink it all at once, but rather had it throughout the second half of the day, which is usually when I start feeling tired.  If I can find the sugar free version, I will definitely try it.  I do have to limit my caffeine intake, but for those occasions when I absolutely must have an extra boost, a cold sparkly Guru sounds like a great alternative to an iced coffee or tea.

I don't usually drink energy drinks because of all the artificial ingredients but I liked Guru because it's organic, low calorie, non-GMO and contains healthy  ingredients like Guarana and Green Tea.

Guru Energy Drink is one of a kind. This drink smells great. The taste is a little on the bitter side. This is my personal opinion. It does have echinacea flower extract, in which I do like. I feel an organic energy and no jitters at all. I like this drink. It is an acquired taste though.

I bought the Original version -  because I had read reviews on Amazon saying that it was better-flavored.  It had a nice fruity-citrusy taste, and wasn't overly sweet.  Since I usually buy low or no-calorie energy drinks I am used to a different flavor profile.  I got a nice "kick" from this drink, and it helped keep me stay alert during a long-distance drive.  I also appreciate the organic ingredients, since a lot of energy drinks are full of all sorts of "junk".  Will definitely buy this again!

I opted for the original as opposed to the lite. I've had several other brands of energy drinks in the past, and Guru definitely has a cleaner slightly refreshing taste. I like that guru is made with organic cane sugar, which surprised me as other drinks I've had can leave a artificial taste. The drink also contains sparkling water, organic white grape juice, and organic green tea leaf extract which is a great naturally occurring caffeine. Guru organic energy drink definitely holds its own when it comes to energy drinks and I would definitely purchase again.

I opened it and was pleasantly surprised that it was carbonated. The taste was not overly sweet... it was JUST right. I am not a fan of things that are TOO sweet.  The flavor was slightly fruity, like a mild version of a candy, again, not too sweet.  After about 10 minutes I started feeling more awake and alert. I love that it didn't get me pumped or jittery. It gave me the perfect amount of energy for it to feel natural. I would absolutely​ purchase this again. I never liked energy drinks, but GURU changed my mind.

I am not a fan of RedBull or coffee, but i like caffeine in other forms, so i decided to try Guru. I was pleasantly surprised, because it has wonderful taste. It is not as overwhelming as RedBull, it is more natural, fruity and refreshing. And the energy in it brought some muracles - on lazy and rainy Sunday afternoon, i did not have much hope to achieve anything, but... with Guru, i completed tasks and chores i was procrastinating about for weeks. The only thing to be aware of: if you live in Bay Area, this drink will cost you hefty tax. I was surprised it has the tax penalty for soft sugary drinks!

I personally am a connoisseur of energy drinks. I rely on caffeine for most of my projects at school and for late night coding sessions as well as marathon gaming. Although energy drinks can be considered a crutch, it's a lifestyle decision that many, many people embrace rather than attempt to avoid... I am one of these people.

That said, Guru Energy is fairly cheap ($1.25USD/can) if you buy it here off Amazon, it comes in the Redbull standard 8.3 fl/oz cans, and is shipped in a surprisingly lightweight and compact case (compare this to Monster, Rockstar, or any other brand with standard 16 fl/oz cans).

The taste, like Guru's website describes, is very indescribable. It is very sharp and light with a medium amount of carbonation. The caffeine buzz is more "natural"... it has more of an upslope and downslope rather than a sudden cracked out (which is arguably awesome too in its own respect) then big crash sort of feeling. This is because the caffeine in Guru is derived from 125mg of Guaranine (Guarana Herb) rather than synthetically separated then added. There is no mention about how much of the 125mg of Guaranine is real caffeine, but since Red Bull checks in at 80mg / 8.3oz it seems that Guru is in pretty good shape.

I think a particular good feature of Guru is that it uses cane sugar rather than high fructose corn syrup. I appreciate a good quality soda, particularly microbrew colas, and they often exclusively contain cane sugar.

So in summary, this energy drink is fairly cheap, good buzz, all natural, and great for coding, gaming, or studying.

The biggest question is DOES IT WORK?? 
The answer to your question is, YES! I was busy all day long and had the best energy I've had in awhile. It feels a lot better than using Redbull.. I'm very sensitive to caffeine so drinking it gives me a lot of energy I have no question about that. But this energy felt like I've slept the whole night without waking up and best bed ever. So pretty much I felt really good!! 
The taste isn't the best but it not a lot you drink so if you hate it a lot then just chug it. It's a little herbaly but not bad. Just different.

Coming from someone who at one point drank a decent amount of Monster Energy drinks, I can say that the GURU Organic Energy drink definitely makes me feel better after consumption. You still get a decent kick of caffeine, but there is less crap (i.e. less gnarly, processed ingredients) in it. I don't consume energy drinks often anymore, but I'd grab one of these if they are available the next time I want one.

I really enjoyed this energy drink. It kept me alert but not at all jittery. So many energy drinks leave me shaky and jittery but this one did not. A BIG bonus for me is that t does not have gross or unpronounceable ingredients in it- it is organic and naturally sweetened with only 10 calories. (This is the lite version- my store did not carry the original) It has a pleasant taste- not great but not bad.

I really enjoyed the Organic Energy Drink by Guru. It was reminiscent of a Slurpee with a slight aftertaste of cough syrup. But the cough syrup taste was not overwhelming. It gave me energy like a normal energy drink would. It is a good-sized drink and has a total of 143 milligrams of caffeine which is only 20 milligrams less than the Monsters that I usually drink. I definitely recommend this and will be buying more.

After popping open the can, I had whiffs of the Red Bull scent. So I was quite surprised after tasting it. Not only did it not taste like Red Bull, it had a fruity flavor, which is a plus! I liked how it was carbonated and that all the ingredients were organic and natural. I tried the regular flavor which was a bit too sweet for me so the Lite may have been a better choice; nonetheless, the original was still pretty good. I do not know if I would recommend it since the sugar (30g) is quite high for one serving, but over other energy drinks, I would. It is probably the best tasting energy drink I have tried so far.

I drink a lot of coffee and a lot of energy drinks. This was was pretty good. It wasn't my favorite, but I enjoyed it. The flavor reminded me if two things. At first, it sort of reminded me of Coca-Cola. Then, the second half sort of reminded me of a 7-11 slurpee. Despite those connotations, it did not taste thick and sugary. It was pretty light and I felt great after drinking it.

Excellent taste and a good source of energy. If you don't care much about sugar content then don't get the lite because the normal one is pretty good too! The can packs a decent punch and the organic components of the product make me feel like I'm not wiring myself up on some synthetic creation that tastes like plastic. The product isn't priced the most competitively but maybe that is because I purchased it at bristol farms, I wouldn't be surprised if whole foods had it for a bit less. I enjoyed my Guru chilled but I totally see how it could be fine on the go at room temperature. Overall I'm happy with my guru experience.

I drink energy drinks often. I drink coffee daily.  With that being said,  guru is pretty good.  I didn't get the jitters like i usually do when trying a new drink for the first time,  so that was a definite plus.  It provided a nice energy boost.  The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the taste. I made the mistake of getting the Lite, so it's my fault but it taste 2 just like anything else that's considered "light", like it's missing an ingredient or mage with fake sugar.  Overall I was satisfied.

I don't usually buy traditional energy drinks because I prefer clean ingredients. This Guru energy drink is very clean (it's organic, too!), and has very low calories. I actually liked the taste a lot better than I thought I would but you can definitely taste the stevia. It's a little bitter but the lemon juice and added sugar help to balance that out. I did not notice a huge lift in energy but it did perk me up at work. I'd probably purchase this in the future to drink after lunch/early afternoon at work.

I really enjoyed the sustained, healthy energy this drink provided. Other energy drinks contain scary amounts of caffeine and vitamin B (like it could give you irregular heart rhythms scary) which causes an energy crash, This one takes a more natural approach. The result is a productive pep that does not make you feel (or seem) like you're on crack and it doesn't cause a sudden drop in energy either. The energizing ingredients are green tea extract, guarana seed, and ginseng. There is also echinacea which is great for the immune system. At first I found the stevia to be overwhelming, but the berry flavor presumably from the luo han guo fruit kept me sipping. I have a suspicion I would like the non-lite version a bit more, but this drink is great for those who are used to the powerful sweetness of stevia.

This seems to be a rarity of an energy drink that does not have awful additives in it!  It has no color and has a light, refreshing texture and slightly sweet taste, without being too much.  It has natural, organic ingredients that provide energy rather than artificial ones and no sugar alcohols (erythritol etc) which usually cause me problems.  I therefore felt a nice, natural energy boost without any discomfort.  Loved it!

While I occasionally consume energy drinks, I often worry about the ingredients in conventional varieties which are often made up of chemicals that I can hardly pronounce and rarely recognize. I wonder about the safety and potential effects on my health from those products, and I'm also not particularly fond of the often strongly artificial taste. As such. I was really interested in learning about and trying out Guru Organic Energy, which is made up of organic ingredients and naturally occurring caffeine. Given that I avoid calories in drinks, I chose the Lite version to try, and I was pleasantly surprised. The flavor was different, and although I wouldn't say it was delicious, it was refreshing and not as aversive as other energy drinks I've tried. I didn't feel a huge kick of energy, but caffeine rarely has a tremendous effect on me and I did feel alert if not energetic. Overall, I think the Guru Organic Energy Drink is a preferable choice for those looking for energy beverages over the typical energy drink laden with artificial ingredients. Although I'm not a regular connoisseur of energy drinks, the next time I want one I will choose Guru Organic. #trynatural

GURU Lite is very tasty and refreshing, especially on a hot day. Unlike most Stevia sweetened drinks, the taste is well balanced with no bitter aftertaste. There's a nice lemony flavor and the carbonation is on-point.

I don't usually drink energy drinks, but this one is an exception to the rule. It's organic, low calorie, non-GMO and contains ingredients that I can actually trust. Another big bonus I noticed is that I did not experience a crash afterwards. I read that this has to do with the fact that they use naturally-occurring caffeine from Green Tea and Guarana. I don't know why you would drink any other energy drink than this. Definitely loading up on these again soon!

This product is packed with good, natural ingredients, unlike most energy drinks out there, and still packs the same amount of caffeine! The flavor of this drink is somewhat like a gummy bear, although just slightly watered down from the flavors of other energy drinks, which I didn't mind. I have tried other natural energy drinks in the past which did not agree with me, however I did not have the same issues with this drink. I really enjoyed it. If there is one thing i could say about it, is there wasn't any selection at the store I went to. They had one flavor of the drink, in one size. The drink was also about a dollar more than comparable energy drinks. I would be most likely to buy this product if they offered a multi-pack with a small discount.

Midday and I just ate too much for lunch and all I wanted to do was take a nap. It was a perfect time to give Guru a try.

Not a jittery jolt but just enough to get me out of my slump. I was also happy to know I wasn't filling my body with harmful stuff to achieve that boost. I would recommend this product to friends, family, and co workers.

A good drink if you are able to find the lite version. The regular version is basically all sugar, which I do not like. The lite version is much better but harder to find. Taste is good, on par with other energy drinks. Not sure if being organic is worth the extra retail cost though.

Really good tasting product! The thing that stood out to me was that it tasted somewhat like redbull, but with a more pleasing aftertaste. It reminded me of cane sugar soda, but much healthier. There are 30g of natural sugar, which is better than most sodas, and there are few ingredients, all of them organic. My only issue was the manufacturer's coupon, which confused the cashier, and in the end, I had to pay sales tax. Other than that, I really enjoyed this experience.

To be honest, I've never been a fan of energy drinks. I usually choose to go with the shots like the 5-hours just because I chug it and it's done. The Guru Energy drink actually has a natural taste though compared to the other energy drinks on the market which is good. The only issue I have with this is availability, This drink is not available a lot of places, which makes it hard to purchase when you do want to indulge. All in all, this is a MUCH better choice for energy drinks, the taste is pleasant and it gave me a nice jolt with absolutely no crash. I would recommend trying this for sure if you could find it! Thanks for the opportunity to taste.

I bought the lite version because I try to stay away from high sugar beverages. I like that the lite only has 3g of sugar and is sweetened with stevia. I enjoyed the taste of the energy drink; it has a light and refreshing cherry flavor. I definitely noticed an increase in energy and alertness after about 15 minutes. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it's still a little to sweet for me. I would buy it if I needed a quick boost of energy over other brands of energy drinks but I probably would not buy this on a regular basis since I currently purchase drinks like this only occasionally.

I am not a huge energy drink fan, due to the usual caffeinated cough syrup taste and often shakey feeling afterwards. However, with Guru I was actually pleasantly surprised! It tasted much better than other energy drinks that I have tried, and there wasn't such a drastic crash after the caffeine wore off. I like that I didn't experience any shakey feelings or feel ill after drinking. I will definitely be purchasing more when my coffee just isn't doing what I need.

The Guru Energy Drink is a great tasting alternative to other energy drinks. I'm primarily a Red Bull fan but I got to try the Guru Energy Drink.

All in all, 10/10 would buy again.

I don't usually drink energy drinks or coffee because they make my heart race and I get shaky but with half a can of this drink I didn't feel over-caffeinated.

The taste, like Guru's website describes, is very indescribable. It is very sharp and light with a medium amount of carbonation. The caffeine buzz is more "natural"... it has more of an upslope and downslope rather than a sudden cracked out (which is arguably awesome too in its own respect) then big crash sort of feeling. This is because the caffeine in Guru is derived from 125mg of Guaranine (Guarana Herb) rather than synthetically separated then added. There is no mention about how much of the 125mg of Guaranine is real caffeine, but since Red Bull checks in at 80mg / 8.3oz it seems that Guru is in pretty good shape.

I usually don't like energy drinks, because I can't deal with the carbonation. Guru Organic Energy Drink was a nice surprise, because the carbonation isn't that bad - I actually let it sit a little and it got a lot better. The taste is very fruity and mild, and I really like how sweet it is. I tried it on a day when I had to be out early, and it really helped me feeling up while running errands. I'd recommend it and buy it again.

There's two sizes. I used the larger sugar free one before starting my 8am shift. I drank it throughout my shift. I absolutely loved the taste of it! The price isn't to bad either. With some of the energy drinks out there at least this one you know is organic and better for you so it's worth it. Energy wise I def felt it when I first started drinking it. It wasn't overpowering but the right amount of energy. I usually sip it throughout my shift. The only problem I had with it was that after the half way point my energy was decreasing but I would definitely recommend it to my friends.

So, I am not an energy drink person & I got this for my husband & he was really skeptic about it cause he's used to the regular energy drinks at the gas station. But, he actually really enjoyed this. He said it gave him more energy without the sugar-y crash that others give him after a couple of hours. This definitely worked for him & I felt better knowing that it has better ingredients for him. I was really against him drinking energy drinks, but thankful that this product is a lot safer for him. I would recommend this product to any & all energy drinkers.

At first taste I thought it was a bit bitter and had a weird taste but the more I drank it, the better it began to taste. It was very smooth and not as gassy as red bull. I began to feel very energetic as the day went on. By nightfall it began to wore off and I was able to sleep like normal. It had no lasting effects like Red Bull or Monster drinks and it tasted real good.  I can see myself buying it again, especially because it has natural and organic ingredients. I would definitely recommend this energy drink to others.

I didn't know what to expect from this drink, what if the flavor was not as strong as other competitors? Or what if the effect was not as strong or at least the same? But having the promise that it is a natural product, and non-GMO why not giving it a chance? 
The result? It is great! As long as you drink it cold it is very refreshing, the flavor is delicious, and it really gives you a boost of energy, perfect for those moments when you need help to stay awake. Even when I got my coupon to get a free drink, I noticed the price is not that high, making it an even better option.

A great pick me up...... recommend this as a before workout drink so you can quickly burn the sugar.  I wish they used organic sugar vice corn syrup which is more in keeping with organic ingredients.  The Lite version uses Stevia which is much better.
I like the product and will continue to use as a pre-run supplement, but in the Lite version only.

I would like to point out first that it seems that only the "original" flavor is organic (if that is something that is important to you). It did have a slight Red Bull like taste but overall it is one of the better tasting energy drinks. It didn't make me super jittery but it did give me a lil extra pep to make it through a late night.

I just tried the regular version of the Guru Organic Energy drink and it was quite good. The flavor was sort of similar to a very mild grapefruit flavor. I do feel energized, but I don't feel ill like some energy drinks can make you feel. Guru is refreshing and reading the ingredients the first thing I see is sparkling water. There is nothing chemical or strange in this drink. I would definitely switch over to this from the other drinks I have tried. If you want something light, refreshing, and tasty pick one of these up!

This product worked so well for my energy level. I was dead drag button tired when I drank it and felt steady energy all day. I would give a higher score, but whoo that aftertaste was something else; however it's nothing unbearable, just a slight bitterness. The drink itself is sweet though, the bitterness only comes after. My husband will probably stick to his normal energy drink, but I like this one myself.

For a natural energy drink, Guru was great. I liked that I knew what I was putting in my body and that the lite version of this drink only has 5 calories. However, I don't feel like it amped me up as much as a "regular" energy drink. It was a great substitute for my morning coffee, but I wouldn't rely on it for an all-nighter.

I work hard and I play hard, so sometimes I need a pick-me-up.

The flavor was pretty good, the energy increase was noticeable, and the ingredients were natural.  I would definitely buy it again!

This drink tasted quite nice, almost like berries, and definitely better than a conventional energy drink.

I would buy this if it were on sale, but other natural energy drinks are consistently cheaper. I would absolutely recommend this product to a friend or customer.

As a monster fanatic and a diabetic I am always happy to try new energy drinks that will give me the energy I need without the sugar that I don't need. Guru is a great substitute for the sugary/no sugar energy drinks. I love the fact that it is sweetened with Stevia and uses natural ingredients for the boost of energy you might need mid day or early morning.

This is a great way to boost up your energy without any harmful chemicals of other energy drinks. I drank it early in the morning and it immediately gave me a boost of energy, like a cup of coffee usually does, and I did not feel a crash throughout the day. It lasts a good 10-12 hours, by the time I was ready for bed I slept soundly, definitely a great product!

This was a surprisingly pleasant beverage. I don't usually like energy drinks. Every now and again I break down and purchase one as an alternative to my usual coffee, but I'm not a big energy drink person. I think of them as having a rather off taste and an unpleasant effect on my heartbeat. This one, surprisingly, seemed to have neither of those. It was fresh tasting if you can believe it, and I found myself actually enjoying the flavor instead of merely tolerating it. The one detractor is that it did not seem to supply quite the same kick as a normal energy drink. The energy it did supply, however, came without heart palpitations or other unfortunate side effects, and for that I am quite grateful! I may not buy it often, but next time I reach for an energy drink I'll definitely reach for guru and I will not hesitate to suggest it to friends.

I'm glad that I was able to try this. It's honestly not to bad if you are looking for a more natural energy. But that being said there is some downsides. Natural Guarana has a steady rise of alertness and energy. But also comes with a sudden crash once it's all used up. That's because there are no synthetics that carry the Caffeine. The flavor is mellow yet sharp. Definitely has that "natural" flavor. All in all, it's not a bad drink. Definitely a plus for those looking for non synthetics and wanting natural energy.

I was a big coffee drinker until i realized how much sugar and creamer I was consuming in my 'cup of joe'. I also realized the energy crash later was due to my coffee fix. Discovering Guru was the perfect answer for me! The taste takes a little getting used to, (best ice cold) but the energy boost is just right and I don't seem to have the crash later. My son uses it for work-outs, and my employer and I swear it makes us happy! Also, I have gotten so I like the taste. Please don't ever stop making guru!

Not overpowering like most energy drinks that I buy. This has no B vitamins and doesn't taste like a vitamin B drink. Instead it has a real smooth lite flavor. It has like a light fruit taste, almost like a carbonated flavored water/juice, and is really not too sweet. It taste real unique and is made with all natural ingredients. I like it, I would definitely recommend this product to help support the immune system. #trynatural

I must admit that I am always needing some sort of energy push, and I most definitely can become a connoisseur of energy drinks. Guru Natural Energy Drink came through 100%. The taste was not too sweet, and actually tasted like a flavorful light fruit beverage. Guru was not too heavy and I could feel the pick up immediately. Bottom line is this energy drink is great in taste, gives me the pick up I need, almost immediately, and does not hurt the pocket book, like so many other energy drinks.

I don't usually drink energy drinks since most are full of ingredients that can do more harm than good.  However, I recently attended an all day training for group fitness and I decided it to try out the GURU natural energy drink  to prepare me for the intense physical activities of the day.  Normally, I am sensitive to caffeine, but I didn't particularly feel any jitters or side effects when I drank GURU natural energy drink.  I liked the taste, which didn't have an aftertaste, as what I would expect...and it kept my energy going throughout the day.  Overall, I enjoyed trying this product out, and like that this is a healthier alternative energy drink than what's on the market.

This actually worked to give me energy. I work in a physically demanding environment, and after 12 hour days, I really just have enough for the commute and then to crash out when I get home. Not so great when I am the primary caretaker of an energetic toddler. Much to my relief, the GURU drink was offered and for me it was a must have.
It actually worked rather well. The taste was smooth and not funky like a lot of energy drinks tend to be. It gave me the energy to keep pushing as I drank it with my break meal. It takes a lot to pep me up, but surprisingly, this did. Kudos!

When taking all factors into consideration this is best energy drink by I've had hands down. The taste is unique, not artificial at all. The effect is more of a smooth climb with a bonus increase in mental awareness. No initial energy jolt and no hard crash. That being said if you have been up for two days you will not reap the full benefits of any energy drink, get some sleep.

When taking all factors into consideration this is best energy drink by I've had hands down. The taste is unique, not artificial at all. The effect is more of a smooth climb with a bonus increase in mental awareness. No initial energy jolt and no hard crash because instead of just caffeine anhydrous, this uses a blend of guarana, ginseng, and gingko biloba for energy., I can easily say that GURU is among the very best. Using natural, organic ingredients (organic, vegan, no gluten, no GMO's) and natural caffeine, GURU manages to be tastier than most of the competition without having to resort a bevy of artificial flavors.I find the taste enjoyable,  It's not too harsh and has refreshing flavor.

I drink energy drinks on occasion but not all the time. I usually don’t like getting the jitters and some do cause jitters. I also hate the taste of some of them. I really wanted to try Guru because I have never had Organic energy drinks before. I decided to take one after returning from a trip in the afternoon and decided that I wanted to go to yoga that night but wasn’t sure if I had the energy for it. I took it about an hour before going to the gym I ran for 15 minutes and did an hour yoga class.  I was pleasantly surprised at how good it tasted. It had a light sparkling natural taste. I felt really great throughout my workout. I didn’t get this surge or jolt of energy, but I noticed that I didn’t feel tired at all. I also never got the jitters which was my biggest concern. I really like Guru. I'm very impressed.  I would recommend it to any of my friends.

I always try to eat and drink healthy especially when it's organic.   Normally I am not a fan of energy drinks  because of the ingredients that are hard to read and understand.  Since this one was organic,  I enjoyed it more because of the enjoyable taste, unlike other energy drinks. Plus it's healthier and has organic ingredients.

I couldn't personally try it due to being pregnant and not having much caffeine, so I gave it to my husband to try. Took him a bit to get use to the flavor. He's use red bull and monster.

I'm so glad I found this energy drink. I can so appreciate that it does not include horrible sweeteners like aspertame or splenda. I also prefer the taste of the drink over the taste of Monster or Rockstar. I also really love that it doesn't give me the jitters that those other popular drinks do. I felt the energy, but it was a smooth increase of energy...not something that made me feel sick or anxious. I would totally recommend.

I appreciated the chance to try this drink. It's great to have a healthier organic alternative without the additives & artificial flavours that are part of many energy drinks.  I found it very refreshing, with just enough sweetness. It did increase my energy somewhat without making me feel overly amped up. I also love that it's vegan & non-GMO. The only reason that I wouldn't buy it as frequently is because I found the taste a little strong, but it's a good product that I plan to drink occasionally.

I really loved this product, I am a huge fan of energy drinks. Most conventional ones contain so many terrible ingredients, so it's kind of hard to justify purchasing them. It took a while for me to get a hold of this product since the store is a bit far, I wish they sold this in more locations. I really enjoyed it, it was sweet; but not overwhelming need water feel. It was very smooth and fizzy, and it didn't contain stevia. I usually hate natural organic drinks that contain stevia since they give me a headache; this product didn't do that. I enjoyed every minute of it and didn't want it to end. I would completely recommend this to everyone, I will purchase it on occasion since it's a bit higher in price; although I can justify paying higher for a healthier alternative. Overall I was beyond impressed, I was very surprised by the quality; I truly enjoyed it.

I have tried many different energy drinks in the past & Guru fits right in with the rest of them. The plus side is that this did not taste any different than non natural products. Bubbly with a smooth flavor. I felt awake after drinking it without having any of the "bloated" feeling afterward that some dinks leave me feeling. Overall I was very pleased and would recommend especially if you only want to drink natural energy drinks.

Deal Comes as European Cities Address Growing Crisis Created by Diesel


        MADRID & NEWPORT BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Clean Energy Fuels Corp. (Nasdaq: CLNE) announced today that its Compression unit has signed an agreement with Seranco, S.A. for 16 Clean Energy CleanCNG 2.0 300HP compressors at three Empresa Municipal de Madrid (EMT) fueling facilities throughout the city.
      

        This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170724005686/en/


        Currently EMT operates approximately 2000 buses which includes 500 that are fueled with CNG. Last month, EMT and the City Council of Madrid approved the purchase of an additional 200 CNG buses in 2017, to go along with the purchase of 400 made in 2016. The transit agency has a goal of making their entire fleet 'clean' by 2019. EMT announced it would continue to purchase CNG buses because they reduce pollutant emissions by 70 percent in relation to diesel - and complies with the strictest European emission regulations.
      

        In December, the city of Madrid joined Paris, Athens and Mexico City in laying out plans to ban diesel from their cities by the year 2025. Madrid already plans to ban cars from 500 acres of its city center by 2020.
      

        'We are proud to perform this project, this will be the first step to improve the air quality of Madrid City in the next years. We hope many other cities will join this process increasing their commitment with the environment,' said Santiago Garrido, CEO of Gas & Go.
      

        'Madrid is just one of a number of cities across Europe and around the world which are taking steps to clean up their air that has become a significant health issue for its citizens, largely caused by the use of diesel,' said Frank Meyer, president of Clean Energy Compression. 'We are proud to partner with Seranco to expand EMT's use of their CNG fleet which is one of the best and quickest ways to address harmful smog.'
      

        Clean Energy Compression is a pioneer in oil-free compression in cylinders and pistons, providing clean gas to the system while protecting the environment by minimizing the amount of lubricant used and keeping the storage capacity constant. Besides the robustness and high reliability of CEC products, the basis of its strength at all points of coverage, is the great experience in manufacturing and maintenance of equipment for CNG.

has a slight citrus taste, gave me the boost i needed without the crash.  much rather drink this than red bull, rockstar or monster as this is organic!  found my new favorite energy drink pre-workout or just when i'm dragging on certain days.  also it doesn't have a ton of calories, big plus! 
Would you purchase again? -  Yes!

I like the taste ! but bI don't drink energy drunk too often. That's why I'm not going to purchase the product.  But I do recommend people to try and  then they can decide for themselves.

This product was tasting and refreshing. It helped provide energy. I'm not sure of the importance of it being vegan for an energy drink though.

I don't usually drink energy drinks, but this one is an exception to the rule. It's organic, low calorie, non-GMO and contains ingredients that I can actually trust.  I did not experience a crash afterwards. I read that this has to do with the fact that they use naturally-occurring caffeine from Green Tea and Guarana. I don't know why you would drink any other energy drink than this. Definitely loading up on these again soon! Great price not expensive at all!
Would you purchase again? -  Yes!

Great Taste and quite a Boost. Perfect for tired driving or late night Study! Have quite a few friends that love GURU also and it's Organic.

Definitely better tasting than something like Red Bull---and just as importantly, better smelling.  I can't be the only person who gags at the smell of Red Bull....  In contrast, this stuff is much more palatable, less artificially sweet, and doesn't leave that horrendous aftertaste coating your tongue.    It's harder to find than Red Bull, so when you see it, stock up.
Would you purchase again? -  Yes!

The energy drink is great to drink in the morning to get rid of the grogginess after a late night. I doesn't bring you up as high as caffeine, but it settles in with your current mood as a stabilizer.

Having only tried this once in my life, i was shocked at how well it tasted! It didn't feel super heavy with sugars and carbs like alot of energy drinks can feel like after consuming. I let my coworker try some, he said he really enjoyed how well it tasted. I would probably purchase in the future.

I don't drink energy drinks often, mostly because they don't typically taste great and I drink coffee already. However, I was impressed with Guru. I couldn't put my finger on the flavor at first, but reading the ingredients it was the green tea that leaves a mild aftertaste, kind of like matcha. The nose is citrusy and refreshing. That said, although I stayed perky after drinking it; I would say it's safe for people who only drink caffeine moderately to drink it too, and if you're dead tired it might not make much of a difference. It only has caffeine from the tea, so not at all the "crack" type of artificial energy drink like a Monster or Red Bull, which I think taste gross and are horrible for you!

Honestly, I much rather drink this organic energy drink rather then regular energy drinks any day! However, I do not normally drink energy drinks.

Brotin D.

I was extremely pleased with the taste of this drink. There was no bitterness unlike other artificially sweet drinks. The plus point of this drink is that its organic, low calorie and contains ingredients that are not harmful to the body. The caffeine in this drink is derived from natural sources like green tea. So I can have as many drinks I desire without feeling guilty. I tried the Lite version of the drink. The only negative point for this product is the price. Costing around $2 per can is quite expensive!

When it comes to energy drinks, I always prefer to have a more natural drink. With the chemicals and fake flavor of many competitors, this is definitely a healthy alternative to give you that boost you need in your day.  This drink did not give my an amped up feeling or jitters, which I always appreciate. It honestly is a drink I would purchase again. I hope this can pops up on more stores' shelves.

It was a lovely soda, lots of carbonation, no aftertaste (kind of like a citrus apple cider with tea) but there was a little too much sugar. I pay attention to carb intake as I am Type 1 Diabetic and there was quite a bit of sugar...too much for my taste. I don't even think it needed it but it was still yummy!

I'm not big on mainstream energy drinks, so I'm happy that there's a more natural organic variation. I probably won't drink a ton of them, but I would probably try to convert people from drinking big brand energy drinks to drinking GURU. I was happy to find the product provided being sold at Sprouts.

I really enjoyed drinking this energy drink, i love how it has only 10 calories! Everyone should try this organic, vegan and non-gmo drink. Why isn't this the new thing ? Gatorade should not be the energy drink people chose.  I loved how it boosted me up when I'm trying to get things done without having to worry about the down fall.

The organic energy its self has an amazing taste at first i was alittle weird about it like should i try it or not but then on the first sip it was really yummy it tasted great. It honestly gave me so much energy, im an active person, i workout, i do alot of things in my day like any other super busy person. I think i would buy it again but im not the type to rely on energy drinks i just wanted to try it to be honest. I would definitely recommend it to any person that needs some extra energy to cope with their day. This is a product that does exactly what it says.

I was a bit hesitant to try an energy drink as I'd heard some of them make people jittery or make their heart race as side effects. But I decided to give this one a try. I drank this on a day of work that I knew would be busy, and it definitely made a difference. I felt very energetic, and I luckily didn't get any bad side effects. It tasted very good too. Would definitely recommend!

I was pleasantly surprised with the overall energy factor of this drink. It tastes much like that of Redbull, but without the tendency of giving you a throbbing headache. I was quite thrilled with the amount of energy I obtained from a single 8.4 fl oz serving. It does taste much like most traditional energy drinks, a bit canny and tin-like but the energy you get is well worth the metallic taste. I can actually see myself purchasing this on a regular basis. 5/5 stars for sure!

As someone who is always on the run, I like having a large variety of different energy drinks to fuel my day as a substitute for coffee. I tried the GURU organic energy drink out and liked that it didn't taste like the typical energy beverage with the taurine flavor that is so prevalent. Generally if you're putting caffeine into your body, you'd like it to be as unadulterated as possible. I like that the ingredients used in the drink are organic, gluten-free, and NON=GMO verified.

I'm not much an engery drinks kind of person but when I do need a lift of engery I like to drink something that is not super high in sugar or have a list of ingredients I can barely pronounce. Guru engery drinks did the job for when I needed an extra boost. As far as taste go I find it similar to the other drinks I had before. If one is in need of an extra boost of energy and prefer something that is organic Guru is the way to.

The first thing I did when I bought this product was read the ingredients. To my surprise I could read all the ingredients and there was no caffeine. I wake up at 5 o'clock in the morning everyday for work. I'm usually a little tired. About two hours into the workday, this particular work day,  the first thing I did was drink the guru light. I did not feel tired all day and did not feel overly energized.  Plainly said, I felt normal and this was good for me.  That means the drink did what it was supposed to do.  I don't think I'D  drink it everyday but I will definitely keep a few spares around for days when I play hockey until midnight and have to work at 5 in the morning or days where I'm working all day and I need that extra push to get me through. #trynatural

Wow, this is definitely one of the best tasting energy drinks out on the market.  It has a really nice, sweet flavor to it, and has zero aftertaste.  You can definitely taste the white grape juice, but it's not overpowering   I definitely felt it starting to work immediately, which I also enjoy with energy drinks, as I like to sip them over the course of my afternoon.  I would definitely buy this one again as it was in the same price point as my other usual energy drinks.  I would also recommend it to a friend if they wanted a sweet, pick-me-up to keep them going,

I usually don't use energy drinks because of the flavor but I tried the Guru Organic energy drink and thought it was a step above the usual Red Bull or Monster drinks.  Upon reading the list of ingredients, I was pleased to see that they were all natural.  I was surprised to see echinacea listed as an ingredient, which I felt was a nice alternative to unpleasant tasting vitamin supplements.  My store did not carry the sugar free variety, so I had to settle for the 30 grams of sugar that came with the regular version.  It was very sweet, but the actual taste was good and I liked the level of carbonation.  I didn't get the jitters nor did I have the "crash and burn" that I would have expected with this type of drink.  I did not drink it all at once, but rather had it throughout the second half of the day, which is usually when I start feeling tired.  If I can find the sugar free version, I will definitely try it.  I do have to limit my caffeine intake, but for those occasions when I absolutely must have an extra boost, a cold sparkly Guru sounds like a great alternative to an iced coffee or tea.

I found this at my local Safeway store in the energy drinks aisle and it was easy to locate.  I like the fact that it is organic and great tasting too.

I really Enjoy the Fruity Taste, and my co-workers see that I'm drinking GURU, and they start asking me about it. Haha, now my friends are also purchasing GURU, and I'm glad to say that they learned about it from me which makes me Happy!

I don't usually drink energy drinks because of all the artificial ingredients but I liked Guru because it's organic, low calorie, non-GMO and contains healthy  ingredients like Guarana and Green Tea. There was no initial energy jolt and no hard crash, did not experience any brain fog either.  A little bit too sweet for me but my son liked it, he usually drinks Monster Zero.

Guru Energy Drink is one of a kind. This drink smells great. The taste is a little on the bitter side. This is my personal opinion. It does have echinacea flower extract, in which I do like. I feel an organic energy and no jitters at all. I like this drink. It is an acquired taste though.

I bought the Original version -  because I had read reviews on Amazon saying that it was better-flavored.  It had a nice fruity-citrusy taste, and wasn't overly sweet.  Since I usually buy low or no-calorie energy drinks I am used to a different flavor profile.  I got a nice "kick" from this drink, and it helped keep me stay alert during a long-distance drive.  I also appreciate the organic ingredients, since a lot of energy drinks are full of all sorts of "junk".  Will definitely buy this again!

I opted for the original as opposed to the lite. I've had several other brands of energy drinks in the past, and Guru definitely has a cleaner slightly refreshing taste. I like that guru is made with organic cane sugar, which surprised me as other drinks I've had can leave a artificial taste. The drink also contains sparkling water, organic white grape juice, and organic green tea leaf extract which is a great naturally occurring caffeine. Guru organic energy drink definitely holds its own when it comes to energy drinks and I would definitely purchase again.

I easily found this at the store. I opted for the original. When I got home I immediately put it in my chiller so that I could try it right away. I didn't even read the can. I opened it and was pleasantly surprised that it was carbonated. The taste was not overly sweet... it was JUST right. I am not a fan of things that are TOO sweet.  The flavor was slightly fruity, like a mild version of a candy, again, not too sweet.  After about 10 minutes I started feeling more awake and alert. I love that it didn't get me pumped or jittery. It gave me the perfect amount of energy for it to feel natural. I would absolutely​ purchase this again. I never liked energy drinks, but GURU changed my mind.

I am not a fan of RedBull or coffee, but i like caffeine in other forms, so i decided to try Guru. I was pleasantly surprised, because it has wonderful taste. It is not as overwhelming as RedBull, it is more natural, fruity and refreshing. And the energy in it brought some muracles - on lazy and rainy Sunday afternoon, i did not have much hope to achieve anything, but... with Guru, i completed tasks and chores i was procrastinating about for weeks. The only thing to be aware of: if you live in Bay Area, this drink will cost you hefty tax. I was surprised it has the tax penalty for soft sugary drinks!

I personally am a connoisseur of energy drinks. I rely on caffeine for most of my projects at school and for late night coding sessions as well as marathon gaming. Although energy drinks can be considered a crutch, it's a lifestyle decision that many, many people embrace rather than attempt to avoid... I am one of these people.

That said, Guru Energy is fairly cheap ($1.25USD/can) if you buy it here off Amazon, it comes in the Redbull standard 8.3 fl/oz cans, and is shipped in a surprisingly lightweight and compact case (compare this to Monster, Rockstar, or any other brand with standard 16 fl/oz cans).

The taste, like Guru's website describes, is very indescribable. It is very sharp and light with a medium amount of carbonation. The caffeine buzz is more "natural"... it has more of an upslope and downslope rather than a sudden cracked out (which is arguably awesome too in its own respect) then big crash sort of feeling. This is because the caffeine in Guru is derived from 125mg of Guaranine (Guarana Herb) rather than synthetically separated then added. There is no mention about how much of the 125mg of Guaranine is real caffeine, but since Red Bull checks in at 80mg / 8.3oz it seems that Guru is in pretty good shape.

I think a particular good feature of Guru is that it uses cane sugar rather than high fructose corn syrup. I appreciate a good quality soda, particularly microbrew colas, and they often exclusively contain cane sugar.

So in summary, this energy drink is fairly cheap, good buzz, all natural, and great for coding, gaming, or studying.

The biggest question is DOES IT WORK?? 
The answer to your question is, YES! I was busy all day long and had the best energy I've had in awhile. It feels a lot better than using Redbull.. I'm very sensitive to caffeine so drinking it gives me a lot of energy I have no question about that. But this energy felt like I've slept the whole night without waking up and best bed ever. So pretty much I felt really good!! 
The taste isn't the best but it not a lot you drink so if you hate it a lot then just chug it. It's a little herbaly but not bad. Just different.

Coming from someone who at one point drank a decent amount of Monster Energy drinks, I can say that the GURU Organic Energy drink definitely makes me feel better after consumption. You still get a decent kick of caffeine, but there is less crap (i.e. less gnarly, processed ingredients) in it. I don't consume energy drinks often anymore, but I'd grab one of these if they are available the next time I want one.

I really enjoyed this energy drink. It kept me alert but not at all jittery. So many energy drinks leave me shaky and jittery but this one did not. A BIG bonus for me is that t does not have gross or unpronounceable ingredients in it- it is organic and naturally sweetened with only 10 calories. (This is the lite version- my store did not carry the original) It has a pleasant taste- not great but not bad.
When I need an energy drink again, I will definitely buy this one.

I really enjoyed the Organic Energy Drink by Guru. It was reminiscent of a Slurpee with a slight aftertaste of cough syrup. But the cough syrup taste was not overwhelming. It gave me energy like a normal energy drink would. It is a good-sized drink and has a total of 143 milligrams of caffeine which is only 20 milligrams less than the Monsters that I usually drink. I definitely recommend this and will be buying more.

After popping open the can, I had whiffs of the Red Bull scent. So I was quite surprised after tasting it. Not only did it not taste like Red Bull, it had a fruity flavor, which is a plus! I liked how it was carbonated and that all the ingredients were organic and natural. I tried the regular flavor which was a bit too sweet for me so the Lite may have been a better choice; nonetheless, the original was still pretty good. I do not know if I would recommend it since the sugar (30g) is quite high for one serving, but over other energy drinks, I would. It is probably the best tasting energy drink I have tried so far.

Love Guru. I think it tastes great (kinda like jelly beans or something similarly sweet) and it gives me a great boost without the crash. I am staying away from sugar now though and at 25 grams a can not worth the splurge anymore.

Guru energy drink really works. The taste was very good no after taste like most energy drinks. I drank it before I did some yard work. The taste is what I liked most about this product it was tastey. I have already purchased Guru for work to get me through the day. I would recommend  this product to anyone who needs a natural energy pickup on a daily basis. Thank you for the opportunity to  try and review Guru Energy Drink.#trynatural.

I drink a lot of coffee and a lot of energy drinks. This was was pretty good. It wasn't my favorite, but I enjoyed it. The flavor reminded me if two things. At first, it sort of reminded me of Coca-Cola. Then, the second half sort of reminded me of a 7-11 slurpee. Despite those connotations, it did not taste thick and sugary. It was pretty light and I felt great after drinking it.

Excellent taste and a good source of energy. If you don't care much about sugar content then don't get the lite because the normal one is pretty good too! The can packs a decent punch and the organic components of the product make me feel like I'm not wiring myself up on some synthetic creation that tastes like plastic. The product isn't priced the most competitively but maybe that is because I purchased it at bristol farms, I wouldn't be surprised if whole foods had it for a bit less. I enjoyed my Guru chilled but I totally see how it could be fine on the go at room temperature. Overall I'm happy with my guru experience.

I drink energy drinks often. I drink coffee daily.  With that being said,  guru is pretty good.  I didn't get the jitters like i usually do when trying a new drink for the first time,  so that was a definite plus.  It provided a nice energy boost.  The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the taste. I made the mistake of getting the Lite, so it's my fault but it taste 2 just like anything else that's considered "light", like it's missing an ingredient or mage with fake sugar.  Overall I was satisfied.

I don't usually buy traditional energy drinks because I prefer clean ingredients. This Guru energy drink is very clean (it's organic, too!), and has very low calories. I actually liked the taste a lot better than I thought I would but you can definitely taste the stevia. It's a little bitter but the lemon juice and added sugar help to balance that out. I did not notice a huge lift in energy but it did perk me up at work. I'd probably purchase this in the future to drink after lunch/early afternoon at work.

I really enjoyed the sustained, healthy energy this drink provided. Other energy drinks contain scary amounts of caffeine and vitamin B (like it could give you irregular heart rhythms scary) which causes an energy crash, This one takes a more natural approach. The result is a productive pep that does not make you feel (or seem) like you're on crack and it doesn't cause a sudden drop in energy either. The energizing ingredients are green tea extract, guarana seed, and ginseng. There is also echinacea which is great for the immune system. At first I found the stevia to be overwhelming, but the berry flavor presumably from the luo han guo fruit kept me sipping. I have a suspicion I would like the non-lite version a bit more, but this drink is great for those who are used to the powerful sweetness of stevia.

This seems to be a rarity of an energy drink that does not have awful additives in it!  It has no color and has a light, refreshing texture and slightly sweet taste, without being too much.  It has natural, organic ingredients that provide energy rather than artificial ones and no sugar alcohols (erythritol etc) which usually cause me problems.  I therefore felt a nice, natural energy boost without any discomfort.  Loved it!

While I occasionally consume energy drinks, I often worry about the ingredients in conventional varieties which are often made up of chemicals that I can hardly pronounce and rarely recognize. I wonder about the safety and potential effects on my health from those products, and I'm also not particularly fond of the often strongly artificial taste. As such. I was really interested in learning about and trying out Guru Organic Energy, which is made up of organic ingredients and naturally occurring caffeine. Given that I avoid calories in drinks, I chose the Lite version to try, and I was pleasantly surprised. The flavor was different, and although I wouldn't say it was delicious, it was refreshing and not as aversive as other energy drinks I've tried. I didn't feel a huge kick of energy, but caffeine rarely has a tremendous effect on me and I did feel alert if not energetic. Overall, I think the Guru Organic Energy Drink is a preferable choice for those looking for energy beverages over the typical energy drink laden with artificial ingredients. Although I'm not a regular connoisseur of energy drinks, the next time I want one I will choose Guru Organic. #trynatural

GURU Lite is very tasty and refreshing, especially on a hot day. Unlike most Stevia sweetened drinks, the taste is well balanced with no bitter aftertaste. There's a nice lemony flavor and the carbonation is on-point.

I don't usually drink energy drinks, but this one is an exception to the rule. It's organic, low calorie, non-GMO and contains ingredients that I can actually trust. Another big bonus I noticed is that I did not experience a crash afterwards. I read that this has to do with the fact that they use naturally-occurring caffeine from Green Tea and Guarana. I don't know why you would drink any other energy drink than this. Definitely loading up on these again soon!

This product is packed with good, natural ingredients, unlike most energy drinks out there, and still packs the same amount of caffeine! The flavor of this drink is somewhat like a gummy bear, although just slightly watered down from the flavors of other energy drinks, which I didn't mind. I have tried other natural energy drinks in the past which did not agree with me, however I did not have the same issues with this drink. I really enjoyed it. If there is one thing i could say about it, is there wasn't any selection at the store I went to. They had one flavor of the drink, in one size. The drink was also about a dollar more than comparable energy drinks. I would be most likely to buy this product if they offered a multi-pack with a small discount.

Not a jittery jolt but just enough to get me out of my slump. I was also happy to know I wasn't filling my body with harmful stuff to achieve that boost.

Really good tasting product! The thing that stood out to me was that it tasted somewhat like redbull, but with a more pleasing aftertaste. It reminded me of cane sugar soda, but much healthier. There are 30g of natural sugar, which is better than most sodas, and there are few ingredients, all of them organic. My only issue was the manufacturer's coupon, which confused the cashier, and in the end, I had to pay sales tax. Other than that, I really enjoyed this experience.

I regularly consume energy drink. But this one is totally different from the rest, perfect taste, so smooth.  Organic and natural caffeine is what is the most exciting feature.

My energy drink from Guru was amazing the flavor is really good it's not overpowering I really noticed that I had a lot more energy after taking it because I had a very restless night of sleeping I would recommend this to other people it's great and doesn't leave the feeling of gitterness afterwards. I also did not come down from the high afterwards. It was a very  natural feeling. Yes I would recommend and purchase this product again in the future

Taste amazing doesn't give you a nasty after taste like most Energy Drinks. Very light and not very carbonated berverage which is amazing. Has a sweet taste but not too much just the perfect amount . Sometimes I need that extra boost of energy at work.  This drink woke me up for the rest of the morning,  would most definitely purchase again and recommend to friends and family. #TryNatural

To be honest, I've never been a fan of energy drinks. I usually choose to go with the shots like the 5-hours just because I chug it and it's done. The Guru Energy drink actually has a natural taste though compared to the other energy drinks on the market which is good. The only issue I have with this is availability, This drink is not available a lot of places, which makes it hard to purchase when you do want to indulge. All in all, this is a MUCH better choice for energy drinks, the taste is pleasant and it gave me a nice jolt with absolutely no crash. I would recommend trying this for sure if you could find it! Thanks for the opportunity to taste.

I bought the lite version because I try to stay away from high sugar beverages. I like that the lite only has 3g of sugar and is sweetened with stevia. I enjoyed the taste of the energy drink; it has a light and refreshing cherry flavor. I definitely noticed an increase in energy and alertness after about 15 minutes. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it's still a little to sweet for me. I would buy it if I needed a quick boost of energy over other brands of energy drinks but I probably would not buy this on a regular basis since I currently purchase drinks like this only occasionally.

I am not a huge energy drink fan, due to the usual caffeinated cough syrup taste and often shakey feeling afterwards. However, with Guru I was actually pleasantly surprised! It tasted much better than other energy drinks that I have tried, and there wasn't such a drastic crash after the caffeine wore off. I like that I didn't experience any shakey feelings or feel ill after drinking. I will definitely be purchasing more when my coffee just isn't doing what I need.

The Guru Energy Drink is a great tasting alternative to other energy drinks. I'm primarily a Red Bull fan but I got to try the Guru Energy Drink.

All in all, 10/10 would buy again.

I don't usually drink energy drinks or coffee because they make my heart race and I get shaky but with half a can of this drink I didn't feel over-caffeinated.
I liked that it is low in calories and organic but that also limits where I can buy it in the future. I don't usually shop at Sprouts or Whole Foods so this would only be something I would get when I rarely make it into those stores.

The taste, like Guru's website describes, is very indescribable. It is very sharp and light with a medium amount of carbonation. The caffeine buzz is more "natural"... it has more of an upslope and downslope rather than a sudden cracked out (which is arguably awesome too in its own respect) then big crash sort of feeling. This is because the caffeine in Guru is derived from 125mg of Guaranine (Guarana Herb) rather than synthetically separated then added. There is no mention about how much of the 125mg of Guaranine is real caffeine, but since Red Bull checks in at 80mg / 8.3oz it seems that Guru is in pretty good shape.

I usually don't like energy drinks, because I can't deal with the carbonation. Guru Organic Energy Drink was a nice surprise, because the carbonation isn't that bad - I actually let it sit a little and it got a lot better. The taste is very fruity and mild, and I really like how sweet it is. I tried it on a day when I had to be out early, and it really helped me feeling up while running errands. I'd recommend it and buy it again.

There's two sizes. I used the larger sugar free one before starting my 8am shift. I drank it throughout my shift. I absolutely loved the taste of it! The price isn't to bad either. With some of the energy drinks out there at least this one you know is organic and better for you so it's worth it. Energy wise I def felt it when I first started drinking it. It wasn't overpowering but the right amount of energy. I usually sip it throughout my shift. The only problem I had with it was that after the half way point my energy was decreasing but I would definitely recommend it to my friends.

So, I am not an energy drink person & I got this for my husband & he was really skeptic about it cause he's used to the regular energy drinks at the gas station. But, he actually really enjoyed this. He said it gave him more energy without the sugar-y crash that others give him after a couple of hours. This definitely worked for him & I felt better knowing that it has better ingredients for him. I was really against him drinking energy drinks, but thankful that this product is a lot safer for him. I would recommend this product to any & all energy drinkers.

At first taste I thought it was a bit bitter and had a weird taste but the more I drank it, the better it began to taste. It was very smooth and not as gassy as red bull. I began to feel very energetic as the day went on. By nightfall it began to wore off and I was able to sleep like normal. It had no lasting effects like Red Bull or Monster drinks and it tasted real good.  I can see myself buying it again, especially because it has natural and organic ingredients. I would definitely recommend this energy drink to others.

I didn't know what to expect from this drink, what if the flavor was not as strong as other competitors? Or what if the effect was not as strong or at least the same? But having the promise that it is a natural product, and non-GMO why not giving it a chance? 
The result? It is great! As long as you drink it cold it is very refreshing, the flavor is delicious, and it really gives you a boost of energy, perfect for those moments when you need help to stay awake. Even when I got my coupon to get a free drink, I noticed the price is not that high, making it an even better option.

I just tried the regular version of the Guru Organic Energy drink and it was quite good. The flavor was sort of similar to a very mild grapefruit flavor. I do feel energized, but I don't feel ill like some energy drinks can make you feel. Guru is refreshing and reading the ingredients the first thing I see is sparkling water. There is nothing chemical or strange in this drink. I would definitely switch over to this from the other drinks I have tried. If you want something light, refreshing, and tasty pick one of these up!

This product worked so well for my energy level. I was dead drag button tired when I drank it and felt steady energy all day. I would give a higher score, but whoo that aftertaste was something else; however it's nothing unbearable, just a slight bitterness. The drink itself is sweet though, the bitterness only comes after. My husband will probably stick to his normal energy drink, but I like this one myself.

For a natural energy drink, Guru was great. I liked that I knew what I was putting in my body and that the lite version of this drink only has 5 calories. However, I don't feel like it amped me up as much as a "regular" energy drink. It was a great substitute for my morning coffee, but I wouldn't rely on it for an all-nighter.

I work hard and I play hard, so sometimes I need a pick-me-up.  Some energy drinks taste terrible, some have crazy ingredients, and some help for a little bit then make me crash, or don't help at all.  Guru was great all around.  The flavor was pretty good, the energy increase was noticeable, and the ingredients were natural.  I would definitely buy it again!

This drink tasted quite nice, almost like berries, and definitely better than a conventional energy drink. I drank it 6 hours into my work shift and I'm still up and running 10 hours later, and I've been awake for 17 hours total.  I would buy this if it were on sale, but other natural energy drinks are consistently cheaper. I would absolutely recommend this product to a friend or customer.

As a monster fanatic and a diabetic I am always happy to try new energy drinks that will give me the energy I need without the sugar that I don't need. Guru is a great substitute for the sugary/no sugar energy drinks. I love the fact that it is sweetened with Stevia and uses natural ingredients for the boost of energy you might need mid day or early morning.

This is a great way to boost up your energy without any harmful chemicals of other energy drinks. I drank it early in the morning and it immediately gave me a boost of energy, like a cup of coffee usually does, and I did not feel a crash throughout the day. It lasts a good 10-12 hours, by the time I was ready for bed I slept soundly, definitely a great product!

This was a surprisingly pleasant beverage. I don't usually like energy drinks. Every now and again I break down and purchase one as an alternative to my usual coffee, but I'm not a big energy drink person. I think of them as having a rather off taste and an unpleasant effect on my heartbeat. This one, surprisingly, seemed to have neither of those. It was fresh tasting if you can believe it, and I found myself actually enjoying the flavor instead of merely tolerating it. The one detractor is that it did not seem to supply quite the same kick as a normal energy drink. The energy it did supply, however, came without heart palpitations or other unfortunate side effects, and for that I am quite grateful! I may not buy it often, but next time I reach for an energy drink I'll definitely reach for guru and I will not hesitate to suggest it to friends.

I'm glad that I was able to try this. It's honestly not to bad if you are looking for a more natural energy. But that being said there is some downsides. Natural Guarana has a steady rise of alertness and energy. But also comes with a sudden crash once it's all used up. That's because there are no synthetics that carry the Caffeine. The flavor is mellow yet sharp. Definitely has that "natural" flavor. All in all, it's not a bad drink. Definitely a plus for those looking for non synthetics and wanting natural energy.

I was a big coffee drinker until i realized how much sugar and creamer I was consuming in my 'cup of joe'. I also realized the energy crash later was due to my coffee fix. Discovering Guru was the perfect answer for me! The taste takes a little getting used to, (best ice cold) but the energy boost is just right and I don't seem to have the crash later. My son uses it for work-outs, and my employer and I swear it makes us happy! Also, I have gotten so I like the taste. Please don't ever stop making guru!

Not overpowering like most energy drinks that I buy. This has no B vitamins and doesn't taste like a vitamin B drink. Instead it has a real smooth lite flavor. It has like a light fruit taste, almost like a carbonated flavored water/juice, and is really not too sweet. It taste real unique and is made with all natural ingredients. I like it, I would definitely recommend this product to help support the immune system. #trynatural

I must admit that I am always needing some sort of energy push, and I most definitely can become a connoisseur of energy drinks. Guru Natural Energy Drink came through 100%. The taste was not too sweet, and actually tasted like a flavorful light fruit beverage. Guru was not too heavy and I could feel the pick up immediately. Bottom line is this energy drink is great in taste, gives me the pick up I need, almost immediately, and does not hurt the pocket book, like so many other energy drinks.

So I love the fact that this energy drink is organic. That is the best thing about it.

Some are too sweet or not sweet enough and I think this one was balanced, but that is just my opinion. I liked it but the best things are that its vegan gluten free non gmo and it comes in light for those counting calories

I don't usually drink energy drinks since most are full of ingredients that can do more harm than good.  However, I recently attended an all day training for group fitness and I decided it to try out the GURU natural energy drink  to prepare me for the intense physical activities of the day.  Normally, I am sensitive to caffeine, but I didn't particularly feel any jitters or side effects when I drank GURU natural energy drink.  I liked the taste, which didn't have an aftertaste, as what I would expect...and it kept my energy going throughout the day.  Overall, I enjoyed trying this product out, and like that this is a healthier alternative energy drink than what's on the market.

This actually worked to give me energy. I work in a physically demanding environment, and after 12 hour days, I really just have enough for the commute and then to crash out when I get home. Not so great when I am the primary caretaker of an energetic toddler. Much to my relief, the GURU drink was offered and for me it was a must have.
It actually worked rather well. The taste was smooth and not funky like a lot of energy drinks tend to be. It gave me the energy to keep pushing as I drank it with my break meal. It takes a lot to pep me up, but surprisingly, this did. Kudos!

When taking all factors into consideration this is best energy drink by I've had hands down. The taste is unique, not artificial at all.

When taking all factors into consideration this is best energy drink by I've had hands down. The taste is unique, not artificial at all. The effect is more of a smooth climb with a bonus increase in mental awareness. No initial energy jolt and no hard crash because instead of just caffeine anhydrous, this uses a blend of guarana, ginseng, and gingko biloba for energy., I can easily say that GURU is among the very best. Using natural, organic ingredients (organic, vegan, no gluten, no GMO's) and natural caffeine, GURU manages to be tastier than most of the competition without having to resort a bevy of artificial flavors.I find the taste enjoyable,  It's not too harsh and has refreshing flavor.

I decided to take one after returning from a trip in the afternoon and decided that I wanted to go to yoga that night but wasn’t sure if I had the energy for it. I took it about an hour before going to the gym I ran for 15 minutes and did an hour yoga class.  I was pleasantly surprised at how good it tasted. It had a light sparkling natural taste. I felt really great throughout my workout. I didn’t get this surge or jolt of energy, but I noticed that I didn’t feel tired at all. I also never got the jitters which was my biggest concern. I really like Guru. I'm very impressed.  I would recommend it to any of my friends.

I always try to eat and drink healthy especially when it's organic.   Normally I am not a fan of energy drinks  because of the ingredients that are hard to read and understand.  Since this one was organic,  I enjoyed it more because of the enjoyable taste, unlike other energy drinks. Plus it's healthier and has organic ingredients.

I am use to drinking energy drinks that most are accustom to, but this drink surely surprised me.  I was thinking that this would not be as good as the one I drink mostly.  Do you know that this drink tasted better?  I was pleasantly surprised that this drink was not only great tasting, but gave me the energy that I needed.  I wish I knew about this brand sooner as it seems that I am always the last to know about great products.

I couldn't personally try it due to being pregnant and not having much caffeine, so I gave it to my husband to try. Took him a bit to get use to the flavor. He's use red bull and monster. I got him the original and it seemed to give him great energy. Will buy more for his long and early work days. We got the original since my husband hates anything "lite". I look forward to having one later.

I'm so glad I found this energy drink. I can so appreciate that it does not include horrible sweeteners like aspertame or splenda. I also prefer the taste of the drink over the taste of Monster or Rockstar. I also really love that it doesn't give me the jitters that those other popular drinks do. I felt the energy, but it was a smooth increase of energy...not something that made me feel sick or anxious. I would totally recommend.

I appreciated the chance to try this drink. It's great to have a healthier organic alternative without the additives & artificial flavours that are part of many energy drinks.  I found it very refreshing, with just enough sweetness. It did increase my energy somewhat without making me feel overly amped up. I also love that it's vegan & non-GMO. The only reason that I wouldn't buy it as frequently is because I found the taste a little strong, but it's a good product that I plan to drink occasionally.

I really loved this product, I am a huge fan of energy drinks. Most conventional ones contain so many terrible ingredients, so it's kind of hard to justify purchasing them. It took a while for me to get a hold of this product since the store is a bit far, I wish they sold this in more locations. I really enjoyed it, it was sweet; but not overwhelming need water feel. It was very smooth and fizzy, and it didn't contain stevia. I usually hate natural organic drinks that contain stevia since they give me a headache; this product didn't do that. I enjoyed every minute of it and didn't want it to end. I would completely recommend this to everyone, I will purchase it on occasion since it's a bit higher in price; although I can justify paying higher for a healthier alternative. Overall I was beyond impressed, I was very surprised by the quality; I truly enjoyed it.

Ive never tried an organic energy drink before. I liked that it was low in calories and was a natural energy drink. I liked that it didnt make me crash because the caffeine was naturally occurring.

I purchased the original 12 oz Guru . I had to purchase the original due to the sweetener used in the lite. This energy drink had a great taste to it .

I drank this on a day when I had no coffee and it did the job of my coffee .

Sometimes even the healthiest and most conscious of foodies wants to imbibe in a 'naughty' energy drink in a can,   Really cool that Guru has an organic alternative.

I have tried many different energy drinks in the past & Guru fits right in with the rest of them. The plus side is that this did not taste any different than non natural products. Bubbly with a smooth flavor. I felt awake after drinking it without having any of the "bloated" feeling afterward that some dinks leave me feeling. Overall I was very pleased and would recommend especially if you only want to drink natural energy drinks.
