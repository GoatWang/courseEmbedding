Item #: MPR-715F-PA


		The MPR Series Biomedical Refrigerator and Freezer Combinations from Panasonic are designed for specific vaccine and biological storage applications, making them ideal for clinics, hospitals, pharmacies, clinical labs, and medical offices. The MPR-715F-PA combines high performance refrigeration with advanced control and alarm monitoring systems as well as energy efficient and cost-effective cabinet design. All housed within one unit, the refrigerator uses fan-forced air circulation (cycle defrost) to keep the inner refrigerated cabinet at an average temperature of +4°C while the freezer uses direct cooling (manual defrost) to cool the inner freezer cabinet down to temperatures as low as -30°C. This space-saving refrigerator with freezer features two separate compressors (one for each section), a microprocessor controller, two access ports (one for each section), casters, remote alarm contacts, and key locks. The MPR Series Biomedical Refrigerator and Freezer Combos have all the right features for even the strictest applications including: advanced temperature controls, precise uniformity, temperature stability, energy savings, and accurate alarms and monitoring.

		 

		 

Product Features:


			Refrigeration Systems: Separate refrigeration systems and compressors allow differential control of individual refrigerator and freezer compartments. The freezer system maintains temperatures as low as -30°C, while the refrigerator system allows for temperatures between 2°C to 8°C.

			Cycle Defrost: Unique cycle defrost (refrigerator only) initiates only as required and maintains internal temperature uniformity without fluctuations

			Microprocessor Controls: Comprehensive set point, alarm, monitoring and diagnostic functions are maintained by Panasonic-built microprocessor controller with digital display of all critical functions.

			Validated Storage: MPR refrigeration systems are designed to meet regulatory guidelines for vaccine and biologicals storage. Therefore, it assures product safety during storage
