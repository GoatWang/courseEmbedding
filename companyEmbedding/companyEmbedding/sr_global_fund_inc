	SR Global Fund Inc. - Change in Portfolio Manager







06/08/2010 16:18

RNS Number : 7102Q SR Global Fund Inc. 06 August 2010  

STOCK EXCHANGE ANNOUNCEMENT
 
For Immediate Release                                                                         06 August 2010
 
SR GLOBAL FUND INC.
 
 
Re. Announcement of Change in Portfolio Manager on the Class A and Class F Europe Portfolios
 
The Directors of SR Global Fund Inc. (the "Company") wish to announce that after nearly 10 years managing the Europe portfolios at Sloane Robinson LLP (the "Investment Manager") Rupert Dyson has decided to take a break from the investment industry and has tendered his resignation. Rupert has contributed significantly to the results of the Class A and Class F Europe portfolios over this period and the Board would like to thank him for his endeavours. 
 
The Investment Manager has promoted two senior European analysts, Michael Hufton (as lead) and Nathan Wong, to become co-managers on the Europe portfolios going forward. They have worked closely with Rupert since joining, but will seek to employ their own management style which will include a focus upon larger and more liquid stocks, a concentration of ideas (typically 30-35 names) and a more active approach to balance sheet management (favouring cash as the first line of defence in periods of uncertainty).
 
The biographies of Michael and Nathan follow;
 
Michael Hufton joined Sloane Robinson in 2008.  Michael began his career in 1995 at Cazenove & Co working in European Equity Sales and was made a partner in 2001.  In 2003, he joined Bruce Nelson Capital, a London-based global long/short and long-only manager, as a partner, European portfolio manager and analyst.  Michael graduated from Durham University with a degree in French and Spanish. 
 
Nathan Wong, CFA, joined Sloane Robinson in July 2007 with a pan-European remit. Nathan started his career in 2000 at Deloitte in banking and financial services. In 2004, he joined Merrill Lynch as an equity analyst covering European speciality/other finance companies. Nathan graduated from Imperial College, London, with a first class degree in mathematics and is a Chartered Accountant and holder of the Chartered Financial Analyst designation. 
 
Should you have any questions regarding this change or would like an opportunity to meet with the new management team then please do not hesitate to contact David Gale at Sloane Robinson LLP (david@sloanerobinson.com).

SR Global Fund Inc.

Appointment of Additional Pri
RNS Number : 1692E SR Global Fund Inc. 24 September 2008  
﻿
    


STOCK EXCHANGE ANNOUNCEMENT

For Immediate Release    23 September 2008

SR Global Fund Inc.

Re: Appointment of Additional Prime Broker to SR Global Fund L.P.
and Appointment of Prime Broker to SR Global (Delaware) LLC

Appointment of Additional Prime Broker to SR Global Fund L.P.

The Directors of SR Global Fund Inc. (the 'Company') wish to announce that, with effect from on or about 19 September 2008, Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Limited has been appointed as an additional prime broker to SR Global Fund L.P. (the 'Partnership').

The allocation of assets between the prime brokers will be determined, amongst other things, by the nature and type of transaction.

Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Limited ('Credit Suisse'), a subsidiary of the Credit Suisse Group and based in London, will provide prime brokerage services to the Partnership.

These services may include the provision to the Partnership of margin financing, clearing, settlement, stock lending and foreign exchange facilities. The Partnership may also utilise Credit Suisse, other members of the Credit Suisse group (collectively the 'Credit Suisse Entities') and other brokers and dealers for the purposes of executing transactions for the Partnership. 

Credit Suisse:

(a)    is authorised and regulated by the Financial Services Authority (the 'FSA') in the conduct of its investment business; and

(b)    satisfies the Financial Resources Requirement (as defined below).

Credit Suisse's ultimate parent company, the Credit Suisse Group, satisfies the Specified Credit Rating Requirement (as defined below).

As security for the payment and discharge of all liabilities of the Partnership to Credit Suisse Entities all investments of the Partnership held by Credit Suisse in its capacity as custodian ('Assets') are subject to a security interest (the 'Security Interest') in favour of Credit Suisse (which Credit Suisse also holds as trustee for the benefit of the Credit Suisse Entities). In relation to any particular market or jurisdiction, Credit Suisse may, at its discretion, acting in good faith, instead of holding Assets in custody, take full legal and beneficial ownership of such Assets ('Specified Assets'). Credit Suisse will notify the Partnership as soon as practicable of the relevant markets or jurisdictions and will give the Partnership reasonable cooperation if the Partnership seeks to hold such Assets on a different basis. All right, title and interest in any Specified Assets delivered or transferred to Credit Suisse will pass to Credit Suisse free of all liens, charges and encumbrances and Credit Suisse (or where applicable, its affiliate) will be obliged to return equivalent assets. Any such Specified Assets transferred to Credit Suisse in this manner will not be segregated from other investments belonging to Credit Suisse and may be available to the creditors of Credit Suisse in the event of its insolvency. 

Assets held by Credit Suisse will be credited to an account, the title of which will make it clear that any Assets credited to that account belong to the Partnership (subject to the Security Interest) and any such account will be separate from any account in which Credit Suisse holds its own assets. Credit Suisse intends to pool Assets and is entitled to treat them as fungible with assets of the same description of its other customers and at any time to allocate equivalent assets to the Partnership. Credit Suisse may hold Assets in registrable form in the name of a nominee controlled by it, or a nominee which is controlled by a recognised or designated investment exchange, or an eligible custodian, or in the name of a Credit Suisse Entity, or in the name of the Partnership or in the name of any other person in accordance with the Partnership's written instructions. However, where, due to the nature of the law or market practice of jurisdictions outside the United Kingdom, it is in the Partnership's best interests so to do or it is not feasible to do otherwise, Assets may be registered in the name of Credit Suisse or an eligible custodian. Any such Assets which are held in the name of Credit Suisse may not be segregated from Credit Suisse's own investments and, as a result, in the event of default of Credit Suisse, may not be as well protected from claims made on behalf of the general creditors of Credit Suisse.

Any Assets may be sold, borrowed, lent or otherwise used by Credit Suisse and its affiliates for their own purposes provided that Credit Suisse will only sell, borrow, lend or otherwise use Assets the dollar equivalent value of which does not exceed an amount equal to 140% of the dollar equivalent of the Partnership's obligations under the relevant Prime Brokerage Agreement as reasonably and in good faith determined by Credit Suisse, in which event the Partnership will have a right against Credit Suisse for the return of assets equivalent to the Assets so used. To the extent so used, any such Assets will not be segregated from other assets belonging to Credit Suisse or the relevant affiliate and may be available to creditors of Credit Suisse or, where applicable, its affiliate, in the event of its insolvency. 

Credit Suisse may employ custodians and sub-custodians (which may include Credit Suisse Entities) ('Sub-Custodians') on such terms as it sees fit. Credit Suisse will use reasonable skill, care and diligence in the selection of a suitable Sub-Custodian and will be responsible to the Partnership for the duration of the sub-custody agreement for satisfying itself as to the ongoing suitability of the Sub-Custodian to provide services to the Partnership. Credit Suisse will maintain an appropriate level of supervision over any Sub-Custodian for the duration of any such appointment and will make appropriate enquiries periodically to confirm that the obligations of such Sub-Custodian continue to be competently discharged. Credit Suisse will be responsible and liable for the solvency, acts or omissions of any Sub-Custodian which is an affiliate of Credit Suisse, or nominee company controlled by, Credit Suisse, but not of any other Sub-Custodian save to the extent that any loss arises directly from the fraud, wilful default or negligence of Credit Suisse or its affiliate in appointing any such Sub-Custodian.

Any cash which Credit Suisse holds or receives on the Partnership's behalf will be treated by Credit Suisse as client money and will be subject to the protections conferred by the FSA client money rules. As a consequence, Credit Suisse will hold client money in a client bank account at an approved bank within the meaning of the client money rules.

The Partnership has agreed to indemnify Credit Suisse and its affiliates for any direct loss, claim, damage or expense arising out of, inter alia, the proper performance by Credit Suisse and its affiliates of services for the Partnership under the Credit Suisse Prime Brokerage Agreements and any breach by the Partnership of any provision of the Credit Suisse Prime Brokerage Agreements, save where any such loss, claim, damage or expense arises from the negligence, fraud or wilful default of Credit Suisse or the relevant affiliate.

The appointment of Credit Suisse will continue unless and until terminated by either party upon 30 calendar days' written notice. Upon such notice becoming effective, Credit Suisse may refuse to settle any transactions for the Partnership and the Partnership shall, subject to the discharge of its obligations to Credit Suisse, instruct Credit Suisse to transfer its assets elsewhere. 

Credit Suisse receives such fees as may be agreed with the Partnership from time to time at normal commercial rates.

Credit Suisse is a service provider to the Partnership and is not responsible for the preparation of this document or the activities of the Partnership and therefore accepts no responsibility for any information contained in this document. Credit Suisse is not an investment or other adviser to the Partnership and will not participate in the investment decision-making process.

The Partnership reserves the right to change the arrangements described above by agreement with Credit Suisse and/or, in its discretion, to appoint additional or alternative prime broker(s) and custodian(s).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

ObjectiveSeeking absolute returns, the SR Global Fund (Class G) Emerging portfolio is a long/short directional equity hedge portfolio with a typical net long bias. The widest possible view of emerging markets within the portfolio is adopted, including Latin America, Asia, Eastern Europe, Africa and the Commonwealth of Independent States. The approach is based on the identification of mispriced investment opportunities and the establishment of investable themes. When considered appropriate, the portfolio is enhanced with derivative overlays for hedging and investment purposes. Significant emphasis is placed on the use of cash for capital preservation purposes. A key feature of the portfolio construction process is the focus on continual risk monitoring and control.More ▼FT Lexicon{0}{0}{2}{0}{0}{2}For more information, visit the FT LexiconLexicon on this pageExplore our toolsAlertsData archivePortfolioWorld marketsEquities screenerFunds overview
