NEW YORK, June 12, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- J.Crew Group, Inc. (the "Company") today announced financial results for the three months ended April 29, 2017.








First Quarter highlights: 

Total revenues decreased 6% to $532.0 million. Comparable company sales decreased 9% following a decrease of 7% in the first quarter last year. 
J.Crew sales decreased 11% to $428.5 million. J.Crew comparable sales decreased 12% following a decrease of 8% in the first quarter last year. 
Madewell sales increased 17% to $84.7 million. Madewell comparable sales increased 10% following an increase of 6% in the first quarter last year. 
Gross margin was 35.4% compared to 36.1% in the first quarter last year. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $210.4 million, or 39.6% of revenues, compared to $192.2 million, or 33.9% of revenues in the first quarter last year. 
Operating loss was $153.3 million compared with operating income of $7.3 million in the first quarter last year. The operating loss includes (i) pre-tax, non-cash impairment charges of $131.2 million and (ii) a charge of $10.7 million for severance and related costs associated with the Company's workforce reduction in April 2017. Operating income last year includes pre-tax, non-cash impairment charges of $5.4 million. 
Net loss was $123.3 million compared to a net loss of $8.0 million in the first quarter last year. The net loss this year reflects the impact of (i) the non-cash impairment charges and (ii) the charge for severance and related costs. The net loss last year reflects the impact of non-cash impairment charges. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $26.6 million compared to $45.4 million in the first quarter last year. An explanation of the manner in which the Company uses adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation to GAAP measures are included in Exhibit (3).

Millard Drexler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "While we are disappointed with our first quarter earnings, we are optimistic regarding the work we have underway to improve our business. We have a clear vision and action plan in place to meet our customers' needs - wherever and however they choose to shop. I look forward to transitioning my role to chairman and to working with our new CEO, Jim Brett, as he takes the reins in July and continues to position J.Crew for long term success." 
Balance Sheet highlights: 

Cash and cash equivalents were $104.6 million compared to $54.7 million at the end of the first quarter last year. 
Total debt, net of discount and deferred financing costs, was $1,503 million compared to $1,515 million at the end of the first quarter last year. There were no outstanding borrowings under the ABL Facility at April 29, 2017 or April 30, 2016. As of the date of this release, there were no outstanding borrowings under the ABL Facility with excess availability of approximately $320 million. 
Inventories were $325.0 million compared to $391.4 million at the end of the first quarter last year. Inventories decreased 17% and inventories per square foot decreased 19% compared to the end of the first quarter last year. 

First Quarter Impairment
During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $129.8 million related to the intangible asset for the J.Crew trade name. After recording the impairment charge in the first quarter, the carrying value of the J.Crew trade name was $250.2 million at April 29, 2017. If operating results decline below the Company's current expectations, additional impairment charges may be recorded in the future.
This impairment charge does not have an effect on the Company's operations, liquidity or financial covenants, and does not change management's long-term strategy, which includes its plans to drive disciplined growth across its brands.
Guidance
In light of the announcement today regarding the Company's efforts to enhance its capital structure, the Company is providing certain updates to its fiscal 2017 Adjusted EBITDA guidance. Investors should not expect the Company to provide interim quarterly updates of guidance or outlook in conjunction with quarterly earnings reports and conference calls in the future. The Company undertakes no obligation to update guidance in the future, and its decision not to update such information should not be understood to be an affirmation of past guidance.  
The Company previously provided guidance that Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2017 was expected to be in the range of $190 million to $210 million, which includes an anticipated $50 million benefit driven primarily by lower product costs and other efficiencies in connection with its strategic sourcing and supply chain initiative. The Company continues to believe, despite its first quarter performance, that its prior guidance range is achievable.
Announcement Regarding Capital Structure Efforts
Today the Company announced that it has reached agreement with certain holders of PIK Notes that also hold a portion of loans under the Term Loan Facility to conduct a series of transactions to enhance its capital structure. For further information regarding these potential transactions, the Company refers you to the publicly filed Form 8-K and other public information it is releasing concurrently with this release.
Related Party
On November 4, 2013, Chinos Intermediate Holdings A, Inc. (the "Issuer"), an indirect parent holding company of the Company, issued $500 million aggregate principal of 7.75/8.50% Senior PIK Toggle Notes due May 1, 2019 (the "PIK Notes"). 
The PIK Notes are (i) senior unsecured obligations of the Issuer, (ii) structurally subordinated to all of the liabilities of the Issuer's subsidiaries, and (iii) not guaranteed by any of the Issuer's subsidiaries, and therefore are not recorded in the financial statements of the Company. 
On April 28, 2017, the Issuer delivered notice to U.S. Bank N.A., as trustee, under the indenture governing the PIK Notes, that with respect to the interest that will be due on such notes on the November 1, 2017 interest payment date, the Issuer will make such interest payment by paying in kind at the PIK interest rate of 8.50% instead of paying in cash. The PIK election will increase the outstanding principal balance of the PIK Notes by $24.1 million to $590.6 million. Therefore, the Company will not pay a dividend to the Issuer in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 to fund a semi-annual interest payment. Pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the PIK Notes, the Issuer intends to evaluate this option prior to the beginning of each interest period based on relevant factors at that time. 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
This announcement includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. An explanation of the manner in which the Company uses adjusted EBITDA and an associated reconciliation to GAAP measures is included in Exhibit (3).

The Company presents Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, because it uses such measure to: (i) monitor the performance of its business, (ii) evaluate its liquidity, and (iii) determine levels of incentive compensation. The Company believes the presentation of this measure will enhance the ability of its investors to analyze trends in its business, evaluate its performance relative to other companies in the industry, and evaluate its ability to service debt. 
Adjusted EBITDA is not a presentation made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and therefore, differences may exist in the manner in which other companies calculate this measure. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to (i) net income, as a measure of operating performance, or (ii) cash flows, as a measure of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation to, or as a substitute for, analysis of the Company's results as measured in accordance with GAAP.

J.Crew - About Us
















We side with style over fashion, think 
timelessness is underrated and find that clothes look 
best when they’re lived in. We love color-
blocking and pattern mixing and temper
tomboy with heels. We’re fans of tousled
hair and think everything’s right when something’s left
just a little imperfect. We wear sneakers with
suits, wing tips with jeans and chambray on chambray.
We don’t believe there’s such a thing
as overdressed—and we don’t rent tuxedos.
we’re an American brand, but we source
fabrics from around the world: Japanese seersucker,
Irish linen and Italian wool. We don’t believe
there’s just one way to wear an outfit,
but we do have a few ideas on how to pull one together.
for us, the magic is in the mix.

NEW YORK, June 12, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- J.Crew Group, Inc. (the "Company") today announced that J.Crew Brand, LLC ("BrandCo") and J.Crew Brand Corp. ("BrandCorp" and, together with BrandCo, the "New Notes Co-Issuers"), both indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company, and Chinos Holdings, Inc., the ultimate parent of the Company ("Parent" and, collectively with the New Notes Co-Issuers, the "New Securities Issuers"), have commenced a private offer (such offer, the "Exchange Offer") to certain eligible noteholders described below to exchange any and all of the outstanding $566.5 million aggregate principal amount of 7.75%/8.50% Senior PIK Toggle Notes due 2019 (CUSIP Nos 16961UAA4 and U1680U AA3, ISIN Nos US16961UAA43 and USU1680UAA35) (the "Old Notes") issued by Chinos Intermediate Holdings A, Inc., a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (the "Old Notes Issuer"), for newly issued: 
(i) 13% Senior Secured Notes due 2021 to be issued by the New Notes Co-Issuers in an aggregate principal amount of up to $250 million (the "New Notes" and, together with the New Guarantees (as defined herein), the "New Debt Securities"), 
(ii) shares of Parent's 7% non-convertible perpetual preferred stock, series A, no par value per share, with an aggregate initial liquidation preference of up to $190,000,000 (the "New Series A Preferred Stock") and 
(iii) shares of Parent's class A common stock, $0.00001 par value per share (the "Class A Common Stock" and, collectively with the New Series A Preferred Stock and the New Debt Securities, the "New Securities"), representing up to approximately 15% of the common equity of Parent, in each case, upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Confidential Offering Memorandum and Consent Solicitation Statement, dated June 12, 2017 (the "Offering Memorandum").








The purpose of the Exchange Offer is to refinance the Old Notes to reduce the consolidated indebtedness of Parent and its subsidiaries and to extend the average maturity thereof. The Exchange Offer is conditioned on a minimum of 95% of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of Old Notes being validly tendered, not withdrawn and accepted in the Exchange Offer.  This condition may not be waived without the consent of certain holders of outstanding Old Notes and their affiliates that also hold a portion of term loans under the Term Loan Facility (as defined below) (such holders, the "Ad Hoc Creditors").
Eligible holders who validly tender their Old Notes in the Exchange Offer prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on June 23, 2017 (such date and time, as it may be extended, the "Early Deadline") and do not validly withdraw their tender prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on June 23, 2017 (such date and time, as it may be extended, the "Withdrawal Deadline") will receive the Total Exchange Consideration.  "Total Exchange Consideration" means, for each $1,000 principal amount of Old Notes validly tendered, not withdrawn and accepted by the New Securities Issuers:
(i) $441.308013 principal amount of New Notes (which includes the "Early Tender Payment" of $40 principal amount of New Notes per $1,000 principal amount of Old Notes tendered), 
(ii) $335.394 initial liquidation preference (0.335394 shares) of New Series A Preferred Stock, and 
(iii) 30.695204 shares of Class A Common Stock, in each case subject to rounding.
Eligible holders who validly tender and do not validly withdraw Old Notes in the Exchange Offer after the Early Deadline, but prior to 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on July 10, 2017 (such date and time, as it may be extended, the "Expiration Time"), will receive the "Exchange Consideration," which is the Total Exchange Consideration less the Early Tender Payment for Old Notes accepted in the Exchange Offer. The "Settlement Date" is expected to be three business days after the Expiration Time, but in no event later than the fifth business day following the Expiration Time. Holders whose Old Notes are accepted in the Exchange Offer will not receive additional consideration in respect of any accrued and unpaid interest on such Old Notes from and including the last interest payment date on such Old Notes to, but not including, the Settlement Date. The New Notes will mature on September 15, 2021, bear interest at a rate of 13% per annum, payable semi-annually in cash in arrears, and will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed as to payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest, jointly and severally, on a senior secured basis, by J. Crew Brand Intermediate, LLC, the direct parent of BrandCo ("Parent Guarantor"), J. Crew Domestic Brand, LLC ("IPCo") and J. Crew International Brand, LLC (together with IPCo, the "Subsidiary Guarantors"), each of which is an indirect domestic subsidiary of the Company (each, a "Guarantor" and collectively, the "Guarantors").  The guarantees of the Guarantors are collectively referred to herein as the "New Guarantees." BrandCorp, the corporate co-issuer of the New Notes, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of BrandCo, has no assets and is not expected to have any cash flow to apply to payments on the New Notes.
The New Debt Securities will be secured (subject to permitted liens under the indenture governing the New Notes (the "New Notes Indenture")) by (a) first-priority liens on (i) the Initial Transferred IP (as defined below), (ii) IPCo's rights under the Intellectual Property License Agreement that IPCo entered into on December 6, 2016 with J.Crew International, Inc., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ("JCI"), and J.Crew Operating Corp., a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ("OpCo") (solely in its capacity as payor on behalf of JCI), pursuant to which JCI transferred a 72.04% undivided interest in certain of its U..S. intellectual property assets (the "Initial Transferred IP") to IPCo (such agreement, as will be amended and restated concurrently with the settlement of the Exchange Offer, the "A&R IP License Agreement"), (iii) a pledge of 100% of the equity interests of the New Notes Co-Issuers and the Subsidiary Guarantors, including IPCo (the "IP Group Pledge"), and (iv) substantially all other assets of the New Notes Co-Issuers and the Guarantors (including (x) any cash held by the New Notes Co-Issuers or any of the Guarantors, (y) certain intercompany loans described in the Offering Memorandum and (z) any Old Notes validly tendered, not withdrawn and accepted in the Exchange Offer, which will not be cancelled but will continue to be held by BrandCo, subject to the terms of the New Notes Indenture) (collectively, the "Other IP Group Assets"); and, in the event the Term Loan Transactions (as defined below), are completed, (b) second-priority liens on (i) the Additional Transferred IP (as defined below) and (ii) IPCo's rights under the new Intellectual Property Agreement that IPCo will enter into on the Settlement Date with JCI and OpCo (solely in its capacity as payor on behalf of JCI) substantially in the form of the A&R IP License Agreement (the "Additional IP License Agreement"). 
IPCo's assets currently consist solely of (i) the Initial Transferred IP, consisting of certain U.S. intellectual property rights currently used by the Company and its subsidiaries in the conduct of their business and (ii) its rights under the A&R IP License Agreement. Pursuant to the A&R IP License Agreement, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries will continue to exclusively use the Transferred IP (as defined below) and OpCo, on behalf of JCI, will pay to IPCo a fixed license fee of $42.5 million per annum or, in the event Term Loan Transactions are completed and the Additional IP License Agreement entered into, an aggregate of $59.0 million per annum, payable semi-annually.
Parent will pay, to the extent of lawfully available funds, cash dividends on the New Series A Preferred Stock, when, as and if declared by Parent's board of directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof).  Dividends on the New Series A Preferred Stock will be cumulative and accrue from the Settlement Date at a rate of 7% per annum, payable at a rate of 5% per annum in cash and 2% per annum through an increase in liquidation preference, in each case, semiannually, in arrears, on September 15 and March 15 of each year, commencing on September 15, 2017.
Equity Recapitalization
Subject to the closing of the Exchange Offer, and concurrently therewith, a majority in interest of the current holders of Parent's Class L Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Class L Common Stock"), including TPG Capital, L.P. (together with its affiliates, "TPG") and Leonard Green & Partners, L.P. (together with its affiliates, "LGP" and, together with TPG, the "Sponsors"), will elect to convert all the outstanding shares of Class L Common Stock into (i) 110,000 shares of Parent's 7% non-convertible perpetual preferred stock, Series B, no par value, with an initial liquidation preference of $1,000 per share ($110 million aggregate initial liquidation preference) that will be pari passu with the New Series A Preferred Stock (the "New Series B Preferred Stock"), and (ii) 95,350,555.66 shares of Parent's Class A Common Stock (collectively, the "Recapitalization"). 
Dividends on the New Series B Preferred Stock will accrue from the Settlement Date at a rate of 7% per annum, semi-annually, in arrears, on September 15 and March 15 of each year, commencing on September 15, 2017.  After distributions have been made on the New Series B Preferred Stock that equal the liquidation preference thereof and all accrued dividends thereon, the holders of the New Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, in the aggregate, approximately 3% of the sum of any distributions made in respect of Class A Common Stock.
In connection with the Recapitalization, the Principal Investors Stockholders' Agreement, dated as of March 7, 2011, among Parent, the Old Notes Issuer, Chinos Intermediate Holdings B, Inc., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Intermediate Holdings B"), the Company, the Sponsors and the other stockholders party thereto, will be amended and restated to provide that the holders of the Class A Common Stock will be subject to certain rights and obligations as set forth in greater detail therein.
In connection with the Exchange Offer, the Company intends to implement a new management incentive plan, pursuant to which it is expected that certain officers and employees of the Company will be entitled to receive equity awards of up to 10% of the Class A Common Stock outstanding after the Exchange Offer and up to $20 million in initial liquidation preference of additional New Series B Preferred Stock of Parent. The Class A Common Stock component of the new management incentive plan will dilute all holders of the Class A Common Stock. Any additional New Series B Preferred Stock will be in addition to the New Series B Preferred Stock. 
The Proposed Term Loan Transactions
Concurrently with the Exchange Offer, the Company is seeking to amend its Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of March 5, 2014 (the "Term Loan Agreement"), by and among, inter alios, the Company, Intermediate Holdings B, Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB, as Administrative Agent (the "Term Loan Agent"), and the Lenders party thereto (such amendment, the "Term Loan Amendment"). 
If requisite consents are received for the Term Loan Amendment, the Company will engage in a series of transactions (the "Term Loan Transactions") concurrently with the settlement of the Exchange Offer, including the purchase of $150 million principal amount of term loans under the Term Loan Agreement held by lenders who consent to the Term Loan Amendment at par plus accrued interest thereon; additional borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement of $30 million principal amount (at a 2% discount), to be provided by new or existing lenders, or in lieu thereof, one or more Sponsors (or affiliates thereof), the net proceeds of which will be applied by the Company to finance the refinancing, redemption or repurchase of term loans referenced above; the issuance of $97 million principal amount of New Private Placement Notes (as defined below) at a 3% discount in a private placement (the "Concurrent Private Placement") pursuant to the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement (as defined below), the proceeds of which will be lent on a subordinated basis by BrandCo to the Company to finance the refinancing, redemption or repurchase of term loans referenced above; the contribution by JCI to IPCo of the remaining undivided 27.96% ownership interest of certain U.S. intellectual property rights  not previously included in the Initial Transferred IP (the "Additional Transferred IP" and, together with the Initial Transferred IP, the "Transferred IP"), in which case, the references herein to the "Transferred IP" will include an aggregate 100% ownership interest in such U.S. intellectual property rights); and a direction to the Term Loan Agent to dismiss, with prejudice, certain litigation relating to the assignment of the Initial Transferred IP (and related matters). 
The Exchange Offer is not conditioned upon approval of the Term Loan Amendment. However, if requisite consents for the Term Loan Amendment are obtained, the settlement of the Exchange Offer will be conditioned upon the completion of the Term Loan Transactions. If the Term Loan Amendment is not approved, the Term Loan Transactions will not be completed, but, if the conditions to the Exchange Offer are satisfied or waived, the Exchange Offer will be consummated.
Restructuring Support Agreement
The Ad Hoc Creditors have entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement (the "RSA"), dated June 12, 2017, with Parent and certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates, pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the Ad Hoc Creditors agreed to take certain actions in support of the Term Loan Transactions, including (i) voting in favor of the Term Loan Amendment as lenders under the Term Loan Agreement; and (ii) if the Term Loan Transactions are consummated, subject to the terms and conditions contained in the Note Purchase Agreement, purchasing an aggregate of $97 million principal amount of the New Private Placement Notes in the Concurrent Private Placement.  In addition, the Ad Hoc Creditors hold approximately 67% of the outstanding Old Notes and have agreed to tender their Old Notes in the Exchange Offer, which contains a 95% minimum tender condition, provided that each Ad Hoc Creditor may withhold or tender in its discretion 3% of the outstanding Old Notes (6% total), and provided further that if one Ad Hoc Creditor tenders any withheld Old Notes in the Exchange Offer, the other Ad Hoc Creditor is required to tender its withheld Old Notes in the Exchange Offer. The agreements and obligations of the Ad Hoc Creditors under the RSA are subject to the conditions, restrictions and provisions contained therein.
Note Purchase Agreement and Concurrent Private Placement
The Company, the New Notes Co-Issuers and the Guarantors have entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (the "Note Purchase Agreement"), dated June 12, 2017, with the Ad Hoc Creditors, pursuant to which, the Ad Hoc Creditors have agreed, in the event the Term Loan Transactions are completed, to purchase $97 million principal amount of an additional series of 13% Senior Secured Notes due 2021 (the "New Private Placement Notes") to be issued by the New Notes Co-Issuers at a 3% discount in the Concurrent Private Placement. The agreements and obligations of the Ad Hoc Creditors under the Note Purchase Agreement are subject to the conditions, restrictions and provisions contained therein.
The New Private Placement Notes will be governed by an indenture substantially in the form of the New Notes Indenture and will also be guaranteed by the Guarantors. In the event the Term Loan Transactions are completed and the New Private Placement Notes are issued in the Concurrent Private Placement, the New Private Placement Notes and the guarantees thereof will be secured (subject to permitted liens under the indenture governing the New Private Placement Notes) by (a) first-priority liens on (i) the Additional Transferred IP, (ii) IPCo's rights under the Additional IP License Agreement, (iii) the IP Group Pledge, and (iv) the Other IP Group Assets; and (b) second-priority liens on (i) the Initial Transferred IP and (ii) IPCo's rights under the A&R IP License Agreement. 
Consent Solicitation
In conjunction with the Exchange Offer, the Old Notes Issuer is soliciting consents (the "Consent Solicitation") from holders of the Old Notes to suspend, subject to certain conditions, substantially all of the covenants, restrictive provisions and events of default under the indenture governing the Old Notes (the "Old Notes Indenture") and provide the Old Notes Issuer, any guarantor under the Old Notes Indenture and any of their respective affiliates, in each case, that holds the Old Notes, with the ability to vote on directions, waivers and consents under the Old Notes Indenture.  The Exchange Offer is conditioned upon the completion of the Consent Solicitation.  The Ad Hoc Creditors have agreed pursuant to the RSA, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to tender Old Notes (and thereby provide consents) with respect to a sufficient principal amount of Old Notes to ensure adoption of the Proposed Amendments, which will become operative only upon completion of the Exchange Offer. Holders who validly tender (and do not validly withdraw) their Old Notes pursuant to the Exchange Offer will be deemed to have delivered their consents pursuant to the Consent Solicitation by such tender. Holders may not deliver consents without tendering their Old Notes, and holders may not tender their Old Notes without delivering consents.
Old Notes subject to the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation may be validly withdrawn at any time on or before the Withdrawal Deadline, but not thereafter, even if the Early Deadline or Expiration Time is extended. The valid withdrawal of tendered Old Notes prior to the Withdrawal Deadline will be deemed to be a concurrent revocation of the corresponding consent.

About J.crew Group, Inc.

J. Crew is rowing in the fast lane. The retailer is known for
its preppy fashions, including jeans, khakis, and other basic (but
pricey) items sold to young professionals through its catalogs,
websites, and nearly 520 retail and factory stores across the US
under the J. Crew, and Madewell banners. Madewell is a women's-only
collection of hip, casual clothes. Outside of the US, the retailer
also boasts 32 stores across Canada, London, Hong Kong, and Paris.
The American retailer sources about 97% of its merchandise from
factories outside of the US, 60% being sourced from China and Hong
Kong. Founded in 1947, the company made its name as a catalog
retailer. Its first physical store appeared in 1989.
Operations
The J. Crew brand (comprising J. Crew Retail and J. Crew
Factory) generates some 85% of total revenue. About 55% of J.
Crew's total sales come from women's apparel sales, while men's and
children's apparel sales generate 25% and over 5% of total sales,
respectively. Accessories brought in the remainder of the
retailer's total sales. J Crew Retail's stores are upscale and
located in high-end regional malls, lifestyle centers, and
on-street locations.
J. Crew Factory stores are located primarily in large outlet
malls and sell a specific line of merchandise tailored after
products sold in the previous season at J. Crew retail stores and
online.
The company's fast-growing Madewell line offers women's apparel,
including a new line of suits, that is priced 20% to 30% lower than
J. Crew merchandise. As at August 2016, the company operated 287 J.
Crew retail stores, 108 Madewell stores, and 170 factory stores,
mostly in the US.
Geographic Reach
New York-based J. Crew boasts some 545 stores in 44 US states
and the District of Columbia, with nearly half of its stores
located across the states of California, New York, Florida, Texas,
Massachusetts, New Jersey, Florida, and Pennsylvania. The US market
accounts for essentially all of the retailer's sales.
Beyond the US, it operates two stores in Paris; 18 stores in
three Canadian provinces (Alberta, British Columbia, and Ontario);
seven stores in London; and four stores in Hong Kong. J. Crew's
e-commerce site is active in 100 countries.
Sales and Marketing
The retailer relies on the J. Crew catalog as the primary
vehicle for marketing and advertising. The catalog, which drives
in-store as well as direct sales, utilizes high-quality photography
and art direction, to burnish the J. Crew brand. The company
typically spends $40-50 million on catalog advertising, the bulk of
its total advertising spend.
Beyond the book, the company relies on online, print, and
outdoor advertising. The retailer also offers a private-label
credit card that accounts for about 15% of its total net sales. The
chain's customers are affluent, college-educated, professional and
style-conscious women and men.


The retailer sources its products either through buying agents
or by purchasing merchandise directly from trading companies and
manufacturers within the US and overseas.
Financial Performance
J. Crew credits its on-target fashion sense and lean inventories
for its strong sales growth in recent years. However, the company
recorded two consecutive years of falls in fiscals 2016 and
2017.
In fiscal 2017, sales fell 3% to $2.4 billion. Comparable sales
fell 7%, with the losses felt entirely in the J. Crew segment.
Women's apparel (specifically knits, shorts, and dresses) and
accessories were the poorest performers in the year. Falls at J.
Crew were partially offset by 14% revenue growth at Madewell, which
raked in $341.6 million.
The company has incurred several years of net losses. In fiscal
2017, net loss narrowed to $23.5 million from an eye-watering $1.24
billion loss the previous year, incurred due to write-downs on its
physical operations. Cash from operations crept up 2% to $137.8
million due to non-cash adjustments.
Strategy
J. Crew is under severe pressure as revenue declines, losses
mount, and competition from online retailers increases. CEO Mickey
Drexler departed in 2017 shortly after creative director Jenna
Lyons. The departures are the two most notable in a larger shakeup
as the company looks to slim down and catch a favorable wind.
J. Crew's directors are also having to deal with its staggering
debt load of around $2 billion. They are aiming to push back a $567
debt repayment due in 2019, giving the company time to return to
profitability and stand a chance of avoiding insolvency.
As well as defensive efforts, the company is working to
modernize, having been left being in terms of online, speed to
market, personalization, and convenience. However, capital
expenditure has fallen from $132 million in 2013 to $80 million in
2017.
J. Crew discontinued its bridal product line in late 2016.
J. Crew has been aggressively expanding its store network across
the US, adding 34 new retail, factory, and Madewell stores in
fiscal 2016 after opening 50 locations during the prior year.
Indeed, from 2012 through 2016, the retailer grew its total store
base by 43%, from 401 to 575 stores. As part of this expansion, J.
Crew has been introducing more of its Madewell and factory stores
for price-sensitive shoppers as consumers have become more thrifty
in recent years.
In an attempt to boost sales, J. Crew has also been expanding
its direct and retail store businesses internationally. The chain
opened its first two J. Crew stores in Paris in 2015, and now has
seven stores in London and four in Hong Kong.

History[edit]
Formation and catalog growth[edit]
In 1947, Mitchell Cinader and Saul Charles founded Popular Merchandise, Inc., a store which did business as Popular Club Plan and sold low-priced women's clothing marketed through in-home demonstrations.[7] Throughout the mid-1980s, sales from catalog operations grew rapidly. "Growth was explosive—25 to 30 percent a year," Cinader later recollected in The New York Times. Annual sales grew from $3 million to more than $100 million over five years.[7] In 1985, the "Clifford & Wills" brand was launched, selling women’s clothing that was more affordable than the Popular Merchandise line.[8] In 1987, two executives left the company to start their own catalog, Tweeds.[9]
The 1980s marked a booming sales period for catalog retail giants Lands' End, Talbots, and L. L. Bean. Popular Merchandise initiated its own catalog operation, focusing on leisurewear for upper-middle-class customers, aiming for a Ralph Lauren look at a much lower price. The first Popular Club Plan catalog was mailed to customers in January 1983 and continued under that name until 1989. Popular Club Plan catalogs often showed the same garment in more than one picture with close-up shots of the fabrics, so customers could get a sense of how the garment looked on the body and be assured of the company's claims of quality.[citation needed]
Name change and first stores[edit]
In 1989, Popular Merchandise, Inc. became known as J.Crew, Inc. The company attempted, but failed to sell the Popular Club Plan brand.[7] Also in 1989, J.Crew opened its first retail store, in South Street Seaport in downtown Manhattan.[10]
J.Crew Group was owned by the Cinader family for most of its existence, but in October 1997 investment firm Texas Pacific Group Inc. purchased a majority stake. By the year 2000, Texas Pacific held an approximate 62 percent stake, a group of J.Crew managers held about 10 percent, and Emily Cinader Woods, the chairman of J.Crew, along with her father, Arthur Cinader, held most of the remainder.[citation needed] The brand Clifford & Wills was sold to Speigel, Inc. in 2000 with the intent to boost sales.[8] In 2004, J.Crew bought the rights to the brand Madewell, a defunct workwear manufacturer founded in 1937, and used the name from 2006 onwards as "a modern-day interpretation", targeted at younger women than their main brand.[11][12][13]
Privatization[edit]




A Madewell store at Easton Town Center in Columbus, Ohio


In 2011, TPG Capital LP and Leonard Green & Partners LP privated J. Crew in a $3 billion leveraged buyout.[1] On November 23, 2010, the company had agreed to be taken private in a $3 billion deal led by management with the backing of TPG Capital and Leonard Green & Partners, two large private equity firms. The announcement of the offer from two investment firms—including one that used to own J.Crew—came as the retailer reported that its third-quarter net income fell by 14 percent due to weak women's clothing sales. The company also lowered its guidance for the 2010 year. Under the deal as proposed, J.Crew shareholders would receive $43.50 per share in cash, representing a 16 percent premium to the stock's closing price the prior day of $37.65. CEO Mickey Drexler, the former Gap Inc. chief credited with turning J.Crew around since coming aboard in 2003, remained in that role and retained a "significant" stake in the company (as of September 2010, he holds 5.4% of outstanding shares). TPG, one of the investment firms in the deal, took a majority stake in J.Crew Group Inc. in 1997 and remained majority shareholder until the company went public in 2006.[14]
Shortly after the announcement of the deal, some in the business community criticized the terms of the deal involving the company's CEO and a majority shareholder.[15] As a result, the "go-shop" period was extended shortly after the initial announcement.[16] In addition, several investigations relating to potential shareholder actions against the company were announced.[17] After the deal, TPG and Leonard Green borrowed more to help finance dividends totaled $787 million to them.[1]
Recent[edit]
In June 2015, The New York Times reported that J. Crew's women's division was undergoing a slump because of the company's failure to react to two market trends: cheap "fast fashion" and "athleisure" items.[18] In 2016, J.Crew partnered with Nordstrom to begin selling their products in stores and online.[19] In December 2016, the company faced litigation after it moved its intellectual property "out of the reach of lenders."[20]
In April 2017, the company cut 250 jobs, largely from its headquarters.[20] The company also underwent several management changes, and long-term creative director Jenna Lyons left the company in April.[21] The brand’s longtime head of menswear left the company that month as well,[22] and in June 2017, the company's CEO, Mickey Drexler, announced that he would later be stepping down as CEO role after 14 years with the company.[23] Drexler announced he would stay on as chairman and still own 10% of the company.[24] On June 12, 2017, J.Crew Group Inc. announced it had "made an offer to some of its bondholders to push back its most pressing debt obligation—about $567 million due in May 2019—and amend its term loan." At the time, J.Crew Group had around $2 billion in debt.[20]
Retail stores[edit]




J.Crew at South Shore Plaza
in Braintree, Massachusetts


The company operates 575 retail stores, including 281 J.Crew stores, 113 Madewell stores, and 181 J.Crew Factory (including 39 J.Crew Mercantile) outlet locations, as reported in 2017.[1] The company also operates internationally in Canada, France, UK, China, and Korea. Additionally, the company has 76 locations in Japan, which are operated under license by ITOCHU Corporation.[citation needed]
In March 1989, the first J.Crew retail outlet opened in the South Street Seaport in Manhattan, and the company planned to open 45 more stores. Five months after the opening of its first store, J.Crew added two new catalog lines: "Classics" and "Collections." "Collections" used more complicated designs and finer fabrics to create dressier and more expensive items, while "Classics" featured clothes that could be worn both to work and for leisure activities.[citation needed] In the fall of 1989, J.Crew opened three new stores in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts; San Francisco, California; and Costa Mesa, California, all locations with strong catalog sales. By the end of the year, retail sales nearly hit $10 million.[citation needed] Despite 1989, revenues that year were estimated at $320 million, J.Crew suffered a setback when its agreement to sell its Popular Club unit collapsed at the end that year. In addition, rumors circulated that the company’s Clifford & Wills low-priced women's apparel catalog was doing poorly.[citation needed]
J.Crew saw revenues reach $400 million in 1990 but reported that its four existing stores had not yet started producing enough profits to cover their overheads. The next phase of store openings included outlets in Philadelphia, Cambridge, and Portland. The company scaled back its plans for opening retail stores from 45 stores to 30 or 35.[citation needed] In early 1991 the company hired a director of new marketing development and began efforts to expand their sales into Canada. In April 1991, J.Crew mailed 75,000 J.Crew catalogs and 60,000 Clifford & Wills catalogs to potential customers in the province of Ontario. Response rates to this effort were slightly lower than in the United States, but each order, on average, was higher.[citation needed] In 1992, J.Crew intensified its push into international markets by hiring a new vice-president for international development. The company already mailed hundreds of catalogs to customers in Japan and Europe, most of whom had become acquainted with J.Crew while traveling or living in the United States.[citation needed]




J. Crew in Markville Shopping Centre


In 2011, J.Crew opened its first international store in the Yorkdale Shopping Centre in Toronto, Ontario.[25] In 2012, J.Crew announced four new Canadian locations: Edmonton, Alberta in West Edmonton Mall, Vancouver, British Columbia on Robson Street, and Toronto, Ontario in Fairview Mall and the Toronto Eaton Centre. All locations will carry women's and men's collections. Along with 5 new stores, J.Crew announced to opening of two new factory stores in Canada, with one in Vaughan Mills and the other in Edmonton (The second J.Crew in Alberta)[26][27][28] Continuing with its expansion in the Greater Toronto Area, J.Crew opened at Markville Shopping Centre in 2013. In early 2014, J.Crew unveiled its new flagship location in Yorkville, Toronto.[citation needed]
In an interview with the Financial Times in 2011, CEO of J.Crew Mickey Drexler said that J.Crew would be expanding to the U.K. with their flagship store being on London's Regent Street. He indicated that the company would be following up their recent expansion into Canada and Canadian e-commerce with a physical store in England, most likely followed by e-commerce elsewhere, such as France and Germany. Although a few locations were reviewed for the London store, including Covent Garden and the East End, the ultimate decision was to open on Regent Street.[29]
In early 2014, J.Crew announced plans to open brick-and-mortar locations in Asia – to be spearheaded by two establishments in Hong Kong. A women's store is slated to open in the International Finance Centre, while a men's shop is in the works for On Lan Street. Both opened for business in May 2014.[citation needed] By June 2017, J.Crew Group had around 600 stores, including about 460 J.Crew locations.[20]
Marketing[edit]
Each year the company issues 24 editions of the J.Crew catalog, distributing more than 80 million copies.
J.Crew has been criticized for labeling its new super-small jeans as "size 000".,[30] and for advertising them as "toothpick jeans". Critics have said the labeling promotes vanity, a practice known as vanity sizing.[31] The "size 000" is smaller than a size zero and has three zeros, implying that it is two sizes smaller than the smallest normal size. This has caused people to question whether negative sizes will be available in the future,[32] and if the method of labeling should be changed.
In early 2011, J.Crew was under fire by conservative media outlets for an advertisement featuring its creative director and president, Jenna Lyons, painting her son's toenails pink. Beneath the picture was a quote that read, "Lucky for me I ended up with a boy whose favorite color is pink." Some people were of the opinion that J.Crew was challenging traditional gender identity roles although the majority of Fox News Twitter users agreed with author Jo B. Paoletti who said that it was "no big deal".[33]

History[edit]
Formation and catalog growth[edit]
In 1947, Mitchell Cinader and Saul Charles founded Popular Merchandise, Inc., a store which did business as Popular Club Plan and sold low-priced women's clothing marketed through in-home demonstrations.[7] Throughout the mid-1980s, sales from catalog operations grew rapidly. "Growth was explosive—25 to 30 percent a year," Cinader later recollected in The New York Times. Annual sales grew from $3 million to more than $100 million over five years.[7] In 1985, the "Clifford & Wills" brand was launched, selling women’s clothing that was more affordable than the Popular Merchandise line.[8] In 1987, two executives left the company to start their own catalog, Tweeds.[9]
The 1980s marked a booming sales period for catalog retail giants Lands' End, Talbots, and L. L. Bean. Popular Merchandise initiated its own catalog operation, focusing on leisurewear for upper-middle-class customers, aiming for a Ralph Lauren look at a much lower price. The first Popular Club Plan catalog was mailed to customers in January 1983 and continued under that name until 1989. Popular Club Plan catalogs often showed the same garment in more than one picture with close-up shots of the fabrics, so customers could get a sense of how the garment looked on the body and be assured of the company's claims of quality.[citation needed]
Name change and first stores[edit]
In 1989, Popular Merchandise, Inc. became known as J.Crew, Inc. The company attempted, but failed to sell the Popular Club Plan brand.[7] Also in 1989, J.Crew opened its first retail store, in South Street Seaport in downtown Manhattan.[10]
J.Crew Group was owned by the Cinader family for most of its existence, but in October 1997 investment firm Texas Pacific Group Inc. purchased a majority stake. By the year 2000, Texas Pacific held an approximate 62 percent stake, a group of J.Crew managers held about 10 percent, and Emily Cinader Woods, the chairman of J.Crew, along with her father, Arthur Cinader, held most of the remainder.[citation needed] The brand Clifford & Wills was sold to Speigel, Inc. in 2000 with the intent to boost sales.[8] In 2004, J.Crew bought the rights to the brand Madewell, a defunct workwear manufacturer founded in 1937, and used the name from 2006 onwards as "a modern-day interpretation", targeted at younger women than their main brand.[11][12][13]
Privatization[edit]




A Madewell store at Easton Town Center in Columbus, Ohio


In 2011, TPG Capital LP and Leonard Green & Partners LP privated J. Crew in a $3 billion leveraged buyout.[1] On November 23, 2010, the company had agreed to be taken private in a $3 billion deal led by management with the backing of TPG Capital and Leonard Green & Partners, two large private equity firms. The announcement of the offer from two investment firms—including one that used to own J.Crew—came as the retailer reported that its third-quarter net income fell by 14 percent due to weak women's clothing sales. The company also lowered its guidance for the 2010 year. Under the deal as proposed, J.Crew shareholders would receive $43.50 per share in cash, representing a 16 percent premium to the stock's closing price the prior day of $37.65. CEO Mickey Drexler, the former Gap Inc. chief credited with turning J.Crew around since coming aboard in 2003, remained in that role and retained a "significant" stake in the company (as of September 2010, he holds 5.4% of outstanding shares). TPG, one of the investment firms in the deal, took a majority stake in J.Crew Group Inc. in 1997 and remained majority shareholder until the company went public in 2006.[14]
Shortly after the announcement of the deal, some in the business community criticized the terms of the deal involving the company's CEO and a majority shareholder.[15] As a result, the "go-shop" period was extended shortly after the initial announcement.[16] In addition, several investigations relating to potential shareholder actions against the company were announced.[17] After the deal, TPG and Leonard Green borrowed more to help finance dividends totaled $787 million to them.[1]
Recent[edit]
In June 2015, The New York Times reported that J. Crew's women's division was undergoing a slump because of the company's failure to react to two market trends: cheap "fast fashion" and "athleisure" items.[18] In 2016, J.Crew partnered with Nordstrom to begin selling their products in stores and online.[19] In December 2016, the company faced litigation after it moved its intellectual property "out of the reach of lenders."[20]
In April 2017, the company cut 250 jobs, largely from its headquarters.[20] The company also underwent several management changes, and long-term creative director Jenna Lyons left the company in April.[21] The brand’s longtime head of menswear left the company that month as well,[22] and in June 2017, the company's CEO, Mickey Drexler, announced that he would later be stepping down as CEO role after 14 years with the company.[23] Drexler announced he would stay on as chairman and still own 10% of the company.[24] On June 12, 2017, J.Crew Group Inc. announced it had "made an offer to some of its bondholders to push back its most pressing debt obligation—about $567 million due in May 2019—and amend its term loan." At the time, J.Crew Group had around $2 billion in debt.[20]
Retail stores[edit]




J.Crew at South Shore Plaza
in Braintree, Massachusetts


The company operates 575 retail stores, including 281 J.Crew stores, 113 Madewell stores, and 181 J.Crew Factory (including 39 J.Crew Mercantile) outlet locations, as reported in 2017.[1] The company also operates internationally in Canada, France, UK, China, and Korea. Additionally, the company has 76 locations in Japan, which are operated under license by ITOCHU Corporation.[citation needed]
In March 1989, the first J.Crew retail outlet opened in the South Street Seaport in Manhattan, and the company planned to open 45 more stores. Five months after the opening of its first store, J.Crew added two new catalog lines: "Classics" and "Collections." "Collections" used more complicated designs and finer fabrics to create dressier and more expensive items, while "Classics" featured clothes that could be worn both to work and for leisure activities.[citation needed] In the fall of 1989, J.Crew opened three new stores in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts; San Francisco, California; and Costa Mesa, California, all locations with strong catalog sales. By the end of the year, retail sales nearly hit $10 million.[citation needed] Despite 1989, revenues that year were estimated at $320 million, J.Crew suffered a setback when its agreement to sell its Popular Club unit collapsed at the end that year. In addition, rumors circulated that the company’s Clifford & Wills low-priced women's apparel catalog was doing poorly.[citation needed]
J.Crew saw revenues reach $400 million in 1990 but reported that its four existing stores had not yet started producing enough profits to cover their overheads. The next phase of store openings included outlets in Philadelphia, Cambridge, and Portland. The company scaled back its plans for opening retail stores from 45 stores to 30 or 35.[citation needed] In early 1991 the company hired a director of new marketing development and began efforts to expand their sales into Canada. In April 1991, J.Crew mailed 75,000 J.Crew catalogs and 60,000 Clifford & Wills catalogs to potential customers in the province of Ontario. Response rates to this effort were slightly lower than in the United States, but each order, on average, was higher.[citation needed] In 1992, J.Crew intensified its push into international markets by hiring a new vice-president for international development. The company already mailed hundreds of catalogs to customers in Japan and Europe, most of whom had become acquainted with J.Crew while traveling or living in the United States.[citation needed]




J. Crew in Markville Shopping Centre


In 2011, J.Crew opened its first international store in the Yorkdale Shopping Centre in Toronto, Ontario.[25] In 2012, J.Crew announced four new Canadian locations: Edmonton, Alberta in West Edmonton Mall, Vancouver, British Columbia on Robson Street, and Toronto, Ontario in Fairview Mall and the Toronto Eaton Centre. All locations will carry women's and men's collections. Along with 5 new stores, J.Crew announced to opening of two new factory stores in Canada, with one in Vaughan Mills and the other in Edmonton (The second J.Crew in Alberta)[26][27][28] Continuing with its expansion in the Greater Toronto Area, J.Crew opened at Markville Shopping Centre in 2013. In early 2014, J.Crew unveiled its new flagship location in Yorkville, Toronto.[citation needed]
In an interview with the Financial Times in 2011, CEO of J.Crew Mickey Drexler said that J.Crew would be expanding to the U.K. with their flagship store being on London's Regent Street. He indicated that the company would be following up their recent expansion into Canada and Canadian e-commerce with a physical store in England, most likely followed by e-commerce elsewhere, such as France and Germany. Although a few locations were reviewed for the London store, including Covent Garden and the East End, the ultimate decision was to open on Regent Street.[29]
In early 2014, J.Crew announced plans to open brick-and-mortar locations in Asia – to be spearheaded by two establishments in Hong Kong. A women's store is slated to open in the International Finance Centre, while a men's shop is in the works for On Lan Street. Both opened for business in May 2014.[citation needed] By June 2017, J.Crew Group had around 600 stores, including about 460 J.Crew locations.[20]
Marketing[edit]
Each year the company issues 24 editions of the J.Crew catalog, distributing more than 80 million copies.
J.Crew has been criticized for labeling its new super-small jeans as "size 000".,[30] and for advertising them as "toothpick jeans". Critics have said the labeling promotes vanity, a practice known as vanity sizing.[31] The "size 000" is smaller than a size zero and has three zeros, implying that it is two sizes smaller than the smallest normal size. This has caused people to question whether negative sizes will be available in the future,[32] and if the method of labeling should be changed.
In early 2011, J.Crew was under fire by conservative media outlets for an advertisement featuring its creative director and president, Jenna Lyons, painting her son's toenails pink. Beneath the picture was a quote that read, "Lucky for me I ended up with a boy whose favorite color is pink." Some people were of the opinion that J.Crew was challenging traditional gender identity roles although the majority of Fox News Twitter users agreed with author Jo B. Paoletti who said that it was "no big deal".[33]

In 2011, J.Crew opened its first international store in the Yorkdale Shopping Centre in Toronto, Ontario.[25] In 2012, J.Crew announced four new Canadian locations: Edmonton, Alberta in West Edmonton Mall, Vancouver, British Columbia on Robson Street, and Toronto, Ontario in Fairview Mall and the Toronto Eaton Centre. All locations will carry women's and men's collections. Along with 5 new stores, J.Crew announced to opening of two new factory stores in Canada, with one in Vaughan Mills and the other in Edmonton (The second J.Crew in Alberta)[26][27][28] Continuing with its expansion in the Greater Toronto Area, J.Crew opened at Markville Shopping Centre in 2013. In early 2014, J.Crew unveiled its new flagship location in Yorkville, Toronto.[citation needed]
In an interview with the Financial Times in 2011, CEO of J.Crew Mickey Drexler said that J.Crew would be expanding to the U.K. with their flagship store being on London's Regent Street. He indicated that the company would be following up their recent expansion into Canada and Canadian e-commerce with a physical store in England, most likely followed by e-commerce elsewhere, such as France and Germany. Although a few locations were reviewed for the London store, including Covent Garden and the East End, the ultimate decision was to open on Regent Street.[29]
In early 2014, J.Crew announced plans to open brick-and-mortar locations in Asia – to be spearheaded by two establishments in Hong Kong. A women's store is slated to open in the International Finance Centre, while a men's shop is in the works for On Lan Street. Both opened for business in May 2014.[citation needed] By June 2017, J.Crew Group had around 600 stores, including about 460 J.Crew locations.[20]
Marketing[edit]
Each year the company issues 24 editions of the J.Crew catalog, distributing more than 80 million copies.
J.Crew has been criticized for labeling its new super-small jeans as "size 000".,[30] and for advertising them as "toothpick jeans". Critics have said the labeling promotes vanity, a practice known as vanity sizing.[31] The "size 000" is smaller than a size zero and has three zeros, implying that it is two sizes smaller than the smallest normal size. This has caused people to question whether negative sizes will be available in the future,[32] and if the method of labeling should be changed.
In early 2011, J.Crew was under fire by conservative media outlets for an advertisement featuring its creative director and president, Jenna Lyons, painting her son's toenails pink. Beneath the picture was a quote that read, "Lucky for me I ended up with a boy whose favorite color is pink." Some people were of the opinion that J.Crew was challenging traditional gender identity roles although the majority of Fox News Twitter users agreed with author Jo B. Paoletti who said that it was "no big deal".[33]

History[edit]
Formation and catalog growth[edit]
In 1947, Mitchell Cinader and Saul Charles founded Popular Merchandise, Inc., a store which did business as Popular Club Plan and sold low-priced women's clothing marketed through in-home demonstrations.[7] Throughout the mid-1980s, sales from catalog operations grew rapidly. "Growth was explosive—25 to 30 percent a year," Cinader later recollected in The New York Times. Annual sales grew from $3 million to more than $100 million over five years.[7] In 1985, the "Clifford & Wills" brand was launched, selling women’s clothing that was more affordable than the Popular Merchandise line.[8] In 1987, two executives left the company to start their own catalog, Tweeds.[9]
The 1980s marked a booming sales period for catalog retail giants Lands' End, Talbots, and L. L. Bean. Popular Merchandise initiated its own catalog operation, focusing on leisurewear for upper-middle-class customers, aiming for a Ralph Lauren look at a much lower price. The first Popular Club Plan catalog was mailed to customers in January 1983 and continued under that name until 1989. Popular Club Plan catalogs often showed the same garment in more than one picture with close-up shots of the fabrics, so customers could get a sense of how the garment looked on the body and be assured of the company's claims of quality.[citation needed]
Name change and first stores[edit]
In 1989, Popular Merchandise, Inc. became known as J.Crew, Inc. The company attempted, but failed to sell the Popular Club Plan brand.[7] Also in 1989, J.Crew opened its first retail store, in South Street Seaport in downtown Manhattan.[10]
J.Crew Group was owned by the Cinader family for most of its existence, but in October 1997 investment firm Texas Pacific Group Inc. purchased a majority stake. By the year 2000, Texas Pacific held an approximate 62 percent stake, a group of J.Crew managers held about 10 percent, and Emily Cinader Woods, the chairman of J.Crew, along with her father, Arthur Cinader, held most of the remainder.[citation needed] The brand Clifford & Wills was sold to Speigel, Inc. in 2000 with the intent to boost sales.[8] In 2004, J.Crew bought the rights to the brand Madewell, a defunct workwear manufacturer founded in 1937, and used the name from 2006 onwards as "a modern-day interpretation", targeted at younger women than their main brand.[11][12][13]
Privatization[edit]




A Madewell store at Easton Town Center in Columbus, Ohio


In 2011, TPG Capital LP and Leonard Green & Partners LP privated J. Crew in a $3 billion leveraged buyout.[1] On November 23, 2010, the company had agreed to be taken private in a $3 billion deal led by management with the backing of TPG Capital and Leonard Green & Partners, two large private equity firms. The announcement of the offer from two investment firms—including one that used to own J.Crew—came as the retailer reported that its third-quarter net income fell by 14 percent due to weak women's clothing sales. The company also lowered its guidance for the 2010 year. Under the deal as proposed, J.Crew shareholders would receive $43.50 per share in cash, representing a 16 percent premium to the stock's closing price the prior day of $37.65. CEO Mickey Drexler, the former Gap Inc. chief credited with turning J.Crew around since coming aboard in 2003, remained in that role and retained a "significant" stake in the company (as of September 2010, he holds 5.4% of outstanding shares). TPG, one of the investment firms in the deal, took a majority stake in J.Crew Group Inc. in 1997 and remained majority shareholder until the company went public in 2006.[14]
Shortly after the announcement of the deal, some in the business community criticized the terms of the deal involving the company's CEO and a majority shareholder.[15] As a result, the "go-shop" period was extended shortly after the initial announcement.[16] In addition, several investigations relating to potential shareholder actions against the company were announced.[17] After the deal, TPG and Leonard Green borrowed more to help finance dividends totaled $787 million to them.[1]
Recent[edit]
In June 2015, The New York Times reported that J. Crew's women's division was undergoing a slump because of the company's failure to react to two market trends: cheap "fast fashion" and "athleisure" items.[18] In 2016, J.Crew partnered with Nordstrom to begin selling their products in stores and online.[19] In December 2016, the company faced litigation after it moved its intellectual property "out of the reach of lenders."[20]
In April 2017, the company cut 250 jobs, largely from its headquarters.[20] The company also underwent several management changes, and long-term creative director Jenna Lyons left the company in April.[21] The brand’s longtime head of menswear left the company that month as well,[22] and in June 2017, the company's CEO, Mickey Drexler, announced that he would later be stepping down as CEO role after 14 years with the company.[23] Drexler announced he would stay on as chairman and still own 10% of the company.[24] On June 12, 2017, J.Crew Group Inc. announced it had "made an offer to some of its bondholders to push back its most pressing debt obligation—about $567 million due in May 2019—and amend its term loan." At the time, J.Crew Group had around $2 billion in debt.[20]
Retail stores[edit]




J.Crew at South Shore Plaza
in Braintree, Massachusetts


The company operates 575 retail stores, including 281 J.Crew stores, 113 Madewell stores, and 181 J.Crew Factory (including 39 J.Crew Mercantile) outlet locations, as reported in 2017.[1] The company also operates internationally in Canada, France, UK, China, and Korea. Additionally, the company has 76 locations in Japan, which are operated under license by ITOCHU Corporation.[citation needed]
In March 1989, the first J.Crew retail outlet opened in the South Street Seaport in Manhattan, and the company planned to open 45 more stores. Five months after the opening of its first store, J.Crew added two new catalog lines: "Classics" and "Collections." "Collections" used more complicated designs and finer fabrics to create dressier and more expensive items, while "Classics" featured clothes that could be worn both to work and for leisure activities.[citation needed] In the fall of 1989, J.Crew opened three new stores in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts; San Francisco, California; and Costa Mesa, California, all locations with strong catalog sales. By the end of the year, retail sales nearly hit $10 million.[citation needed] Despite 1989, revenues that year were estimated at $320 million, J.Crew suffered a setback when its agreement to sell its Popular Club unit collapsed at the end that year. In addition, rumors circulated that the company’s Clifford & Wills low-priced women's apparel catalog was doing poorly.[citation needed]
J.Crew saw revenues reach $400 million in 1990 but reported that its four existing stores had not yet started producing enough profits to cover their overheads. The next phase of store openings included outlets in Philadelphia, Cambridge, and Portland. The company scaled back its plans for opening retail stores from 45 stores to 30 or 35.[citation needed] In early 1991 the company hired a director of new marketing development and began efforts to expand their sales into Canada. In April 1991, J.Crew mailed 75,000 J.Crew catalogs and 60,000 Clifford & Wills catalogs to potential customers in the province of Ontario. Response rates to this effort were slightly lower than in the United States, but each order, on average, was higher.[citation needed] In 1992, J.Crew intensified its push into international markets by hiring a new vice-president for international development. The company already mailed hundreds of catalogs to customers in Japan and Europe, most of whom had become acquainted with J.Crew while traveling or living in the United States.[citation needed]

In 1947, Mitchell Cinader and Saul Charles founded Popular Merchandise, Inc., a store which did business as Popular Club Plan and sold low-priced women's clothing marketed through in-home demonstrations.[7] Throughout the mid-1980s, sales from catalog operations grew rapidly. "Growth was explosive—25 to 30 percent a year," Cinader later recollected in The New York Times. Annual sales grew from $3 million to more than $100 million over five years.[7] In 1985, the "Clifford & Wills" brand was launched, selling women’s clothing that was more affordable than the Popular Merchandise line.[8] In 1987, two executives left the company to start their own catalog, Tweeds.[9]
The 1980s marked a booming sales period for catalog retail giants Lands' End, Talbots, and L. L. Bean. Popular Merchandise initiated its own catalog operation, focusing on leisurewear for upper-middle-class customers, aiming for a Ralph Lauren look at a much lower price. The first Popular Club Plan catalog was mailed to customers in January 1983 and continued under that name until 1989. Popular Club Plan catalogs often showed the same garment in more than one picture with close-up shots of the fabrics, so customers could get a sense of how the garment looked on the body and be assured of the company's claims of quality.[citation needed]
Name change and first stores[edit]
In 1989, Popular Merchandise, Inc. became known as J.Crew, Inc. The company attempted, but failed to sell the Popular Club Plan brand.[7] Also in 1989, J.Crew opened its first retail store, in South Street Seaport in downtown Manhattan.[10]
J.Crew Group was owned by the Cinader family for most of its existence, but in October 1997 investment firm Texas Pacific Group Inc. purchased a majority stake. By the year 2000, Texas Pacific held an approximate 62 percent stake, a group of J.Crew managers held about 10 percent, and Emily Cinader Woods, the chairman of J.Crew, along with her father, Arthur Cinader, held most of the remainder.[citation needed] The brand Clifford & Wills was sold to Speigel, Inc. in 2000 with the intent to boost sales.[8] In 2004, J.Crew bought the rights to the brand Madewell, a defunct workwear manufacturer founded in 1937, and used the name from 2006 onwards as "a modern-day interpretation", targeted at younger women than their main brand.[11][12][13]
Privatization[edit]




A Madewell store at Easton Town Center in Columbus, Ohio


In 2011, TPG Capital LP and Leonard Green & Partners LP privated J. Crew in a $3 billion leveraged buyout.[1] On November 23, 2010, the company had agreed to be taken private in a $3 billion deal led by management with the backing of TPG Capital and Leonard Green & Partners, two large private equity firms. The announcement of the offer from two investment firms—including one that used to own J.Crew—came as the retailer reported that its third-quarter net income fell by 14 percent due to weak women's clothing sales. The company also lowered its guidance for the 2010 year. Under the deal as proposed, J.Crew shareholders would receive $43.50 per share in cash, representing a 16 percent premium to the stock's closing price the prior day of $37.65. CEO Mickey Drexler, the former Gap Inc. chief credited with turning J.Crew around since coming aboard in 2003, remained in that role and retained a "significant" stake in the company (as of September 2010, he holds 5.4% of outstanding shares). TPG, one of the investment firms in the deal, took a majority stake in J.Crew Group Inc. in 1997 and remained majority shareholder until the company went public in 2006.[14]
Shortly after the announcement of the deal, some in the business community criticized the terms of the deal involving the company's CEO and a majority shareholder.[15] As a result, the "go-shop" period was extended shortly after the initial announcement.[16] In addition, several investigations relating to potential shareholder actions against the company were announced.[17] After the deal, TPG and Leonard Green borrowed more to help finance dividends totaled $787 million to them.[1]
Recent[edit]
In June 2015, The New York Times reported that J. Crew's women's division was undergoing a slump because of the company's failure to react to two market trends: cheap "fast fashion" and "athleisure" items.[18] In 2016, J.Crew partnered with Nordstrom to begin selling their products in stores and online.[19] In December 2016, the company faced litigation after it moved its intellectual property "out of the reach of lenders."[20]
In April 2017, the company cut 250 jobs, largely from its headquarters.[20] The company also underwent several management changes, and long-term creative director Jenna Lyons left the company in April.[21] The brand’s longtime head of menswear left the company that month as well,[22] and in June 2017, the company's CEO, Mickey Drexler, announced that he would later be stepping down as CEO role after 14 years with the company.[23] Drexler announced he would stay on as chairman and still own 10% of the company.[24] On June 12, 2017, J.Crew Group Inc. announced it had "made an offer to some of its bondholders to push back its most pressing debt obligation—about $567 million due in May 2019—and amend its term loan." At the time, J.Crew Group had around $2 billion in debt.[20]
Retail stores[edit]




J.Crew at South Shore Plaza
in Braintree, Massachusetts


The company operates 575 retail stores, including 281 J.Crew stores, 113 Madewell stores, and 181 J.Crew Factory (including 39 J.Crew Mercantile) outlet locations, as reported in 2017.[1] The company also operates internationally in Canada, France, UK, China, and Korea. Additionally, the company has 76 locations in Japan, which are operated under license by ITOCHU Corporation.[citation needed]
In March 1989, the first J.Crew retail outlet opened in the South Street Seaport in Manhattan, and the company planned to open 45 more stores. Five months after the opening of its first store, J.Crew added two new catalog lines: "Classics" and "Collections." "Collections" used more complicated designs and finer fabrics to create dressier and more expensive items, while "Classics" featured clothes that could be worn both to work and for leisure activities.[citation needed] In the fall of 1989, J.Crew opened three new stores in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts; San Francisco, California; and Costa Mesa, California, all locations with strong catalog sales. By the end of the year, retail sales nearly hit $10 million.[citation needed] Despite 1989, revenues that year were estimated at $320 million, J.Crew suffered a setback when its agreement to sell its Popular Club unit collapsed at the end that year. In addition, rumors circulated that the company’s Clifford & Wills low-priced women's apparel catalog was doing poorly.[citation needed]
J.Crew saw revenues reach $400 million in 1990 but reported that its four existing stores had not yet started producing enough profits to cover their overheads. The next phase of store openings included outlets in Philadelphia, Cambridge, and Portland. The company scaled back its plans for opening retail stores from 45 stores to 30 or 35.[citation needed] In early 1991 the company hired a director of new marketing development and began efforts to expand their sales into Canada. In April 1991, J.Crew mailed 75,000 J.Crew catalogs and 60,000 Clifford & Wills catalogs to potential customers in the province of Ontario. Response rates to this effort were slightly lower than in the United States, but each order, on average, was higher.[citation needed] In 1992, J.Crew intensified its push into international markets by hiring a new vice-president for international development. The company already mailed hundreds of catalogs to customers in Japan and Europe, most of whom had become acquainted with J.Crew while traveling or living in the United States.[citation needed]




J. Crew in Markville Shopping Centre


In 2011, J.Crew opened its first international store in the Yorkdale Shopping Centre in Toronto, Ontario.[25] In 2012, J.Crew announced four new Canadian locations: Edmonton, Alberta in West Edmonton Mall, Vancouver, British Columbia on Robson Street, and Toronto, Ontario in Fairview Mall and the Toronto Eaton Centre. All locations will carry women's and men's collections. Along with 5 new stores, J.Crew announced to opening of two new factory stores in Canada, with one in Vaughan Mills and the other in Edmonton (The second J.Crew in Alberta)[26][27][28] Continuing with its expansion in the Greater Toronto Area, J.Crew opened at Markville Shopping Centre in 2013. In early 2014, J.Crew unveiled its new flagship location in Yorkville, Toronto.[citation needed]
In an interview with the Financial Times in 2011, CEO of J.Crew Mickey Drexler said that J.Crew would be expanding to the U.K. with their flagship store being on London's Regent Street. He indicated that the company would be following up their recent expansion into Canada and Canadian e-commerce with a physical store in England, most likely followed by e-commerce elsewhere, such as France and Germany. Although a few locations were reviewed for the London store, including Covent Garden and the East End, the ultimate decision was to open on Regent Street.[29]
In early 2014, J.Crew announced plans to open brick-and-mortar locations in Asia – to be spearheaded by two establishments in Hong Kong. A women's store is slated to open in the International Finance Centre, while a men's shop is in the works for On Lan Street. Both opened for business in May 2014.[citation needed] By June 2017, J.Crew Group had around 600 stores, including about 460 J.Crew locations.[20]
Marketing[edit]
Each year the company issues 24 editions of the J.Crew catalog, distributing more than 80 million copies.
J.Crew has been criticized for labeling its new super-small jeans as "size 000".,[30] and for advertising them as "toothpick jeans". Critics have said the labeling promotes vanity, a practice known as vanity sizing.[31] The "size 000" is smaller than a size zero and has three zeros, implying that it is two sizes smaller than the smallest normal size. This has caused people to question whether negative sizes will be available in the future,[32] and if the method of labeling should be changed.
In early 2011, J.Crew was under fire by conservative media outlets for an advertisement featuring its creative director and president, Jenna Lyons, painting her son's toenails pink. Beneath the picture was a quote that read, "Lucky for me I ended up with a boy whose favorite color is pink." Some people were of the opinion that J.Crew was challenging traditional gender identity roles although the majority of Fox News Twitter users agreed with author Jo B. Paoletti who said that it was "no big deal".[33]

History[edit]
Formation and catalog growth[edit]
In 1947, Mitchell Cinader and Saul Charles founded Popular Merchandise, Inc., a store which did business as Popular Club Plan and sold low-priced women's clothing marketed through in-home demonstrations.[7] Throughout the mid-1980s, sales from catalog operations grew rapidly. "Growth was explosive—25 to 30 percent a year," Cinader later recollected in The New York Times. Annual sales grew from $3 million to more than $100 million over five years.[7] In 1985, the "Clifford & Wills" brand was launched, selling women’s clothing that was more affordable than the Popular Merchandise line.[8] In 1987, two executives left the company to start their own catalog, Tweeds.[9]
The 1980s marked a booming sales period for catalog retail giants Lands' End, Talbots, and L. L. Bean. Popular Merchandise initiated its own catalog operation, focusing on leisurewear for upper-middle-class customers, aiming for a Ralph Lauren look at a much lower price. The first Popular Club Plan catalog was mailed to customers in January 1983 and continued under that name until 1989. Popular Club Plan catalogs often showed the same garment in more than one picture with close-up shots of the fabrics, so customers could get a sense of how the garment looked on the body and be assured of the company's claims of quality.[citation needed]
Name change and first stores[edit]
In 1989, Popular Merchandise, Inc. became known as J.Crew, Inc. The company attempted, but failed to sell the Popular Club Plan brand.[7] Also in 1989, J.Crew opened its first retail store, in South Street Seaport in downtown Manhattan.[10]
J.Crew Group was owned by the Cinader family for most of its existence, but in October 1997 investment firm Texas Pacific Group Inc. purchased a majority stake. By the year 2000, Texas Pacific held an approximate 62 percent stake, a group of J.Crew managers held about 10 percent, and Emily Cinader Woods, the chairman of J.Crew, along with her father, Arthur Cinader, held most of the remainder.[citation needed] The brand Clifford & Wills was sold to Speigel, Inc. in 2000 with the intent to boost sales.[8] In 2004, J.Crew bought the rights to the brand Madewell, a defunct workwear manufacturer founded in 1937, and used the name from 2006 onwards as "a modern-day interpretation", targeted at younger women than their main brand.[11][12][13]
Privatization[edit]




A Madewell store at Easton Town Center in Columbus, Ohio


In 2011, TPG Capital LP and Leonard Green & Partners LP privated J. Crew in a $3 billion leveraged buyout.[1] On November 23, 2010, the company had agreed to be taken private in a $3 billion deal led by management with the backing of TPG Capital and Leonard Green & Partners, two large private equity firms. The announcement of the offer from two investment firms—including one that used to own J.Crew—came as the retailer reported that its third-quarter net income fell by 14 percent due to weak women's clothing sales. The company also lowered its guidance for the 2010 year. Under the deal as proposed, J.Crew shareholders would receive $43.50 per share in cash, representing a 16 percent premium to the stock's closing price the prior day of $37.65. CEO Mickey Drexler, the former Gap Inc. chief credited with turning J.Crew around since coming aboard in 2003, remained in that role and retained a "significant" stake in the company (as of September 2010, he holds 5.4% of outstanding shares). TPG, one of the investment firms in the deal, took a majority stake in J.Crew Group Inc. in 1997 and remained majority shareholder until the company went public in 2006.[14]
Shortly after the announcement of the deal, some in the business community criticized the terms of the deal involving the company's CEO and a majority shareholder.[15] As a result, the "go-shop" period was extended shortly after the initial announcement.[16] In addition, several investigations relating to potential shareholder actions against the company were announced.[17] After the deal, TPG and Leonard Green borrowed more to help finance dividends totaled $787 million to them.[1]
Recent[edit]
In June 2015, The New York Times reported that J. Crew's women's division was undergoing a slump because of the company's failure to react to two market trends: cheap "fast fashion" and "athleisure" items.[18] In 2016, J.Crew partnered with Nordstrom to begin selling their products in stores and online.[19] In December 2016, the company faced litigation after it moved its intellectual property "out of the reach of lenders."[20]
In April 2017, the company cut 250 jobs, largely from its headquarters.[20] The company also underwent several management changes, and long-term creative director Jenna Lyons left the company in April.[21] The brand’s longtime head of menswear left the company that month as well,[22] and in June 2017, the company's CEO, Mickey Drexler, announced that he would later be stepping down as CEO role after 14 years with the company.[23] Drexler announced he would stay on as chairman and still own 10% of the company.[24] On June 12, 2017, J.Crew Group Inc. announced it had "made an offer to some of its bondholders to push back its most pressing debt obligation—about $567 million due in May 2019—and amend its term loan." At the time, J.Crew Group had around $2 billion in debt.[20]
Retail stores[edit]




J.Crew at South Shore Plaza
in Braintree, Massachusetts


The company operates 575 retail stores, including 281 J.Crew stores, 113 Madewell stores, and 181 J.Crew Factory (including 39 J.Crew Mercantile) outlet locations, as reported in 2017.[1] The company also operates internationally in Canada, France, UK, China, and Korea. Additionally, the company has 76 locations in Japan, which are operated under license by ITOCHU Corporation.[citation needed]
In March 1989, the first J.Crew retail outlet opened in the South Street Seaport in Manhattan, and the company planned to open 45 more stores. Five months after the opening of its first store, J.Crew added two new catalog lines: "Classics" and "Collections." "Collections" used more complicated designs and finer fabrics to create dressier and more expensive items, while "Classics" featured clothes that could be worn both to work and for leisure activities.[citation needed] In the fall of 1989, J.Crew opened three new stores in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts; San Francisco, California; and Costa Mesa, California, all locations with strong catalog sales. By the end of the year, retail sales nearly hit $10 million.[citation needed] Despite 1989, revenues that year were estimated at $320 million, J.Crew suffered a setback when its agreement to sell its Popular Club unit collapsed at the end that year. In addition, rumors circulated that the company’s Clifford & Wills low-priced women's apparel catalog was doing poorly.[citation needed]
J.Crew saw revenues reach $400 million in 1990 but reported that its four existing stores had not yet started producing enough profits to cover their overheads. The next phase of store openings included outlets in Philadelphia, Cambridge, and Portland. The company scaled back its plans for opening retail stores from 45 stores to 30 or 35.[citation needed] In early 1991 the company hired a director of new marketing development and began efforts to expand their sales into Canada. In April 1991, J.Crew mailed 75,000 J.Crew catalogs and 60,000 Clifford & Wills catalogs to potential customers in the province of Ontario. Response rates to this effort were slightly lower than in the United States, but each order, on average, was higher.[citation needed] In 1992, J.Crew intensified its push into international markets by hiring a new vice-president for international development. The company already mailed hundreds of catalogs to customers in Japan and Europe, most of whom had become acquainted with J.Crew while traveling or living in the United States.[citation needed]




J. Crew in Markville Shopping Centre


In 2011, J.Crew opened its first international store in the Yorkdale Shopping Centre in Toronto, Ontario.[25] In 2012, J.Crew announced four new Canadian locations: Edmonton, Alberta in West Edmonton Mall, Vancouver, British Columbia on Robson Street, and Toronto, Ontario in Fairview Mall and the Toronto Eaton Centre. All locations will carry women's and men's collections. Along with 5 new stores, J.Crew announced to opening of two new factory stores in Canada, with one in Vaughan Mills and the other in Edmonton (The second J.Crew in Alberta)[26][27][28] Continuing with its expansion in the Greater Toronto Area, J.Crew opened at Markville Shopping Centre in 2013. In early 2014, J.Crew unveiled its new flagship location in Yorkville, Toronto.[citation needed]
In an interview with the Financial Times in 2011, CEO of J.Crew Mickey Drexler said that J.Crew would be expanding to the U.K. with their flagship store being on London's Regent Street. He indicated that the company would be following up their recent expansion into Canada and Canadian e-commerce with a physical store in England, most likely followed by e-commerce elsewhere, such as France and Germany. Although a few locations were reviewed for the London store, including Covent Garden and the East End, the ultimate decision was to open on Regent Street.[29]
In early 2014, J.Crew announced plans to open brick-and-mortar locations in Asia – to be spearheaded by two establishments in Hong Kong. A women's store is slated to open in the International Finance Centre, while a men's shop is in the works for On Lan Street. Both opened for business in May 2014.[citation needed] By June 2017, J.Crew Group had around 600 stores, including about 460 J.Crew locations.[20]
Marketing[edit]
Each year the company issues 24 editions of the J.Crew catalog, distributing more than 80 million copies.
J.Crew has been criticized for labeling its new super-small jeans as "size 000".,[30] and for advertising them as "toothpick jeans". Critics have said the labeling promotes vanity, a practice known as vanity sizing.[31] The "size 000" is smaller than a size zero and has three zeros, implying that it is two sizes smaller than the smallest normal size. This has caused people to question whether negative sizes will be available in the future,[32] and if the method of labeling should be changed.
In early 2011, J.Crew was under fire by conservative media outlets for an advertisement featuring its creative director and president, Jenna Lyons, painting her son's toenails pink. Beneath the picture was a quote that read, "Lucky for me I ended up with a boy whose favorite color is pink." Some people were of the opinion that J.Crew was challenging traditional gender identity roles although the majority of Fox News Twitter users agreed with author Jo B. Paoletti who said that it was "no big deal".[33]

History[edit]
Formation and catalog growth[edit]
In 1947, Mitchell Cinader and Saul Charles founded Popular Merchandise, Inc., a store which did business as Popular Club Plan and sold low-priced women's clothing marketed through in-home demonstrations.[7] Throughout the mid-1980s, sales from catalog operations grew rapidly. "Growth was explosive—25 to 30 percent a year," Cinader later recollected in The New York Times. Annual sales grew from $3 million to more than $100 million over five years.[7] In 1985, the "Clifford & Wills" brand was launched, selling women’s clothing that was more affordable than the Popular Merchandise line.[8] In 1987, two executives left the company to start their own catalog, Tweeds.[9]
The 1980s marked a booming sales period for catalog retail giants Lands' End, Talbots, and L. L. Bean. Popular Merchandise initiated its own catalog operation, focusing on leisurewear for upper-middle-class customers, aiming for a Ralph Lauren look at a much lower price. The first Popular Club Plan catalog was mailed to customers in January 1983 and continued under that name until 1989. Popular Club Plan catalogs often showed the same garment in more than one picture with close-up shots of the fabrics, so customers could get a sense of how the garment looked on the body and be assured of the company's claims of quality.[citation needed]
Name change and first stores[edit]
In 1989, Popular Merchandise, Inc. became known as J.Crew, Inc. The company attempted, but failed to sell the Popular Club Plan brand.[7] Also in 1989, J.Crew opened its first retail store, in South Street Seaport in downtown Manhattan.[10]
J.Crew Group was owned by the Cinader family for most of its existence, but in October 1997 investment firm Texas Pacific Group Inc. purchased a majority stake. By the year 2000, Texas Pacific held an approximate 62 percent stake, a group of J.Crew managers held about 10 percent, and Emily Cinader Woods, the chairman of J.Crew, along with her father, Arthur Cinader, held most of the remainder.[citation needed] The brand Clifford & Wills was sold to Speigel, Inc. in 2000 with the intent to boost sales.[8] In 2004, J.Crew bought the rights to the brand Madewell, a defunct workwear manufacturer founded in 1937, and used the name from 2006 onwards as "a modern-day interpretation", targeted at younger women than their main brand.[11][12][13]
Privatization[edit]




A Madewell store at Easton Town Center in Columbus, Ohio


In 2011, TPG Capital LP and Leonard Green & Partners LP privated J. Crew in a $3 billion leveraged buyout.[1] On November 23, 2010, the company had agreed to be taken private in a $3 billion deal led by management with the backing of TPG Capital and Leonard Green & Partners, two large private equity firms. The announcement of the offer from two investment firms—including one that used to own J.Crew—came as the retailer reported that its third-quarter net income fell by 14 percent due to weak women's clothing sales. The company also lowered its guidance for the 2010 year. Under the deal as proposed, J.Crew shareholders would receive $43.50 per share in cash, representing a 16 percent premium to the stock's closing price the prior day of $37.65. CEO Mickey Drexler, the former Gap Inc. chief credited with turning J.Crew around since coming aboard in 2003, remained in that role and retained a "significant" stake in the company (as of September 2010, he holds 5.4% of outstanding shares). TPG, one of the investment firms in the deal, took a majority stake in J.Crew Group Inc. in 1997 and remained majority shareholder until the company went public in 2006.[14]
Shortly after the announcement of the deal, some in the business community criticized the terms of the deal involving the company's CEO and a majority shareholder.[15] As a result, the "go-shop" period was extended shortly after the initial announcement.[16] In addition, several investigations relating to potential shareholder actions against the company were announced.[17] After the deal, TPG and Leonard Green borrowed more to help finance dividends totaled $787 million to them.[1]
Recent[edit]
In June 2015, The New York Times reported that J. Crew's women's division was undergoing a slump because of the company's failure to react to two market trends: cheap "fast fashion" and "athleisure" items.[18] In 2016, J.Crew partnered with Nordstrom to begin selling their products in stores and online.[19] In December 2016, the company faced litigation after it moved its intellectual property "out of the reach of lenders."[20]
In April 2017, the company cut 250 jobs, largely from its headquarters.[20] The company also underwent several management changes, and long-term creative director Jenna Lyons left the company in April.[21] The brand’s longtime head of menswear left the company that month as well,[22] and in June 2017, the company's CEO, Mickey Drexler, announced that he would later be stepping down as CEO role after 14 years with the company.[23] Drexler announced he would stay on as chairman and still own 10% of the company.[24] On June 12, 2017, J.Crew Group Inc. announced it had "made an offer to some of its bondholders to push back its most pressing debt obligation—about $567 million due in May 2019—and amend its term loan." At the time, J.Crew Group had around $2 billion in debt.[20]
Retail stores[edit]




J.Crew at South Shore Plaza
in Braintree, Massachusetts


The company operates 575 retail stores, including 281 J.Crew stores, 113 Madewell stores, and 181 J.Crew Factory (including 39 J.Crew Mercantile) outlet locations, as reported in 2017.[1] The company also operates internationally in Canada, France, UK, China, and Korea. Additionally, the company has 76 locations in Japan, which are operated under license by ITOCHU Corporation.[citation needed]
In March 1989, the first J.Crew retail outlet opened in the South Street Seaport in Manhattan, and the company planned to open 45 more stores. Five months after the opening of its first store, J.Crew added two new catalog lines: "Classics" and "Collections." "Collections" used more complicated designs and finer fabrics to create dressier and more expensive items, while "Classics" featured clothes that could be worn both to work and for leisure activities.[citation needed] In the fall of 1989, J.Crew opened three new stores in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts; San Francisco, California; and Costa Mesa, California, all locations with strong catalog sales. By the end of the year, retail sales nearly hit $10 million.[citation needed] Despite 1989, revenues that year were estimated at $320 million, J.Crew suffered a setback when its agreement to sell its Popular Club unit collapsed at the end that year. In addition, rumors circulated that the company’s Clifford & Wills low-priced women's apparel catalog was doing poorly.[citation needed]
J.Crew saw revenues reach $400 million in 1990 but reported that its four existing stores had not yet started producing enough profits to cover their overheads. The next phase of store openings included outlets in Philadelphia, Cambridge, and Portland. The company scaled back its plans for opening retail stores from 45 stores to 30 or 35.[citation needed] In early 1991 the company hired a director of new marketing development and began efforts to expand their sales into Canada. In April 1991, J.Crew mailed 75,000 J.Crew catalogs and 60,000 Clifford & Wills catalogs to potential customers in the province of Ontario. Response rates to this effort were slightly lower than in the United States, but each order, on average, was higher.[citation needed] In 1992, J.Crew intensified its push into international markets by hiring a new vice-president for international development. The company already mailed hundreds of catalogs to customers in Japan and Europe, most of whom had become acquainted with J.Crew while traveling or living in the United States.[citation needed]




J. Crew in Markville Shopping Centre


In 2011, J.Crew opened its first international store in the Yorkdale Shopping Centre in Toronto, Ontario.[25] In 2012, J.Crew announced four new Canadian locations: Edmonton, Alberta in West Edmonton Mall, Vancouver, British Columbia on Robson Street, and Toronto, Ontario in Fairview Mall and the Toronto Eaton Centre. All locations will carry women's and men's collections. Along with 5 new stores, J.Crew announced to opening of two new factory stores in Canada, with one in Vaughan Mills and the other in Edmonton (The second J.Crew in Alberta)[26][27][28] Continuing with its expansion in the Greater Toronto Area, J.Crew opened at Markville Shopping Centre in 2013. In early 2014, J.Crew unveiled its new flagship location in Yorkville, Toronto.[citation needed]
In an interview with the Financial Times in 2011, CEO of J.Crew Mickey Drexler said that J.Crew would be expanding to the U.K. with their flagship store being on London's Regent Street. He indicated that the company would be following up their recent expansion into Canada and Canadian e-commerce with a physical store in England, most likely followed by e-commerce elsewhere, such as France and Germany. Although a few locations were reviewed for the London store, including Covent Garden and the East End, the ultimate decision was to open on Regent Street.[29]
In early 2014, J.Crew announced plans to open brick-and-mortar locations in Asia – to be spearheaded by two establishments in Hong Kong. A women's store is slated to open in the International Finance Centre, while a men's shop is in the works for On Lan Street. Both opened for business in May 2014.[citation needed] By June 2017, J.Crew Group had around 600 stores, including about 460 J.Crew locations.[20]
Marketing[edit]
Each year the company issues 24 editions of the J.Crew catalog, distributing more than 80 million copies.
J.Crew has been criticized for labeling its new super-small jeans as "size 000".,[30] and for advertising them as "toothpick jeans". Critics have said the labeling promotes vanity, a practice known as vanity sizing.[31] The "size 000" is smaller than a size zero and has three zeros, implying that it is two sizes smaller than the smallest normal size. This has caused people to question whether negative sizes will be available in the future,[32] and if the method of labeling should be changed.
In early 2011, J.Crew was under fire by conservative media outlets for an advertisement featuring its creative director and president, Jenna Lyons, painting her son's toenails pink. Beneath the picture was a quote that read, "Lucky for me I ended up with a boy whose favorite color is pink." Some people were of the opinion that J.Crew was challenging traditional gender identity roles although the majority of Fox News Twitter users agreed with author Jo B. Paoletti who said that it was "no big deal".[33]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
