A fundamentally differentway to invest.


As an independent asset manager established in 1995, Palisade Capital Management thinks, invests, and treats our clients in a manner that is fundamentally different from other managers. We believe in putting clients first, constant communication, fundamental research — and much more. 


We invite you to see the difference being different can make:

Institutional Investors
Individual Investors















Focused All Cap Equity
Palisade’s Focused All Cap Equity strategy is led by Senior Portfolio Manager Will Potter with the support of Analyst Mark Berman.  Our objective is to invest in a diversified, yet focused portfolio of well-managed companies in all capitalization ranges. Through fundamental research, we seek to narrow the universe down to a portfolio typically comprised of 20-30 compounders of shareowner value. We prefer portfolio company management teams that distinguish themselves through continuous operational improvement, highly-competitive corporate strategies, and disciplined/effective deployment of capital. Palisade’s Focused All Cap Equity strategy is currently available through separately managed accounts.Learn More









Small Cap Core Equity
Led by Senior Portfolio Manager Marc Shapiro, Palisade’s experienced four-member Small Cap Core Equity team utilizes a research-intensive, disciplined investment process that integrates bottom-up fundamental stock research with a conviction-weighted approach to portfolio construction. This patient investment approach seeks outperformance regardless of market environment.  Palisade’s Small Cap Core Equity portfolios are available through separately managed accounts, subadvised mutual fund engagements, a collective investment trust, and various wrap, SMA and UMA platforms.Learn More









Convertible Securities
Palisade's six-member Convertible Securities team, led by Senior Portfolio Manager Bill Lee, is responsible for managing our Convertible Securities (CS), Short Duration Convertible Bond (SDCB), and Hedged Convertibles (HC) portfolios. Our team’s extensive experience, discipline through market cycles, and strong equity research help distinguish Palisade from our peers. CS portfolios are available through separate accounts and subadvised mutual fund engagements, SDCB portfolios are available through separate accounts, and HC portfolios are available through separate accounts and a private fund (available only to Accredited Investors).Strategies:Convertible SecuritiesShort Duration Convertible BondHedged Convertibles









Private Wealth Management
Private Wealth Management has served as a cornerstone of Palisade’s business since the firm’s founding in 1995. Our highly experienced team of Private Wealth Portfolio Managers average over three decades each of building and managing diversified portfolios for individuals, families, and organizations. Each manager works directly with clients to understand their individual financial needs, expectations, and goals, and then designs a portfolio that fits these unique circumstances.Learn More









Private Equity
Since 1997, Palisade has raised five private equity funds totaling over $400 million in capital.  Our Private Equity funds seek to achieve attractive total returns through investments in small-to middle-market private and out-of-favor small public companies that represent “special situations” or growth opportunities. Palisade’s private equity funds are currently fully invested and are no longer open to new investors.Learn More

A fundamentally differentway to invest.


As an independent asset manager established in 1995, Palisade Capital Management thinks, invests, and treats our clients in a manner that is fundamentally different from other managers. We believe in putting clients first, constant communication, fundamental research — and much more. 


We invite you to see the difference being different can make:

Institutional Investors
Individual Investors















Focused All Cap Equity
Palisade’s Focused All Cap Equity strategy is led by Senior Portfolio Manager Will Potter with the support of Analyst Mark Berman.  Our objective is to invest in a diversified, yet focused portfolio of well-managed companies in all capitalization ranges. Through fundamental research, we seek to narrow the universe down to a portfolio typically comprised of 20-30 compounders of shareowner value. We prefer portfolio company management teams that distinguish themselves through continuous operational improvement, highly-competitive corporate strategies, and disciplined/effective deployment of capital. Palisade’s Focused All Cap Equity strategy is currently available through separately managed accounts.Learn More









Small Cap Core Equity
Led by Senior Portfolio Manager Marc Shapiro, Palisade’s experienced four-member Small Cap Core Equity team utilizes a research-intensive, disciplined investment process that integrates bottom-up fundamental stock research with a conviction-weighted approach to portfolio construction. This patient investment approach seeks outperformance regardless of market environment.  Palisade’s Small Cap Core Equity portfolios are available through separately managed accounts, subadvised mutual fund engagements, a collective investment trust, and various wrap, SMA and UMA platforms.Learn More









Convertible Securities
Palisade's six-member Convertible Securities team, led by Senior Portfolio Manager Bill Lee, is responsible for managing our Convertible Securities (CS), Short Duration Convertible Bond (SDCB), and Hedged Convertibles (HC) portfolios. Our team’s extensive experience, discipline through market cycles, and strong equity research help distinguish Palisade from our peers. CS portfolios are available through separate accounts and subadvised mutual fund engagements, SDCB portfolios are available through separate accounts, and HC portfolios are available through separate accounts and a private fund (available only to Accredited Investors).Strategies:Convertible SecuritiesShort Duration Convertible BondHedged Convertibles









Private Wealth Management
Private Wealth Management has served as a cornerstone of Palisade’s business since the firm’s founding in 1995. Our highly experienced team of Private Wealth Portfolio Managers average over three decades each of building and managing diversified portfolios for individuals, families, and organizations. Each manager works directly with clients to understand their individual financial needs, expectations, and goals, and then designs a portfolio that fits these unique circumstances.Learn More









Private Equity
Since 1997, Palisade has raised five private equity funds totaling over $400 million in capital.  Our Private Equity funds seek to achieve attractive total returns through investments in small-to middle-market private and out-of-favor small public companies that represent “special situations” or growth opportunities. Palisade’s private equity funds are currently fully invested and are no longer open to new investors.Learn More
