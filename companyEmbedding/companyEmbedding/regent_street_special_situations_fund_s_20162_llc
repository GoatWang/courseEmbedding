Small Cap Awards Winners 2016 Announced
17th June 2016

The fourth Small Cap Awards winners were announced last night at Montcalm Hotel in Marble Arch, London, Thursday 16 June 2016. Hamlins were delighted to co-sponsor the annual  awards alongside ICAP Securities & Derivatives Exchange (ISDX),  the Social Stock Exchange and UHY Hacker Young. The event was also supported by the London Stock Exchange.
Over 200 guests, all supporters of the small cap community comprising of advisers and their companies, congregated at a black tie event which was hosted by Peter Dickson (the voice of television programme The X-Factor) with a keynote speech by one of the UK’s best known politicians, Lord Young of Graffham, former Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. Until recently he was Enterprise Adviser to the Prime Minister with a brief to conduct a “brutal” review of the relationship of government to small firms.
Lord Young gave encouragement to young entrepreneurs and told the audience they were the future of UK mid-cap and FTSE100. He spoke of Brexit and said that whatever the outcome, the outlook was in his view still positive for the UK as long as it maintained a non-regulatory environment.
The awards shone a light on the best companies and participants in the small and micro-cap community (sub £150m market capitalisation) across twelve categories. They are a once-in-a-year opportunity to recognise outstanding achievement focused on smaller quoted companies.
The event follows the success of the Small Cap UK network founded by Lily and Piper, a specialist integrated Events Company. Hamlins have been a supporter of both the Small Cap Awards and the Small Cap Club since their establishment in 2012.
