Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)

What is a Hedge Fund? A Closer Look at Hedge Funds.
There are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking. The hedge fund is just one of those, but it is also the one that is worth looking at. There’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle, but it is not always a tough nut to crack. What investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to.
How Do Hedge Funds Work?
Hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets. However, it is not open to every individual investor. Rather, the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown. Managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund, and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund.
It is theoretically similar to mutual funds, but they differ in the techniques. That’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors. There are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds, hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio.
Adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments. Hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but that’s on a case to case basis. If the assets are large enough, the SEC will require reports. Hedge fund managers, however, are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face anti-fraud measures.
A Brief History of Hedge Funds
Hedge funds have a very long history. People and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early 21st century. The funds never lost popularity over time. Before the recession hit, there was a total value of US$1.93 trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide. The industry had a brief hiccup afterwards, because of the sub-prime mortgage crisis, but it eventually recovered. This is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are, and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers.
Hedge fund assets totaled $2 trillion worldwide by April 2011, just three years after the crisis burst. By the third quarter of 2014, the worldwide value of assets under management or AUM is at $2.38 trillion and may continue to grow in the next years.
Hedge Fund Strategies
Hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but, rather, they employ a combination of various strategies. It is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives.
There are, however, some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use. Hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market.
Here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use, either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets:

Global macro

This type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions. Managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments. The Global Macro approach leverages multiple markets, and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements. This approach is very flexible, and very diversified as well because there are many variations of sub-strategy under this umbrella.

Directional

The directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis. Instead, directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments. A typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term, and to couple that position with short-term buying and selling to hedge against risk.

Event-driven

Hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences. For instance, company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price. Event-driven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur. Even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from event-driven hedge fund managers.

Relative value

Relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those. This is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far. Analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic, as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies.
How Do Hedge Fund Managers Approach Risk?
As mentioned above, hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation. That is where risk mitigation comes in. In fact, managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings.
The most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify. The entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments, and varying investment positions. For instance, some of the funds may be put into long-term positions in low-risk, low-return funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time.
A portion of the funds may be invested in high-risk, high-return investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term, taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment.
In addition, hedge fund companies may employ risk officers. These are not people who are directly involved in trading, but have knowledge in how markets work. These risk officers will focus on identifying long and short-term risks to the assets under management, and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets.
Other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence.
Offshore and Onshore Hedge Funds
Because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment, hedge fund managers can be found all over the world. There are two types of hedge fund management companies, and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers. Their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings.
Offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences. For example, US-based investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments, particularly in retirement funds, will turn to offshore hedge funds. This helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds.
On the other hand, if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the United States, they can expect the US government to slap withholding taxes on their investments. However, there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not double-taxed for any increase on the value of their assets. Only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments.
The presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation. In addition, it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of double-taxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally.
Prominent Centers of Investment
The United States remains the center of global hedge fund management. 70% of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission has in its registry nearly 4,000 financial experts, as of April 2012, who handled management of hedge funds. These are found across the US, but most of them are based in New York City and Connecticut’s Gold Coast.
As for European hedge funds, London is the home of the managers with over 800 of them found in the city. In 2011, these firms were responsible for managing 85% of the hedge fund assets from continental Europe.
There is a growing market in Asia, particularly in Japan. Growing economic centers Hong Kong and Singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management, but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the US and London in Europe. In fact, most of the hedge funds from Asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers.

Hedge Funds are not the only alternative way to invest in the investment universe. A different class of investment are Managed Futures.

 
Commodity trading advisors are these that provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds. Managed Futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements. Because hedge funds are usually stock picking and don’t provide crisis alpha, managed funds which do, are a good way to avoid painful market correction.

Tracking Small-Cap Super Investor Bares Capital Management - Q2 2014 | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Tracking Small-Cap Super Investor Bares Capital Management - Q2 2014Aug. 21, 2014  9:15 AM ET|| Includes: ATU, CEB, CFX, CRMT, ECOL, FHCO, GHM, HEI, INTL, MIDD, MLAB, OFLX, PAH, POST, REIS, RLD, TAX, TLF, UTMD, WINA, XPOby: Unconventional Capital WisdomUnconventional Capital Wisdom Value, long-term horizon, worldly wisdom, growth at reasonable priceUnconventional Capital Wisdom LLCSummaryTracking small-cap super investors might be more worthwhile for smaller investors than tracking large-cap super investors.Bares Capital has been graduating to larger small-cap equities.The firm's reduction of small and micro-caps is likely due to both the graduation and also due to the Nine Ten Partners LP transfer.Investors often check the holdings of super investors, but they often limit themselves to investors that focus on larger mid-cap or large-cap companies. Super investors with a lot of capital to manage are restricted to those larger companies, while investors with smaller amounts of capital do not have the same restrictions. A continued run up in the overall market, especially the larger more well known companies, leaves those large super investors with an even more limited number of companies to choose from. While they might have trouble finding ideas, there still are 1,000s of smaller companies that go unnoticed by analysts, the market and larger institutions. To circumvent this, investors can follow super investors that focus on micro-caps and small-cap companies where there tends to be greater opportunities to find inefficiently priced quality companies, even in bull markets.
One investor that has been restricting their assets under management to continue to invest in micro-caps and small-caps is Brian Bares. Although we do not know his firm's exact performance, we do know that in his first year of operation his fund returned 66% on ~$1 million and fourteen years later manages over a billion dollars.
His philosophy tends to lean towards Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger focusing on owning only a hand full of quality businesses, with quality managers and allowing the company to internally compound capital at high rates. Since he began focusing on micro-caps he essentially was finding those quality companies in their infancy and letting them compound capital at high rates. The following interview gives a better idea of Brian Bares' philosophy.
Brian has written about the institutional investing imperative where super investors tend to start in the inefficient small-cap space and once achieving high performance, they have a profit incentive to gather more assets - institutions are also more likely to invest - thus making it more difficult to continue investing in the micro-cap and small cap areas of the market. He calls this graduating to bigger markets where there is more institutional competition and more efficient markets.

Q2 Portfolio Changes
Bares Capital has been able to continue to invest in the micro-cap space (<$300 million market cap) since Bares was content capping assets under management, which is unusual with institutional fund managers. What we have noticed, however, is that Bares Capital Management looks to continuing graduation from micro-caps to small caps above $400 million in market cap and most above $1 billion. Looking at the firms transactions in the recent quarter, eight out of the eleven companies below $400 million in market cap saw their positions reduced. (INTL, WINA, REIS, FHCO, UTMD, OFLX, TLF).

(Source: Mkt cap from Yahoo Finance, SEC Filings, Our Calculations)
It is likely that these positions have been reduced less for valuation reasons and more to do with the firm's graduation to larger equities since Bares Capital manages $1.2 billion AUM and companies in the over $400 million market cap constitute more than 70% of the firm's portfolio.
What is also notable is that in the last few months, the above companies have been transferred from Bares Capital to Nine Ten Partners LP, which is a hedge fund directed by Bares Capital. What is interesting is that only these small-cap companies have been listed, so far, under Nine Ten Partners, while the larger company holdings are yet to be listed with Nine Ten. Our educated guess is that some institutions and the partners of Bares elected to continue their focus on micro-caps and smaller small-cap companies. As we guessed in this article, the transfer is likely to have caused Bares to reduce their positions potentially due to giving some capital back to some investors. XPO Logistics (NYSEMKT:XPO) is another position that was reduced in the quarter - that is well above $300 million - that is also included as Nine Ten's holdings.

The only companies with an ~$300 million market cap that were added to were Americas Carmart (NASDAQ:CRMT), Graham Corp (NYSEMKT:GHM) and Mesa Laboratories (NASDAQ:MLAB). Only Graham Corp has been listed as a Nine Ten holding as well.
Positions Significantly Increased
(We exclude the many small holdings)
Post Holdings - (NYSE:POST) This position was originally purchased last year in the same quarter and has grown from 2.68% of the portfolio to 10.31%. Bares added 8% or 184k shares during the quarter and the position is likely to have fallen as a percentage of the whole portfolio due to the recent decline in share price. It is quite likely that with the high conviction Bares could be adding to the position with the decline in share price.
Middleby Corp - (NASDAQ:MIDD)
This position was originally purchased at the end of 2010 at an average price of ~$25 per share and with continued purchases and large upside in the share price, the position is 7% of the portfolio. Only 2% of the stake increased from the last quarter.
Corporate Executive Board - (NYSE:CEB)
This position increased 5% to 7.7% of the portfolio and has likely been added to since the drop at the end of July.
Platform Specialty Products - (NYSE:PAH)
This is another recent addition to the portfolio from last quarter. Only 5% of the stake increased since the original position was initiated last quarter making it a 6.35% position of the total portfolio.
Heico Corp. Class A - (NYSE:HEI)
This position has been in the portfolio for a number of years starting from 1% of the total portfolio. In the second quarter the position was increased by 18% to 4.78% of the total portfolio.
Liberty Tax - (NASDAQ:TAX)
This position was first purchased in the first quarter and grew 22% to 0.35% of the portfolio.
Positions Insignificantly Increased
Actuant Corp - (NYSE:ATU)
This position was originally purchased in the first quarter of last year and has grown from 5.32% of the portfolio to 9.94%. Half a percent of the stake was increased in the quarter.

Colfax Corp - (NYSE:CFX)
This position was originally purchased in the second quarter of 2010 at an average price of ~$12 a share and has been increased every quarter since to 9.62% of the portfolio. Largely, the increase in the stake value is attributable to the nearly 4.5x increase in share price since the original investment. About 0.2% of the stake was increased the past quarter.
RealD - (NYSE:RLD)
This position was originally purchased at the end of 2012 and it has grown from 5.92% of the portfolio to 8.54%. This stake increase was also not too significant.
U.S. Ecology - (NASDAQ:ECOL)
This position was significantly added to in the first quarter, however, in the second quarter less than 1% of the position was increased. U.S. Ecology currently makes up 5.47% of the total portfolio.
