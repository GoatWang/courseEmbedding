Full Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy covers the privacy practices that Totango INC and it’s parent company Totango Metrics LTD (“Totango”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) employs in providing the Totango Service (the “Service”) to our customers, including their personnel (collectively, “Customer(s)”). It explains what data we collect, including Personally Identifiable Information (defined below), about (i) Customers; and (ii) the customers and clients of our Customers (“End Users”), and how we collect, use and retain such data. The use of information collected through our Service shall be limited to the purpose of providing the Service for which our clients have engaged Totango.
 
Introduction:
We are committed to respecting privacy and recognize the need for appropriate protection and management of any Personally Identifiable Information that is shared with us as part of the Service. As used in this Privacy Policy, “Personally Identifiable Information” means any information that may be used, either alone or in combination with other information, to personally identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, personal profile, a home or other physical address, an email address or other contact information.
 
Totango Service Description:
We provide the Service in order to enable our Customers to collect information about their End Users’ activities on our Customer’s web service and/or other software services offering (“Customer Service”) and to provide our Customers with a global view of those activities.
 
What Information We Collect and How We Collect It.
As the provider of the Service, we receive and/or collect data, which may contain Personally Identifiable Information, in the following ways:
3.1. Customer Account Information. As part of the Service, we may collect or obtain information (including Personally Identifiable Information) that a Customer provides about itself, such as the Customer’s account name, and email address, company information and related information about its personnel (“Customer Data”).
3.2. End User Data. As part of the Service, a Customer may provide us with data, including Personally Identifiable Information, such as a user’s email address to store on the Customer’s behalf about an End User in connection with the End User’s use of the Customer Service (“End User Data”). Totango has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. We work with our Customers to help them provide notice to their End Users concerning the purpose for which Personally Identifiable Information is collected. We may transfer Personally Identifiable Information to companies that help us provide our Service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our Customers.
3.3. Transactions. We may collect or obtain information, including Personally Identifiable Information, from each Customer in order to complete the Customer’s subscription to the Service. Such information could include a credit card number, related account and billing information, and other data required to process the order. We may update such data should a Customer grant us permission to bill a credit card for recurring charges, such as monthly or other types of periodic payments. We may use the tools, software or services of third party service providers to process transactions on our behalf, in which case the terms of use and/or privacy policy of said third party service provider shall also apply to the transaction. These third party service providers are authorized to use your Personally Identifiable Information only as necessary to provide these services to us.
3.4. Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies. Technologies such as: cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by Totango and our partners e.g. marketing partners, affiliates, or analytics or service providers e.g. online customer support provider, etc. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.
3.5. Analytics / Log Files. As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically using Analytics technology and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.
3.6. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as HTML 5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs.
We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking here (or if located in the European Union click here). Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.
4. The Way We Use Information.
4.1. We will use the Customer Data of a Customer to provide and improve our Service to the Customer, to contact the Customer, and to identify and authenticate the Customer’s access to our services that the Customer is authorized to access.
4.2. We will store End User Data on behalf of the related Customer in order to provide the Service to that Customer.
4.3. We will share your Personally Identifiable Information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. We do not sell your Personally Identifiable Information to third parties.
4.4. We may engage third party hosting providers to store information, including Personally Identifiable Information, on our behalf. Such information may be stored on servers located in different countries around the world. We only engage third party hosting providers that post a privacy policy governing their processing of Personally Identifiable Information.
4.5. We may transfer Personally Identifiable Information to our affiliated companies located in other countries around the world in order for them to perform business functions or services for us or on our behalf, such as customer service. We require that these affiliated companies agree to process such information in compliance with our Privacy Policy. Any information provided to these companies is used only as necessary to provide these services to us.
4.6. We will retain your information for as long as your account is active. We reserve the right to retain any Personally Identifiable Information, End User Data we process on behalf of our Customers and other Service- related data for such time as we are providing the Service to the Customer to which the information relates and for a reasonable time thereafter. We will retain and use information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
4.7. If your Personally Identifiable Information changes, or if you no longer desire our Service, you may correct, update or amend by making the change in your account/profile settings page or by emailing our Customer Support. We will respond to your request to access within 30 days. Totango has no direct relationship with the individual End Users’ personal data it may processes. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, delete inaccurate data or withdraw consent for further contact should direct his query to the Totango Customer they deal with directly. If the Customer requests Totango to remove the data, we will respond to their request within 30 days. In any event, we will delete or  amend any Customer’s or End User’s Personally Identifiable Information that we are storing if we receive a written request to do so. Any such request should be addressed to privacy@totango.com and include sufficient information for Totango to identify the Customer or End User and the information to delete or amend.
Upon request Totango INC will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information. You may access, correct, or request deletion of your personal information by contacting us at support@totango.com. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.
4.8. Email Opt-Out. If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s), (accessable from our blog page) we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, you may choose to stop receiving our newsletter or marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these emails, accessing the email preferences in your account settings page or you can contact us at privacy@totango.com
4.9. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may disclose Personally Identifiable Information or any information that we receive in connection with the Service if we have a good faith belief that disclosure of such information is helpful or reasonably necessary to (i) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request; or (ii) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Totango, our Customers, End Users, or the public.
In certain situations, Totango may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
Anonymous Information.
We may use Anonymous Information (defined below), or disclose it to third party service providers, to provide, improve and/or develop the Service. From time to time, we may disclose Anonymous Information as part of our participation in an industry wide benchmark for the benefit of the online software community. Each Customer may opt-out from such benchmarks at any time by emailing us at privacy@totango.com. “Anonymous Information” means information which does not enable identification of an individual user, such as aggregated information, about the use of the Service.
 
Children’s Privacy.
The Service is not structured to attract children under the age of 18. Accordingly, we do not intend to collect Personally Identifiable Information from anyone we know to be under 18 years.
 
In the Event of Merger, Sale, or Change of Control.
We may transfer or assign this Privacy Policy and any Personally Identifiable Information to a third party entity that acquires or is merged with Totango as part of a merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control (“Change of Control”). Should such a Change of Control occur, Totango will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use the Personally Identifiable Information in a manner that is consistent with Totango’s privacy policies. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your Personally Identifiable Information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your Personally Identifiable Information.
 
Security.
The security of Personally Identifiable Information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personally Identifiable Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
We use SSL technology to encrypt data (such as your credit card information) during transmission, and we also employ application-layer security features to further anonymize sensitive data. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect Personally Identifiable Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
 
9. Blog/Forum.
Our Website offers a publicly accessible blog and a community support forum which allow user generated comments. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them.
Our blog is also managed by a third party application that may require you to register to post a comment. We do not have access or control of the information posted to the blog that is managed by a third party application. You will need to contact or login into the third party application if you want the personal information that was posted to the comments section removed. To learn how the third party application uses your information, please review their privacy policy.
 
10.Single Sign on.
On certain pages of our site, such as the support forum or the careers page, you can access their functionality by using an authentication service such as Twitter, Google or “Apply with Linkedin”. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain Personally Identifiable Information with us such as your name and email address. Services like these may give you the option to post information about your activities on this Web site to your profile page to share with others within your network.

Totango Releases ROI Metrics to Help Companies Monitor Product Performance


Improved satisfaction measurements aim to give organization tailored customer insights.

Totango, a provider of cloud-based customer success management tools, yesterday announced the release of ROI Metrics, which aims to help companies more precisely measure product performance among customers.According to Kaiser Mulla-Feroze, chief marketing officer at Totango, all too often brands rely on ineffective metrics to determine customer health. "Measurements like customer satisfaction surveys, NPS scores, or the number of existing customer support tickets are subjective," Mulla-Feroze says. "How often [does a company] run a satisfaction survey? And what does that tell [it] about the health of [its] customers?"ROI Metrics tries to fill those gaps. The package builds on Totango's customer engagement platform, which uses sensors to keep track of data that flows across specified Web pages. The Formula Builder feature allows users to create custom metrics that offer insights into ROI in particular areas. Those results can also be used to compose customer profiles and reports that can be shared throughout a company. ROI Metrics can allow a hotel, for example, to gauge how much extra revenue has been generated by an app allowing customers to upgrade to better rooms.For Totango, the release is a further push to steer companies toward the customer engagement data that can be collected from their own products. Mulla-Feroze suggests that the information companies can glean from their own apps can be just as valuable as the data they store in CRM and ERP systems. He believes that as more businesses adopt subscriptions models, it will become increasingly important to create ways to generate revenue with existing customers. "Over time, the revenue that you get from your existing customers shadows the revenue that you're going to get from your new customers, given the way that the business model works," Mulla-Feroze says. "Companies like Netflix and Amazon have excelled at understanding what users are doing, and what experiences they're having within their applications and services. Those companies have a clear revenue edge on the market because of this. That's what we're trying to get across to an entire terrain of digital and subscription businesses."Experts working in the space agree that tools to operationalize customer health data are welcome. "Sometimes brands need help seeing how looking at the customer experience will relate to things like long-term customer lifetime value," says Dr. Natalie Petouhoff, principal analyst at Constellation Research. She points out that companies will often neglect the 90 percent of forum users who typically don't comment on a product, instead feeding off what the 10 percent who do comment are saying. "Brands can get left in the dark and suddenly go out of business, not realizing how unhappy customers were, or that the business was in trouble. Because those brands are not paying attention, they don’t know what customers feel.""Digital business models reward the post-sale, on-demand, attention economy," adds Ray Wang, founder of Constellation Research. "What happens after the sale is the long tail in value creation, especially as we are buying products and services in smaller increments."

 Your own business metrics in Totango


Totango helps you speak your own metric language, custom metric is a new feature from Totango Analytics team and it is available to all our ProPlus and Enterprise customers.
This advanced analytics feature allows Totango administrators to define and create your own business metrics within Totango - you can use any numeric data element or computed metric that is in your Totango account. This new feature can be found under the Settings menu as Metrics.Creating your own metrics is simple and easy to test and validate.  
With the custom metrics, you will be able to define and create up to 20 metrics and formulas that relate specifically to your business.  
This article will guide you through the simple process of creating your own metric.
 
Computed Metrics Use Case Examples
Basic Use Case
As a CS Manager at Zendesk I would like Totango to compute my engagement score instead of computing its out of the box engagement score. I will configure a computed metric of (tickets per agent) in order to accomplish this metric.
Analytics Use Case
As a CS Executive at Optimizely I want to understand how my customers are adopting the value of new module that I delivered.  My new module is called “analytics”. I will create a custom formula for UDM equal to “total activities in analytics module per user per day” and expose it on each account profile.  I will build lists and reports to track its trend.
Health Configuration Use Case
As a CEO I want to know who are my power users in all of the important modules of my application.  For me it is reporting, workflow and mobile. I will create a custom metric equal to sum of total activities per user in all these modules in the last 7 days. If the metric value is greater than zero, I will know that my users used one of these modules.  I can make this part of my health configuration because if the value of this metric is greater than 10 activities per day, then I can consider my customers to be green in health.
 
Implementation Instructions
This is a step by step guide which will help you implement your first custom metric.
As the CS director, I would like to know what is my application ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) per user, he would like to name it: “Active User Price”.
His desired formula is:   [contract value]  / [active users in last 30 days]
How to implement it in Totango:As a Totango administrator, you can open the “Metrics” page in the “Settings” menu
 

Create a new metric by clicking on the “Add Metric” button, the metric formula editor opens.

Enter a metric name, and display type, and start drag & drop the metric components from the left menu to the gray formula canvas.


Totango out of the box metrics, numeric attributes, specific activity count and a specific module count can be used in the metric formula editor.
Once the metric looks fine, you can preview the metric results based on your real accounts data.
In this mode, you can review all the formula components, and final result, and change the display type.

Once you okay with the metric results, save it.

The metric is now shown in the metric page, the metric display name and display type can be changed, and you can decide if this metric will be shown in the account profile.A user can define a metric and not expose it in the account profile by unchecking the “Show in account profile” checkbox.
Your metric is now fully defined, the first time a metric is created it takes few minutes to be available in health configuration, active lists, reports, and account profile.


 
How To Consume The New Custom Metric
The new metric can be used across Totango, in health configuration, active lists and reports. 
View custom metrics in account profile
Use custom metrics to configure your health



Filter active lists based on custom metrics


 

Use custom metrics as active lists columns


Add report breakdowns based on custom metric
 

 

That’s it, you have created and learned how to consume your first custom metric.
Now you can create a meaningful and creative custom metrics in Totango.
This feature is available to Totango customers on ProPlus edition.

Customer Success Management Software Overview | TrustRadiusAre You a Tech Marketer?HomeCustomer Success Management SoftwareCustomer Success Management SoftwareFollowing Follow CategoryOverviewListingsReviewsArticlesOverviewListingsReviewsArticlesFollowing Follow CategoryBest Customer Success Management SoftwareTrustMaps are two-dimensional charts that compare products and services based on end-user satisfaction ratings and research
frequency by prospective buyers. You can filter the data by company size, because small businesses and enterprises can have very different needs.Products and services must have 10 or more ratings to appear on the TrustMap,
and those above the median line are considered Top Rated.  Top Rated Customer Success Management Software include: Gainsight, Intercom, and ClientSuccess.Other Customer Success Management Software on the TrustMap include: Woopraand Totango.A complete list of Customer Success Management Software is available here.Customer Success Management Software OverviewWhat is Customer Success Management?Customer Success Management is a relatively new phenomenon
that came about as a result of the growing trend of the Software-as-a-Service
(SaaS) business model and the subscription economy. When companies purchase
software as a cloud-deployed monthly subscription rather than a large, upfront
cost for on-premises solutions, it’s easier for unsatisfied customers to switch
vendors. Since the bulk of profit is no longer an upfront cost, but rather a
much lower monthly fee, vendors must keep customers around in order to derive
revenue.
Therefore, some B2B technology vendors focus on ensuring
their customers are successful – i.e. deriving continuous and growing value
from the technology product – in order to reduce churn rate and increase upsell
and cross-sell rates. This involves actions such as selling to the right
customers in the first place, making sure they are using the product through
onboarding and training, providing proactive tech support, and making them
aware of ways to expand their use of the product. In some cases the traditional
Account Manager role has transitioned to Customer Success Manager.Benefits & Capabilities of Customer Success Management Software
Customer Success Management Software is intended to help
companies improve customer retention through increased visibility into the
customer base. One key feature is tracking customer usage and adoption of your
product, which can allow you to identify at-risk customers (or power users) and
set up alerts or automated personalized responses.
Other capabilities include NPS surveys, customer health
scoring, customer profiles, and rule-based automated workflow (i.e., trigger
actions based on changes in customer data or engagement). Many CSM software
products integrate with email marketing or marketing automation solutions to
enable triggered communications based actions the customer takes within the
vendor’s product. Products like Intercom enable this kind of contextual, usage-based communication in-product, whereas products like Woopra and Pendo provide the usage statistics and segmentation capabilities that CSMs can use to trigger communications from within other systems. (Customer success is one use case for these three products; however they are also used by other customer experience/engagement teams, such as Marketing, and are more likely to be integrated with than compete directly with full CSM suites.) Gainsight, Totango, ClientSuccess, and Natero are examples of broader Customer Success Management suites.
The benefits of using Customer Success Management Software
include the ability to proactively find customers that need attention,
prioritize areas of response, identify upsell and cross-sell opportunities, optimize
the customer lifecycle, and discover customer advocates.
The software is primarily used by customer success managers,
account managers and sales executives.Customer Success Management Listings Listings   All Types   ListingsSearchListings (1-25 of 25)Sort by: Reviews | Highest Rated | Lowest Rated | Alphabetical | Product | Service(172) 8.6GainsightGainsight says they enable business transformation through their passionate community, proven expertise, and cutting edge technology.

It is used by CSMs, AMs, product managers, and marketing. We have several workflows implemented and have started to send campaigns.It allows us to be more pro-active and anticipate potential issues with our clients. The business is really getting value from Totango and more and more people are using it beyond the CS team.ProsTrack client usageDefine workflowsIntegrate with SalaesForceIntegrate with ZendeskTriggering campaignsConsNot all features are properly integrated - like success plays and segments. We are using Totango to generate all the on boarding tasks but are managing them on Salesforce as Totango was somehow limitedCampaigns are fairly basic - difficult to monitor who has received one. Not integrated properly with Salesforce or HubSpotSegments and Reports can have limitationsData and activities limitationLikelihood to Recommend9.0Great to manage our onboarding workflow, even if we have to manage it from Salesforce.Great to generate alerts and triggersGreat to give a clear view of each rep's portfolioCampaigns are good but need to be improvedData can sometimes be a bit messy and not consistent from one feature to anotherLike any system, getting it adopted by the team has been difficultfrom Cyrille Saulnier's Full Review (5 More Sections)Stephen WilsonSr. Director of Customer Success | Media Production | 201-500 employeesUser Review: "It Actually Only Takes One: Totango"9 of 10  |  5/12/2017Invited By: TrustRadius | Incentive: YesUse Cases and Deployment ScopeOur Customer Success and Renewal Sales organization uses Totango to provide insight into client utilization, client health, contract status, and client "TouchPoints" and interactions with the CSMs and Sales team. Allows us to create playbooks (Sets of actions) for our CSMs for certain conditions like a new contact is in play, or client has a support incident logged. It helps address the need for more granular real time insight into client health so we don't have to rely on lagging indicators like NPS or CSAT Survey scores. It is critical we get out in front of any potential client issues as well as understand how our CSMs are interacting with their portfolio of clients.ProsTotango really allows flexibility in dashboarding a client contract. You can pull in all the relevant metrics into one spot to help make efficient use of CSM and management time.Integrates well with Salesforce contract records. This is nuanced, but other vendors interact at the "opportunity" level in SFDC. For Services execution, it needs to be focused on the contract. This allows a lot of flexibility in designing the flow.Reporting is pretty easy to set up. You can slice and dice the segments and create reports based on these segments.There are a wide range of "TouchPoint" options in Totango, so you can log Kick Offs, QBRs, Renewals, Escalations, Nurture... TouchPoints. Super easy for CSMs to add and Management to report on.ConsWhile the TouchPoints are flexible, they display on the date entered in. This assumes that all TouchPoints are put in when they are being done. Would like to see them allow the ability to backdate TouchPoints.Report setup is a bit quirky. Not bad, but you have to wrap your head around how they do it.Would like to see more chart options, but this is me being geeky.Likelihood to Recommend9.0Great for CSM and Client Services teams. Can help increase collaboration with Sales side. Really helps frame out how CSMs should be spending time and definitely helps with what clients to focus on. Has allowed us to stop focusing last minute on renewals and get a longer view to catch potential churn.Not really a "Support" software or [meant to] take the place of something like Zendesk.from Stephen Wilson's Full Review (3 More Sections)Nate RichardsonBusiness Operations and Analytics Manager | Computer Software | 201-500 employeesUser Review: "It takes two to Totango"10 of 10  |  11/7/2016Invited By: TrustRadius | Incentive: YesUse Cases and Deployment ScopeTotango is used to provide business intelligence to Customer Success, Consulting, Onboarding, Professional Services, Sales, Marketing, and Support groups.ProsIntuitive DesignReliableFastConsNewness of the Enterprise platform is apparent. Have encountered more than a few bugs.Likelihood to Recommend10.0Totango seems like it is best suited for companies that are focused on scalable customer success strategies over high touch. Totango is also very useful for companies that have a strong account based marketing strategy in place. from Nate Richardson's Full Review (8 More Sections)George MarkouCustomer Success Manager | E-Learning | 11-50 employeesUser Review: "Totango - A must for any CSM"9 of 10  |  11/7/2016Invited By: TrustRadius | Incentive: YesUse Cases and Deployment ScopeTotango is currenlty being used by the entire organization in order to track our customers' engagement with the product, their general health, as well as to segment our customer base, keep track of the current and past MRR and revenue/other cost metrics, and finally as a platform that facilitates email campaigns. ProsEasy to set up health metricsEmail campaigns with included goals and statistics in relation to themAccount segmentationConsVarious minor bugs and glitchesInability to remove accounts/users yourselfRevenue center is still very basicLikelihood to Recommend9.0Totango excels in account/user segmentation; its campaign module is also very reliable and useful. It is intuitive to use and easy to set up. Its revenue center is not currently as useful. The current integration with Salesforce was both very easy to achieve and has provided us with a great insight to our product process.from George Markou's Full Review (5 More Sections)Cecilia PradoDigital Marketing Coordinator | Education Management | 51-200 employeesReview: "Do you really know if your customer is happy with your product and willing to do a renewal? Totango knows."9 of 10  |  10/27/2016Invited By: TrustRadius | Incentive: YesUse Cases and Deployment ScopeTotango is being used to minimize the impact of unexpected churns; to measure and increase sales and the customer success teams' productivity and to get product optimization insights.Today, it is used mainly by 3 teams: customer success, operations, and product development. Customer success is totally guided by Totango's insights. They constantly monitor their account's health and design strategies to increase customers' satisfaction together with the operations team.The health score given by Totango is even in these team's business goals related to compensation and bonus. The health scenario is also analysed by the company directors frequently in order to understand the impact of customer success' actions.ProsAccount's health and changes overview: In the homepage, which is your "dashboard", you can clearly see your portfolio's health and what has changed since your last update. In this way, it is easy to get fast insights and move accounts to your "attention center".Health history: It's easy to see health changes over time and by clicking in the date range, you see what criteria were impacting this health at that time.Account's hierarchy: For my business, it's really important to be able to group accounts and have more than one level of customers (companies and groups of companies, for example). This way, it is possible to design and deploy strategies to different decision makers.Easy health profile set up: The Health Profile set up page is really easy to use, with simple calculations features to determine what is good and poor health for your customers.Tasks and touchpoint monitoring: Although these features have some room for improvement (e.g.: edit options, paragraph, bold or topics could make a huge difference when you want to record long conversations or detailed topics), they are really user friendly and make it easy for the account manager to write down notes on the customer's updates.ConsRetroactive actions: Today, Totango is not able to understand past data and make changes on customer's health based on that, which is a representative gap when you don't have real-time integration with your product.Experience for offline data upload: Since we don't have a real-time integration with our product (we upload on a CSV data basis), it would be better if Totango was more adapted to this kind of use. An example of a gap in this matter is that Totango doesn't understand the "Timestamp" when the actions were made, which means it is like all the actions you uploaded were made in the second you were uploading your CSV, instead of when it was actually made by your user. Although I know this development is on the product team's radar, it still does not have any forecast for the launching.Block users to see data of different portfolios: When you have a big company and you don't want to share your revenue information or key contacts data with sales/CS managers who don't own the specific account, you have a certain gap with Totango. I know they are aware of that and planning some improvements, but today you cannot hide any data from any user, which means every Totango's user in your company can search and find data from every account. Its impacts are minimized by the portfolio set up (a segment of your homepage/dashboard), but the users are still able to find the data using the accounts search field.Likelihood to Recommend9.0If you are beginning your customer success strategy and want have a lot of data to put together in a health rank you have to monitor frequently, Totango should definitely be considered. It has an easy implementation (for both offline/CSV data and easy integrations like Segment.io) and an onboarding process. It will give you a fast answer about how your features and the product usage are impacting customer health. Also, after a contract renewal cycle, you will be able to improve your guess on what good and poor health really is for your customers.If you have trouble with unexpected churn and your forecast are still based on account managers' analysis, you should definitely get to know Totango and how it could help you not only with this matter but also with increasing your team productivity [that is] focusing on the risky accounts.On the other hand, if you already have a customer success department and a health rank/score implemented and are working fine with internal tools or other tools, you should analyse if Totango would represent a huge progress on your strategy or not.from Cecilia Prado's Full Review (5 More Sections)Mathieu Brillon, MBA, PMPDirector, implementations | Information Technology and Services | 51-200 employeesTotango Review: "Infinite possibilities"7 of 10  |  10/24/2016Invited By: TrustRadius | Incentive: YesUse Cases and Deployment ScopeTotango is used by a newly created team of customer success managers to proactively manage our portfolio of clients.ProsThe automated touchpoints and tasks based on rules align well with a CSM strategy.ConsThe integration hub is a little weak.

ProsAggregate customer data.Analyze usage & adoption and use it to trigger health warnings and proactive account management.Monitor CSM engagement.ConsLack of flexibility for business models outside of core (subscription-model SaaS).Complex implementation, very hands-on.Likelihood to Recommend7.0It seems especially well suited to subscription SaaS platforms that sell subscription licenses. We have had trouble adapting to our business model (essentially pay-per-use).

Based on user actions or health status, you can automatically assign tasks to team members to take action.Automated emails. Based on user actions or health status, you can automatically send emails to customers.ConsProject management. There is some functionality in this area, but we are currently using an external application for project management for our onboarding process in order to handle the advanced functionality we need.Likelihood to Recommend9.0It's less appropriate for a company primarily looking for project management.from Josh Carlson's Full Review (6 More Sections)Authenticated ReviewerAccount Manager in Sales | Computer Software | 51-200 employeesUser Review: "Thumbs up for Totango"9 of 10  |  9/2/2016Invited By: TrustRadius | Incentive: YesUse Cases and Deployment ScopeTotango is mainly used by our Customer Success team; but, as an account manager I use it to understand the overall health of my accounts including usage of the TrackMaven app, latest communication from the CX team, etc. From my lens, it helps the complimentary teams (AM/CX) ensure we know everything we need to when strategizing on an account. For CX, they live in Totango and record all campaigns, touchpoints, sentiment, etc. so without access to it, I'd be pretty lost as to how my customers are doing.ProsIt monitors the usage of our application well - we can see who logs in and how frequently so we can make inferences as to how much value our customers are getting from our softwareIt records all communication effectively in a log format - you can even bcc emails to Totango and they're automatically loggedIt stores and automates delivery of campaigns to our customers who are more "light touch" - we can see who opens the emails and if it moves the needle of app usageConsI have to use Salesforce to do my job - SFDC/Tontango can communicate and exchange data, but for the most part I have to manually input data to one or the other when I wish there was more integrationWhen you record touchpoints you can't go back and edit them if you made a mistake/typoLikelihood to Recommend9.0When I want to touch base with an Executive at one of my accounts I always log on to Totango to get a sense of who is using TrackMaven, how frequently, and what communication CX has had with them recently. It helps round out my account knowledge so I'm going into meetings and conversations prepared. It's less appropriate from a strategic perspective - for instance, if I see end users active and healthy in their TrackMaven account that's a great sign, but I don't know if that necessarily means we're helping to solve something for executives who own budget. In all, Totango achieves what it's meant to and is a key ingredient for me to do my job.from Authenticated Review (4 More Sections)Jamie WangDirector, Customer Success Consultants | Internet | 51-200 employeesTotango Review: "Imperative for Customer Success and Many Other Teams"10 of 10  |  8/22/2016Invited By: TrustRadius | Incentive: YesUse Cases and Deployment ScopePrimarily customer success and support is making use of Totango. We are using the tool to track user engagement to see the various actions specific users are taking. This helps us better understand use cases and challenges a user my face. Beyond that, it gives a nice quick glance into seeing what is happening across a large group of customers to try and find clients falling into bad health and proactively reach out to them if they have stopped using the tool.The benefits also extend to our product team to track the effectiveness of new feature releases.Also, the sales team has not yet implemented it, but it will be helpful for them to track how various leads are using the software during their trials.ProsSupport and Customer Success have been very helpful in teaching/coaching and responding quickly.Tool has never gone down or let us down when we needed to access important data.Interface and usability is super straightforward and easy to use.They are consistently releasing new, relevant features.Consif you connect through Segment.io it requires you to go one plan higher on segment in order to use Totango (but it's not a lot of money),Sometimes the Totango created 'engagement' score can be a bit tricky to understand rather than our own created health metrics and health scores we use Totango for.Likelihood to Recommend10.0Totango can be very helpful for product and marketing and sales teams but I do think the most success is in customer success and support to identify risks and keep close tabs on how various users are using the system. Rather than just tracking accounts, it it cool to track multiple end users for B2B SaaS with multiple end users. Our billing team also used it for credit card disputes to prove clients used the tool if there were ever disputes.from Jamie Wang's Full Review (2 More Sections)Authenticated ReviewerAccount Manager in Sales | Information Technology and Services | 51-200 employeesTotango Review: "Fantastic Product for Account Managers/CSMs"10 of 10  |  8/2/2016Invited By: TrustRadius | Incentive: YesUse Cases and Deployment ScopeTotango is being used by the customer success organization to manage daily/weekly/monthly/etc. customer engagement. In past organizations, the frequency of customer engagement, the application of different success plays, and the overall results of customer strategies were fairly ad-hoc. Totango has been able to act as the main hub for all customer engagement activity, metrics, and strategy.ProsI've worked with two other mainstream Customer Success-focused products in the past, and found their UIs very complex, particularly around navigation and creating custom reports. One in particular required heavy assistance from the product's CSM to stand up custom reports. I find that Totango has a very intuitive user interface and a simplified approach to reporting. Best of all, my Totango Customer Success Manager (CSM) is in frequent communication throughout the course of the month so I rarely ever feel 'stuck.'Being a fairly heavy Salesforce user in past roles, I was highly critical of the Sales and Account Management teams working in silos: Sales in Salesforce, and Account Managers in Totango. Totango gives you plenty of import/export options with Salesforce in mind so that Account Managers like myself don't have to worry about double-entry of notes and other data points.My favorite features by far are creating tasks and touch points. It's incredibly simple, and includes a timeline of events on the customer profile page so that you can easily glance at the most recent activity.ConsWhen customizing a current report and saving under a different name, at times it overwrites the previous report. This requires you to go into the previous report and undo any edits that were made.I've never felt more care and attention from a CSM team before, but at times they can overcommunicate; more than 2 or 3 times a week.They should consider relocating the "What's New" tab somewhere more visible. I often forget to scroll all the way to the bottom of the screen and check on which new features have been released.Likelihood to Recommend10.0For post-sales scenarios where you need to manage the customer relationship based on a set of attributes (ie. usage, case load, website engagement, etc.), Totango is one of the more superior products on the market. For pre-sales scenarios, it seems as if other tools on the market would work just fine such as Salesforce or any one of their competitors.from Authenticated Review (5 More Sections)John AbrahamCustomer Success Manager | Internet | 1001-5000 employeesReview: "When it comes to Business Totango is your Adviser"7 of 10  |  8/2/2016Invited By: TrustRadius | Incentive: YesUse Cases and Deployment ScopeTotango is mainly used to find our clients' usage of our software.

Instead of going the alternate expensive BI route, we decided that Totango provided enough insight into how our users are using our platform as well as how often. We are currently using Totango throughout our entire Customer Success department but information gets shared to Sales, Marketing, Product as well as to the VP and CXO levels. Totango has helped us understand our user and account adoption. We understand where our customers stand, what activities they're using our product for, etc. Totango has been key in making us a customer-centric company. ProsTotango makes it easy to understand how users/companies are using your product.Totango always provides support whenever you need it. Val and Joseph are awesome to work with. Heck, I've even hung out with them during the Customer Success Summit.They always find a way to meet your needs. They found workarounds for us to get the data we need.ConsReporting on more data points not just limited to accounts.Being able to drill down to specific dates not just "the last 1, 3, 7, 30 days"An easier way to add activities into a segment. We have almost a hundred activities so adding a hundred columns is quite a timely process.Likelihood to Recommend9.0As a BI substitute to understand how your users are using your product, Totango works fairly well.

It also allows us to track customer health by seeing how much they are interacting with our platform and what modules they use.ProsAllows you to see an in-depth view of how your customers are interacting with your product in terms of both time spent and what parts they use.Helps multiple teams coordinate communications across accounts and track tasks that need to be fulfilled for the customer.Allows you to easily send outreach emails to wide segments of customers based on custom criteria.ConsThe app itself can be pretty slow, especially when you are trying to perform activities across multiple accounts.It can be difficult to track large organizations who have multiple workspaces in our platform, particularly on an enterprise level.Likelihood to Recommend8.0Totango is great for serving mid-market customers on SaaS platforms and tracking how they interact with your app. It is also well suited for a scenario where multiple teams are reaching out to customers so you can coordinate easily.Totango can be hard to use with enterprise customers as it can be difficult to get the hierarchies within the enterprise set up.from Sam Rutzick's Full Review (2 More Sections)Philip Nguyen, SCPMHead of Communities and Customer Success Management | Computer Software | 51-200 employees"Totango review"8 of 10  |  7/22/2016Invited By: TrustRadius | Incentive: YesUse Cases and Deployment ScopeMy team uses Totango across my organization.

It helps us to know the current customer health, get alerted about changes in health, and perform actions and tasks based on that health. Before we used it, we could only use our own metrics to gauge their usage, but now we can track clicks, actions, and users and set health scores based on it. ProsTracking logins and clicks on certain areas of our site.Create automated tasks based on health score or actions.Look at overall team performance based on customer health.ConsAs a management tool there are many areas and feature that could be built. Currently it's mainly a CSM tool, as opposed to a tool for managers of CSMs.Creating tasks that aren't based on account - this would help us to use the tool to manage overall and would increase daily usage for managers and CSMs.Email reporting is limited to 10 accounts - it would be great to see much more in reports (such as all accounts in bad health).Likelihood to Recommend9.0It's suited for customer sucess managers (CSM), and less for managers.
