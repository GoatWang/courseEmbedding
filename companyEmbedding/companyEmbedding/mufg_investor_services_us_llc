T. Rowe Price mutual funds are subject to ongoing management fees and may be subject to redemption fees. An IRA may be subject to an annual fee, and a fee may be assessed when an IRA is closed. See prospectus for details.

The mutual funds referred to in this website are offered and sold only to persons residing in the United States and are offered by prospectus only. The prospectuses include investment objectives, risks, fees, expenses, and other information that you should read and consider carefully before investing.
Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 6/30/17, 72 of 108 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

*157 of our 332 mutual funds had a 10-year track record as of 6/30/17 (includes all share classes and excludes funds used in insurance products). 134 of these 157 (85%) funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 215 of 317 (68%), 183 of 225 (81%), 149 of 180 (83%), of T. Rowe Price funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
36 of our 39 Retirement Funds had a 10-year track record as of 6/30/17 (includes all share classes). 34 of these 36 funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 38 of 39, 38 of 39, and 35 of 36 of the Retirement Funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
Source: Lipper Inc. 162 of 213 funds (excluding institutional and bank institutional funds as defined by Lipper) more than 6 months old had expense ratios below their Lipper averages based on fiscal year-end data available as of 6/30/17.
The principal value of the Retirement Funds is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The funds’ allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term postretirement withdrawal horizon. The funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The funds maintain a substantial allocation to equities both prior to and after the target date, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.

MUFG Investor Services, the global asset servicing arm of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, has named Joe Latini as executive director of relationship management. Previously, Latini worked at ENSO Financial Analytics where he served as a director of U.S. sales.
PRESS RELEASE
New York, 5 April 2017 – MUFG Investor Services, the global asset servicing arm of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, has appointed Joe Latini as Executive Director of Relationship Management.
Joe will be responsible for managing relationships with existing clients across MUFG Investor Services’ alternative asset servicing platform. He will work alongside the current relationship management team to develop clients’ strategy and ensure they receive the highest level of service throughout the investment cycle.
Formerly a Director of US Sales at ENSO Financial Analytics, Joe brings over 18 years of experience from business development roles in the investment industry. Prior to ENSO, Joe spent the majority of his career at Morgan Stanley in various client facing roles. Most recently he was an Executive Director in Prime Brokerage, acting as a senior member of the Relationship Management team. Joe will be based in New York and will report to Mac Kirschner, Global Head of Client Relationship Management.
The announcement follows a string of 2016 hires that saw MUFG bring in a hall of industry veterans to bolster its growth commitment to asset servicing. This includes Michael McCabe from BNY Mellon’s Alternative Investment Services business, Daniel Trentacosta from Och-Ziff Capital Management Group, Mac Kirschner from BlackRock, and Marc Russell-Jones from State Street. 





Mac Kirschner said: “Joe’s experience and background speak to how we differentiate our talent in the asset servicing space. Joe’s ability to develop operational and technological solutions for investment managers will continue to drive deeper partnerships with clients. MUFG is much more than a service provider, and Joe embodies this philosophy. His appointment demonstrates our commitment to our clients as they continue to look for operational leverage.”
Joe Latini said: “MUFG Investor Services’ commitment to strategically grow the business, while consistently providing the highest quality client service and experience is what excites me most. I look forward to working with premiere clientele and continuing to enhance our best in class product. It’s a very exciting time for sure.”

MUFG Investor Services has agreed to acquire Rydex Fund Services, a mutual fund administration business, from Guggenheim Investments. No financial terms were disclosed for a deal that’s expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year.
PRESS RELEASE
New York, 28 July – MUFG Investor Services, the global asset servicing group of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, and Guggenheim Investments, the global asset management and investment advisory business of Guggenheim Partners, today announced that they have entered into an agreement in which MUFG Investor Services will acquire Guggenheim’s 1940-Act mutual fund administration business, Rydex Fund Services. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.
When consummated the deal will complete MUFG Investor Services’ full service offering for investment managers, adding regulated 1940 Act mutual fund and exchange traded fund services expertise to a comprehensive service proposition, which spans single manager, fund of hedge fund, private equity and real estate funds, pension funds and traditional asset managers.
The acquisition when completed will add $52 billion to MUFG Investor Services’ assets under administration (AuA) bringing total AuA to $422 billion. The assets serviced by Rydex Fund Services primarily consist of Guggenheim and Rydex branded mutual funds, exchange-traded products and closed-end funds, for which Guggenheim Investments will continue to serve as investment advisor. 





Junichi Okamoto, Group Head of Trust Assets Business Group, Deputy President, Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking Corporation said: “The acquisition of Rydex Fund Services will strengthen our position as an industry-leading administrator and is an important part of our commitment to supporting the growth of new clients and extending our services to existing clients. This deal will add capabilities which will allow us to respond more dynamically to our clients’ changing needs, enabling them to fully realize new market opportunities and support their growth ambitions.”
John Sergides, Managing Director, Global Head, Business Development and Marketing, MUFG Investor Services, said: “Demand for liquid alternative strategies has risen significantly in recent years as retail investors recognize the return potential and diversification benefits relative to traditional asset classes. Alternative fund managers are increasingly establishing ‘40-Act fund structures to access this growing market. We recognize the challenging environment our clients face and continue to enhance our offering to support the strategies that managers must deliver, both now and in the future. Our complete offering will allow us to become the partner of choice for alternative fund managers of all sizes, strategies and structures.”
Nikolaos Bonos, Head of Rydex Fund Services, commented: “MUFG Investor Services will provide new opportunities for us to extend and enhance our ‘40-Act fund administration experience for the benefit of our current and future clients. Aligning our team within the MUFG Investor Services group will enable us to respond to rising demand for liquid alternatives with a comprehensive service proposition that supports the development of investment managers’ businesses.” 





Upon completion, MUFG Investor Services will be acquiring all of Rydex Fund Services’ business and intends to provide a seamless transition for its employees and clients.
Terms of the deal are undisclosed.

T. Rowe Price mutual funds are subject to ongoing management fees and may be subject to redemption fees. An IRA may be subject to an annual fee, and a fee may be assessed when an IRA is closed. See prospectus for details.

The mutual funds referred to in this website are offered and sold only to persons residing in the United States and are offered by prospectus only. The prospectuses include investment objectives, risks, fees, expenses, and other information that you should read and consider carefully before investing.
Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 6/30/17, 72 of 108 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

*157 of our 332 mutual funds had a 10-year track record as of 6/30/17 (includes all share classes and excludes funds used in insurance products). 134 of these 157 (85%) funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 215 of 317 (68%), 183 of 225 (81%), 149 of 180 (83%), of T. Rowe Price funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
36 of our 39 Retirement Funds had a 10-year track record as of 6/30/17 (includes all share classes). 34 of these 36 funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 38 of 39, 38 of 39, and 35 of 36 of the Retirement Funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
Source: Lipper Inc. 162 of 213 funds (excluding institutional and bank institutional funds as defined by Lipper) more than 6 months old had expense ratios below their Lipper averages based on fiscal year-end data available as of 6/30/17.
The principal value of the Retirement Funds is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The funds’ allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term postretirement withdrawal horizon. The funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The funds maintain a substantial allocation to equities both prior to and after the target date, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.
