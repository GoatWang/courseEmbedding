HedgeZ Fund Profile
































Bostwick
Compound L.P.

















Fund Investment Objectives











                                        Bostwick Compound L.P. is a fund of long/short equity funds that invests with managers who are fundamentally driven, employ a rigorous research process, and take a long-term approach to investing. We seek to achieve superior absolute returns while managing risk through manager selection, diversification, and limited net exposure. Bostwick Compound LP provides investors with a diversified portfolio of long short funds through a single investment. Additionally, our long-term approach allows us to target tax efficiency. Our competitive advantages include access to mature closed funds, early access to emerging managers, unique industry experience, and a proprietary network for efficient due diligence. It would be difficult (or impossible) for most investors to replicate our portfolio.
