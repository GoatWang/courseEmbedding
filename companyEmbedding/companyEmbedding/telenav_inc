    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

                    TeleNav Asset Tracker
                

                    Verizon Wireless and TeleNav Inc.
                

                    May 23, 2011 - Products
                

BASKING RIDGE, NJ, and SUNNYVALE, CA – Verizon Wireless and TeleNav, Inc. announced the availability of TeleNav’s Asset Tracker.  The product provides enterprise customers, utilizing location-based services (LBS) enabled wireless devices, with near real-time location information, as well as critical activity alerts, for cargo, delivery trucks, or other mobile assets.
TeleNav Asset Tracker relies on the Verizon Wireless data network to enable machine-to-machine (M2M) data transfer between the company’s portable monitoring devices and TeleNav’s servers, making the data available to organizations via a secure, Web-based portal.  With devices in place inside shipments or on mobile assets, management is able to use TeleNav’s portal to monitor the location of assets and manage device properties, such as enabling activity alerts.
TeleNav Asset Tracker also provides management with dynamic maps offering street and satellite views for identification of an asset’s location.  Real-time alerts can be configured to send notifications when an asset enters or leaves a predetermined geo-fenced area, stops for an extended period of time or if there is a loss of communication with the tracking device.
Organizations can use this real-time location information to enhance supply chain and logistics operations by:
Monitoring the status of high-value shipments in transit between warehouses and delivery sites
Triggering specific activities, such as loading dock preparation, when cargo enters pre-determined areas to improve supply chain efficiency
Reducing theft and vandalism and increasing asset recovery by triggering automatic alerts when cargo moves locations
Providing security for trucks and loads traveling in remote locations or in extreme conditions
Accessing detailed historical data on the transit of cargo to support customer reporting requirementsPrimary beneficiaries of TeleNav’s asset tracking technology include manufacturers and distributors involved in shipping of consumer products, apparel, electronics, pharmaceuticals and other high-value goods.
TeleNav Asset Tracker works with the PT200, a portable, rugged tracking device, manufactured by Sendum, that can be placed in packages, containers or mounted to equipment.  The device can be easily moved from one asset or container to another, giving organizations flexibility in what they choose to monitor at any given time. 
The Sendum PT200 uses assisted GPS, a technology that combines satellite GPS with cellular tower triangulation data, to provide rapid “first fix” triangulation as well as location information when the device is connected to the Verizon Wireless network but does not have satellite line of sight.  The device is also designed for extreme conditions, working in temperatures ranging from minus 20 degrees to 60 degrees Celsius (minus 4 to 140 degrees Fahrenheit).
Additional features include:
Device information, alerts and notifications delivered to the management portal via the Verizon Wireless data network
Rechargeable, quick-change, high-capacity lithium ion battery packs capable of powering the device for a long duration in the field
Comprehensive reporting – on demand or scheduled reporting cycle
Battery level alert notifications
Geo-fence function to report when assets leave or enter a defined area
Integrated temperature sensor
Intelligent power management which conserves battery life and minimizes network usage

History[edit]





This section reads like a press release or a news article and/or is entirely based on routine coverage. Please expand this article with properly sourced content to meet Wikipedia's quality standards, event notability guideline, and/or encyclopedic content policy. (June 2016)


Founding[edit]
Telenav, founded as “Televigation” was first established in 1999 by HP Jin, YC Chao, Sal Dhanani and Robert Rennard to provide GPS-based navigation software on mobile devices.[1]
1999-2004[edit]
In December 2000, Telenav launched myPNA (My Personal Navigation Assistant) WAP service to Sprint. The product allowed users to retrieve directions between two addresses and search for local points-of-interest (POIs).[2]
In 2002, Telenav developed a real-time mobile navigation product for Nextel/Motorola Java phones using a tethered GPS receiver developed by GlobalSat. The following year, Navigator was created for the BlackBerry 7520, RIM’s first GPS-enabled device.
2005-2009[edit]
Sprint Navigation was introduced in 2005. Catering to Sprint devices, Telenav created a line of mobiled-based applications with 3D navigation capability available for wireless subscribers using particular Sprint devices.[3]
Telenav Track, a product designed to help companies track their mobile resources including employees, vehicles and assets was launched in 2006.[4]
In 2009, Telenav announced their first Android app[5] available in Google Play and BlackBerry App world.[6]
Also, in June 2009, Telenav unveiled its first app for iOS, AT&T Navigator,[7] made available on the iPhone 3G and iPhone 3GS.
In March 2011, Telenav announced a stand-alone application, Telenav GPS Navigation, available for all iOS users.[8]
2010-present[edit]
Telenav completed its Initial Public Offering[10] (IPO) in May 2010 and began trading on the NASDAQ under the symbol TNAV.[11] With the completion of its IPO, Telenav became the first mobile LBS company to enter into public trading.
In 2010, Ford announced it had also selected Telenav to provide GPS navigation software in its new MyFord Touch driver connect technology.[9] During the summer, Telenav announced a partnership with U.S. Cellular Corporation[12] (U.S.C.C.) to bring mobile GPS navigation service to wireless subscribers.
In September 2011, Telenav acquired the Boston-based company, Goby Inc., a local and travel search company.
At CES 2012, Telenav announced new iPhone app, Scout, a GPS and discovery app with integration with the web and automotive. Also at CES, Ford announced Scout as the navigation service for some vehicles.
Most recently, Telenav announced Scout for Apps, in March – a service for mobile web and app developers to include turn-by-turn, voice-guided GPS navigation within their mobile app or website via HTML5.
In January 2014 Telenav acquired Skobbler, a producer of navigation software for Android and iPhone based on OpenStreetMap for $23.8 Million.[10]
Products[edit]
Telenav offers a number of location-based products serving the mobile consumer and enterprise markets.
Scout[edit]
Announced in January, 2012,[11] Scout was launched for iPhones. The free mobile app features mapping and navigation support, and allows users to access real-time commute times, current location, search and weather.
Scout.me[edit]

At the frontier of doing "on the go" better
At Telenav, we've always been about making people's lives less stressful, more productive, and more fun when they are on the go. We started on this mission in 1999 when we pioneered GPS navigation for mobile phones and changed how people get from point A to point B. Over the years, we have paved the way for a bigger end-to-end mobility transformation for all people on the go — starting with connected car solutions for drivers.
Our Products
We provide connected car and advertising solutions that are built on our powerful location platform.

These experiences are powered by our comprehensive set of location services across the car, mobile, and cloud including global one-box search, real-time traffic, dynamic routing, fully interactive maps, and ADAS features.



Global platform that meets regional needs
Our robust location platform enables top global automotive companies to deliver experiences that help their drivers save time, stay safe, and reduce stress.

MISCELLANEOUS
This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Telenav and you with respect to the subject matter hereof. Telenav’s or your failure to require performance of any provision shall not affect that party’s right to require performance at any time thereafter, nor shall a waiver of any breach or default of this Agreement constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself.

SCOUT
Scout allows you to obtain via your wireless device GPS-assisted navigation instructions to destinations throughout most of the United States or Canada, depending on your cellular carrier. Use of Scout requires payment of a monthly fee, which includes download to your wireless device of the Telenav GPS Navigator software and any upgrades, modifications, or additions thereto (collectively, "Telenav Software"), but does not include any hardware that may be required for certain wireless devices (such as a standalone GPS receiver). A complete description of Scout is available at the Products link on Telenav's website, located at www.telenav.com/products/tn/.
Scout is for your internal business and personal use and is not for resale or other transfer or disposition to any other person or entity.
Scout utilizes map and other data licensed to Telenav by third parties for the benefit of you and other end users. This Agreement includes end-user terms required by these companies (set forth at the end of this Agreement), and thus your use of Scout is limited by and subject to such terms.

You agree to comply with the following when using Scout:

Do not use Scout for any illegal, unauthorized, unintended, unsafe, hazardous, or unlawful purposes, or in any manner inconsistent with this Agreement.

Telenav also does not warrant the accuracy of the map or other data used for Scout. Such data may not always reflect reality due to, among other things, road closures, construction, weather, new roads and other changing conditions.

To the fullest extent permissible pursuant to applicable law, in no event will Telenav, its licensors and suppliers, or agents or employees of any of the foregoing, be liable for any decision made or action taken by you or anyone else in reliance on the information provided by the Telenav Services or the Telenav Software. You are responsible for the entire risk arising out of your use of the Telenav Services and the Telenav Software.
The Telenav Services and the Telenav Software are provided "as is" and without warranties of any kind either express or implied. Telenav disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. Applicable law may not allow certain warranty exclusions, so one or more of the above disclaimers may not apply to you.
OTHER QUALIFICATIONS
You understand and agree that the Telenav Software is downloaded to your wireless device at your own discretion and risk and that you will be solely responsible for any damages to your wireless device, or loss of data, that results from the download of such software. 
Telenav does not warrant that the Telenav Services or the Telenav Software will not infringe on third party intellectual property rights.
Telenav also does not warrant that your use of the Telenav Services will be uninterrupted or error-free. Rather, temporary interruptions of the Telenav Services may occur from time to time (such as when you drive into an area that has no cell phone coverage or when the Telenav Services or your carrier's network is undergoing maintenance). Telenav will exercise reasonable efforts to attempt to limit or prevent such occurrences, but in no event will Telenav be liable for any financial or other damages due to such interruptions.
Telenav also does not warrant the accuracy of the map or other data used for the Telenav Services. Such data may not always reflect reality due to, among other things, road closures, construction, weather, new roads and other changing conditions. 
Telenav has technological and operational security policies and procedures to protect your information from loss, misuse, alteration, or unintentional destruction, but Telenav makes no representations or warranties regarding the security of the Telenav Services or the transmission of data or information to and from Telenav and your wireless device. Telenav will not be liable to you or anyone else in the event of any unauthorized infiltration of any of its systems.
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
To the extent permitted under applicable law, under no circumstances shall Telenav or its licensors (or their licensors and suppliers) be liable to you or anyone else for any loss, injury, or damages (including but not limited to any compensatory, punitive, special, incidental, indirect, exemplary or consequential damages) arising out of or in connection with the use by you or anyone else of the Telenav Services or the Telenav Software, any defects in the Telenav Services or the Telenav Software, or any breach of this Agreement, even if Telenav or its licensors have been advised of the possibility of such damages. 
Applicable law may not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability or incidental or consequential damages, so the above exclusion may not apply to you.
INDEMNIFICATION
To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to indemnify, defend and hold Telenav and its licensors (including their respective licensors, suppliers, assignees, subsidiaries, affiliated companies, and the respective officers, directors, employees, shareholders, agents and representatives of each of them) free and harmless from and against any liability, loss, injury (including injuries resulting in death), demand, action, cost, expense, or claim of any kind or character, including but not limited to attorney's fees, arising out of or in connection with your use of the Telenav Services or the Telenav Software.

The arbitrator shall apply the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, and the judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered by any court having jurisdiction. Note that there is no judge or jury in an arbitration proceeding and the decision of the arbitrator shall be binding upon both parties. 
This Agreement and performance hereunder will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to its conflict of laws provisions. You agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the County of Santa Clara, California.
MISCELLANEOUS
This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Telenav and you with respect to the subject matter hereof. 
Telenav's or your failure to require performance of any provision shall not affect that party's right to require performance at any time thereafter, nor shall a waiver of any breach or default of this Agreement constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself.
If any provision herein is held unenforceable, then such provision will be modified to reflect the intention of the parties, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.
You may not resell, assign, or transfer any of your rights hereunder. Any such attempt may result in termination of this Agreement, without liability to Telenav. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Telenav may assign this Agreement to any affiliate at any time without notice.

Scout® with OSM
Please read these terms and conditions of use ("Terms of Use") carefully before you launch Scout® ("Scout") on your wireless device. Your use of Scout indicates that you accept these terms and conditions. If you do not accept these terms and conditions, do not launch or otherwise use Scout.
INTRODUCTION
These Terms of Use represent the agreement ("Agreement") between you and Telenav, Inc. ("Telenav") with respect to Scout. All references herein to "you" and "your" means you, your employees, agents, and contractors, and any other entity on whose behalf you accept these terms and conditions, all of whom shall also be bound by this Agreement.
Telenav may revise these terms and conditions at any time, with or without notice to you. You should visit www.telenav.com from time to time to review the then current terms and conditions for Scout.
SCOUT
Scout allows you to obtain via your wireless device GPS-assisted navigation instructions to destinations throughout most of the United States or Canada, depending on your cellular carrier. Use of Scout requires payment of a monthly fee, which includes download to your wireless device of the Telenav GPS Navigator software and any upgrades, modifications, or additions thereto (collectively, "Telenav Software"), but does not include any hardware that may be required for certain wireless devices (such as a standalone GPS receiver). A complete description of Scout is available at the Products link on Telenav's website, located at www.telenav.com/products/tn/.
Scout is for your internal business and personal use and is not for resale or other transfer or disposition to any other person or entity.
Scout utilizes map and other data licensed to Telenav by third parties for the benefit of you and other end users. This Agreement includes end-user terms required by these companies (set forth at the end of this Agreement), and thus your use of Scout is limited by and subject to such terms.
YOUR LOCATION AND ROUTE INFORMATION
For Telenav to provide Scout, Telenav must record your route information, including your point of origin, the address of your destination, the starting time of your trip, and the route you are instructed to follow, and must periodically receive your GPS location from the GPS hardware associated with your wireless device.
In using Scout, you allow Telenav to access your GPS hardware and otherwise obtain this location and route information, and to record, compile and display such information internally. Such information is subject to Telenav's privacy policy located at www.telenav.com. Your use of Scout indicates that you accept the terms of Telenav's privacy policy.
If you are using Scout with Ford Applink: (1) you allow Ford Motor Company to access your vehicle GPS hardware and send your GPS location to Telenav so that Telenav may record, compile and display GPS location and route information internally; and (2) your use of Scout with Ford Applink indicates your consent to Ford Motor Company accessing your vehicle GPS along with the serial number of the SYNC module, and sharing your GPS with Telenav (for information on SYNC, see your Owners Guide). If you do not want Ford to access your vehicle GPS, do not use Scout with Ford Applink.
SAFE AND LAWFUL USE OF SCOUT
You agree to comply with the following when using Scout:

Observe all traffic laws and otherwise drive safely.
Use your own personal judgment while driving. If you feel that a route suggested by Scout instructs you to perform an unsafe or illegal maneuver, places you in an unsafe situation, or directs you into an area that you consider to be unsafe, do not follow such instructions.
Do not input destinations, or otherwise interact with Scout, unless your vehicle is stationary and parked.
Do not use Scout for any illegal, unauthorized, unintended, unsafe, hazardous, or unlawful purposes, or in any manner inconsistent with this Agreement.
Arrange all GPS and wireless devices and cables necessary for use of Scout in a secure manner in your vehicle so that they will not interfere with your driving and will not prevent the operation of any safety device (such as an airbag).

Before your paid Scout application will be activated, you must: (i) provide Telenav with a valid major credit card (American Express, VISA or MasterCard); (ii) enter into a direct billing or prepaid agreement with Telenav; or (iii) subscribe to Scout through your wireless telephone carrier, and agree to pay the relevant charges to such carrier.
You agree to pay all fees charged to your account for Scout (including applicable state and local taxes), in accordance with Telenav's billing terms in effect at the time the charge becomes payable. You will be charged such fees each month, even if you do not use Scout. Telenav reserves the right to change the fees for Scout at any time, upon prior notice to you.
If payment cannot be charged to your credit card or your credit card charge is returned to Telenav for any reason, or you otherwise fail to pay the charges for Scout when due, Telenav reserves the right to pursue any and all legal remedies to collect the amounts owed by you, and to suspend or terminate your access to Scout.
TELEPHONE CHARGES
You are responsible for any fees assessed by your wireless telephone carrier to access Scout, including any data plan charges, toll, out-of-area, roaming, or other telephone connection charges.

ACCOUNT INFORMATION
You agree: (a) when signing up for Scout, to provide Telenav with true, accurate, current, and complete information about yourself, and (b) to inform Telenav promptly of any changes to such information to keep it true, accurate, current and complete.
If you provide Telenav with any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Telenav has reasonable grounds to suspect so, Telenav has the right to suspend or terminate your access to Scout.

Telenav GPS Navigator™ for BlackBerry™
Please read these terms and conditions of use ("Terms of Use") carefully before you launch Telenav GPS Navigator, Telenav GPS, or Telenav GPS Plus ("Telenav Services") on your wireless device. Your use of the Telenav GPS Navigator indicates that you accept these terms and conditions. If you do not accept these terms and conditions, do not launch or otherwise use the Telenav GPS Navigator.
INTRODUCTION
These Terms of Use represent the agreement ("Agreement") between you and Telenav, Inc. ("Telenav") with respect to the Telenav Services. All references herein to "you" and "your" means you, your employees, agents, and contractors, and any other entity on whose behalf you accept these terms and conditions, all of whom shall also be bound by this Agreement.
Telenav may revise these terms and conditions at any time, with or without notice to you. You should visit www.telenav.com from time to time to review the then current terms and conditions for the Telenav Service.
THE TELENAV SERVICE
The Telenav Service allows you to obtain via your wireless device GPS-assisted navigation instructions to destinations throughout most of the United States or Canada, depending on your cellular carrier. Use of the Telenav Service requires payment of a monthly fee, which includes download to your wireless device of the Telenav GPS Navigator software and any upgrades, modifications, or additions thereto (collectively, "Telenav Software"), but does not include any hardware that may be required for certain wireless devices (such as a standalone GPS receiver). A complete description of the Telenav Service is available at the Products link on Telenav’s website, located at www.telenav.com/products.
The Telenav Service is for your internal business and personal use and is not for resale or other transfer or disposition to any other person or entity.
The Telenav Service utilizes map and other data licensed to Telenav by third parties for the benefit of you and other end users. This Agreement includes end-user terms required by these companies (set forth at the end of this Agreement), and thus your use of the Telenav Service is limited by and subject to such terms.
Use of MyMileage within the Telenav Services is subject to additional terms located at www.telenav.com/legal/terms-of-use.html.
YOUR LOCATION AND ROUTE INFORMATION
For Telenav to provide the Telenav Service, Telenav must record your route information, including your point of origin, the address of your destination, the starting time of your trip, and the route you are instructed to follow, and must periodically receive your GPS location from the GPS hardware associated with your wireless device.
In using the Telenav Service, you allow Telenav to access your GPS hardware and otherwise obtain this location and route information, and to record, compile and display such information internally. Such information is subject to Telenav’s privacy policy located at www.telenav.com. Your use of the Telenav Service indicates that you accept the terms of Telenav’s privacy policy.
SAFE AND LAWFUL USE OF THE TELENAV SERVICE
You agree to comply with the following when using the Telenav Service:

Observe all traffic laws and otherwise drive safely.
Use your own personal judgment while driving. If you feel that a route suggested by the Telenav Service instructs you to perform an unsafe or illegal maneuver, places you in an unsafe situation, or directs you into an area that you consider to be unsafe, do not follow such instructions.
Do not input destinations, or otherwise interact with the Telenav Service, unless your vehicle is stationary and parked. 
Do not use the Telenav Service for any illegal, unauthorized, unintended, unsafe, hazardous, or unlawful purposes, or in any manner inconsistent with this Agreement.
Arrange all GPS and wireless devices and cables necessary for use of the Telenav Service in a secure manner in your vehicle so that they will not interfere with your driving and will not prevent the operation of any safety device (such as an airbag).

PAYMENT
Before your Telenav Service will be activated, you must: (i) provide Telenav with a valid major credit card (American Express, VISA or MasterCard); (ii) enter into a direct billing or prepaid agreement with Telenav; or (iii) subscribe to the Telenav Service through your wireless telephone carrier, and agree to pay the relevant charges to such carrier.
You agree to pay all fees charged to your account for the Telenav Service (including applicable state and local taxes), in accordance with Telenav’s billing terms in effect at the time the charge becomes payable. You will be charged such fees each month, even if you do not use the Telenav Service. Telenav reserves the right to change the fees for the Telenav Service at any time, upon prior notice to you.
If payment cannot be charged to your credit card or your credit card charge is returned to Telenav for any reason, or you otherwise fail to pay the charges for the Telenav Service when due, Telenav reserves the right to pursue any and all legal remedies to collect the amounts owed by you, and to suspend or terminate your access to the Telenav Service.
TELEPHONE CHARGES
You are responsible for any fees assessed by your wireless telephone carrier to access the Telenav Service, including any data plan charges, toll, out-of-area, roaming, or other telephone connection charges. Standard messaging rates and other charges may apply when using certain features in the Telenav Service, such as Shared Address.
Telenav reserves the right to change at any time the phone number designated for you to access the Telenav Service, including eliminating any toll-free numbers.
TERMINATION
Telenav reserves the right to terminate your access to the Telenav Service at any time for any or no reason and without notice to you.

For a copy of Telenav’s refund policy, visit www.telenav.com.
ACCOUNT INFORMATION
You agree: (a) when signing up for the Telenav Service, to provide Telenav with true, accurate, current, and complete information about yourself, and (b) to inform Telenav promptly of any changes to such information to keep it true, accurate, current and complete.
If you provide Telenav with any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Telenav has reasonable grounds to suspect so, Telenav has the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Telenav Service.
All of your account information, as well as other payment and personal information provided by you to Telenav, is subject to Telenav’s privacy policy located at www.telenav.com. Your use of the Telenav Service indicates that you accept the terms of Telenav’s privacy policy.

To the fullest extent permissible pursuant to applicable law, in no event will Telenav, its licensors and suppliers, or agents or employees of any of the foregoing, be liable for any decision made or action taken by you or anyone else in reliance on the information provided by the Telenav Service or the Telenav Software. You are responsible for the entire risk arising out of your use of the Telenav Service and the Telenav Software.
The Telenav Service and the Telenav Software are provided "as is" and without warranties of any kind either express or implied. Telenav disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.
Applicable law may not allow certain warranty exclusions, so one or more of the above disclaimers may not apply to you.
OTHER QUALIFICATIONS
You understand and agree that the Telenav Software is downloaded to your wireless device at your own discretion and risk and that you will be solely responsible for any damages to your wireless device, or loss of data, that results from the download of such software.
Telenav does not warrant that the Telenav Service or the Telenav Software will not infringe on third party intellectual property rights.
Telenav also does not warrant that your use of the Telenav Service will be uninterrupted or error-free. Rather, temporary interruptions of the Telenav Service may occur from time to time (such as when you drive into an area that has no cell phone coverage or when the Telenav Service or your carrier’s network is undergoing maintenance). Telenav will exercise reasonable efforts to attempt to limit or prevent such occurrences, but in no event will Telenav be liable for any financial or other damages due to such interruptions.
Telenav also does not warrant the accuracy of the map or other data used for the Telenav Service. Such data may not always reflect reality due to, among other things, road closures, construction, weather, new roads and other changing conditions.
Telenav has technological and operational security policies and procedures to protect your information from loss, misuse, alteration, or unintentional destruction, but Telenav makes no representations or warranties regarding the security of the Telenav Service or the transmission of data or information to and from Telenav and your wireless device. Telenav will not be liable to you or anyone else in the event of any unauthorized infiltration of any of its systems.
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
To the extent permitted under applicable law, under no circumstances shall Telenav or its licensors (or their licensors and suppliers) be liable to you or anyone else for any loss, injury, or damages (including but not limited to any compensatory, punitive, special, incidental, indirect, exemplary or consequential damages) arising out of or in connection with the use by you or anyone else of the Telenav Service or the Telenav Software, any defects in the Telenav Service or the Telenav Software, or any breach of this Agreement, even if Telenav or its licensors have been advised of the possibility of such damages.
Applicable law may not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability or incidental or consequential damages, so the above exclusion may not apply to you.
INDEMNIFICATION
To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to indemnify, defend and hold Telenav and its licensors (including their respective licensors, suppliers, assignees, subsidiaries, affiliated companies, and the respective officers, directors, employees, shareholders, agents and representatives of each of them) free and harmless from and against any liability, loss, injury (including injuries resulting in death), demand, action, cost, expense, or claim of any kind or character, including but not limited to attorney’s fees, arising out of or in connection with your use of the Telenav Service or the Telenav Software.

Note that there is no judge or jury in an arbitration proceeding and the decision of the arbitrator shall be binding upon both parties.
This Agreement and performance hereunder will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to its conflict of laws provisions. You agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the County of Santa Clara, California.
MISCELLANEOUS
This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Telenav and you with respect to the subject matter hereof.
Telenav’s or your failure to require performance of any provision shall not affect that party’s right to require performance at any time thereafter, nor shall a waiver of any breach or default of this Agreement constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself.
If any provision herein is held unenforceable, then such provision will be modified to reflect the intention of the parties, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.
You may not resell, assign, or transfer any of your rights hereunder. Any such attempt may result in termination of this Agreement, without liability to Telenav. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Telenav may assign this Agreement to any affiliate at any time without notice.
By using the Telenav Service, you consent to receive from Telenav all communications, including notices, agreements, legally required disclosures or other information in connection with the Telenav Service (collectively, "Notices") electronically.

                                    Based on beautiful wrapper written by Rob Groves 
(https://secure.codeproject.com/database/CppSQLite.asp).
                                    Very good wrapper, but without unicode support unfortunately. 
                                    So, I have reconstructed it for unicode.

                                    2006-Jan-27 Copyright 1996-2002, 2006 by David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg
Introduction
The FreeType Project is distributed in several archive packages; some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine, various tools and contributions which rely on, or relate to, the FreeType Project.
This license applies to all files found in such packages, and which do not fall under their own explicit license. The license affects thus the FreeType font engine, the test programs, documentation and makefiles, at the very least.
This license was inspired by the BSD, Artistic, and IJG (Independent JPEG Group) licenses, which all encourage inclusion and use of free software in commercial and freeware products alike. As a consequence, its main points are that:

We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be interested in any kind of bug reports. ('as is' distribution)
You can use this software for whatever you want, in parts or full form, without having to pay us. ('royalty-free' usage)
You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use it, or only parts of it, in a program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that you have used the FreeType code. ('credits')

We specifically permit and encourage the inclusion of this software, with or without modifications, in commercial products.
                                    We disclaim all warranties covering The FreeType Project and assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.
Finally, many people asked us for a preferred form for a credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license. We thus encourage you to use the following text:
 """ 
                                    Portions of this software are copyright © 20XX The FreeType
                                    Project (www.freetype.org). All rights reserved.
                                    """ 
Please replace 20XX with the value from the FreeType version you actually use.
Legal Terms
                                    0. Definitions
Throughout this license, the terms 'package', 'FreeType Project', and 'FreeType archive' refer to the set of files originally distributed by the authors (David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg) as the 'FreeType Project', be they named as alpha, beta or final release.
'You' refers to the licensee, or person using the project, where 'using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source code as well as linking it to form a 'program' or 'executable'.
This program is referred to as 'a program using the FreeType engine'.
This license applies to all files distributed in the original FreeType Project, including all source code, binaries and documentation, unless otherwise stated in the file in its original, unmodified form as distributed in the original archive.
                                    If you are unsure whether or not a particular file is covered by this license, you must contact us to verify this.

These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the FreeType Project, not just the unmodified files. If you use our work, you must acknowledge us. However, no fee need be paid to us.
3. Advertising
                                    Neither the FreeType authors and contributors nor you shall use the name of the other for commercial, advertising, or promotional purposes without specific prior written permission.
We suggest, but do not require, that you use one or more of the following phrases to refer to this software in your documentation or advertising materials: 'FreeType Project', 'FreeType Engine', 'FreeType library', or 'FreeType Distribution'.
As you have not signed this license, you are not required to accept it. However, as the FreeType Project is copyrighted material, only this license, or another one contracted with the, grants you the right to use, distribute, and modify it.

Wireless Short Messaging Service (SMS)
Telenav makes every effort to comply with the Mobile Marketing Association (MMA) Consumer Best Practices Guideline for the use of text messages for conducting its word-of-mouth marketing campaign. To review these guidelines, go to http://www.mmaglobal.com/documents/best-practices.
Messages Delieverd by Telenav 
Case 1: Upon receiving activation notification from a wireless carrier, Telenav may send text messages to advise its subscriber that their Telenav accounts have been activated. Generally, these messages are sent via the messaging gateway owned by the wireless carrier that provisioned the order for Telenav services. Except for these activation confirmation messages, Telenav does not send any text messages on its own. 
Case 2: Telenav allows its mobile device application subscribers to share addresses and other relevant content with other parties using text messaging via Telenav's short code address. For example, if John Doe wants to share the address of a new club he likes, he can send the address to his friend Tom Smith from within the Telenav mobile device application. When Tom Smith receives the message, it will be sent from Telenav, Inc's short code, but opening the message will reveal that John Doe originated it. 
In both Case 1 and Case 2 above, the standard messaging rates (charges) imposed by the wireless carrier, if any, for delivering or accepting a message will apply. 
Ending Message Delivery
Every message sent via Telenav's short code includes instructions to reply STOP to stop future messages being sent on behalf of Telenav's customers. When Telenav receives a STOP message via a reply to its short code, Telenav is compelled by the MMA guidelines to inform the recipient of the original message that no additional messages will be sent, and to not deliver any further messages for any reason.
Obtaining Help 
If a message recipient wishes to get HELP on the Telenav services to better explain why he received the message, the recipient can send reply with HELP to the message, or any other person can send HELP to the Telenav short code, 69355, at any time. Telenav will respond with a message that directs the sender to this portion of the Telenav.com web site.
Restarting Services 
If a recipient, or any other person, has sent STOP, CANCEL, or any other word that could be reasonably interpreted as meaning the recipient wanted text messages from Telenav's short code to cease, but later determines that he does want to receive messages from Telenav's short code, the party wishing to restart services should send RESTART as the subject of a text message to Telenav's short code, 69355.
Other Issues or Questions 
If this information does not address a concern you have about Telenav's use of text messages or SMS, please send an e-mail to support@telenav.com. 
Effective as of June 11, 2010

Please read these terms and conditions of use ("Terms of Use") carefully before you launch Your Navigator Deluxe on your wireless device. Your use of Your Navigator Deluxe indicates that you accept these terms and conditions. If you do not accept these terms and conditions, do not launch or otherwise use Your Navigator Deluxe.
INTRODUCTION
These Terms of Use represent the agreement ("Agreement") between you and Telenav, Inc. ("Telenav") with respect to the Your Navigator Deluxe service ("Your Navigator Deluxe Service"). All references herein to "you" and "your" means you, your employees, agents, and contractors, and any other entity on whose behalf you accept these terms and conditions, all of whom shall also be bound by this Agreement.

If you feel that a route suggested by the Telenav Software instructs you to perform an unsafe or illegal maneuver, places you in an unsafe situation, or directs you into an area that you consider to be unsafe, do not follow such instructions; (c) do not input destinations, or otherwise manipulate the Telenav Software, unless your vehicle is stationary and parked; (d) do not use the Telenav Software for any illegal, unauthorized, unintended, unsafe, hazardous, or unlawful purposes, or in any manner inconsistent with this Agreement; (e) arrange all GPS and wireless devices and cables necessary for use of the Telenav Software in a secure manner in your vehicle so that they will not interfere with your driving and will not prevent the operation of any safety device (such as an airbag).
You agree to indemnify and hold Telenav harmless against all claims resulting from any dangerous or otherwise inappropriate use of the Telenav Software in any moving vehicle, including as a result of your failure to comply with the directions above.
2. Account Information & Your Location and Search Information
You agree: (a) when registering the Telenav Software, to provide Telenav and General Motors Holdings LLC and its affiliates ("GM") with true, accurate, current, and complete information about yourself, your account and your vehicle, and (b) to keep such information true, accurate, current and complete.
In order to use the Telenav Software, Telenav may receive location and search information related to your use of the Telenav Software. In using the Telenav Software, you allow Telenav to obtain, use and share (as disclosed)this location and search information. Such information is subject to the  Privacy Policy, which can be reviewed at http://www.telenav.com/legal/NavConnect-privacy.htm. Your use of the Telenav Software indicates that you accept the terms of this Privacy Policy.
3. Software License
Subject to your compliance with the terms of this Agreement, Telenav hereby grants to you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable license (except as expressly permitted below in connection with your permanent transfer of the Telenav Software license), without the right to sublicense, to access and use the Telenav Software (in object code form only).  This license shall terminate upon any termination or expiration of this Agreement.  You agree that you will use the Telenav Software only for your personal business or leisure purposes, and not to provide commercial navigation services to other parties.
3.1 License Limitations
You agree not to do any of the following: (a) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, translate, modify, alter or otherwise change the Telenav Software or any part thereof; (b) attempt to derive the source code, audio library or structure of the Telenav Software without the prior express written consent of Telenav; (c) remove from the Telenav Software, or alter, any of Telenav's or its suppliers' trademarks, trade names, logos, patent or copyright notices, or other notices or markings; (d) distribute, sublicense or otherwise transfer the Telenav Software to others, except as part of your permanent transfer of the Telenav Software; or (e) use the Telenav Software in any manner that (i) infringes the intellectual property or proprietary rights, rights of publicity or privacy or other rights of any party, (ii) violates any law, statute, ordinance or regulation, including but not limited to laws and regulations related to spamming, privacy, consumer and child protection, obscenity or defamation, or (iii) is harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortuous, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, libelous, or otherwise objectionable; and (f) lease, rent out, or otherwise permit unauthorized access by third parties to the Telenav Software without advanced written permission of Telenav.
4. Disclaimers
Except where prohibited by applicable law (which may include the Province of Quebec), in no event will Telenav, its licensors and suppliers, GM, or agents or employees of any of the foregoing, be liable for any decision made or action taken by you or anyone else in reliance on the information provided by the Telenav Software.  Unless otherwise provided under applicable laws, Telenav and GM also do not warrant or condition the accuracy of the map or other data used for the Telenav Software. Such data may not always reflect reality due to, among other things, road closures, construction, weather, new roads and other changing conditions.  You are responsible for the entire risk arising out of your use of the Telenav Software.  For example but without limitation, you agree not to rely on the Telenav Software for critical navigation in areas where the well-being or survival of you or others is dependent on the accuracy of navigation, as the maps or functionality of the Telenav Software are not intended to support such high risk applications, especially in more remote geographical areas.
EXCEPT WHERE PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW (WHICH MAY INCLUDE THE PROVINCE OF QUEBEC), TELENAV AND GM EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM AND EXCLUDE ALL WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THE TELENAV SOFTWARE, WHETHER STATUTORY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ALL WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS WHICH MAY ARISE FROM COURSE OF DEALING, CUSTOM OR TRADE AND INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO THE TELENAV SOFTWARE. Certain jurisdictions do not permit the disclaimer of certain warranties, so this limitation may not apply to you.
5. Limitation of Liability
EXCEPT WHERE PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW (WHICH MAY INCLUDE THE PROVINCE OF QUEBEC), UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL TELENAV OR ITS LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS OR GM BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES (INCLUDING IN EACH CASE, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR THE INABILITY TO USE THE EQUIPMENT OR ACCESS DATA, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF BUSINESS, LOSS OF PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR THE LIKE) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE TELENAV SOFTWARE, EVEN IF TELENAV HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
EXCEPT WHERE PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW (WHICH MAY INCLUDE THE PROVINCE OF QUEBEC), NOTWITHSTANDING ANY DAMAGES THAT YOU MIGHT INCUR FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ALL DAMAGES REFERENCED HEREIN AND ALL DIRECT OR GENERAL DAMAGES IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE), THE ENTIRE LIABILITY OF TELENAV AND OF ALL OF TELENAV'S SUPPLIERS AND OF GM SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU FOR THE TELENAV SOFTWARE.  SOME PROVINCES, STATES AND/OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
6. Arbitration and Governing Law
Unless you are a resident of Canada, You agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Telenav Software shall be settled by independent arbitration involving a neutral arbitrator and administered by the American Arbitration Association in the County of Santa Clara, California.  The arbitrator shall apply the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, and the judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered by any court having jurisdiction. Note that there is no judge or jury in an arbitration proceeding and the decision of the arbitrator shall be binding upon both parties.  You expressly agree to waive your right to a jury trial.
This Agreement and performance hereunder will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to its conflict of laws provisions. To the extent judicial action is necessary in connection with the binding arbitration, both Telenav and you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the County of Santa Clara, California.  The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you reside in Canada, this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the province or territory in which You reside at the time of entering into this Agreement and the laws of Canada applicable therein.  Any action brought by Telenav or You shall be brought exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction located within the province or territory in which You resided at the time of entering into this Agreement.
It is the express wish of the parties that this Agreement and any directly or indirectly related documents be drawn up in English. Les parties ont exprimé la volonté expresse que cette convention et tous les documents s'y rattachant directement ou indirectement soient rédigés en anglais.
7. Assignment
You may not resell, assign, or transfer this Agreement or any of your rights or obligations, except in totality, in connection with your permanent transfer of the Telenav Software, and expressly conditioned upon the new user of the Telenav Software agreeing to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.  Any such sale, assignment or transfer that is not expressly permitted under this paragraph will result in immediate termination of this Agreement, without liability to Telenav, in which case you and all other parties shall immediately cease all use of the Telenav Software.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Telenav may assign this Agreement to any other party at any time without notice, provided the assignee remains bound by this Agreement.
8. Miscellaneous
8.1 This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Telenav and you with respect to the subject matter hereof.
8.2 Except for the limited licenses expressly granted in this Agreement, Telenav retains all right, title and interest in and to the Telenav Software, including without limitation all related intellectual property rights.  No licenses or other rights which are not expressly granted in this Agreement are intended to, or shall be, granted or conferred by implication, statute, inducement, estoppel or otherwise, and Telenav and its suppliers and licensors hereby reserve all of their respective rights other than the licenses explicitly granted in this Agreement.
8.3 By using the Telenav Software, you consent to receive from Telenav all communications, including notices, agreements, legally required disclosures or other information in connection with the Telenav Software (collectively, "Notices") electronically. Telenav may provide such Notices by posting them on Telenav's Website or by downloading such Notices to your wireless device. If you desire to withdraw your consent to receive Notices electronically, you must discontinue your use of the Telenav Software.
8.4 Telenav's or your failure to require performance of any provision shall not affect that party's right to require performance at any time thereafter, nor shall a waiver of any breach or default of this Agreement constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself.
8.5 If any provision herein is held unenforceable, then such provision will be modified to reflect the intention of the parties, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.
8.6 The headings in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only, will not be deemed to be a part of this Agreement, and will not be referred to in connection with the construction or interpretation of this Agreement.  As used in this Agreement, the words "include" and "including," and variations thereof, will not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather will be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."

Licensed under GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 2.1, February 1999
Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".
A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)
"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
•a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
•b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
•c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
•d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.
3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.
4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.
If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:
•a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)
•b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
•c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.
•d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.
•e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.
7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
•a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.
•b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.
10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.
12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
NO WARRANTY
15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Copyright (C) 1991-2010, Thomas G. Lane, Guido Vollbeding.
All Rights Reserved except as specified below.
The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied, with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided "AS IS", and you, its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.
Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these conditions:
(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group".
(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.
These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code, not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to acknowledge us.
Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's software".
We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are assumed by the product vendor.
ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch, sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA. ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally, that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than the foregoing paragraphs do.
The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf. It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable. The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by X Consortium but is also freely distributable.
The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files. To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce "uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard GIF decoders.
We are required to state that "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of CompuServe Incorporated. GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of CompuServe Incorporated."

Vous vous engagez à indemniser et à tenir à couvert Telenav à l'égard de toutes les réclamations découlant d'une utilisation dangereuse ou par ailleurs inappropriée du logiciel Telenav dans un véhicule en marche, y compris du fait que vous n'avez pas suivi les instructions ci dessus.

Vous vous engagez : a) au moment d'inscrire le logiciel Telenav, à fournir à Telenav et à General Motors Holdings LLC et aux membres de son groupe (« GM ») des renseignements véridiques, exacts, à jour et complets à votre sujet et au sujet de votre compte et de votre véhicule et b) à tenir ces renseignements à jour.
Aux fins de l'utilisation du logiciel Telenav, Telenav pourrait recevoir de l'information de localisation et de recherche liée à votre utilisation du logiciel Telenav.

Si vous utilisiez le logiciel Telenav, vous acceptez les modalités de cette politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels.
3. Licence relative au logiciel
Sous réserve de votre conformité avec les modalités de la présente convention, Telenav vous concède par les présentes une licence personnelle, non exclusive et incessible (sauf comme il est expressément autorisé ci après dans le cadre de votre transfert permanent de la licence relative au logiciel Telenav), sans droit de sous-licence, aux fins d'accès au logiciel Telenav (sous forme de code objet seulement) et d'utilisation de celui-ci. Cette licence prend fin à la résiliation ou à l'expiration de la présente convention. Sauf si les lois applicables l'interdisent (ce qui peut comprendre celles de la province de Québec), Telenav peut résilier la licence à tout moment et sans motif. Vous vous engagez à utiliser le logiciel Telenav uniquement à des fins commerciales personnelles ou de loisir et non pour fournir des services de navigation commerciale à d'autres parties.

Vous vous engagez à ne pas faire ce qui suit : a) désosser, décompiler, désassembler, traduire ou autrement modifier le logiciel Telenav ou une partie de celui ci; b) tenter de déterminer le code source, la sonothèque ou la structure du logiciel Telenav sans le consentement écrit exprès préalable de Telenav; c) retirer du logiciel Telenav ou modifier les marques de commerce, noms de marque, logos, avis de brevet ou de droit d'auteur ou autre avis ou indications de Telenav ou de ses fournisseurs; d) distribuer, concéder aux termes d'une sous-licence ou autrement transférer le logiciel Telenav à des tiers, sauf dans le cadre du transfert permanent du logiciel Telenav ou e) utiliser le logiciel Telenav d'une manière qui i) contrevient aux droits de propriété intellectuelle ou exclusifs, aux droits à la protection de la personnalité ou aux droits en matière de protection des renseignements personnels ou autres d'une partie, ii) viole une loi, une ordonnance ou un règlement, notamment les lois et les règlements relatifs au pollupostage, à la protection des renseignements personnels, à la protection des consommateurs et des enfants, aux obscénités ou à la diffamation ou iii) est dangereuse, menaçante, abusive, malveillante, délictuelle, diffamatoire, vulgaire, obscène, calomnieuse ou autrement répréhensible et f) consiste à louer le logiciel Telenav ou à autrement permettre un accès non autorisé à celui ci à des tiers sans l'autorisation écrite préalable de Telenav.
4. Dénégation de responsabilité
Sauf si les lois applicables l'interdisent (ce qui peut comprendre celles de la province de Québec), Telenav, ses concédants de licence et fournisseurs, GM ou encore les mandataires ou employés des personnes précitées ne seront en aucun cas tenus responsables d'une décision ou d'une mesure prise par vous ou un tiers sur le fondement de l'information fournie par le logiciel Telenav. Sauf si les lois applicables l'y obligent, Telenav et GM ne garantissent pas non plus ni ne conditionnent l'exactitude de la carte ou des autres données utilisées pour le logiciel Telenav. Il se pourrait que ces données ne reflètent pas toujours la réalité en raison, notamment, de fermeture de routes, de travaux de construction, de la température, de nouvelles routes et d'autres changements. Vous assumez entièrement le risque découlant de votre utilisation du logiciel Telenav. Par exemple, vous vous engagez notamment à ne pas vous fier au logiciel Telenav dans des situations critiques et des régions où votre bien-être ou votre survie ou celle d'autres personnes dépend de l'exactitude de la navigation, étant donné que les cartes ou la fonctionnalité du logiciel Telenav ne sont pas conçues pour soutenir ces applications à haut risque, plus particulièrement dans des régions géographiques plus éloignées.
SAUF SI LES LOIS APPLICABLES L'INTERDISENT (CE QUI PEUT COMPRENDRE CELLES DE LA PROVINCE DE QUÉBEC), TELENAV ET GM REJETTENT EXPRESSÉMENT TOUTE GARANTIE OU CONDITION RELATIVE AU LOGICIEL TELENAV, QU'ELLE SOIT PRÉVUE PAR LA LOI, EXPRESSE OU IMPLICITE, Y COMPRIS TOUTES LES GARANTIES OU CONDITIONS POUVANT DÉCOULER DE LA CONDUITE HABITUELLE, DE LA COUTUME OU DE L'USAGE COMMERCIAL, NOTAMMENT LES GARANTIES IMPLICITES DE QUALITÉ MARCHANDE, D'ADAPTATION À UN USAGE PARTICULIER ET DE NON-VIOLATION DES DROITS DE TIERS À L'ÉGARD DU LOGICIEL TELENAV. Certains territoires ne permettent pas l'exclusion de certaines garanties. Par conséquent, la présente limitation pourrait ne pas s'appliquer à vous.
5. Responsabilité limitée
SAUF SI LES LOIS APPLICABLES L'INTERDISENT (CE QUI PEUT COMPRENDRE CELLES DE LA PROVINCE DE QUÉBEC), TELENAV OU SES CONCÉDANTS DE LICENCE ET FOURNISSEURS OU GM NE SERONT EN AUCUN CAS TENUS RESPONSABLES ENVERS VOUS OU UN TIERS DE DOMMAGES INDIRECTS, ACCESSOIRES, CONSÉCUTIFS, SPÉCIAUX OU EXEMPLAIRES (Y COMPRIS, DANS CHAQUE CAS, NOTAMMENT, LES DOMMAGES EN CAS D'INCAPACITÉ D'UTILISER LE MATÉRIEL OU LES DONNÉES D'ACCÈS, LA PERTE DE DONNÉES, LES PERTES COMMERCIALES, LA PERTE DE PROFITS, L'INTERRUPTION DES ACTIVITÉS OU DES SITUATIONS SIMILAIRES) DÉCOULANT DE L'UTILISATION OU DE L'INCAPACITÉ D'UTILISER LE LOGICIEL TELENAV, ET CE, MÊME SI TELENAV A ÉTÉ AVISÉE DE LA POSSIBILITÉ DE TELS DOMMAGES.
SAUF SI LES LOIS APPLICABLES L'INTERDISENT (CE QUI PEUT COMPRENDRE CELLES DE LA PROVINCE DE QUÉBEC), MALGRÉ LES DOMMAGES QUE VOUS POURRIEZ SUBIR POUR QUELQUE RAISON QUE CE SOIT (NOTAMMENT TOUS LES DOMMAGES MENTIONNÉS DANS LES PRÉSENTES AINSI QUE L'ENSEMBLE DES DOMMAGES DIRECTS OU GÉNÉRAUX, CONTRACTUELS, DÉLICTUELS (NOTAMMENT PAR SUITE D'UNE NÉGLIGENCE) OU AUTRES), L'ENTIÈRE RESPONSABILITÉ DE TELENAV AINSI QUE DE L'ENSEMBLE DE SES FOURNISSEURS ET DE GM SE LIMITERA AU MONTANT RÉELLEMENT PAYÉ PAR VOUS POUR LE LOGICIEL TELENAV. CERTAINES PROVINCES OU CERTAINS ÉTATS ET/OU TERRITOIRES NE PERMETTENT PAS L'EXCLUSION OU LA LIMITATION DES DOMMAGES ACCESSOIRES OU CONSÉCUTIFS. PAR CONSÉQUENT, LES RESTRICTIONS OU EXCLUSIONS PRÉCITÉES POURRAIENT NE PAS S'APPLIQUER À VOUS.
6. Arbitrage et droit applicable
Sauf si vous êtes un résident du Canada, vous convenez que les différends, réclamations ou litiges découlant de la présente convention ou du logiciel Telenav doivent être réglés dans le cadre d'une procédure d'arbitrage indépendante effectuée par un arbitre neutre et administrée par l'American Arbitration Association du comté de Santa Clara, en Californie. L'arbitre appliquera les Commercial Arbitration Rules de l'American Arbitration Association, et la décision rendue par l'arbitre peut être entérinée par n'importe quel tribunal compétent. Il y a lieu de préciser qu'aucun juge ou jury ne participe à une procédure d'arbitrage et que la décision de l'arbitre lie les deux parties. Vous vous engagez expressément à renoncer à votre droit à un procès devant jury.
La présente convention et son exécution seront régies par les lois de l'État de la Californie et interprétées conformément à celles ci, sans égard aux dispositions en matière de conflits de lois. Si une mesure judiciaire doit être prise dans le cadre de la procédure d'arbitrage qui lie les parties, Telenav et vous vous engagez à vous en remettre à la compétence exclusive des tribunaux du comté de Santa Clara, en Californie. La Convention des Nations Unies sur les contrats de vente internationale de marchandises ne s'applique pas.
Malgré ce qui précède, si vous résidez au Canada, la présente convention est régie par les lois de la province ou du territoire dans lequel vous résidez au moment de la conclusion de la présente convention et les lois du Canada qui s'appliquent dans cette province ou ce territoire et elle doit être interprétée conformément à celles-ci. Toute poursuite intentée par Telenav ou vous doit être intentée exclusivement devant un tribunal compétent situé dans la province ou le territoire dans lequel vous résidez au moment de la conclusion de la présente convention.
7. Cession
Il vous est interdit de revendre, de céder ou de transférer la présente convention ou vos droits ou obligations, sauf en totalité, dans le cadre de votre transfert permanent du logiciel Telenav, et à la condition expresse que le nouvel utilisateur du logiciel Telenav s'engage à être lié par les modalités de la présente convention. Une vente ou cession ou un transfert qui n'est pas expressément autorisé aux termes du présent paragraphe entraînera la résiliation immédiate de la présente convention, sans responsabilité pour Telenav, auquel cas vous et les autres parties devez cesser immédiatement toute utilisation du logiciel Telenav. Malgré ce qui précède, Telenav peut céder la présente convention à une autre partie à tout moment et sans préavis, pourvu que le cessionnaire demeure lié par la présente convention.
8. Divers
8.1 La présente convention constitue l'entente intégrale intervenue entre Telenav et vous à l'égard de l'objet des présentes.
8.2 Sauf en ce qui concerne les licences limitées expressément octroyées aux termes de la présente convention, Telenav conserve tous les droits, titres et intérêts à l'égard du logiciel Telenav, notamment tous les droits de propriété intellectuelle connexes. Aucune licence ni aucun autre droit non expressément octroyés aux termes de la présente convention ne visent à, ni ne doivent, être octroyés ou conférés implicitement, par la loi, par induction, par préclusion ou autrement, et Telenav ainsi que ses fournisseurs et concédants de licence se réservent par les présentes tous leurs droits respectifs, sauf les licences explicitement octroyées aux termes de la présente convention.
8.3 En utilisant le logiciel Telenav, vous consentez à recevoir par voie électronique de Telenav toutes les communications, y compris les avis, conventions, renseignements devant être fournis par la loi ou autres renseignements relatifs au logiciel Telenav (collectivement, les « avis »). Telenav peut fournir ces avis en les affichant sur son site Web ou en les téléchargeant vers votre appareil sans fil. Si vous souhaitez retirer votre consentement à recevoir des avis par voie électronique, vous devez cesser d'utiliser le logiciel Telenav.
8.4 L'omission, de la part de Telenav ou de votre part, d'exiger l'exécution d'une disposition n'a pas d'incidence sur le droit d'une partie d'en exiger l'exécution à tout moment par la suite. Une renonciation à invoquer une violation ou un défaut à l'égard de la présente convention ne constitue pas une renonciation à invoquer une violation ou à un défaut subséquent ni une renonciation à la disposition elle-même.
8.5 Si une disposition des présentes est jugée inopposable, elle sera alors modifiée afin de refléter l'intention des parties, et les autres dispositions de la présente convention demeureront pleinement en vigueur.
8.6 Les titres utilisés dans la présente convention sont fournis pour en faciliter la consultation seulement et ne sont pas réputés en faire partie et ne doivent pas servir à l'interpréter. Dans la présente convention, les termes et expressions « comprend » et « y compris » et les variations de ceux ci ne se veulent pas limitatifs, mais signifient « y compris, sans restriction ».
9. Autres modalités des fournisseurs
Le logiciel Telenav utilise des cartes et d'autres données concédées sous licence à Telenav par des fournisseurs tiers à votre avantage et à celui d'autres utilisateurs finaux. La présente convention comprend les modalités d'utilisation applicables à ces sociétés. Par conséquent, votre utilisation du logiciel Telenav est également assujettie à ces modalités. Vous vous engagez à vous conformer aux modalités supplémentaires suivantes, qui s'appliquent aux concédants de licence fournisseurs tiers de Telenav.

On some versions of our applications you can also create a list of "favorite" addresses that can include your home and work addresses.

(d) Third Party Applications

When you enable a third party application, information collected by Telenav is processed under our Privacy Policy while information collected by the third party application provider is governed by its own privacy policy.
(e) Promotions
When you participate in a Telenav promotion, such as a sweepstakes or contest, you may be asked to provide your name and email address, and possibly other information such as your mailing address and telephone number.
We store this information in our database and will use it to communicate with you about the promotion.

Telenav cannot prevent the distribution and use of such information by other parties.
(h) Other Submissions

2. Information Automatically Collected
We automatically receive certain types of information, some of which may be associated with Personal Information, when you visit our websites or use our products and services.
(a) Information Related to Your Location and Route or Other User Content
Each time you access the Telenav GPS Navigator™ or Scout® service or our partnered branded versions of our Navigator services, we record your location and route information, including your point of origin (which may be your then-current location), the address of your destination, the starting time of your trip, and the route you are instructed to follow. We record your current location when your wireless device requests a rerouting (which occurs, for example, when you deviate from the specified instructions). We maintain a database with these locations and route information, and may keep such information indefinitely to improve our map coverage and to provide other features that may enhance your service capabilities, functions, and your user experience. We may periodically receive your current location from the GPS hardware associated with your wireless device for the purpose of providing enhanced services, including traffic flow data. When your location, GPS heading and speed are used for these purposes, we strip it of your Personal Information, such as your phone number, prior to storing. We may share such location data in anonymized form with our third party partners performing research and analysis about traffic conditions and road segment usage.
When your mobile device's Location Services are being used by Scout or other third party applications or your mobile operating systems services, the Scout application may periodically collect and store data about your current location along with a non-personally identifiable version of your device ID to create an anonymous profile for advertising purposes.  This profile may be shared with third parties for advertising purposes. For additional information about this data usage and how to opt-out, please see below regarding geohistorical-based and interest-based advertising. Additionally, this location data may also be used by us for anonymous traffic flow data or floating car data.
When you choose to use your current GPS location for specifying the locale for a business finder search, or obtaining a map, we use your location information for the requested purpose, and then discard it. We anonymously record any search activities and results for comparative analysis. Further, we anonymously record transactions for the purpose of paying directory listing and mapping data providers.
Some versions of our applications include a location and information sharing feature that enables you to share your location or other information with another party. These location exchanges are transmitted within the application or via the internet or text messages using SMS. For example, when you create, join, or navigate to a Meet Up with the Scout application, your name, profile photo, current location and/or ETA at the Meet Up location will be displayed on a map visible by other Meet Up participants.  The Meet Up and your location and/or ETA will be removed from the map visible to other participants when you delete the Meet Up.  We record these location exchanges, and may keep such information indefinitely. Also, if you set up a Notification within the app, the phone numbers you provide will be automatically notified via SMS message each time you arrive at or depart from the location you select. You can turn off a Notification from within the application's settings menu.
Additionally, in some versions of our applications, you can allow our application to access the data stored in the address book and/or calendar on your mobile device. Our applications may use data from your address book or for your Facebook or Google+ contacts (if you signed in with a Facebook  or Google+ sign-in)   to allow you to search for and navigate to the addresses of your contacts, chat with your contacts within the application, or create a Meet Up within the application. Our applications may use calendar entry data to provide you with reminders about upcoming appointments and to provide navigation to the locations of your appointments. We will only access this data if you have given permissions for a particular Telenav application to do so, and you can revoke such permissions at any time by changing the settings on your mobile device.
When you access Telenav map and data services through a third party application, we receive and store your location information from your device along with any address or point of interest search requests along with associated destination location information.  We maintain a database with locations and search information, and may keep such information indefinitely to improve our map coverage and to provide other features that may enhance your service capabilities, functions, and your user experience. Such data does not contain any Personal Information, such as your phone number.

If you would like to opt out of the use and/or sharing of such data for interest-based advertising, please contact us at support@telenav.com or click here and follow the instructions provided.
We may also obtain Precise Location Data from your use of Telenav applications (and certain other third party location based applications and use that location data) about your "geohistory", which is the geo-location of your mobile device over time along with a de-identified version of your device ID to create a profile.  Additionally, in order to create a profile, we may use data about your location and online activity and interests, including things like real-world category types you visited (e.g. Shopping Mall), mobile apps with which you engage, information collected by our inventory partners and other third parties and shared with us.  This will involve the use of your de-identified device ID and will not include any Personal Information, such as your name, phone number, or email address.

3. Information From Other Sources

WHEN YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE SHARED OR DISCLOSED
Telenav does not sell, rent, license or otherwise share information with unaffiliated parties except as explained in this Privacy Policy.
Consent Given/Transaction Processing
We may disclose Personal Information about you to third parties with your consent. Consent is sometimes implicit, as in the disclosure of Personal Information to third-parties who complete transactions or perform services on our behalf.
If you do not want us to share your Personal Information with these companies, you may contact us at: support@telenav.com.
To the Primary Account Holder
We may disclose Personal Information of an account user to the primary account holder (the party financially responsible for the account). If a business, governmental agency, or other individual obtains service for you, that entity or individual is our customer, and we may provide Personal Information about you, or your use of the service to them or others at their direction.
Third Party Services or Third Party Service Providers
Telenav offers access to a variety of resources, including but not limited to various communication tools, search services, forums, and links to other World Wide Web sites in providing its services, products and websites. We may make certain Personal Information non-personal and share it or aggregated data with strategic partners that work with us to analyze usage, provide and improve products or services, or that help us market to customers, or for similar purposes. Information that is not Personal Information or is aggregated is not subject to any restrictions of use or disclosure under this Privacy Policy.
If you take advantage of a third party's services or products offered through the use of our services, we may disclose your Personal Information to such unaffiliated third parties. These entities may use this information that you provide in the course of your use of Telenav's services (including your name, nicknames, telephone numbers, audio files, and email and mailing addresses) to promote their products and services to you. Any such Personal Information that a third party uses will be subject to their applicable privacy policies.
Some of our services and functionality are provided in conjunction with third party service providers. These third party service providers process Personal Information on our behalf and are obligated to process such information in compliance with this Privacy Policy and other appropriate security and confidentiality measures. In cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU individuals received pursuant to the EU-US or Swiss-EU Privacy Shield, Telenav is potentially liable.
Legal Processes
We will comply with any subpoenas, court orders or other legal processes for any of the information about you in our possession, and we may use such information to establish or exercise yours, ours, or others' legal rights, or to defend against legal claims. We also may be required to disclose Personal Information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
Business Transfers
Information about you in our possession may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another provider, as well as in the unlikely event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which your Personal Information would be transferred as one of the business assets of the company. Telenav does not guarantee that any entity receiving such information in connection with one of these transactions will comply with all terms of this policy.
European Union Users
Information that we collect about you may also be transferred among our various divisions and affiliated companies around the world, which may involve transfer from countries within the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland to countries outside the EEA. By allowing Telenav to collect this information about you, you consent to these transfers, including transborder transmission of data covered by this Privacy Policy. As a result, that country's courts, governments or law enforcement agencies could obtain disclosure of such information under that country's laws.
Telenav complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss – U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States, respectively.

INFORMATION ON WIRELESS DEVICES
The Telenav software (and any upgrades, modifications, or additions thereto) that is factory installed or downloaded to, and resides upon your wireless device retains your manually entered account number and PIN, or reads it from the device. Having your carrier change the assigned phone number for your wireless device does not change the account number we maintain with regard to that device, which will result in your device not being able to access your Telenav account established using the previous phone number. If this happens, please contact Telenav customer care.
SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
Telenav has implemented various physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of Personal Information under our control. For instance, Telenav limits access to Telenav systems that store such information to authorized personnel. Telenav also employs the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to protect your Personal Information when you bill on our website.
While Telenav maintains a multitude of security measures to prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of your Personal Information, no security measures are absolute or wholly guaranteed. Telenav will make reasonable attempts to notify you if it determines there were unauthorized acts by third parties that violate the law or this policy, or other security breaches, or where otherwise required by law.
Telenav will maintain your Personal Information for as long as a business need exists, or as required by applicable laws, regulations, or government orders. When we dispose of Personal Information, we use commercially reasonable procedures to erase or render it unreadable.
CHILDREN'S PRIVACY
Telenav will not knowingly request or collect Personal Information from any person under 13 years of age without prior verifiable parental or legal guardian consent. If, however, you authorize a child to use our services or products by providing them a device associated with your Telenav service, any Personal Information associated with such use will be treated as your information in accordance with this policy. Telenav encourages parents to be involved in the online activities (including wireless Internet browsing) of their children to ensure that no information is collected from a child without parental or Guardian consent.
CUSTOMER REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION
Telenav acknowledges that individuals have the right to access the Personal Information/data that we maintain about them.  Customers are entitled to request information concerning whether a business has disclosed Personal Information to any affiliated companies or third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Customers are further entitled to request access to their Personal Information under Telenav's control. To protect your privacy and security, Telenav will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before providing you access or making corrections. Good faith efforts to resolve requests to correct inaccuracies in or delete Personal Information will be made by Telenav, except where the request is unreasonable. As stated in this Privacy Policy, Telenav will not sell or share your Personal Information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes without your consent.

Telenav Warranty and Refunds Policy
Telenav Hardware Warranties and Refunds
Telenav Bluetooth® GPS Receivers One-Year Limited Warranty 
Telenav, Inc. warrants this Telenav Bluetooth® GPS receiver against defects in material and workmanship under normal use and service for a period of one (1) year from the date of purchase by the original purchaser. This warranty is extended only to the original purchaser.
If a defect in a receiver arises and a valid claim is received by Telenav within the one-year warranty period, Telenav will, at its option, either (1) exchange the receiver with another receiver, or (2) refund the purchase price of the receiver. When a receiver is exchanged, any replacement item becomes your property and the replaced item becomes Telenav’s property. When a refund is given, the receiver for which the refund is provided must be returned to Telenav and becomes Telenav’s property.
Telenav is not responsible for your shipping and other costs to return the receiver to Telenav or its authorized representative.
This warranty does not apply to: 

Damage or loss which occurs during shipment. 
Damage caused by accident, abuse, misuse, flood, fire, earthquake or other external causes. 
Damage caused by operating the product outside the permitted or intended uses described by Telenav. 
Damage caused by service performed by anyone who is not a representative of Telenav. 
Consumable parts, such as batteries, unless damage has occurred due to a defect in materials or workmanship. 

This warranty also does not apply to any item other than the receiver. Specifically, this warranty does not cover any of the accessories shipped with your receiver, including the plug-in wall charger, the plug-in car charger, the USB cable, and the installation CD. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THIS WARRANTY AND REMEDIES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE EXCLUSIVE AND IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, REMEDIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, STATUTORY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. AS PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, TELENAV SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL STATUTORY OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. IF TELENAV CANNOT LAWFULLY DISCLAIM STATUTORY OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES THEN TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ALL SUCH WARRANTIES SHALL BE LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE DURATION OF THIS EXPRESS WARRANTY AND TO REPLACEMENT SERVICE AS DETERMINED BY TELENAV IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION. 
No Telenav reseller, agent, or employee is authorized to make any modification, extension, or addition to this warranty. Some States do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, and some States do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so one or more of the above limitations may not apply to you. 
This warranty gives you specific legal rights. You may have other rights which vary from state to state. 
How to Obtain Warranty Service
To obtain service under this warranty, call Telenav at 1-88-Telenav-4 (1-888-353-6284). You will be asked for your email address for Telenav to send you a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) number and details for returning the receiver to Telenav. Alternatively, you may receive this information verbally over the phone. The receiver must be returned in the original packaging with (i) a copy of the email from Telenav identifying your RMA number, or some other writing specifying your RMA number, and (ii) proof of purchase in the form of a copy of your original receipt. (You may keep the receiver’s activation code and the installation CD.)

If you or Telenav cancel your account at any time after the first 30 days, Telenav will discontinue charging your credit card for your monthly service fee or otherwise cease assessing charges under your direct billing arrangement, but will not refund any amounts for the current or previous months of service and will not provide a refund for any hardware purchased from Telenav. In addition, Telenav will not refund any amount of prepaid service. For example, if you purchased twelve (12) months of prepaid service and cancel your account after three (3) months, there will be no refund of any amount to you on your account. 
You will not be provided a refund for any month for which you were not charged for the Telenav Service (i.e., as a result of any free usage or other promotion). 

Telenav Shotgun™
If you pay for the Telenav Shotgun (“Shotgun”) through a credit card payment at www.telenav.com or through a direct billing arrangement with Telenav, then you may request a refund within the first 30 days after the date of purchase. Upon Telenav’s receipt of the Shotgun unit from you per the terms of this policy, the purchase price you paid for the Shotgun unit will be credited back to your credit card or otherwise refunded to you, along with any applicable sales tax. No refund will be made for any shipping or handling charges. The Shotgun unit for which the refund is provided must be returned to Telenav and becomes Telenav’s property.
Telenav is not responsible for your shipping and other costs to return the Shotgun to Telenav or its authorized representative.
To request a refund, call Telenav at 1-88-Telenav-8 (1-888-353-6288). You will be asked for your email address for Telenav to send you a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) number and details for returning the Shotgun unit to Telenav. Alternatively, you may receive this information verbally over the phone. The Shotgun unit must be returned in the original packaging including all original accessories and with (i) a copy of the email from Telenav identifying your RMA number, or some other writing specifying your RMA number, and (ii) proof of purchase in the form of a copy of your original receipt. The Shotgun unit and all original accessories must be in good physical and operational condition; damaged product will not be accepted for return. Telenav must receive your return of the Shotgun unit per the terms of this return policy within ten (10) days from the date the RMA number is provided to you. Failure to return the Shotgun unit in this timeframe, or otherwise not in compliance with the terms herein, will invalidate your RMA.
Telenav Connected Service™
Use of the Telenav Connected Service (“TCS”) which includes downloads to your wireless device of selected upgrades, modifications, or additions to TCS, requires payment of a monthly fee.
If you pay for TCS through a credit card payment at www.telenav.com or through a direct billing arrangement with Telenav, then you or Telenav may cancel your account at any time subject to the following policies:

The first 3 months of TCS is free with your purchase of a Telenav Shotgun unit, and begins from the date of first TCS activation. If you or Telenav cancel TCS within the first 30 days of first TCS activation, all charges for TCS (and the Shotgun unit purchased from Telenav that you return per Telenav’s Shotgun return policy and procedures) will be credited back to your credit card or otherwise refunded to you, unless your TCS is cancelled by Telenav for cause.
If you or Telenav cancel TCS at any time after the first 30 days of first TCS activation, Telenav will discontinue charging your credit card for your monthly service fee or otherwise cease assessing charges under your direct billing arrangement, but will not refund any amounts for the current or previous months of service and will not provide a refund for any hardware purchased from Telenav. In addition, Telenav will not refund any amount of prepaid service. For example, if you purchased twelve (12) months of prepaid service and cancel your account after three (3) months, there will be no refund of any amount to you on your account.
You will not be provided a refund for any month for which you were not charged for TCS (i.e., as a result of any free usage period or other promotion). Should you or Telenav choose to cancel TCS for any reason, you shall not be entitled to any refund of or reduction in the price of the Shotgun unit (except as expressly provided under Telenav’s Shotgun return policy and procedures).

Telenav Open Source Statement last updated as of January 20, 2015.


Telenav Privacy Policy for Navigation and NavConnect

en
fr
es

This Privacy Policy governs your use of Navigation and/or NavConnect service offered by Telenav, Inc. ("Telenav") for select automotive vehicles produced or distributed by General Motors Holdings LLC or its affiliates ("GM").  In order to provide you with navigation and related services we collect and store certain information relating to your account, your location, and your use of the navigation services.  Please review this Privacy Policy for more detail about the information that may be collected and used in connection with your use of Navigation, NavConnect, and NavConnect with Predictive Navigation. By using these products or otherwise by interacting with us, you consent to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Policy, please do not engage in any of these activities.
Telenav understands and respects your concerns about the use of your personally identifiable information, collected from you as a user of Navigation and/or NavConnect ("Personal Information"). Personal Information includes name, home address, telephone numbers including mobile telephone numbers, email addresses, and VIN numbers. Personal Information does not include anonymous or aggregate information, which after processing cannot be associated with a specific person or entity. We believe that you should know what information about you we collect, as well as how that information is used, maintained, and, in some cases, shared. The following sets forth our privacy practices and policies, applicable to Navigation and/or NavConnect users.
You acknowledge and understand that this Privacy Policy does not apply to other Telenav products or services, our business partners or other companies that Telenav does not own or operate. For information about other Telenav products and services as well as the Telenav.com website, please visit http://www.telenav.com/legal/policies. For information on how other providers of products or services handle personal information you provide through other web sites or through the use of our services in conjunction with a third party, please consult their privacy policies.
INFORMATION COLLECTED ABOUT YOU AND OUR USE OF SUCH INFORMATION
The types of personal and other information we may collect about you are primarily from three sources: (1) information you provide; (2) information automatically collected; and (3) information from other sources. How we use and maintain that information is described below.
1. Information You Provide
(a) Register/Information Related to Your Account
We receive and store Personal Information about you when you authorize our business partners to share that information with us for use with Navigation and/or NavConnect or login to Navigation and/or NavConnect using your information, and when you otherwise transmit such information to us via Navigation and/or NavConnect, or contact us by phone or email regarding our products and services. For instance, to maintain and/or verify your account we may receive certain account information from other of your accounts, with your consent, including your name, email address, vehicle information and whether your NavConnect subscription is active. We may also assign you a separate and unique Telenav ID number, which may be stored and used to manage your account and provide you with customer support, and perform research and analysis about your use of our products and services.
Through GM, Navigation and/or NavConnect, you have the option of providing us with your home and work addresses, which we store in our database, to enable you to quickly navigate to those destinations and readily access other features of Navigation and/or NavConnect. Through Navigation or NavConnect you can also create a list of "favorite" addresses and points of interest. Within Navigation and/or NavConnect you also have the option to use Navigation and/or NavConnect settings menu to customize your experience, for example by selecting your navigation preferences, setting up traffic reports, and selecting your preferred gas grade for searches. For NavConnect subscribers, we store these addresses and setting preferences in our cloud database so that you can access them from Navigation and/or NavConnect. For Navigation users, this information is stored locally on the navigation system in your vehicle.
We may also use the information that we collect about you to manage your account and provide you with customer support, perform research and analysis about your use of our products and services, to inform you from time to time within Navigation and/or NavConnect about products or services that we think may interest you, unless you inform us that you opt out from receiving such communications.  We may share certain information we collect about you and your usage activity with GM on a non-identifiable basis for the purpose of performing research and analysis about users of its products and services.
(b) Contact Our Customer Service Representatives/ Feedback
GM may use your email address or phone number to contact you with regard to Navigation or your NavConnect subscription, such as to communicate that it is about to expire or to respond to any inquiry or feedback you submit with GM Customer Service Representatives, by email or from within Navigation and/or NavConnect.
If you provide feedback regarding a routing or map issue, we may share your comments and anonymized location data with our third party map provider.
(c) Request for Information
When you request additional information about Navigation or NavConnect, the information collected through these requests may include your name, phone number, and email address. We will use this information to provide you with details about these services, and in accordance with requirements under applicable law, we may use this information to promote our services to you in the future, unless you inform us that you opt out from receiving such communications.
(d) Public Forums
If you use or link to public forums such as social networking services, blogs on Telenav or non-Telenav websites, internet bulletin boards, or chat rooms, be aware that any personal information you submit can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, including to send you unsolicited messages. Telenav cannot prevent the distribution and use of such information by other parties.
2. Information Automatically Collected
We automatically receive certain types of information, some of which may be associated with Personal Information, when you use Navigation and/or NavConnect.
(a) Information Related to Your Location and Route or Other User Content
Each time you access Navigation, we record your location, search and route information, including your point of origin or current location, the address of your destination, the starting time of your trip, and the route you are instructed to follow. When you are in an active Navigation session, we periodically record your current location, data from your vehicle's sensors, and GPS heading and speed from the GPS hardware associated with your vehicle in order to provide you with your route. Navigation will save and display your most recent destinations to allow you to easily navigate to these destinations again.
When you choose to use your current location for specifying the locale for a business finder search, or obtaining a map, we use your location information for the requested purpose, and then discard it. We anonymously record any search activities and results for comparative analysis.
For NavConnect users with an active subscription who have opted-in to use Connectivity, this location and route information will be stored in our secure cloud database, where we may keep such information for up to five years to improve our services and to provide other features that may enhance your service capabilities, functions, and your user experience.  For NavConnect users, other address data, including home and work addresses, favorite places, and recent destinations will also be stored with your account information in our secure cloud database until your account is deleted.
For NavConnect users who have enabled the Predictive Navigation functionality, we will regularly receive and record location data from your vehicle's GPS hardware, whenever you are operating your vehicle.  This data will be stored in our secured cloud database and we will use such information to customize and improve your navigation and search experience, for example to provide preferred brand point of interest search results, personalized routing, and commute alerts.
You can update your Predictive Navigation options (including disabling Predictive Navigation) at any time by accessing the Navigation Settings menu.
(b) Information About Your Vehicle Systems
We may receive and store limited vehicle data from the vehicle systems, for example, ambient temperature, seat sensors on/off, and ignition on/off, which may be used to optimize the safety functionality of Navigation.  For Navigation-only users, this data will be stored indefinitely in your Navigation system's local memory.  For NavConnect users with an active subscription, this data will be stored in our secure cloud database for up to five years from the date of collection.
(c) Information About Your Use of Navigation Services
When you use Navigation and/or NavConnect, we log certain information relating to your use of Navigation and/or NavConnect and the Navigation performance. For example, we may collect data about what actions you take within a session, such as the type of search you performed or what kind of route you selected.
(d) Other Information
When you use the voice command or entry features on our services, we receive the text transcription from your audible utterance (what you said) and that text data may be stored for up to five years.
WHEN YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE SHARED OR DISCLOSED
Telenav does not sell, rent, license or otherwise share information relating to your use of Navigation or NavConnect with unaffiliated parties except as explained in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required or permitted by applicable law.
Consent Given/Transaction Processing
We may disclose Personal Information about you to third parties who complete transactions or perform services on our behalf.  Your use of the Navigation and/or NavConnect may constitute consent to such disclosure.
Third Party Services or Third Party Service Providers
Telenav may make certain Personally Information non-personal and share it or anonymous, aggregated data with strategic partners that work with us to analyze usage, provide and improve products or services, or that help us market to customers, or for similar purposes. Information that is not personally identifiable or is aggregated is not subject to any restrictions of use or disclosure under this Privacy Policy.
Some of the Navigation and NavConnect services and functionality are provided by or in conjunction with third party service providers. These third party service providers process Personal Information on our behalf and are obligated to process such information in compliance with this Privacy Policy and other appropriate security and confidentiality measures. Our service providers are given the information they need to perform their designated functions, and we do not authorize them to use or disclose personal information for their own marketing or other purposes. Personal information may be maintained and processed by us, our affiliates and other third party service providers in the US or other jurisdictions. In cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU individuals received pursuant to the EU-US Privacy Shield, Telenav is potentially liable.
Legal Processes
We, our affiliates and service providers will comply with any applicable subpoenas, court orders or other legal processes for information about you in our possession, and we may use and disclose Personal Information to establish or exercise yours, ours, or others' legal rights, or to defend against legal claims. We also may be required to disclose Personal Information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
Business Transfers
Information about you in our possession may be disclosed as part of a prospective or completed merger, acquisition, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another provider, as well as in the unlikely event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which your personal information would be transferred as one of the business assets of the company.

es

La présente politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels régit votre utilisation du service Navigation et/ou NavConnect offert par Telenav, Inc. (« Telenav ») pour certains véhicules motorisés fabriqués ou distribués par General Motors Holdings LLC ou les membres de son groupe (« GM »). Afin de vous fournir des services de navigation et des services connexes, nous recueillons et stockons certains renseignements relatifs à votre compte, à votre localisation et à votre utilisation des services de navigation. Veuillez lire la présente politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels pour obtenir des détails supplémentaires au sujet des renseignements qui pourraient être recueillis et utilisés dans le cadre de votre utilisation de Navigation, de NavConnect et de NavConnect avec Predictive Navigation. En utilisant ces produits ou en interagissant autrement avec nous, vous indiquez être d'accord avec la présente politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels. Si vous n'êtes pas d'accord avec les modalités de la présente politique, veuillez ne pas vous adonner à ces activités. Telenav comprend et respecte vos préoccupations au sujet de l'utilisation des renseignements permettant de vous identifier qui sont recueillis à votre sujet en tant qu'utilisateur de Navigation et/ou de NavConnect (les « renseignements personnels »). Les renseignements personnels comprennent le nom, l'adresse domiciliaire, les numéros de téléphone, y compris les numéros de téléphone cellulaire, adresses électroniques et numéros d'identification de véhicule. Les renseignements personnels ne comprennent pas les renseignements anonymes ou regroupés qui, une fois traités, ne peuvent être associés à une personne ou à une entité en particulier. Nous estimons que vous devriez savoir quel type de renseignements nous recueillons et comment ces renseignements sont utilisés, conservés et, dans certains cas, partagés. Nos pratiques et politiques en matière de protection des renseignements personnels applicables aux utilisateurs de Navigation et/ou de NavConnect sont décrites ci après.
Vous comprenez que la présente politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels ne s'applique pas à d'autres produits ou services de Telenav, à nos partenaires commerciaux et à d'autres sociétés dont Telenav n'a pas la propriété ou qu'elle n'exploite pas. Pour obtenir des renseignements au sujet d'autres produits et services de Telenav ainsi que sur le site Web Telenav.com, veuillez visiter http://www.telenav.com/legal/policies. Pour obtenir des renseignements sur la façon dont d'autres fournisseurs de produits ou services traitent les renseignements personnels que vous fournissez par l'intermédiaire d'autres sites Web ou dans le cadre de l'utilisation de nos services conjointement avec un tiers, veuillez consulter leurs politiques en matière de protection des renseignements personnels.
RENSEIGNEMENTS RECUEILLIS À VOTRE SUJET ET MANIÈRE DONT NOUS LES UTILISONS
Le type de renseignements personnels et d'autres renseignements que nous pourrions recueillir à votre sujet proviennent principalement de trois sources : 1) l'information que vous fournissez; 2) l'information qui est recueillie automatiquement et 3) l'information provenant d'autres sources. La manière dont nous utilisons et conservons cette information est décrite ci après.
1. Information que vous fournissez
a) Inscription/information liée à votre compte
Nous recevons et stockons des renseignements personnels à votre sujet lorsque vous autorisez nos partenaires commerciaux à partager cette information avec nous aux fins d'utilisation avec Navigation et/ou NavConnect ou que vous vous connectez à Navigation et/ou à NavConnect à l'aide de vos renseignements, et lorsque vous nous transmettez autrement cette information par l'intermédiaire de Navigation et/ou de NavConnect ou que vous communiquez avec nous par téléphone ou par courriel au sujet de nos produits et services. Par exemple, aux fins de la tenue et/ou de la vérification de votre compte, nous pourrions recevoir certains renseignements sur le compte provenant de certains autres de vos comptes, avec votre consentement, notamment votre nom, votre adresse électronique, des renseignements sur votre véhicule et si votre abonnement à NavConnect est actif. Nous pourrions également vous attribuer un numéro d'identification Telenav distinct et unique, qui pourrait être stocké et utilisé aux fins de gestion de votre compte et pour vous fournir le service de soutien à la clientèle ainsi qu'effectuer des recherches et analyses au sujet de votre utilisation de nos produits et services.
Par l'intermédiaire de GM, de Navigation et/ou de NavConnect, vous avez la possibilité de nous fournir vos adresses à domicile et au travail, que nous stockons dans notre base de données, pour vous permettre de naviguer rapidement vers ces destinations et d'accéder facilement à d'autres fonctionnalités de Navigation et/ou de NavConnect. Par l'intermédiaire de Navigation ou de NavConnect, vous pouvez également créer une liste d'adresses « favorites » et de points d'intérêt. Navigation et/ou NavConnect vous permettent également d'utiliser le menu des paramètres de Navigation et/ou de NavConnect afin de personnaliser votre expérience, par exemple en choisissant vos préférences de navigation, en établissant des rapports de circulation et en établissant vos préférences en matière de qualité d'essence pour les recherches. À l'égard des abonnés à NavConnect, nous stockons ces adresses et préférences de paramètres dans nos serveurs de bases de données de sorte qu'ils puissent y accéder à partir de Navigation et/ou de NavConnect. En ce qui concerne les utilisateurs de Navigation, cette information est stockée localement sur le système de navigation situé dans votre véhicule.
Nous pourrions également utiliser l'information que nous recueillons auprès de vous pour gérer votre compte et vous fournir un soutien à la clientèle, effectuer des recherches et des analyses à propos de votre utilisation de nos produits et services, vous informer à l'occasion à l'aide de Navigation et/ou de NavConnect des produits ou services qui, selon nous, pourraient vous intéresser, sauf si vous nous indiquez ne plus vouloir recevoir ces communications. Nous pourrions partager avec GM certains renseignements que nous recueillons à votre sujet et au sujet de votre utilisation et que nous avons rendus non identifiables dans le but d'effectuer des recherches et des analyses au sujet des utilisateurs des produits et services de GM.
b) Communication avec nos représentants du service à la clientèle/commentaires
Le service à la clientèle pour Navigation and NavConnect est fourni par GM. GM peut utiliser votre adresse électronique ou votre numéro de téléphone pour communiquer avec vous au sujet de votre abonnement à Navigation ou à NavConnect, notamment pour vous indiquer que votre abonnement prend fin ou pour répondre à une demande de renseignements ou à un commentaire que vous avez présenté ou formulé à des représentants du service à la clientèle de GM, par courriel ou à l'aide de Navigation et/ou de NavConnect.
Si vous formulez des commentaires au sujet d'un problème avec un itinéraire ou une carte, nous pourrions partager vos commentaires et vos données de localisation rendues anonymes avec notre fournisseur de carte tiers.
c) Demande de renseignements
Lorsque vous demandez des renseignements supplémentaires au sujet de Navigation ou de NavConnect, les renseignements alors recueillis peuvent comprendre votre nom, votre numéro de téléphone et votre adresse électronique. Nous utiliserons ces renseignements pour vous fournir des détails au sujet de ces services et, conformément aux exigences prévues par les lois applicables, nous pourrions les utiliser pour faire la promotion de nos services dans l'avenir, sauf si vous nous indiquez ne plus vouloir recevoir ces communications.
d) Tribunes publiques
Si vous utilisez des tribunes publiques ou des liens vers des tribunes publiques comme des services de réseautage social, des blogues sur des sites Web appartenant à Telenav ou n'appartenant pas à Telenav, des babillards électroniques ou des clavardoirs, sachez que les renseignements personnels que vous pourriez communiquer peuvent être lus, recueillis ou utilisés par d'autres utilisateurs de ces tribunes, notamment pour vous envoyer des messages non sollicités. Telenav ne peut empêcher la distribution et l'utilisation de ces renseignements par d'autres parties.
2. Information recueillie automatiquement
Nous recevons automatiquement certains types de renseignements, dont certains peuvent être associés à des renseignements personnels, lorsque vous utilisez Navigation et/ou NavConnect.
a) Information relative à votre localisation et itinéraire ou d'autre contenu sur l'utilisateur
Chaque fois que vous accédez à Navigation, nous enregistrons votre localisation, vos recherches et vos itinéraires, y compris votre point d'origine ou localisation actuelle, l'adresse de votre destination, l'heure du début de votre déplacement et l'itinéraire qu'on vous a indiqué de suivre. Pendant que vous utilisez Navigation, nous enregistrons périodiquement votre localisation, des données provenant des capteurs de votre véhicule et la direction indiquée par le GPS ainsi que la vitesse de votre véhicule à partir du matériel GPS associé à votre véhicule afin de vous fournir votre itinéraire. Navigation sauvegardera et affichera vos destinations les plus récentes afin de vous permettre d'y retourner facilement.
Si vous choisissez d'utiliser votre localisation pour trouver une entreprise ou obtenir une carte, nous utiliserons les renseignements relatifs à votre localisation d'origine pour faire la recherche demandée, puis les supprimerons. Nous enregistrons de façon anonyme les activités et résultats de recherche aux fins d'analyses comparatives.
À l'égard des utilisateurs de NavConnect dont l'abonnement est actif et qui ont choisi d'utiliser Connectivity, les renseignements sur la localisation et les itinéraires seront stockés dans nos serveurs de bases de données sécurisés pendant au plus cinq ans afin d'améliorer nos services et d'offrir d'autres fonctionnalités pouvant améliorer vos capacités de service, fonctions et votre expérience utilisateur. À l'égard des utilisateurs de NavConnect, les autres données concernant les adresses, notamment les adresses à la maison et au travail, les lieux favoris et les destinations récentes, seront également stockées avec les renseignements sur votre compte dans nos serveurs de bases de données sécurisés jusqu'à ce que votre compte soit supprimé.
À l'égard des utilisateurs de NavConnect qui ont activé la fonction Predictive Navigation, nous recevrons régulièrement et enregistrerons les données relatives à la localisation provenant du matériel GPS de votre véhicule, chaque fois que vous utiliserez votre véhicule. Ces données seront stockées dans nos serveurs de bases de données sécurisés et nous utiliserons cette information afin de personnaliser et d'améliorer votre expérience de navigation et de recherche, par exemple pour fournir des résultats de recherche sur vos points d'intérêt préférés, des itinéraires personnalisés et des alertes de circulation.
Vous pouvez mettre à jour vos options Predictive Navigation (y compris désactiver la fonction Predictive Navigation) à tout moment en accédant au menu des paramètres de navigation.
b) Information au sujet des systèmes de votre véhicule
Nous pourrions recevoir et stocker des données restreintes sur votre véhicule provenant des systèmes de votre véhicule, par exemple la température ambiante, les détecteurs de présence du siège (marche/arrêt) et le système d'allumage (marche/arrêt), qui peuvent être utilisés pour optimiser la fonctionnalité de sécurité de Navigation. Pour les utilisateurs de Navigation seulement, ces données seront stockées indéfiniment dans la mémoire locale du système Navigation. À l'égard des utilisateurs de NavConnect dont l'abonnement est actif, ces données seront stockées dans nos serveurs de bases de données sécurisés pendant au plus cinq ans à compter de la date de cueillette.
c) Information au sujet de votre utilisation des services de Navigation
Lorsque vous utilisez Navigation et/ou NavConnect, nous stockons certains renseignements au sujet de votre utilisation de Navigation et/ou de NavConnect et du rendement de Navigation. Par exemple, nous pourrions recueillir des données au sujet de vos activités au cours d'une session, comme le type de recherche que vous avez effectuée ou le type d'itinéraire que vous avez choisi.
d) Information supplémentaire
Lorsque vous utilisez les fonctions de commande ou de saisie vocale de nos services, nous recevons la transcription texte de vos instructions vocales et ces données texte peuvent être stockées pendant au plus cinq ans. Nous pouvons utiliser et conserver cette information afin d'améliorer nos services de reconnaissance de la voix.
MOMENT OÙ VOTRE INFORMATION SERA PARTAGÉE OU COMMUNIQUÉE
Telenav ne vend pas ni ne loue, ne concède sous licence ou ne partage autrement les renseignements concernant votre utilisation de Navigation ou de NavConnect avec des parties qui ne sont pas membres de son groupe, sauf comme il est indiqué dans la présente politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels ou comme les lois applicables l'exigent ou l'autorisent.
Consentements donnés/traitement d'opérations
Nous pourrions communiquer des renseignements personnels à votre sujet à des tiers qui effectuent des opérations ou fournissent des services pour notre compte. Votre utilisation de Navigation et/ou de NavConnect peut constituer un consentement à la communication de tels renseignements.
Services de tiers ou fournisseurs de services tiers
Telenav peut rendre certains renseignements personnels non personnels et les partager ou partager des données regroupées anonymes avec des partenaires stratégiques qui travaillent avec nous pour analyser l'utilisation de produits ou services ainsi que fournir et améliorer des produits ou services ou qui nous aident à commercialiser des produits ou services auprès de clients, ou à des fins similaires. Les renseignements qui ne permettent pas d'identifier une personne ou qui sont regroupés ne sont assujettis à aucune restriction d'utilisation ou de communication en vertu de la présente politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels.
Certains des services et fonctionnalités de Navigation et de NavConnect sont fournis par ou conjointement avec des fournisseurs de services tiers. Ces fournisseurs de services tiers traitent les renseignements personnels pour notre compte et sont tenus de le faire en conformité avec la présente politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels et d'autres mesures appropriées en matière de sécurité et de confidentialité. Nos fournisseurs de services obtiennent l'information dont ils ont besoin pour s'acquitter de leurs fonctions désignées, et nous ne les autorisons pas à utiliser ou à communiquer des renseignements personnels aux fins de commercialisation ou à d'autres fins personnelles. Nous, les membres de notre groupe ou d'autres fournisseurs de services tiers aux États Unis ou dans d'autres territoires pouvons tenir et traiter les renseignements personnels. En cas de transfert ultérieur à des tiers de données concernant des personnes de l'UE reçues en vertu du « Bouclier de confidentialité UE-US » (UE-US Privacy Shield), Telenav est potentiellement responsable.
Procédures judiciaires
Nous, les membres de notre groupe et nos fournisseurs de services canadiens, américains et autres nous conformerons aux assignations à témoigner, aux ordonnances des tribunaux ou aux autres procédures judiciaires applicables relativement aux renseignements à votre sujet que nous avons en notre possession, et nous pourrions utiliser et communiquer des renseignements personnels pour établir vos ou nos droits ou ceux de tiers, exercer nos droits ou pour nous défendre contre des réclamations. Nous pouvons également être dans l'obligation de divulguer des renseignements personnels en réponse à une demande légale par les autorités publiques, notamment à des fins de conformité aux exigences de sécurité nationale ou d'application des lois.
Transferts commerciaux
Les renseignements à votre sujet que nous avons en notre possession pourraient être communiqués dans le cadre d'une fusion, d'une acquisition, de la vente d'actifs de la société ou de la transition de services vers un autre fournisseur éventuelle ou effectuée ainsi que dans un cas improbable d'insolvabilité, de faillite ou de mise sous séquestre dans le cadre de laquelle vos renseignements personnels seraient transférés en tant qu'actifs de la société. Telenav ne garantit pas que l'entité qui recevra ces renseignements dans le cadre de l'une de ces opérations se conformera à toutes les modalités de la présente politique.
Utilisateurs internationaux
Les informations que nous recueillons à votre sujet peuvent également être transférées parmi nos différentes divisions et sociétés affiliées situées dans le monde entier, ce qui peut impliquer leur transfert à partir de pays de l'Espace économique européen (EEE) et de la Suisse vers des pays hors EEE. En permettant à Telenav de recueillir ces renseignements vous concernant, vous consentez à ces transferts, notamment à la transmission transfrontalière de données couvertes par cette politique de confidentialité. En conséquence, les tribunaux, gouvernements ou les organismes chargés de l'application de la loi de ces pays pourraient obtenir la divulgation de ces renseignements en vertu des lois des pays respectifs.
Telenav est conforme aux exigences du cadre d'application du « Bouclier de confidentialité UE-US » tel que défini par le ministère américain du Commerce concernant le recueil, l'utilisation et la conservation de renseignements personnels provenant de pays membres de l'Union européenne.

SÉCURITÉ DES RENSEIGNEMENTS PERSONNELS
Telenav a mis en place diverses mesures de sauvegarde physiques, électroniques et procédurales dans le but de préserver la confidentialité et la sécurité des renseignements personnels sous notre garde et notre contrôle. Par exemple, Telenav réserve l'accès aux systèmes de Telenav qui stockent ces renseignements au personnel autorisé.
Bien que Telenav ait mis en place une multitude de mesures de sécurité pour prévenir l'accès non autorisé à vos renseignements personnels ou la communication de ceux ci, aucune mesure de sécurité n'est absolue ou pleinement garantie. Telenav tentera raisonnablement de vous aviser si elle détermine que des tiers ont posé des actes non autorisés qui violent la loi ou la présente politique ou que d'autres infractions à la sécurité sont survenues ou encore si elle y est tenue par la loi.
Telenav conservera vos renseignements personnels aussi longtemps que nécessaire pour l'exercice de ses activités ou conformément aux exigences des lois, règlements ou ordonnances gouvernementales applicables. Au moment d'éliminer des renseignements personnels, nous utilisons des procédures raisonnables sur le plan commercial pour les effacer ou les rendre anonymes ou illisibles.
PROTECTION DES RENSEIGNEMENTS PERSONNELS DES ENFANTS
Telenav ne demandera pas sciemment à  une personne âgée de moins de 13 ans de lui fournir des renseignements personnels ni ne recueillera de tels renseignements auprès d'une telle personne sans le consentement vérifiable préalable de ses parents ou de son tuteur légal. Cependant, si vous autorisez un enfant à utiliser nos services ou produits en leur donnant accès à un véhicule ou à un appareil ayant accès à Navigation, à NavConnect et/ou à d'autres services ou produits Telenav, les renseignements personnels associés à cette utilisation seront traités comme s'il s'agissait de vos renseignements conformément à la présente politique. Telenav encourage les parents à s'intéresser aux activités en ligne (y compris la navigation Internet sans fil) de leurs enfants pour s'assurer qu'aucun renseignement n'est recueilli auprès d'eux sans le consentement d'un parent ou du tuteur.
DEMANDE DE RENSEIGNEMENTS PROVENANT DE CLIENTS
Les clients ont le droit de demander des renseignements pour savoir si une entreprise a communiqué des renseignements personnels à des sociétés membres de son groupe ou à des tiers aux fins de commercialisation directe. Ils ont également le droit de demander l'accès à leurs renseignements personnels qui sont sous le contrôle de Telenav ainsi que de les mettre à jour et de les corriger. Pour protéger vos renseignements personnels et préserver votre sécurité, Telenav prendra des mesures raisonnables pour vérifier votre identité avant de vous donner accès à vos renseignements personnels ou d'y apporter des corrections. Telenav déploiera de bonne foi des efforts pour répondre aux demandes de correction de renseignements personnels, sauf si la demande est déraisonnable. Comme il est indiqué dans la présente politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels, Telenav ne vendra pas vos renseignements personnels ni ne les partagera avec des tiers aux fins de commercialisation directe par ceux ci sans votre consentement. Les clients qui souhaitent demander des renseignements supplémentaires au sujet de notre conformité avec cette loi ou qui ont des questions ou des préoccupations au sujet de nos pratiques et politiques en matière de protection des renseignements personnels peuvent communiquer avec nous à support@telenav.com ou par écrit avec le responsable de la protection des renseignements personnels, à Telenav, Inc., Attn : Privacy Policy Officer, 950 DeGuigne Dr., Sunnyvale, CA 94085 3900, USA

AUTRES CONVENTIONS
Telenav peut conclure avec des clients des conventions écrites relatives à des produits ou à des services qui renferment des dispositions particulières en matière de confidentialité, de sécurité ou de traitement d'information.

Dans tous les autres cas, les modalités de la présente politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels s'appliqueront.
DROIT APPLICABLE

Cuando usted utiliza la navegación o NavConnect, nosotros recibimos automáticamente cierto tipo de información, parte de la cual puede estar asociada con  información personal.

Cada vez que usted ingresa a la navegación, nosotros grabamos su ubicación, la información sobre búsquedas y rutas, incluyendo su punto de origen o ubicación actual, domicilio de destino, hora en que inicia su viaje, así como la ruta que ha instruido a seguir. Cuando se encuentra en una sesión de navegación activa,  grabamos periódicamente su ubicación actual, datos de los sensores de su vehículo, encabezado de su GPS, así como su velocidad, a partir del hardware del GPS asociado a su vehículo.  La navegación salvará y mostrará sus destinos más recientes para que pueda trasladarse nuevamente hacia ellos con facilidad.
Cuando usted elige su ubicación actual de geolocalización para especificar el lugar, a fin de realizar la búsqueda de un negocio u obtener un mapa, usaremos dicha información sólo para la finalidad necesaria y después la desecharemos. Grabaremos, de manera anónima, todas los ejercicios de búsqueda y resultados con fines de análisis comparativos.

Para los usuarios de Navconnect, otros datos de dirección, incluyendo las de casa y trabajo, lugares preferidos y destinos recientes se guardarán también junto con su información de cuenta en nuestra base de datos segura en la nube hasta que su cuenta sea borrada.
Para los usuarios de NavConnect que han habilitado la función de navegación predictiva, recibiremos y guardaremos de manera regular sus datos de ubicación proporcionados por el hardware de geolocalización de su vehículo, siempre que se encuentren utilizando el automóvil.  Dichos datos se almacenarán en nuestra base de datos segura en la nube hasta por 5 años, para poder personalizar y mejorar su navegación y experiencia de búsqueda y así proporcionarles, por ejemplo, los resultados sobre puntos de interés de marcas preferidos, personalizando rutas y alertas de viajes al trabajo.
Usted puede actualizar las opciones de navegación predictiva (incluyendo su inhabilitación) en cualquier momento, ingresando al menú de opciones de navegación.

Personal information does not include anonymous or aggregate information, which after processing may not be associated with a specific person or entity. We believe that you should know what information about you we collect, as well as how that information is used, maintained, and, in some cases, shared. The following sets forth our privacy practices and policies, applicable to the Scout GPS Link application users and account holders.

INFORMATION COLLECTED ABOUT YOU AND OUR USE OF SUCH INFORMATION
The types of personal and other information we may collect about you are primarily from three sources: (1) information you provide; (2) information automatically collected; and (3) information from other sources. How we use and maintain that information is described below.
1. Information You Provide
(a) Register/Information Related to Your Account
We collect and store personal information about you when you register for an account to use our Scout GPS Link application or login to Scout GPS Link using your Scout mobile account information, and when you otherwise transmit such information to us via the Scout GPS Link application, or contact us by phone or email regarding your account. For instance, to maintain and/or verify your account we collect and store in a database your User ID, name, email address, account password your mobile operating system, mobile phone model, head unit device-type ID.

If you want to revoke authorization for the application to interact with your Facebook account, you can remove the application from the list of permitted Apps or turn off the Platform for Apps, Plugin and Websites from the Settings menu for your Facebook account.
When you choose to access Scout GPS Link through a Google Sign in, we collect your email, basic profile information and Google password with your permission, which will be stored to provide future access to our application. We may use this email to contact you regarding your account and/or to respond to any inquiry or feedback you submit from within our applications as described in section (b) below.
You have the option of providing us with your home and work addresses, which we store in our database, to enable you to quickly navigate to those destinations and readily access other features of the application. You can also create a list of "favorite" addresses and points of interest. Within the application you also have the option to use the application's settings menu to personalize your experience, for example by selecting your navigation preferences, setting up traffic reports, and selecting your preferred gas grade for searches. We store these addresses and settings in our database so that you can access them from your account, even if you change vehicles or mobile devices.
We may also use the information that we collect about you to manage your account and provide you with customer support, perform research and analysis about your use of our products and services, to inform you from time to time about features, products or services that we think will interest you, unless you inform us that you opt out from receiving such communications.  We may share certain information we collect about you and your usage activity with our third party auto partners for the purpose of performing research and analysis about users of our products and services. However, any data will be aggregated and all of your Personal Information will be removed before sharing with such partners.
(b) Contact Our Customer Service Representatives/In-App Feedback
We may use your email address to contact you with regard to your account, such as to confirm any change to your phone number, and to respond to any inquiry or feedback you submit by email or from within the Scout GPS Link application.

(d) Request for Information
When you request additional information about one of our services either via the Telenav website or via one of our partners, such as Toyota, the information we collect through these requests may include your name, phone number, and email address. We will use this information to provide you with details about our services, and we may use this information to promote our services to you in the future, unless you inform us that you opt out from receiving such communications. To understand what a partner of ours may do with information about you in the partner's custody, you should check the privacy policy of that partner.

If you use or link to public forums such as social networking services, blogs on Telenav or non-Telenav websites, internet bulletin boards, or chat rooms, be aware that any personal information you submit can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, including to send you unsolicited messages. Telenav cannot prevent the distribution and use of such information by other parties.
2. Information Automatically Collected
We automatically receive certain types of information, some of which may be associated with personal information, when you use the Scout GPS Link application.
(a) Information Related to Your Location and Route or Other User Content
Each time you access the Scout GPS Link application, we record your location and route information, including your point of origin, the address of your destination, the starting time of your trip, the route you are instructed to follow, and your arrival time (if applicable). We record your current location when your wireless device requests a rerouting (which occurs, for example, when you deviate from the specified instructions). When you are in an active navigation session, we periodically receive your current location, GPS heading and speed from the GPS hardware associated with your wireless device. We maintain a database with these locations and route information, and may keep such information indefinitely to improve our map coverage and to provide other features that may enhance and personalize your service capabilities, functions, and your user experience. The application will display your most recent destinations to allow you to easily navigate to these destinations again. When you choose to use your current GPS location for specifying the locale for a business finder search, or obtaining a map, we use your location information for the requested purpose. We anonymously record any search activities and results for comparative analysis. Further, we anonymously record transactions for the purpose of paying directory listing providers.
Scout GPS Link includes a location and information sharing feature that enables you to share your location or other information with another party. These location exchanges are transmitted within the application or via the internet or text messages using SMS. For example, when you create, join, or navigate to a Meet Up with the Scout GPS Link application, your name, current location and/or ETA at the Meet Up location will be displayed on a map visible by other Meet Up participants.  The Meet Up and your location and/or ETA will be removed from the map visible to other participants when you delete the Meet Up.  We record these location exchanges, and may keep such information indefinitely. 
Additionally, you can allow the Scout GPS Link application to access the data stored in the address book on your mobile device. Our applications may use data from your address book or from your Facebook or Google+ contacts (if you signed in with a Facebook  or Google+ sign-in)  to allow you to search for and navigate to the addresses of your contacts or create a Meet Up within the application. We will only access this data if you have given permissions for the Scout GPS Link application to do so, and you can revoke such permissions at any time by changing the settings on your mobile device.
(b) Information About Your Use of the Application
When you use the Scout GPS Link application, we log certain information your use of the application and the application's performance. For example, we may collect data about what actions you take within the application such as whether the vehicle's head unit is being used, the type of search you performed or what caused an application crash. This data will be stored indefinitely to allow us to improve the application. This data may be shared with our third party auto partners in anonymized, aggregated form. Your Personal Information will be removed before any data is shared.
We will also collect information relating to the performance of our applications, including the state of your device at the time of an error or issue with the application, and such information is disclosed to and processed by third party providers, including but not limited to Crashlytics, for purposes of collecting information about errors or issues within our applications so we may improve our applications.
(c) Other Information
When you use the voice command or entry features on our services, we record your audible utterance (what you said) and that recording is shared with our third party voice recognition partner, who will use the data solely for voice recognition purposes.
WHEN YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE SHARED OR DISCLOSED
Telenav does not sell, rent, license or otherwise share information with unaffiliated parties except as explained in this privacy policy.
Consent Given/Transaction Processing
We may disclose personal information about you to third parties with your consent. Consent is sometimes implicit, as in the disclosure of personal information to third-parties who complete transactions or perform services on our behalf. Third Party Services or Third Party Service Providers.
Telenav may make certain personally identifiable information non-personal and share it or anonymized, aggregated data with strategic partners that work with us to analyze usage, provide and improve products or services, or that help us market to customers, or for similar purposes. Information that is not personally identifiable or is aggregated is not subject to any restrictions of use or disclosure under this privacy policy.
If you take advantage of a third party's services or products offered through the use of our services, we may disclose your personal information to such unaffiliated third parties. These entities may use this information that you provide in the course of your use of Telenav's services (including your name, , telephone number, and email address) to promote their products and services to you. Any such personal information that a third party uses will be subject to their applicable privacy policies.

Business Transfers
Information about you in our possession may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another provider, as well as in the unlikely event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which your personal information would be transferred as one of the business assets of the company. Telenav does not guarantee that any entity receiving such information in connection with one of these transactions will comply with all terms of this policy.

Privacy Policy for Scout® GPS Link (Canada)

en
fr

This Privacy Policy governs your use of the Scout GPS Link mobile application offered by Telenav, Inc. ("Telenav") for mobile devices and use with certain Toyota and Lexus vehicles. By using this application or otherwise by interacting with us, you consent to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Policy, please do not engage in any of these activities.
You acknowledge and understand that this privacy policy does not apply to Telenav websites, other Telenav products or services, our business partners or other companies that Telenav does not own or operate. For information about other Telenav products and services as well as the Telenav.com website, please visit http://www.telenav.com/legal/policies.html. For information on how other providers of products or services handle Personal Information you provide through other web sites or through the use of our services in conjunction with a third party, please consult their privacy policies.
Telenav understands and respects your concerns about the collection, use and treatment of your personally identifiable information in connection with the Scout GPS Link application ("Personal Information"). Personal Information may include name, home address, telephone numbers including mobile telephone numbers, location information, Mobile Subscriber Identifier, Mobile Equipment Identifier, and email addresses. Personal Information does not include anonymous or aggregate information, which cannot be associated with a specific person. We believe that you should know what information about you we collect, as well as how that information is used, maintained, and, in some cases, shared. The following sets forth our privacy practices and policies, applicable to the Scout GPS Link application users and account holders.
INFORMATION COLLECTED ABOUT YOU AND OUR USE OF SUCH INFORMATION
The types of Personal Information we may collect about you are primarily from three sources: (1) information you provide; (2) information automatically collected; and (3) information from other sources. How we use and maintain that information is described below.
1. Information You Provide
(a) Register/Information Related to Your Account
We collect and store Personal Information about you when you register for an account to use our Scout GPS Link application or login to Scout GPS Link, and when you otherwise transmit such information to us via the Scout GPS Link application, or contact us by phone or email regarding your account. For instance, to maintain and/or verify your account we collect and store in a database your name, email address, account password your mobile operating system, mobile phone model, head unit device-type ID. From the device, we collect a device ID such as IDFA or Android Advertising ID.
When you choose to access Scout GPS Link through a Facebook log-in, we collect your name, profile picture, email, and your Facebook contacts list with your permission in order to facilitate your log-in. Your name will be displayed and stored within our application and your email and Facebook password will be stored to provide future access to our application. We may use this email to contact you regarding your account and/or to respond to any inquiry or feedback you submit from within our applications as described in section (b) below. If you want to revoke authorization for the application to interact with your Facebook account, you can log-out of Facebook from within the Scout GPS Link account settings menu, remove the application from the list of permitted Apps, or turn off the Platform for Apps, Plugin and Websites from the Settings menu for your Facebook account.
When you choose to access Scout GPS Link through a Google Sign In, we collect your email and basic profile information, which will be stored to provide future access to our application in order to facilitate your log-in. We may use this email to contact you regarding your account and/or to respond to any inquiry or feedback you submit from within our applications as described in section (b) below.
You have the option of providing us with your home and work addresses, which we store in our database, to enable you to quickly navigate to those destinations and readily access other features of the application. You can also create a list of "favorite" addresses and points of interest. Within the application you also have the option to use the application's settings menu to personalize your experience, for example by selecting your navigation preferences, setting up traffic reports, and selecting your preferred gas grade for searches. We store these addresses and settings in our database so that you can access them from your account, even if you change vehicles or mobile devices.
We may also use the information that we collect about you to manage your account and provide you with customer support and to perform research and analysis about your use of our products and services. We may share certain information we collect about you and your usage activity with our third party auto partners for the purpose of performing research and analysis about users of our products and services. However, any data will be aggregated and all of your Personal Information will be removed before sharing with such partners.
(b) Contact Our Customer Service Representatives/In-App Feedback
We may use your email address to contact you with regard to your account, such as to confirm any change to your phone number, and to respond to any inquiry or feedback you submit by email or from within the Scout GPS Link application. If you contact us with a comment, question or complaint, you may be asked for information that identifies you (such as your name, address and a phone number) along with any additional information we may need to help us promptly answer your question or respond to your comment or complaint. We may retain this information to assist you in the future and to improve our customer service and product and service offerings.
Additionally, if you provide feedback regarding a routing or map issue within one of our applications, we may share your comments in non-identifiable form and anonymized data about your location and route with the OpenStreetMap community for purposes of improving OpenStreetMap data.
2. Information Automatically Collected
We automatically receive certain types of information, some of which may be Personal Information, when you use the Scout GPS Link application.
(a) Information Related to Your Location and Route or Other User Content
Each time you access or use the Scout GPS Link application (including when you search for a nearby address or Point of Interest within the application running on your mobile device, when you are in an active navigation session within the application running on your mobile device, or when your mobile device running the application is connected to your Toyota vehicle), we record your GPS location and route information, including your point of origin, the address of your destination, the starting time of your trip, the route you are instructed to follow, and your arrival time (if applicable). We record your current location when your wireless device requests a rerouting (which occurs, for example, when you deviate from the specified instructions). When you are in an active navigation session, we periodically receive your current location, GPS heading and speed from the GPS hardware associated with your wireless device in order to provide you with and update your route. We maintain a database with these locations and route information, and may keep such information for up to five (5) years to improve our map coverage and to provide other features that may enhance and personalize your service capabilities, functions, and your user experience.
We may also periodically receive your current location from the GPS hardware associated with your wireless device for the purpose of providing enhanced services, including traffic flow data for you and other users of the application. When your location, GPS heading and speed are used for these purposes, we remove any Personal Information, such as your phone number, prior to storing. We may share such location data in a non-identifiable or anonymized form with our third party partners performing research and analysis about traffic conditions and road segment usage. The application will display your most recent destinations to allow you to easily navigate to these destinations again. When you choose to use your current GPS location for specifying the locale for a business finder search, or obtaining a map, we use your location information for the requested purpose. We anonymously record any search activities and results in order to improve our search functionality. Further, we anonymously record transactions for the purpose of determining our payment obligations to directory listing providers.
Additionally, you can allow the Scout GPS Link application to access the data stored in the address book on your mobile device. Our applications may use data from your address book to allow you to search for and navigate to the addresses of your contacts within the application. We will only access this data if you have given permissions for the Scout GPS Link application to do so, and you can revoke such permissions at any time by changing the settings on your mobile device.
(b) Information About Your Use of the Application
When you use the Scout GPS Link application, we log certain information regarding your use of the application and the application's performance. For example, we may collect data about what actions you take within the application such as whether the vehicle's head unit is being used, the type of search you performed or what caused an application crash. This data will be stored indefinitely to allow us to improve the application. This data may be shared with our third party auto partners in a non-identifiable, aggregated form. Your Personal Information will be removed before any data is shared.
We will also collect information relating to the performance of our applications, including the state of your device at the time of an error or issue with the application, and such information is disclosed to and processed by third party providers, including but not limited to Crashlytics, for purposes of collecting information about errors or issues within our applications so we may improve our applications.
WHEN YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE SHARED OR DISCLOSED
Telenav does not sell, rent, license or otherwise share information with unaffiliated parties except as explained in this privacy policy.
Third Party Services and Service Providers
We may transfer or disclose certain information about you to third parties that perform services on our behalf, such as data hosting, application performance reporting, map and traffic data improvement and analysis, application usage analysis, and the list referenced below.
Some of the application's services and functionality are provided by or in conjunction with third party service providers. These third party service providers process Personal Information on our behalf and are obligated to process such information in compliance with this privacy policy and other appropriate security and confidentiality measures. We do not authorize them to use or disclose Personal Information for their own marketing or other purposes.  Personal Information may be maintained and processed by us, our affiliates and other third party service providers in the U.S. or other jurisdictions.
Telenav may share certain non-identifiable, aggregated data with strategic partners that work with us to analyze usage, provide and improve products or services, or that help us market to customers, or for similar purposes.
Third Party Partners
If you take advantage of a third party's services or products offered through the use of our services, we may disclose your Personal Information to such unaffiliated third parties. With your consent, these entities may use this information that you provide in the course of your use of Telenav's services (including your name, telephone number, and email address) to promote their products and services to you. Any such Personal Information that a third party uses will be subject to their applicable privacy policies.
Legal Processes
We and our authorized service providers and affiliates will comply with any subpoenas, court orders or other legal processes for any of the information about you in our possession, and we may use or disclose such information to establish or exercise yours, ours, or others' legal rights, or to defend against legal claims or as otherwise required or permitted by applicable Canadian, US or other law. We also may be required to disclose Personal Information in response to a lawful request by applicable US or other courts and governmental authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
Business Transfers
Information about you in our possession may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another provider, as well as in the unlikely event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which your Personal Information would be transferred as one of the business assets of the company.
SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
Telenav has implemented reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in an effort to protect the confidentiality and security of Personal Information in our custody and under our control.
While Telenav maintains security measures to help prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of your Personal Information, no security measures are absolute or wholly guaranteed.
Telenav will maintain your Personal Information for as long as a business need exists, or as required by applicable laws, regulations, or government orders. When we dispose of Personal Information, we use commercially reasonable procedures to erase, anonymize or render it unreadable.

Telenav comprend et respecte vos préoccupations au sujet de la collecte, de l’utilisation et du traitement des renseignements permettant de vous identifier dans le cadre de l’application Scout GPS Link (les « renseignements personnels »). Parmi les renseignements personnels peuvent figurer le nom, l’adresse domiciliaire, les numéros de téléphone, y compris les numéros de téléphone mobile, les données de positionnement, le numéro d’identification d’abonné mobile, le numéro d’identification d’équipement mobile et les adresses de courriel. Les renseignements personnels ne comprennent pas les renseignements anonymes ou regroupés qui ne peuvent être associés à une personne en particulier. Nous estimons que vous devriez savoir quel type de renseignements nous recueillons et comment ces renseignements sont utilisés, conservés et, dans certains cas, partagés. Nos pratiques et politiques en matière de protection des renseignements personnels applicables aux utilisateurs et aux titulaires de compte de l’application Scout GPS Link sont décrites ci après.
RENSEIGNEMENTS RECUEILLIS À VOTRE SUJET ET MANIÈRE DONT NOUS LES UTILISONS
Le type de renseignements personnels que nous pourrions recueillir à votre sujet proviennent principalement de trois sources : 1) l’information que vous fournissez; 2) l’information qui est recueillie automatiquement et 3) l’information provenant d’autres sources. La manière dont nous utilisons et conservons cette information est décrite ci après.
1. Renseignements que vous fournissez
a) Inscription/renseignements liés à votre compte
Nous recueillons et conservons des renseignements personnels à votre sujet lorsque vous ouvrez un compte en vue d’utiliser notre application Scout GPS Link ou que vous vous connectez à Scout GPS Link, et lorsque vous nous transmettez autrement cette information par l’intermédiaire de l’application Scout GPS Link ou que vous communiquez avec nous par téléphone ou par courriel au sujet de votre compte. Par exemple, aux fins de la tenue et/ou de la vérification de votre compte, nous recueillons et conservons dans une base de données votre nom, votre adresse de courriel, le mot de passe du compte, des données sur votre système d’exploitation mobile, le modèle de votre téléphone mobile et l’identifiant de type d’appareil de l’unité centrale. Sur l’appareil, nous recueillons un numéro d’identification comme l’identifiant publicitaire IDFA ou Android.
Si vous décidez d’accéder à Scout GPS Link au moyen de votre compte Facebook, nous recueillerons votre nom, votre photo de profil, votre adresse de courriel et la liste de vos contacts Facebook avec votre permission afin de simplifier l’ouverture de la session. Votre nom sera affiché et stocké dans notre application et votre adresse de courriel et votre mot de passe Facebook seront stockés afin de permettre l’accès à notre application dans le futur. Nous pourrions utiliser cette adresse de courriel afin de communiquer avec vous concernant votre compte et/ou de répondre à des questions ou à des commentaires que vous formulez au moyen de notre application comme il est décrit au paragraphe b) ci-après. Si vous souhaitez révoquer l’autorisation permettant à l’application d’interagir avec votre compte Facebook, vous pouvez vous déconnecter de Facebook à partir du menu des paramètres de compte de Scout GPS Link, retirer l’application de la liste d’applications autorisées ou désactiver la fonction Applications, sites Web et modules d’extension dans les paramètres de votre compte Facebook.
Si vous décidez d’accéder à Scout GPS Link au moyen de votre compte Google, nous recueillerons votre adresse de courriel et des données de base sur votre profil, lesquels seront conservés afin de permettre l’accès à notre application dans le futur et de simplifier l’ouverture de votre session. Nous pourrions utiliser cette adresse de courriel afin de communiquer avec vous concernant votre compte et/ou de répondre à des questions ou à des commentaires que vous formulez au sein de notre application comme il est décrit au paragraphe b) ci-après.
Vous avez la possibilité de nous fournir vos adresses à domicile et au travail, que nous stockons dans notre base de données, pour vous permettre de naviguer rapidement vers ces destinations et d’accéder facilement à d’autres fonctionnalités de l’application. Vous pouvez également créer une liste d’adresses « favorites » et de points d’intérêt. L’application vous permet également d’utiliser son menu des paramètres afin de personnaliser votre expérience, par exemple en choisissant vos préférences de navigation, en établissant des rapports de circulation et en établissant vos préférences en matière de qualité d’essence pour les recherches. Nous stockons ces adresses et paramètres dans nos bases de données de sorte que vous puissiez y accéder à partir de votre compte, même si vous changez de véhicule ou d’appareil mobile.
Nous pourrions également utiliser les renseignements que nous recueillons sur vous pour gérer votre compte et vous fournir un soutien à la clientèle et pour effectuer des recherches et des analyses à propos de votre utilisation de nos produits et services. Nous pourrions communiquer à nos partenaires indépendants du secteur automobile certains renseignements que nous recueillons à votre sujet et au sujet de votre utilisation dans le but d’effectuer des recherches et des analyses au sujet des utilisateurs de nos produits et services. Toutefois, les données seront regroupées et tous vos renseignements personnels seront retirés avant que des renseignements soient communiqués à ces partenaires.
b) Communication avec nos représentants du service à la clientèle/commentaires formulés au moyen de l’application
Nous pouvons utiliser votre adresse de courriel pour communiquer avec vous au sujet de votre compte, notamment pour confirmer une modification apportée à votre numéro de téléphone, et pour répondre à une demande de renseignements ou à un commentaire que vous avez formulé par courriel ou au moyen de l’application Scout GPS Link. Si vous communiquez avec nous pour formuler un commentaire, une question ou une plainte, vous pourriez devoir fournir des renseignements pouvant vous identifier (comme votre nom, votre adresse et votre numéro de téléphone) ainsi que d’autres renseignements dont nous pourrions avoir besoin pour nous aider à répondre rapidement à votre question, à votre commentaire ou à votre plainte. Nous pourrions conserver ces renseignements pour vous aider dans le futur et pour améliorer notre service à la clientèle et notre gamme de produits et services.
De plus, si vous formulez des commentaires concernant un problème d’itinéraire ou de carte dans l’une de nos applications, nous pourrions partager vos commentaires selon un format qui ne risque pas de vous identifier ainsi que des données anonymisées sur votre emplacement et votre itinéraire avec la communauté OpenStreetMap en vue de perfectionner les données d’OpenStreetMap.
2. Renseignements recueillis automatiquement
Nous recevons automatiquement certains types de renseignements, dont certains peuvent être des renseignements personnels, lorsque vous utilisez l’application Scout GPS Link.
a) Renseignements relatifs à votre position et itinéraire ou d’autre contenu sur l’utilisateur
Chaque fois que vous accédez à l’application Scout GPS Link ou que vous l’utilisez (notamment lorsque vous recherchez une adresse à proximité ou un point d’intérêt au moyen de l’application ouverte sur votre appareil mobile, lorsque votre session de navigation est active dans l’application ouverte sur votre appareil mobile ou lorsque votre appareil mobile sur laquelle l’application est ouverte est connecté à votre véhicule Toyota), nous enregistrons votre position obtenue par GPS, vos itinéraires, y compris votre point d’origine, l’adresse de votre destination, l’heure du début de votre déplacement, l’itinéraire qu’on vous a indiqué de suivre et l’heure de votre arrivée (s’il y a lieu). Nous enregistrons votre position actuelle lorsque votre appareil sans fil demande un nouvel itinéraire (ce qui survient lorsque, par exemple, vous vous écartez de l’itinéraire fourni). Tant que votre session de navigation est active, nous recevons périodiquement votre position, la direction indiquée par le GPS et la vitesse de votre véhicule à partir du matériel GPS associé à votre appareil sans fil afin de vous fournir votre itinéraire et de le rajuster. Nous constituons une base de données composée de ces données de positionnement et d’itinéraire et nous pouvons les conserver jusqu’à cinq ans afin d’améliorer nos cartes et d’offrir d’autres fonctionnalités pouvant améliorer et personnaliser vos capacités à bénéficier du service, les fonctions et votre expérience utilisateur.
Nous pourrions également recevoir périodiquement des données sur votre position provenant du matériel GPS associé à votre appareil sans fil afin de vous fournir et de fournir à d’autres utilisateurs de l’application des services bonifiés, comme des données sur la fluidité de la circulation. Si les données sur votre position, votre direction indiquée par le GPS et votre vitesse sont utilisées à ces fins, nous en retirons tous les renseignements personnels, comme votre numéro de téléphone, avant de les stocker. Nous pourrions partager ces données de positionnement selon un format qui ne risque pas de vous identifier ou sous une forme anonyme avec nos partenaires indépendants qui effectuent de la recherche et de l’analyse sur les conditions de la circulation et l’utilisation du réseau routier. L’application affichera vos destinations les plus récentes afin de vous permettre d’y retourner facilement. Si vous choisissez d’utiliser votre position établie par GPS pour trouver une entreprise ou obtenir une carte, nous utiliserons les renseignements relatifs à votre position pour faire la recherche demandée. Nous enregistrons de façon anonyme les activités et les résultats de recherche afin d’améliorer notre fonction de recherche. De plus, nous enregistrons les opérations de façon anonyme afin de déterminer nos obligations de paiement aux fournisseurs de service d’annuaire.
De plus, vous pouvez permettre à l’application Scout GPS Link d’accéder aux données stockées dans le carnet d’adresses de votre appareil mobile. Nos applications peuvent utiliser les données de votre carnet d’adresses pour vous permettre d’effectuer une recherche dans vos contacts et d’activer la navigation pour vous diriger à leur adresse au moyen de l’application. Nous n’accéderons à ces données que si vous en avez donné la permission à l’application Scout GPS Link. Vous pouvez révoquer la permission à tout moment en modifiant les paramètres de votre appareil mobile.
b) Données sur l’utilisation que vous faites de l’application
Lorsque vous utilisez l’application Scout GPS Link, nous conservons certaines données sur votre utilisation de l’application et son rendement. Par exemple, nous pourrions recueillir des données au sujet de vos activités dans l’application, comme l’utilisation de l’unité centrale du véhicule, le type de recherche que vous avez effectuée ou la cause d’une défaillance de l’application. Ces données seront stockées pour une durée indéterminée afin de nous permettre d’apporter des améliorations à l’application.

Telenav
Transforming life on the go for millions of people around the world.

We're hiring.









At the frontier of doing "on the go" better
At Telenav, we've always been about making people's lives less stressful, more productive, and more fun when they are on the go. We started on this mission in 1999 when we pioneered GPS navigation for mobile phones and changed how people get from point A to point B. Over the years, we have paved the way for a bigger end-to-end mobility transformation for all people on the go — starting with connected car solutions for drivers.
Our Products
We provide connected car and advertising solutions that are built on our powerful location platform.
Connected car solutions that help people before, during, and after every drive



Intelligent navigation & ADAS services
Our deep expertise in location-based services and driver, car, and road intelligence enables proactive, predictive, and personalized navigation and ADAS experiences. These experiences are powered by our comprehensive set of location services across the car, mobile, and cloud including global one-box search, real-time traffic, dynamic routing, fully interactive maps, and ADAS features.



Global platform that meets regional needs
Our robust location platform enables top global automotive companies to deliver experiences that help their drivers save time, stay safe, and reduce stress. These experiences are delivered through connected-embedded, embedded, and brought-in systems that are customized to meet the regional needs of drivers.





Crowd-sourced map-making
Telenav is proud to be part of the OpenStreetMap® (OSM) community. Our map-making tools enable the OSM community of more than 3 million contributors to make OSM a richer map for navigation, ADAS, and autonomous driving applications.

Applicable law may not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability or incidental or consequential damages, so the above exclusion may not apply to you.

OTHER QUALIFICATIONS
You understand and agree that the Telenav Software is downloaded to your wireless device at your own discretion and risk and that you will be solely responsible for any damages to your wireless device, or loss of data, that results from the download of such software. 
Telenav does not warrant that the Telenav Services or the Telenav Software will not infringe on third party intellectual property rights.

Telenav has technological and operational security policies and procedures to protect your information from loss, misuse, alteration, or unintentional destruction, but Telenav makes no representations or warranties regarding the security of the Telenav Services or the transmission of data or information to and from Telenav and your wireless device.

MISCELLANEOUS

Scout® with OSM
Please read these terms and conditions of use ("Terms of Use") carefully before you launch Scout® ("Scout") on your wireless device. Your use of Scout indicates that you accept these terms and conditions. If you do not accept these terms and conditions, do not launch or otherwise use Scout.
INTRODUCTION
These Terms of Use represent the agreement ("Agreement") between you and Telenav, Inc. ("Telenav") with respect to Scout. All references herein to "you" and "your" means you, your employees, agents, and contractors, and any other entity on whose behalf you accept these terms and conditions, all of whom shall also be bound by this Agreement.
Telenav may revise these terms and conditions at any time, with or without notice to you. You should visit www.telenav.com from time to time to review the then current terms and conditions for Scout.
SCOUT
Scout allows you to obtain via your wireless device GPS-assisted navigation instructions to destinations throughout most of the United States or Canada, depending on your cellular carrier. Use of Scout requires payment of a monthly fee, which includes download to your wireless device of the Telenav GPS Navigator software and any upgrades, modifications, or additions thereto (collectively, "Telenav Software"), but does not include any hardware that may be required for certain wireless devices (such as a standalone GPS receiver). A complete description of Scout is available at the Products link on Telenav's website, located at www.telenav.com/products/tn/.
Scout is for your internal business and personal use and is not for resale or other transfer or disposition to any other person or entity.
Scout utilizes map and other data licensed to Telenav by third parties for the benefit of you and other end users. This Agreement includes end-user terms required by these companies (set forth at the end of this Agreement), and thus your use of Scout is limited by and subject to such terms.
YOUR LOCATION AND ROUTE INFORMATION
For Telenav to provide Scout, Telenav must record your route information, including your point of origin, the address of your destination, the starting time of your trip, and the route you are instructed to follow, and must periodically receive your GPS location from the GPS hardware associated with your wireless device.
In using Scout, you allow Telenav to access your GPS hardware and otherwise obtain this location and route information, and to record, compile and display such information internally. Such information is subject to Telenav's privacy policy located at www.telenav.com. Your use of Scout indicates that you accept the terms of Telenav's privacy policy.
If you are using Scout with Ford Applink: (1) you allow Ford Motor Company to access your vehicle GPS hardware and send your GPS location to Telenav so that Telenav may record, compile and display GPS location and route information internally; and (2) your use of Scout with Ford Applink indicates your consent to Ford Motor Company accessing your vehicle GPS along with the serial number of the SYNC module, and sharing your GPS with Telenav (for information on SYNC, see your Owners Guide). If you do not want Ford to access your vehicle GPS, do not use Scout with Ford Applink.
SAFE AND LAWFUL USE OF SCOUT
You agree to comply with the following when using Scout:

Observe all traffic laws and otherwise drive safely.
Use your own personal judgment while driving. If you feel that a route suggested by Scout instructs you to perform an unsafe or illegal maneuver, places you in an unsafe situation, or directs you into an area that you consider to be unsafe, do not follow such instructions.
Do not input destinations, or otherwise interact with Scout, unless your vehicle is stationary and parked.
Do not use Scout for any illegal, unauthorized, unintended, unsafe, hazardous, or unlawful purposes, or in any manner inconsistent with this Agreement.
Arrange all GPS and wireless devices and cables necessary for use of Scout in a secure manner in your vehicle so that they will not interfere with your driving and will not prevent the operation of any safety device (such as an airbag).

You will be charged such fees each month, even if you do not use Scout. Telenav reserves the right to change the fees for Scout at any time, upon prior notice to you.
If payment cannot be charged to your credit card or your credit card charge is returned to Telenav for any reason, or you otherwise fail to pay the charges for Scout when due, Telenav reserves the right to pursue any and all legal remedies to collect the amounts owed by you, and to suspend or terminate your access to Scout.
TELEPHONE CHARGES

Telenav GPS Navigator™ for BlackBerry™
Please read these terms and conditions of use ("Terms of Use") carefully before you launch Telenav GPS Navigator, Telenav GPS, or Telenav GPS Plus ("Telenav Services") on your wireless device. Your use of the Telenav GPS Navigator indicates that you accept these terms and conditions. If you do not accept these terms and conditions, do not launch or otherwise use the Telenav GPS Navigator.
INTRODUCTION
These Terms of Use represent the agreement ("Agreement") between you and Telenav, Inc. ("Telenav") with respect to the Telenav Services. All references herein to "you" and "your" means you, your employees, agents, and contractors, and any other entity on whose behalf you accept these terms and conditions, all of whom shall also be bound by this Agreement.
Telenav may revise these terms and conditions at any time, with or without notice to you. You should visit www.telenav.com from time to time to review the then current terms and conditions for the Telenav Service.
THE TELENAV SERVICE
The Telenav Service allows you to obtain via your wireless device GPS-assisted navigation instructions to destinations throughout most of the United States or Canada, depending on your cellular carrier. Use of the Telenav Service requires payment of a monthly fee, which includes download to your wireless device of the Telenav GPS Navigator software and any upgrades, modifications, or additions thereto (collectively, "Telenav Software"), but does not include any hardware that may be required for certain wireless devices (such as a standalone GPS receiver). A complete description of the Telenav Service is available at the Products link on Telenav’s website, located at www.telenav.com/products.
The Telenav Service is for your internal business and personal use and is not for resale or other transfer or disposition to any other person or entity.
The Telenav Service utilizes map and other data licensed to Telenav by third parties for the benefit of you and other end users. This Agreement includes end-user terms required by these companies (set forth at the end of this Agreement), and thus your use of the Telenav Service is limited by and subject to such terms.
Use of MyMileage within the Telenav Services is subject to additional terms located at www.telenav.com/legal/terms-of-use.html.
YOUR LOCATION AND ROUTE INFORMATION
For Telenav to provide the Telenav Service, Telenav must record your route information, including your point of origin, the address of your destination, the starting time of your trip, and the route you are instructed to follow, and must periodically receive your GPS location from the GPS hardware associated with your wireless device.
In using the Telenav Service, you allow Telenav to access your GPS hardware and otherwise obtain this location and route information, and to record, compile and display such information internally. Such information is subject to Telenav’s privacy policy located at www.telenav.com. Your use of the Telenav Service indicates that you accept the terms of Telenav’s privacy policy.
SAFE AND LAWFUL USE OF THE TELENAV SERVICE
You agree to comply with the following when using the Telenav Service:

Observe all traffic laws and otherwise drive safely.
Use your own personal judgment while driving. If you feel that a route suggested by the Telenav Service instructs you to perform an unsafe or illegal maneuver, places you in an unsafe situation, or directs you into an area that you consider to be unsafe, do not follow such instructions.
Do not input destinations, or otherwise interact with the Telenav Service, unless your vehicle is stationary and parked. 
Do not use the Telenav Service for any illegal, unauthorized, unintended, unsafe, hazardous, or unlawful purposes, or in any manner inconsistent with this Agreement.
Arrange all GPS and wireless devices and cables necessary for use of the Telenav Service in a secure manner in your vehicle so that they will not interfere with your driving and will not prevent the operation of any safety device (such as an airbag).

PAYMENT
Before your Telenav Service will be activated, you must: (i) provide Telenav with a valid major credit card (American Express, VISA or MasterCard); (ii) enter into a direct billing or prepaid agreement with Telenav; or (iii) subscribe to the Telenav Service through your wireless telephone carrier, and agree to pay the relevant charges to such carrier.
You agree to pay all fees charged to your account for the Telenav Service (including applicable state and local taxes), in accordance with Telenav’s billing terms in effect at the time the charge becomes payable. You will be charged such fees each month, even if you do not use the Telenav Service. Telenav reserves the right to change the fees for the Telenav Service at any time, upon prior notice to you.
If payment cannot be charged to your credit card or your credit card charge is returned to Telenav for any reason, or you otherwise fail to pay the charges for the Telenav Service when due, Telenav reserves the right to pursue any and all legal remedies to collect the amounts owed by you, and to suspend or terminate your access to the Telenav Service.
TELEPHONE CHARGES
You are responsible for any fees assessed by your wireless telephone carrier to access the Telenav Service, including any data plan charges, toll, out-of-area, roaming, or other telephone connection charges. Standard messaging rates and other charges may apply when using certain features in the Telenav Service, such as Shared Address.
Telenav reserves the right to change at any time the phone number designated for you to access the Telenav Service, including eliminating any toll-free numbers.
TERMINATION

For a copy of Telenav’s refund policy, visit www.telenav.com.
ACCOUNT INFORMATION
You agree: (a) when signing up for the Telenav Service, to provide Telenav with true, accurate, current, and complete information about yourself, and (b) to inform Telenav promptly of any changes to such information to keep it true, accurate, current and complete.
If you provide Telenav with any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Telenav has reasonable grounds to suspect so, Telenav has the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Telenav Service.
All of your account information, as well as other payment and personal information provided by you to Telenav, is subject to Telenav’s privacy policy located at www.telenav.com. Your use of the Telenav Service indicates that you accept the terms of Telenav’s privacy policy.
SOFTWARE LICENSE
Subject to your compliance with the terms of this Agreement, Telenav hereby grants to you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to: (i) download or otherwise copy the Telenav Software onto your wireless device, and (ii) use the Telenav Software (in object code form only) on such wireless device in order to access and use the Telenav Service.

DISCLAIMERS
To the fullest extent permissible pursuant to applicable law, in no event will Telenav, its licensors and suppliers, or agents or employees of any of the foregoing, be liable for any decision made or action taken by you or anyone else in reliance on the information provided by the Telenav Service or the Telenav Software. You are responsible for the entire risk arising out of your use of the Telenav Service and the Telenav Software.
The Telenav Service and the Telenav Software are provided "as is" and without warranties of any kind either express or implied. Telenav disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.
Applicable law may not allow certain warranty exclusions, so one or more of the above disclaimers may not apply to you.
OTHER QUALIFICATIONS
You understand and agree that the Telenav Software is downloaded to your wireless device at your own discretion and risk and that you will be solely responsible for any damages to your wireless device, or loss of data, that results from the download of such software.
Telenav does not warrant that the Telenav Service or the Telenav Software will not infringe on third party intellectual property rights.
Telenav also does not warrant that your use of the Telenav Service will be uninterrupted or error-free. Rather, temporary interruptions of the Telenav Service may occur from time to time (such as when you drive into an area that has no cell phone coverage or when the Telenav Service or your carrier’s network is undergoing maintenance). Telenav will exercise reasonable efforts to attempt to limit or prevent such occurrences, but in no event will Telenav be liable for any financial or other damages due to such interruptions.
Telenav also does not warrant the accuracy of the map or other data used for the Telenav Service. Such data may not always reflect reality due to, among other things, road closures, construction, weather, new roads and other changing conditions.
Telenav has technological and operational security policies and procedures to protect your information from loss, misuse, alteration, or unintentional destruction, but Telenav makes no representations or warranties regarding the security of the Telenav Service or the transmission of data or information to and from Telenav and your wireless device. Telenav will not be liable to you or anyone else in the event of any unauthorized infiltration of any of its systems.
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
To the extent permitted under applicable law, under no circumstances shall Telenav or its licensors (or their licensors and suppliers) be liable to you or anyone else for any loss, injury, or damages (including but not limited to any compensatory, punitive, special, incidental, indirect, exemplary or consequential damages) arising out of or in connection with the use by you or anyone else of the Telenav Service or the Telenav Software, any defects in the Telenav Service or the Telenav Software, or any breach of this Agreement, even if Telenav or its licensors have been advised of the possibility of such damages.
Applicable law may not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability or incidental or consequential damages, so the above exclusion may not apply to you.
INDEMNIFICATION
To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to indemnify, defend and hold Telenav and its licensors (including their respective licensors, suppliers, assignees, subsidiaries, affiliated companies, and the respective officers, directors, employees, shareholders, agents and representatives of each of them) free and harmless from and against any liability, loss, injury (including injuries resulting in death), demand, action, cost, expense, or claim of any kind or character, including but not limited to attorney’s fees, arising out of or in connection with your use of the Telenav Service or the Telenav Software.

The arbitrator shall apply the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, and the judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered by any court having jurisdiction. Note that there is no judge or jury in an arbitration proceeding and the decision of the arbitrator shall be binding upon both parties.
This Agreement and performance hereunder will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to its conflict of laws provisions. You agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the County of Santa Clara, California.
MISCELLANEOUS
This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Telenav and you with respect to the subject matter hereof.
Telenav’s or your failure to require performance of any provision shall not affect that party’s right to require performance at any time thereafter, nor shall a waiver of any breach or default of this Agreement constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself.
If any provision herein is held unenforceable, then such provision will be modified to reflect the intention of the parties, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.
You may not resell, assign, or transfer any of your rights hereunder. Any such attempt may result in termination of this Agreement, without liability to Telenav. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Telenav may assign this Agreement to any affiliate at any time without notice.
By using the Telenav Service, you consent to receive from Telenav all communications, including notices, agreements, legally required disclosures or other information in connection with the Telenav Service (collectively, "Notices") electronically. Telenav may provide such Notices by posting them on Telenav’s website or by downloading such Notices to your wireless device.

                                    Very good wrapper, but without unicode support unfortunately. 
                                    So, I have reconstructed it for unicode.

                                    2006-Jan-27 Copyright 1996-2002, 2006 by David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg
Introduction
The FreeType Project is distributed in several archive packages; some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine, various tools and contributions which rely on, or relate to, the FreeType Project.
This license applies to all files found in such packages, and which do not fall under their own explicit license. The license affects thus the FreeType font engine, the test programs, documentation and makefiles, at the very least.
This license was inspired by the BSD, Artistic, and IJG (Independent JPEG Group) licenses, which all encourage inclusion and use of free software in commercial and freeware products alike. As a consequence, its main points are that:

We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be interested in any kind of bug reports. ('as is' distribution)
You can use this software for whatever you want, in parts or full form, without having to pay us. ('royalty-free' usage)
You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use it, or only parts of it, in a program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that you have used the FreeType code. ('credits')

We specifically permit and encourage the inclusion of this software, with or without modifications, in commercial products.
                                    We disclaim all warranties covering The FreeType Project and assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.
Finally, many people asked us for a preferred form for a credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license. We thus encourage you to use the following text:
 """ 
                                    Portions of this software are copyright © 20XX The FreeType
                                    Project (www.freetype.org). All rights reserved.
                                    """ 
Please replace 20XX with the value from the FreeType version you actually use.
Legal Terms
                                    0. Definitions
Throughout this license, the terms 'package', 'FreeType Project', and 'FreeType archive' refer to the set of files originally distributed by the authors (David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg) as the 'FreeType Project', be they named as alpha, beta or final release.
'You' refers to the licensee, or person using the project, where 'using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source code as well as linking it to form a 'program' or 'executable'.
This program is referred to as 'a program using the FreeType engine'.
This license applies to all files distributed in the original FreeType Project, including all source code, binaries and documentation, unless otherwise stated in the file in its original, unmodified form as distributed in the original archive.
                                    If you are unsure whether or not a particular file is covered by this license, you must contact us to verify this.
The FreeType Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000 by David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg. All rights reserved except as specified below.
1. No Warranty
                                    THE FREETYPE PROJECT IS PROVIDED 'AS IS' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.
2. Redistribution
                                    This license grants a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable right and license to use, execute, perform, compile, display, copy, create derivative works of, distribute and sublicense the FreeType Project (in both source and object code forms) and derivative works thereof for any purpose; and to authorize others to exercise some or all of the rights granted herein, subject to the following conditions:

Redistribution of source code must retain this license file ('FTL.TXT') unaltered; any additions, deletions or changes to the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation. The copyright notices of the unaltered, original files must be preserved in all copies of source files.
Redistribution in binary form must provide a disclaimer that states that the software is based in part of the work of the FreeType Team, in the distribution documentation. We also encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page in your documentation, though this isn't mandatory.

These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the FreeType Project, not just the unmodified files. If you use our work, you must acknowledge us. However, no fee need be paid to us.
3. Advertising
                                    Neither the FreeType authors and contributors nor you shall use the name of the other for commercial, advertising, or promotional purposes without specific prior written permission.
We suggest, but do not require, that you use one or more of the following phrases to refer to this software in your documentation or advertising materials: 'FreeType Project', 'FreeType Engine', 'FreeType library', or 'FreeType Distribution'.
As you have not signed this license, you are not required to accept it. However, as the FreeType Project is copyrighted material, only this license, or another one contracted with the, grants you the right to use, distribute, and modify it.
                                    Therefore, by using, distributing, or modifying the FreeType Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms of this license.

Wireless Short Messaging Service (SMS)
Telenav makes every effort to comply with the Mobile Marketing Association (MMA) Consumer Best Practices Guideline for the use of text messages for conducting its word-of-mouth marketing campaign. To review these guidelines, go to http://www.mmaglobal.com/documents/best-practices.
Messages Delieverd by Telenav 
Case 1: Upon receiving activation notification from a wireless carrier, Telenav may send text messages to advise its subscriber that their Telenav accounts have been activated. Generally, these messages are sent via the messaging gateway owned by the wireless carrier that provisioned the order for Telenav services. Except for these activation confirmation messages, Telenav does not send any text messages on its own. 
Case 2: Telenav allows its mobile device application subscribers to share addresses and other relevant content with other parties using text messaging via Telenav's short code address. For example, if John Doe wants to share the address of a new club he likes, he can send the address to his friend Tom Smith from within the Telenav mobile device application. When Tom Smith receives the message, it will be sent from Telenav, Inc's short code, but opening the message will reveal that John Doe originated it. 
In both Case 1 and Case 2 above, the standard messaging rates (charges) imposed by the wireless carrier, if any, for delivering or accepting a message will apply. 
Ending Message Delivery
Every message sent via Telenav's short code includes instructions to reply STOP to stop future messages being sent on behalf of Telenav's customers. When Telenav receives a STOP message via a reply to its short code, Telenav is compelled by the MMA guidelines to inform the recipient of the original message that no additional messages will be sent, and to not deliver any further messages for any reason.
Obtaining Help 
If a message recipient wishes to get HELP on the Telenav services to better explain why he received the message, the recipient can send reply with HELP to the message, or any other person can send HELP to the Telenav short code, 69355, at any time. Telenav will respond with a message that directs the sender to this portion of the Telenav.com web site.
Restarting Services 
If a recipient, or any other person, has sent STOP, CANCEL, or any other word that could be reasonably interpreted as meaning the recipient wanted text messages from Telenav's short code to cease, but later determines that he does want to receive messages from Telenav's short code, the party wishing to restart services should send RESTART as the subject of a text message to Telenav's short code, 69355.
Other Issues or Questions 
If this information does not address a concern you have about Telenav's use of text messages or SMS, please send an e-mail to support@telenav.com. 
Effective as of June 11, 2010


Your Navigator Deluxe™ on U.S. Cellular®
Please read these terms and conditions of use ("Terms of Use") carefully before you launch Your Navigator Deluxe on your wireless device. Your use of Your Navigator Deluxe indicates that you accept these terms and conditions. If you do not accept these terms and conditions, do not launch or otherwise use Your Navigator Deluxe.
INTRODUCTION
These Terms of Use represent the agreement ("Agreement") between you and Telenav, Inc. ("Telenav") with respect to the Your Navigator Deluxe service ("Your Navigator Deluxe Service"). All references herein to "you" and "your" means you, your employees, agents, and contractors, and any other entity on whose behalf you accept these terms and conditions, all of whom shall also be bound by this Agreement. These Terms of Use replace and supersede any license agreements or terms and conditions between Telenav and you for the Your Navigator Deluxe Service that may appear on your wireless carrier's web-site(s).

The Your Navigator Deluxe Service allows you to obtain via your wireless device GPS-assisted navigation instructions to destinations throughout most of the United States or Canada, depending on your cellular carrier.

Observe all traffic laws and otherwise drive safely.

Do not input destinations, or otherwise interact with the Your Navigator Deluxe Service, unless your vehicle is stationary and parked.

TELEPHONE CHARGES
You are responsible for any fees assessed by your wireless telephone carrier to access the Your Navigator Deluxe Service, including any data plan charges, toll, out-of-area, roaming, or other telephone connection charges.

Telenav does not warrant that the Your Navigator Deluxe Service or the Your Navigator Deluxe Software will not infringe on third party intellectual property rights.

3. Software License
Subject to your compliance with the terms of this Agreement, Telenav hereby grants to you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable license (except as expressly permitted below in connection with your permanent transfer of the Telenav Software license), without the right to sublicense, to access and use the Telenav Software (in object code form only).  This license shall terminate upon any termination or expiration of this Agreement.  You agree that you will use the Telenav Software only for your personal business or leisure purposes, and not to provide commercial navigation services to other parties.
3.1 License Limitations
You agree not to do any of the following: (a) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, translate, modify, alter or otherwise change the Telenav Software or any part thereof; (b) attempt to derive the source code, audio library or structure of the Telenav Software without the prior express written consent of Telenav; (c) remove from the Telenav Software, or alter, any of Telenav's or its suppliers' trademarks, trade names, logos, patent or copyright notices, or other notices or markings; (d) distribute, sublicense or otherwise transfer the Telenav Software to others, except as part of your permanent transfer of the Telenav Software; or (e) use the Telenav Software in any manner that (i) infringes the intellectual property or proprietary rights, rights of publicity or privacy or other rights of any party, (ii) violates any law, statute, ordinance or regulation, including but not limited to laws and regulations related to spamming, privacy, consumer and child protection, obscenity or defamation, or (iii) is harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortuous, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, libelous, or otherwise objectionable; and (f) lease, rent out, or otherwise permit unauthorized access by third parties to the Telenav Software without advanced written permission of Telenav.
4. Disclaimers
Except where prohibited by applicable law (which may include the Province of Quebec), in no event will Telenav, its licensors and suppliers, GM, or agents or employees of any of the foregoing, be liable for any decision made or action taken by you or anyone else in reliance on the information provided by the Telenav Software.  Unless otherwise provided under applicable laws, Telenav and GM also do not warrant or condition the accuracy of the map or other data used for the Telenav Software. Such data may not always reflect reality due to, among other things, road closures, construction, weather, new roads and other changing conditions.  You are responsible for the entire risk arising out of your use of the Telenav Software.  For example but without limitation, you agree not to rely on the Telenav Software for critical navigation in areas where the well-being or survival of you or others is dependent on the accuracy of navigation, as the maps or functionality of the Telenav Software are not intended to support such high risk applications, especially in more remote geographical areas.
EXCEPT WHERE PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW (WHICH MAY INCLUDE THE PROVINCE OF QUEBEC), TELENAV AND GM EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM AND EXCLUDE ALL WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THE TELENAV SOFTWARE, WHETHER STATUTORY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ALL WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS WHICH MAY ARISE FROM COURSE OF DEALING, CUSTOM OR TRADE AND INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO THE TELENAV SOFTWARE. Certain jurisdictions do not permit the disclaimer of certain warranties, so this limitation may not apply to you.
5. Limitation of Liability
EXCEPT WHERE PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW (WHICH MAY INCLUDE THE PROVINCE OF QUEBEC), UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL TELENAV OR ITS LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS OR GM BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES (INCLUDING IN EACH CASE, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR THE INABILITY TO USE THE EQUIPMENT OR ACCESS DATA, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF BUSINESS, LOSS OF PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR THE LIKE) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE TELENAV SOFTWARE, EVEN IF TELENAV HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
EXCEPT WHERE PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW (WHICH MAY INCLUDE THE PROVINCE OF QUEBEC), NOTWITHSTANDING ANY DAMAGES THAT YOU MIGHT INCUR FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ALL DAMAGES REFERENCED HEREIN AND ALL DIRECT OR GENERAL DAMAGES IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE), THE ENTIRE LIABILITY OF TELENAV AND OF ALL OF TELENAV'S SUPPLIERS AND OF GM SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU FOR THE TELENAV SOFTWARE.  SOME PROVINCES, STATES AND/OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
6. Arbitration and Governing Law
Unless you are a resident of Canada, You agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Telenav Software shall be settled by independent arbitration involving a neutral arbitrator and administered by the American Arbitration Association in the County of Santa Clara, California.  The arbitrator shall apply the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, and the judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered by any court having jurisdiction. Note that there is no judge or jury in an arbitration proceeding and the decision of the arbitrator shall be binding upon both parties.  You expressly agree to waive your right to a jury trial.
This Agreement and performance hereunder will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to its conflict of laws provisions. To the extent judicial action is necessary in connection with the binding arbitration, both Telenav and you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the County of Santa Clara, California.  The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you reside in Canada, this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the province or territory in which You reside at the time of entering into this Agreement and the laws of Canada applicable therein.  Any action brought by Telenav or You shall be brought exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction located within the province or territory in which You resided at the time of entering into this Agreement.
It is the express wish of the parties that this Agreement and any directly or indirectly related documents be drawn up in English. Les parties ont exprimé la volonté expresse que cette convention et tous les documents s'y rattachant directement ou indirectement soient rédigés en anglais.
7. Assignment
You may not resell, assign, or transfer this Agreement or any of your rights or obligations, except in totality, in connection with your permanent transfer of the Telenav Software, and expressly conditioned upon the new user of the Telenav Software agreeing to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.  Any such sale, assignment or transfer that is not expressly permitted under this paragraph will result in immediate termination of this Agreement, without liability to Telenav, in which case you and all other parties shall immediately cease all use of the Telenav Software.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Telenav may assign this Agreement to any other party at any time without notice, provided the assignee remains bound by this Agreement.
8. Miscellaneous
8.1 This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Telenav and you with respect to the subject matter hereof.
8.2 Except for the limited licenses expressly granted in this Agreement, Telenav retains all right, title and interest in and to the Telenav Software, including without limitation all related intellectual property rights.  No licenses or other rights which are not expressly granted in this Agreement are intended to, or shall be, granted or conferred by implication, statute, inducement, estoppel or otherwise, and Telenav and its suppliers and licensors hereby reserve all of their respective rights other than the licenses explicitly granted in this Agreement.
8.3 By using the Telenav Software, you consent to receive from Telenav all communications, including notices, agreements, legally required disclosures or other information in connection with the Telenav Software (collectively, "Notices") electronically. Telenav may provide such Notices by posting them on Telenav's Website or by downloading such Notices to your wireless device. If you desire to withdraw your consent to receive Notices electronically, you must discontinue your use of the Telenav Software.
8.4 Telenav's or your failure to require performance of any provision shall not affect that party's right to require performance at any time thereafter, nor shall a waiver of any breach or default of this Agreement constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself.
8.5 If any provision herein is held unenforceable, then such provision will be modified to reflect the intention of the parties, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.
8.6 The headings in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only, will not be deemed to be a part of this Agreement, and will not be referred to in connection with the construction or interpretation of this Agreement.  As used in this Agreement, the words "include" and "including," and variations thereof, will not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather will be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."
9. Other Vendors Terms and Conditions

Licensed under GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 2.1, February 1999
Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".
A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)
"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
•a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
•b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
•c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
•d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.
3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.
4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.
If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:
•a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)
•b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
•c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.
•d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.
•e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.
7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
•a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.
•b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.
10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.
12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
NO WARRANTY
15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

All Rights Reserved except as specified below.
The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied, with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided "AS IS", and you, its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.
Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these conditions:
(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group".
(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.
These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code, not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to acknowledge us.
Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's software".
We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are assumed by the product vendor.
ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch, sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA. ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally, that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than the foregoing paragraphs do.
The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf. It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable. The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by X Consortium but is also freely distributable.
The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files. To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce "uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard GIF decoders.
We are required to state that "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of CompuServe Incorporated. GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of CompuServe Incorporated."

Par conséquent, vous vous engagez à suivre les règles suivantes lors de l'utilisation du logiciel Telenav : a) respecter les lois en matière de circulation routière et conduire par ailleurs prudemment; b) faire preuve de jugement lors de la conduite. Si vous pensez qu'un itinéraire suggéré par le logiciel Télénav vous oblige à effectuer une manœuvre dangereuse ou illégale, vous place dans une situation dangereuse ou vous conduit dans une région que vous considérez comme étant non sécuritaire, ne suivez par ces instructions; c) avant d'entrer une destination dans le logiciel Telenav ou de manipuler celui ci, assurez-vous que votre véhicule est immobilisé et stationné; d) n'utilisez pas le logiciel Telenav à des fins illégales, non autorisées, involontaires, non sécuritaires, dangereuses ou illicites, ou d'une manière non conforme à la présente convention; e) installer tous les GPS et appareils sans fil et câbles nécessaires pour l'utilisation du logiciel Telenav d'une manière sécuritaire dans votre véhicule de sorte qu'ils n'interfèrent pas avec votre conduite et n'empêchent pas l'utilisation d'un dispositif de sécurité (comme un coussin gonflable).
Vous vous engagez à indemniser et à tenir à couvert Telenav à l'égard de toutes les réclamations découlant d'une utilisation dangereuse ou par ailleurs inappropriée du logiciel Telenav dans un véhicule en marche, y compris du fait que vous n'avez pas suivi les instructions ci dessus.
2. Information sur le compte et information de localisation et de recherche
Vous vous engagez : a) au moment d'inscrire le logiciel Telenav, à fournir à Telenav et à General Motors Holdings LLC et aux membres de son groupe (« GM ») des renseignements véridiques, exacts, à jour et complets à votre sujet et au sujet de votre compte et de votre véhicule et b) à tenir ces renseignements à jour.
Aux fins de l'utilisation du logiciel Telenav, Telenav pourrait recevoir de l'information de localisation et de recherche liée à votre utilisation du logiciel Telenav. En utilisant le logiciel Telenav, vous autorisez Telenav à obtenir, à utiliser et à partager (comme il est indiqué) cette information. Cette information est assujettie à la politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels, qui est affichée à http://www.telenav.com/legal/NavConnect-privacy.htm. Si vous utilisiez le logiciel Telenav, vous acceptez les modalités de cette politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels.
3. Licence relative au logiciel
Sous réserve de votre conformité avec les modalités de la présente convention, Telenav vous concède par les présentes une licence personnelle, non exclusive et incessible (sauf comme il est expressément autorisé ci après dans le cadre de votre transfert permanent de la licence relative au logiciel Telenav), sans droit de sous-licence, aux fins d'accès au logiciel Telenav (sous forme de code objet seulement) et d'utilisation de celui-ci. Cette licence prend fin à la résiliation ou à l'expiration de la présente convention. Sauf si les lois applicables l'interdisent (ce qui peut comprendre celles de la province de Québec), Telenav peut résilier la licence à tout moment et sans motif. Vous vous engagez à utiliser le logiciel Telenav uniquement à des fins commerciales personnelles ou de loisir et non pour fournir des services de navigation commerciale à d'autres parties.
3.1 Restrictions relatives à la licence
Vous vous engagez à ne pas faire ce qui suit : a) désosser, décompiler, désassembler, traduire ou autrement modifier le logiciel Telenav ou une partie de celui ci; b) tenter de déterminer le code source, la sonothèque ou la structure du logiciel Telenav sans le consentement écrit exprès préalable de Telenav; c) retirer du logiciel Telenav ou modifier les marques de commerce, noms de marque, logos, avis de brevet ou de droit d'auteur ou autre avis ou indications de Telenav ou de ses fournisseurs; d) distribuer, concéder aux termes d'une sous-licence ou autrement transférer le logiciel Telenav à des tiers, sauf dans le cadre du transfert permanent du logiciel Telenav ou e) utiliser le logiciel Telenav d'une manière qui i) contrevient aux droits de propriété intellectuelle ou exclusifs, aux droits à la protection de la personnalité ou aux droits en matière de protection des renseignements personnels ou autres d'une partie, ii) viole une loi, une ordonnance ou un règlement, notamment les lois et les règlements relatifs au pollupostage, à la protection des renseignements personnels, à la protection des consommateurs et des enfants, aux obscénités ou à la diffamation ou iii) est dangereuse, menaçante, abusive, malveillante, délictuelle, diffamatoire, vulgaire, obscène, calomnieuse ou autrement répréhensible et f) consiste à louer le logiciel Telenav ou à autrement permettre un accès non autorisé à celui ci à des tiers sans l'autorisation écrite préalable de Telenav.
4. Dénégation de responsabilité
Sauf si les lois applicables l'interdisent (ce qui peut comprendre celles de la province de Québec), Telenav, ses concédants de licence et fournisseurs, GM ou encore les mandataires ou employés des personnes précitées ne seront en aucun cas tenus responsables d'une décision ou d'une mesure prise par vous ou un tiers sur le fondement de l'information fournie par le logiciel Telenav. Sauf si les lois applicables l'y obligent, Telenav et GM ne garantissent pas non plus ni ne conditionnent l'exactitude de la carte ou des autres données utilisées pour le logiciel Telenav. Il se pourrait que ces données ne reflètent pas toujours la réalité en raison, notamment, de fermeture de routes, de travaux de construction, de la température, de nouvelles routes et d'autres changements. Vous assumez entièrement le risque découlant de votre utilisation du logiciel Telenav. Par exemple, vous vous engagez notamment à ne pas vous fier au logiciel Telenav dans des situations critiques et des régions où votre bien-être ou votre survie ou celle d'autres personnes dépend de l'exactitude de la navigation, étant donné que les cartes ou la fonctionnalité du logiciel Telenav ne sont pas conçues pour soutenir ces applications à haut risque, plus particulièrement dans des régions géographiques plus éloignées.
SAUF SI LES LOIS APPLICABLES L'INTERDISENT (CE QUI PEUT COMPRENDRE CELLES DE LA PROVINCE DE QUÉBEC), TELENAV ET GM REJETTENT EXPRESSÉMENT TOUTE GARANTIE OU CONDITION RELATIVE AU LOGICIEL TELENAV, QU'ELLE SOIT PRÉVUE PAR LA LOI, EXPRESSE OU IMPLICITE, Y COMPRIS TOUTES LES GARANTIES OU CONDITIONS POUVANT DÉCOULER DE LA CONDUITE HABITUELLE, DE LA COUTUME OU DE L'USAGE COMMERCIAL, NOTAMMENT LES GARANTIES IMPLICITES DE QUALITÉ MARCHANDE, D'ADAPTATION À UN USAGE PARTICULIER ET DE NON-VIOLATION DES DROITS DE TIERS À L'ÉGARD DU LOGICIEL TELENAV. Certains territoires ne permettent pas l'exclusion de certaines garanties. Par conséquent, la présente limitation pourrait ne pas s'appliquer à vous.
5. Responsabilité limitée
SAUF SI LES LOIS APPLICABLES L'INTERDISENT (CE QUI PEUT COMPRENDRE CELLES DE LA PROVINCE DE QUÉBEC), TELENAV OU SES CONCÉDANTS DE LICENCE ET FOURNISSEURS OU GM NE SERONT EN AUCUN CAS TENUS RESPONSABLES ENVERS VOUS OU UN TIERS DE DOMMAGES INDIRECTS, ACCESSOIRES, CONSÉCUTIFS, SPÉCIAUX OU EXEMPLAIRES (Y COMPRIS, DANS CHAQUE CAS, NOTAMMENT, LES DOMMAGES EN CAS D'INCAPACITÉ D'UTILISER LE MATÉRIEL OU LES DONNÉES D'ACCÈS, LA PERTE DE DONNÉES, LES PERTES COMMERCIALES, LA PERTE DE PROFITS, L'INTERRUPTION DES ACTIVITÉS OU DES SITUATIONS SIMILAIRES) DÉCOULANT DE L'UTILISATION OU DE L'INCAPACITÉ D'UTILISER LE LOGICIEL TELENAV, ET CE, MÊME SI TELENAV A ÉTÉ AVISÉE DE LA POSSIBILITÉ DE TELS DOMMAGES.
SAUF SI LES LOIS APPLICABLES L'INTERDISENT (CE QUI PEUT COMPRENDRE CELLES DE LA PROVINCE DE QUÉBEC), MALGRÉ LES DOMMAGES QUE VOUS POURRIEZ SUBIR POUR QUELQUE RAISON QUE CE SOIT (NOTAMMENT TOUS LES DOMMAGES MENTIONNÉS DANS LES PRÉSENTES AINSI QUE L'ENSEMBLE DES DOMMAGES DIRECTS OU GÉNÉRAUX, CONTRACTUELS, DÉLICTUELS (NOTAMMENT PAR SUITE D'UNE NÉGLIGENCE) OU AUTRES), L'ENTIÈRE RESPONSABILITÉ DE TELENAV AINSI QUE DE L'ENSEMBLE DE SES FOURNISSEURS ET DE GM SE LIMITERA AU MONTANT RÉELLEMENT PAYÉ PAR VOUS POUR LE LOGICIEL TELENAV. CERTAINES PROVINCES OU CERTAINS ÉTATS ET/OU TERRITOIRES NE PERMETTENT PAS L'EXCLUSION OU LA LIMITATION DES DOMMAGES ACCESSOIRES OU CONSÉCUTIFS. PAR CONSÉQUENT, LES RESTRICTIONS OU EXCLUSIONS PRÉCITÉES POURRAIENT NE PAS S'APPLIQUER À VOUS.
6. Arbitrage et droit applicable
Sauf si vous êtes un résident du Canada, vous convenez que les différends, réclamations ou litiges découlant de la présente convention ou du logiciel Telenav doivent être réglés dans le cadre d'une procédure d'arbitrage indépendante effectuée par un arbitre neutre et administrée par l'American Arbitration Association du comté de Santa Clara, en Californie. L'arbitre appliquera les Commercial Arbitration Rules de l'American Arbitration Association, et la décision rendue par l'arbitre peut être entérinée par n'importe quel tribunal compétent. Il y a lieu de préciser qu'aucun juge ou jury ne participe à une procédure d'arbitrage et que la décision de l'arbitre lie les deux parties. Vous vous engagez expressément à renoncer à votre droit à un procès devant jury.
La présente convention et son exécution seront régies par les lois de l'État de la Californie et interprétées conformément à celles ci, sans égard aux dispositions en matière de conflits de lois. Si une mesure judiciaire doit être prise dans le cadre de la procédure d'arbitrage qui lie les parties, Telenav et vous vous engagez à vous en remettre à la compétence exclusive des tribunaux du comté de Santa Clara, en Californie. La Convention des Nations Unies sur les contrats de vente internationale de marchandises ne s'applique pas.
Malgré ce qui précède, si vous résidez au Canada, la présente convention est régie par les lois de la province ou du territoire dans lequel vous résidez au moment de la conclusion de la présente convention et les lois du Canada qui s'appliquent dans cette province ou ce territoire et elle doit être interprétée conformément à celles-ci. Toute poursuite intentée par Telenav ou vous doit être intentée exclusivement devant un tribunal compétent situé dans la province ou le territoire dans lequel vous résidez au moment de la conclusion de la présente convention.
7. Cession
Il vous est interdit de revendre, de céder ou de transférer la présente convention ou vos droits ou obligations, sauf en totalité, dans le cadre de votre transfert permanent du logiciel Telenav, et à la condition expresse que le nouvel utilisateur du logiciel Telenav s'engage à être lié par les modalités de la présente convention. Une vente ou cession ou un transfert qui n'est pas expressément autorisé aux termes du présent paragraphe entraînera la résiliation immédiate de la présente convention, sans responsabilité pour Telenav, auquel cas vous et les autres parties devez cesser immédiatement toute utilisation du logiciel Telenav. Malgré ce qui précède, Telenav peut céder la présente convention à une autre partie à tout moment et sans préavis, pourvu que le cessionnaire demeure lié par la présente convention.
8. Divers
8.1 La présente convention constitue l'entente intégrale intervenue entre Telenav et vous à l'égard de l'objet des présentes.
8.2 Sauf en ce qui concerne les licences limitées expressément octroyées aux termes de la présente convention, Telenav conserve tous les droits, titres et intérêts à l'égard du logiciel Telenav, notamment tous les droits de propriété intellectuelle connexes. Aucune licence ni aucun autre droit non expressément octroyés aux termes de la présente convention ne visent à, ni ne doivent, être octroyés ou conférés implicitement, par la loi, par induction, par préclusion ou autrement, et Telenav ainsi que ses fournisseurs et concédants de licence se réservent par les présentes tous leurs droits respectifs, sauf les licences explicitement octroyées aux termes de la présente convention.
8.3 En utilisant le logiciel Telenav, vous consentez à recevoir par voie électronique de Telenav toutes les communications, y compris les avis, conventions, renseignements devant être fournis par la loi ou autres renseignements relatifs au logiciel Telenav (collectivement, les « avis »). Telenav peut fournir ces avis en les affichant sur son site Web ou en les téléchargeant vers votre appareil sans fil. Si vous souhaitez retirer votre consentement à recevoir des avis par voie électronique, vous devez cesser d'utiliser le logiciel Telenav.
8.4 L'omission, de la part de Telenav ou de votre part, d'exiger l'exécution d'une disposition n'a pas d'incidence sur le droit d'une partie d'en exiger l'exécution à tout moment par la suite. Une renonciation à invoquer une violation ou un défaut à l'égard de la présente convention ne constitue pas une renonciation à invoquer une violation ou à un défaut subséquent ni une renonciation à la disposition elle-même.
8.5 Si une disposition des présentes est jugée inopposable, elle sera alors modifiée afin de refléter l'intention des parties, et les autres dispositions de la présente convention demeureront pleinement en vigueur.
8.6 Les titres utilisés dans la présente convention sont fournis pour en faciliter la consultation seulement et ne sont pas réputés en faire partie et ne doivent pas servir à l'interpréter. Dans la présente convention, les termes et expressions « comprend » et « y compris » et les variations de ceux ci ne se veulent pas limitatifs, mais signifient « y compris, sans restriction ».
9. Autres modalités des fournisseurs
Le logiciel Telenav utilise des cartes et d'autres données concédées sous licence à Telenav par des fournisseurs tiers à votre avantage et à celui d'autres utilisateurs finaux. La présente convention comprend les modalités d'utilisation applicables à ces sociétés. Par conséquent, votre utilisation du logiciel Telenav est également assujettie à ces modalités. Vous vous engagez à vous conformer aux modalités supplémentaires suivantes, qui s'appliquent aux concédants de licence fournisseurs tiers de Telenav. Ces modalités sont affichées à l'adresse suivante : http://www.telenav.com/legal/terms-of-use.html#NavConnect.

Telenav Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy governs your use of certain services, product or websites offered by Telenav, Inc. ("Telenav"), including the Scout GPS application, Thinknear by Telenav, and the telenav.com and thinknear.com websites.  By using our services, products, websites, or otherwise by interacting with us, you consent to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Policy, please do not engage in any of these activities.
Telenav understands and respects your concerns about the use of your personally identifiable information, collected from you as a customer or visitor to our websites that identifies you as a specific person or entity ("Personal Information"). Personal Information may include name, telephone numbers including mobile telephone numbers, billing account number, Mobile Subscriber Identifier, Mobile Equipment Identifier, Network Address Identifier, IP address, and email addresses. Personal Information does not include anonymous or aggregate information, which after processing may not be associated with a specific person or entity. We believe that you should know what information about you we collect, as well as how that information is used, maintained, and, in some cases, shared. The following sets forth our privacy practices and policies, applicable to Telenav customers and visitors to the Telenav websites.
You acknowledge and understand that this Privacy Policy does not apply to our business partners or other companies that Telenav does not own or operate. For information on how other providers of products or services handle Personal Information you provide through other web sites or through the use of our services in conjunction with a third party, please consult their privacy policies.
INFORMATION COLLECTED ABOUT YOU AND OUR USE OF SUCH INFORMATION
The types of Personal Information and other information we may collect about you are primarily from three sources: (1) information you provide; (2) information automatically collected; and (3) information from other sources. How we use and maintain that information is described below.
1. Information You Provide
(a) Register/Information Related to Your Account
We may collect and store Personal Information about you when you register to become a customer of our services, and when you otherwise transmit such information to us via our applications, the internet (including partner websites) or by email. For instance, to maintain and/or verify your account we may collect and store in a database your name, nickname(s), mobile phone number, mobile phone model, wireless carrier, and in certain circumstances your email address, device ID/number, the last four digits of your credit card number, credit card holder's name, billing address, and credit card expiration date.
Where you have consented, we use your billing or PayPal account information for the purpose of billing you for certain of our services, and other services offered from within certain Telenav products, and with your permission, may store such information for future transactions. In certain versions of our applications, you may also be given the option to provide a profile photo.
When you choose to access one of our applications through a Facebook log-in, we collect your name, profile picture, email, Facebook password and your Facebook contacts list with your permission.  Your name will be displayed and stored within our application and your email and Facebook password will be stored to provide future access to our application. We may use this email to contact you regarding your account and/or to respond to any inquiry or feedback you submit from within our applications as described in section (b) below. If you want to revoke authorization for the application to interact with your Facebook account, you can sign out of Facebook from within the application's settings menu, remove the application from the list of permitted Apps, or turn off the Platform for Apps, Plugin and Websites from the Settings menu for your Facebook account.
When you choose to access one of our applications through a Google Sign in, we collect your email, basic profile information and Google password with your permission, which will be stored to provide future access to our application. We may use this email to contact you regarding your account and/or to respond to any inquiry or feedback you submit from within our applications as described in section (b) below. If you want to revoke authorization for the application to interact with your Google account, you can sign out of Google from within the application's settings menu.
We may also use the information that we collect about you to manage your account and provide you with customer support, perform research and analysis about your use of our products and services, to inform you from time to time by email, Short Messaging Service (SMS) message and/or within our application about products or services that we think will interest you, unless you inform us that you opt out from receiving such communications from within the email, SMS message or the application.  We may share the information we collect about you and your usage activity with our third party partners for the purpose of performing research and analysis about users of our products and services.
(b) Contact Our Customer Service Representatives/In-App Feedback
We may use your email address to contact you with regard to your account, such as to communicate that it is about to expire or to confirm any change to your phone number, and to respond to any inquiry or feedback you submit via our websites by email or from within any of our applications. You may opt-out of receiving such communications using the link provided within the email.
Additionally, if you provide feedback regarding a routing or map issue within one of our applications, we may share your comments and anonymized data about your location and route with the OpenStreetMap community for purposes of improving OpenStreetMap data.
(c) Accessing Our Services
When you use any of our services, including when you use a mobile device equipped with one of our applications, you will be asked to provide certain information. We may use your mobile phone number as your account number and if you consent may provide you with a verification code via SMS message. We may also assign you a separate and unique ID number as your account number. Your account number may be stored and used to manage your account and provide you with customer support, perform research and analysis about your use of our products and services, to inform you from time to time by email, SMS message and/or within our application about products or services that we think will interest you, unless you inform us that you opt out from receiving such communications from within the email, SMS message or the application.
Some of our applications also allow you to create a personal identification number (PIN), which we store in our database, for the purpose of you logging into your account. In some cases, this PIN is generated for you automatically on your wireless device, and cannot be altered.
Some of our applications also give you the option of providing us with your home and work addresses, which we store in our database, to enable you to access readily other features of our services.
On some versions of our applications you can also create a list of "favorite" addresses that can include your home and work addresses. We store these addresses in our database so that you can access them from your mobile device, and so that should you change devices, this collection of addresses will still be available to you.
(d) Third Party Applications
Some of Telenav's services provide you with access to third party applications. When you enable a third party application, information collected by Telenav is processed under our Privacy Policy while information collected by the third party application provider is governed by its own privacy policy.
(e) Promotions
When you participate in a Telenav promotion, such as a sweepstakes or contest, you may be asked to provide your name and email address, and possibly other information such as your mailing address and telephone number.
We store this information in our database and will use it to communicate with you about the promotion. We also may use your email address from time to time to inform you about our products and services that we think will interest you, unless you inform us that you opt out from receiving such communications using the link provided within the email.
(f) Request for Information
When you request additional information about one of our services either via one of our websites or via one of our partners through which our services are offered, such as a mobile telecommunications provider, information we collect through these requests include your name, nickname(s), phone number, and email address, and if you are seeking information on behalf of your company, the name of that company. We will use this information to provide you with details about our services, and we may use this information to promote our services to you in the future, unless you inform us that you opt out from receiving such communications using the link provided within the email you may receive or by contacting support@telenav.com. To understand what a partner of ours may do with information about you in the partner's custody, you should check the privacy policy of that partner.
(g) Public Forums
If you use or link to public forums such as social networking services, blogs on Telenav or non-Telenav websites, internet bulletin boards, or chat rooms, be aware that any Personal Information you submit can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, including to send you unsolicited messages. Telenav cannot prevent the distribution and use of such information by other parties.
(h) Other Submissions
We collect Personal Information about you when you submit survey responses, a job application or resume. Such information will be used only for the stated purposes.
2. Information Automatically Collected
We automatically receive certain types of information, some of which may be associated with Personal Information, when you visit our websites or use our products and services.
(a) Information Related to Your Location and Route or Other User Content
Each time you access the Telenav GPS Navigator™ or Scout® service or our partnered branded versions of our Navigator services, we record your location and route information, including your point of origin (which may be your then-current location), the address of your destination, the starting time of your trip, and the route you are instructed to follow. We record your current location when your wireless device requests a rerouting (which occurs, for example, when you deviate from the specified instructions). We maintain a database with these locations and route information, and may keep such information indefinitely to improve our map coverage and to provide other features that may enhance your service capabilities, functions, and your user experience. We may periodically receive your current location from the GPS hardware associated with your wireless device for the purpose of providing enhanced services, including traffic flow data. When your location, GPS heading and speed are used for these purposes, we strip it of your Personal Information, such as your phone number, prior to storing. We may share such location data in anonymized form with our third party partners performing research and analysis about traffic conditions and road segment usage.
When your mobile device's Location Services are being used by Scout or other third party applications or your mobile operating systems services, the Scout application may periodically collect and store data about your current location along with a non-personally identifiable version of your device ID to create an anonymous profile for advertising purposes.  This profile may be shared with third parties for advertising purposes. For additional information about this data usage and how to opt-out, please see below regarding geohistorical-based and interest-based advertising. Additionally, this location data may also be used by us for anonymous traffic flow data or floating car data.
When you choose to use your current GPS location for specifying the locale for a business finder search, or obtaining a map, we use your location information for the requested purpose, and then discard it. We anonymously record any search activities and results for comparative analysis. Further, we anonymously record transactions for the purpose of paying directory listing and mapping data providers.
Some versions of our applications include a location and information sharing feature that enables you to share your location or other information with another party. These location exchanges are transmitted within the application or via the internet or text messages using SMS. For example, when you create, join, or navigate to a Meet Up with the Scout application, your name, profile photo, current location and/or ETA at the Meet Up location will be displayed on a map visible by other Meet Up participants.  The Meet Up and your location and/or ETA will be removed from the map visible to other participants when you delete the Meet Up.  We record these location exchanges, and may keep such information indefinitely. Also, if you set up a Notification within the app, the phone numbers you provide will be automatically notified via SMS message each time you arrive at or depart from the location you select. You can turn off a Notification from within the application's settings menu.
Additionally, in some versions of our applications, you can allow our application to access the data stored in the address book and/or calendar on your mobile device. Our applications may use data from your address book or for your Facebook or Google+ contacts (if you signed in with a Facebook  or Google+ sign-in)   to allow you to search for and navigate to the addresses of your contacts, chat with your contacts within the application, or create a Meet Up within the application. Our applications may use calendar entry data to provide you with reminders about upcoming appointments and to provide navigation to the locations of your appointments. We will only access this data if you have given permissions for a particular Telenav application to do so, and you can revoke such permissions at any time by changing the settings on your mobile device.
When you access Telenav map and data services through a third party application, we receive and store your location information from your device along with any address or point of interest search requests along with associated destination location information.  We maintain a database with locations and search information, and may keep such information indefinitely to improve our map coverage and to provide other features that may enhance your service capabilities, functions, and your user experience. Such data does not contain any Personal Information, such as your phone number.

Additionally, in connection with our thinknear.com website we use a marketing automation tool called Hubspot® to handle various marketing tasks, for example but not limited to, contacting visitors to thinknear.com who provided their contact information and requested additional information. HubSpot's software uses cookies to track thinknear.com visitors and contacts. You can read more about Hubspot's Privacy Policy and opt-out options here.
Also note that we do not have a system to comply with Do Not Track requests at this time, unless required by applicable laws or regulations.
(c) Information related to your personal interests for particular advertisements
When you search for a Point of Interest or address within our Scout applicatios or our partnered branded navigation applications, we may share your search and location data with our third party partners in order to provide you with more relevant advertisement results within the application. The information we share is de-identified so that it does not contain any Personal Information, such as your name, phone number or email address.
When Thinknear by Telenav has the opportunity to serve an ad to you on a third party mobile site or mobile application or within the Scout application, we may receive information about your device, including GPS location data or other precise location data from third party ad exchanges and/or mobile publishers, including the Scout application.

This information does not contain Personal Information and does enable us to personally identify you by name, phone number, email address, or other similar means, but may include your device ID, your IP address and the geo-location of your device at the time. This information is provided so that we can improve the relevance of the ads served to you. Any such information is shared in accordance with the third party's privacy policies and subject to their terms and conditions. We do not use such information for any purpose other than serving you with interest-based ads on behalf of advertising partners. If you would like to opt out of the use and/or sharing of such data for interest-based advertising, please contact us at support@telenav.com or click here and follow the instructions provided.
We may also obtain Precise Location Data from your use of Telenav applications (and certain other third party location based applications and use that location data) about your "geohistory", which is the geo-location of your mobile device over time along with a de-identified version of your device ID to create a profile.  Additionally, in order to create a profile, we may use data about your location and online activity and interests, including things like real-world category types you visited (e.g. Shopping Mall), mobile apps with which you engage, information collected by our inventory partners and other third parties and shared with us.  This will involve the use of your de-identified device ID and will not include any Personal Information, such as your name, phone number, or email address.

(d) Other Information

We will also collect information relating to your use of and the performance of our applications, including the state of your device at the time of an error or issue with the application, and such information is disclosed to and processed by third party providers, including but not limited to Crashlytics, for purposes of collecting information about errors or issues within our applications so we may improve our applications.
We may retain any data you provide to us in an email inquiry, for the purpose of tracking the types of questions we receive.
3. Information From Other Sources
We may obtain information about you from outside sources and add to it or combine it with your Personal Information. For example, we may request credit information when you initially subscribe for service, collect demographic and marketing data about you from third parties for marketing research and analysis to improve our products/services, obtain updated address information from our shippers, or collect information from other vendors that promote and distribute our products through their own brands.
WHEN YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE SHARED OR DISCLOSED
Telenav does not sell, rent, license or otherwise share information with unaffiliated parties except as explained in this Privacy Policy.
Consent Given/Transaction Processing
We may disclose Personal Information about you to third parties with your consent. Consent is sometimes implicit, as in the disclosure of Personal Information to third-parties who complete transactions or perform services on our behalf.
If you do not want us to share your Personal Information with these companies, you may contact us at: support@telenav.com.
To the Primary Account Holder
We may disclose Personal Information of an account user to the primary account holder (the party financially responsible for the account). If a business, governmental agency, or other individual obtains service for you, that entity or individual is our customer, and we may provide Personal Information about you, or your use of the service to them or others at their direction.
Third Party Services or Third Party Service Providers
Telenav offers access to a variety of resources, including but not limited to various communication tools, search services, forums, and links to other World Wide Web sites in providing its services, products and websites. We may make certain Personal Information non-personal and share it or aggregated data with strategic partners that work with us to analyze usage, provide and improve products or services, or that help us market to customers, or for similar purposes. Information that is not Personal Information or is aggregated is not subject to any restrictions of use or disclosure under this Privacy Policy.
If you take advantage of a third party's services or products offered through the use of our services, we may disclose your Personal Information to such unaffiliated third parties. These entities may use this information that you provide in the course of your use of Telenav's services (including your name, nicknames, telephone numbers, audio files, and email and mailing addresses) to promote their products and services to you. Any such Personal Information that a third party uses will be subject to their applicable privacy policies.
Some of our services and functionality are provided in conjunction with third party service providers. These third party service providers process Personal Information on our behalf and are obligated to process such information in compliance with this Privacy Policy and other appropriate security and confidentiality measures. In cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU individuals received pursuant to the EU-US or Swiss-EU Privacy Shield, Telenav is potentially liable.
Legal Processes
We will comply with any subpoenas, court orders or other legal processes for any of the information about you in our possession, and we may use such information to establish or exercise yours, ours, or others' legal rights, or to defend against legal claims. We also may be required to disclose Personal Information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
Business Transfers
Information about you in our possession may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another provider, as well as in the unlikely event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which your Personal Information would be transferred as one of the business assets of the company. Telenav does not guarantee that any entity receiving such information in connection with one of these transactions will comply with all terms of this policy.
European Union Users
Information that we collect about you may also be transferred among our various divisions and affiliated companies around the world, which may involve transfer from countries within the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland to countries outside the EEA. By allowing Telenav to collect this information about you, you consent to these transfers, including transborder transmission of data covered by this Privacy Policy. As a result, that country's courts, governments or law enforcement agencies could obtain disclosure of such information under that country's laws.
Telenav complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss – U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States, respectively.  Telenav has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability.  If there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.
INFORMATION ON WIRELESS DEVICES
The Telenav software (and any upgrades, modifications, or additions thereto) that is factory installed or downloaded to, and resides upon your wireless device retains your manually entered account number and PIN, or reads it from the device. Having your carrier change the assigned phone number for your wireless device does not change the account number we maintain with regard to that device, which will result in your device not being able to access your Telenav account established using the previous phone number. If this happens, please contact Telenav customer care.
SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
Telenav has implemented various physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of Personal Information under our control. For instance, Telenav limits access to Telenav systems that store such information to authorized personnel. Telenav also employs the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to protect your Personal Information when you bill on our website.
While Telenav maintains a multitude of security measures to prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of your Personal Information, no security measures are absolute or wholly guaranteed. Telenav will make reasonable attempts to notify you if it determines there were unauthorized acts by third parties that violate the law or this policy, or other security breaches, or where otherwise required by law.
Telenav will maintain your Personal Information for as long as a business need exists, or as required by applicable laws, regulations, or government orders. When we dispose of Personal Information, we use commercially reasonable procedures to erase or render it unreadable.
CHILDREN'S PRIVACY
Telenav will not knowingly request or collect Personal Information from any person under 13 years of age without prior verifiable parental or legal guardian consent. If, however, you authorize a child to use our services or products by providing them a device associated with your Telenav service, any Personal Information associated with such use will be treated as your information in accordance with this policy. Telenav encourages parents to be involved in the online activities (including wireless Internet browsing) of their children to ensure that no information is collected from a child without parental or Guardian consent.
CUSTOMER REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION
Telenav acknowledges that individuals have the right to access the Personal Information/data that we maintain about them.  Customers are entitled to request information concerning whether a business has disclosed Personal Information to any affiliated companies or third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Customers are further entitled to request access to their Personal Information under Telenav's control. To protect your privacy and security, Telenav will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before providing you access or making corrections. Good faith efforts to resolve requests to correct inaccuracies in or delete Personal Information will be made by Telenav, except where the request is unreasonable. As stated in this Privacy Policy, Telenav will not sell or share your Personal Information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes without your consent. Customers who wish to request further information about our compliance with this law or have questions or concerns about our privacy practices and policies may contact us at support@telenav.com or write to the attention of Privacy Policy Officer, Telenav, Inc., 4655 Great America Parkway, Suite 300, Santa Clara, CA 95054, USA.

Telenav Warranty and Refunds Policy
Telenav Hardware Warranties and Refunds
Telenav Bluetooth® GPS Receivers One-Year Limited Warranty 
Telenav, Inc. warrants this Telenav Bluetooth® GPS receiver against defects in material and workmanship under normal use and service for a period of one (1) year from the date of purchase by the original purchaser. This warranty is extended only to the original purchaser.
If a defect in a receiver arises and a valid claim is received by Telenav within the one-year warranty period, Telenav will, at its option, either (1) exchange the receiver with another receiver, or (2) refund the purchase price of the receiver. When a receiver is exchanged, any replacement item becomes your property and the replaced item becomes Telenav’s property. When a refund is given, the receiver for which the refund is provided must be returned to Telenav and becomes Telenav’s property.
Telenav is not responsible for your shipping and other costs to return the receiver to Telenav or its authorized representative.
This warranty does not apply to: 

Damage or loss which occurs during shipment. 
Damage caused by accident, abuse, misuse, flood, fire, earthquake or other external causes. 
Damage caused by operating the product outside the permitted or intended uses described by Telenav. 
Damage caused by service performed by anyone who is not a representative of Telenav. 
Consumable parts, such as batteries, unless damage has occurred due to a defect in materials or workmanship. 

This warranty also does not apply to any item other than the receiver. Specifically, this warranty does not cover any of the accessories shipped with your receiver, including the plug-in wall charger, the plug-in car charger, the USB cable, and the installation CD. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THIS WARRANTY AND REMEDIES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE EXCLUSIVE AND IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, REMEDIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, STATUTORY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.

IF TELENAV CANNOT LAWFULLY DISCLAIM STATUTORY OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES THEN TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ALL SUCH WARRANTIES SHALL BE LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE DURATION OF THIS EXPRESS WARRANTY AND TO REPLACEMENT SERVICE AS DETERMINED BY TELENAV IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION. 
No Telenav reseller, agent, or employee is authorized to make any modification, extension, or addition to this warranty. Some States do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, and some States do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so one or more of the above limitations may not apply to you. 
This warranty gives you specific legal rights. You may have other rights which vary from state to state.

To obtain service under this warranty, call Telenav at 1-88-Telenav-4 (1-888-353-6284). You will be asked for your email address for Telenav to send you a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) number and details for returning the receiver to Telenav. Alternatively, you may receive this information verbally over the phone. The receiver must be returned in the original packaging with (i) a copy of the email from Telenav identifying your RMA number, or some other writing specifying your RMA number, and (ii) proof of purchase in the form of a copy of your original receipt. (You may keep the receiver’s activation code and the installation CD.) 
Telenav Refund Policy
Telenav GPS Navigator™
Use of the Telenav GPS Navigator service (the “Telenav Service”) requires payment of a monthly fee, which includes downloads to your wireless device of the Telenav GPS Navigator software and any upgrades, modifications, or additions thereto, but does not include any hardware that may be required for certain wireless devices (such as a GPS receiver).



    
Telenav will not refund any payments for the Telenav Service or any necessary hardware made directly to a cellular carrier (e.g., Sprint Nextel, AT&T, etc.) or otherwise not directly made to Telenav. Check with your cellular carrier for its policy on refunds of such payments.
If you pay for the Telenav Service or for any necessary hardware through a credit card at www.telenav.com or through a direct billing arrangement with Telenav, then you or Telenav may cancel your account at any time subject to the following policies: 

If you or Telenav cancel your account within the first 30 days of activation, all charges for the Telenav Service (and any hardware purchased from Telenav that you return per Telenav’s hardware return policy and procedures) will be credited back to your credit card or otherwise refunded to you, unless your account is cancelled by Telenav for cause.
For any payments for the “Telenav GPS Kit Promotion” (a free GPS receiver kit with a two-year service plan commitment), if you or Telenav cancel your account within the first 30 days and you return all hardware in the GPS receiver kit, all charges will be credited back to your credit card or otherwise refunded to you, unless your account is cancelled by Telenav for cause. Beyond the initial 30-day period, the GPS receiver kit is no longer returnable and any charges assessed for the Telenav Service are not refundable. 
If you or Telenav cancel your account at any time after the first 30 days, Telenav will discontinue charging your credit card for your monthly service fee or otherwise cease assessing charges under your direct billing arrangement, but will not refund any amounts for the current or previous months of service and will not provide a refund for any hardware purchased from Telenav. In addition, Telenav will not refund any amount of prepaid service. For example, if you purchased twelve (12) months of prepaid service and cancel your account after three (3) months, there will be no refund of any amount to you on your account. 
You will not be provided a refund for any month for which you were not charged for the Telenav Service (i.e., as a result of any free usage or other promotion). 

Telenav Shotgun™
If you pay for the Telenav Shotgun (“Shotgun”) through a credit card payment at www.telenav.com or through a direct billing arrangement with Telenav, then you may request a refund within the first 30 days after the date of purchase. Upon Telenav’s receipt of the Shotgun unit from you per the terms of this policy, the purchase price you paid for the Shotgun unit will be credited back to your credit card or otherwise refunded to you, along with any applicable sales tax. No refund will be made for any shipping or handling charges. The Shotgun unit for which the refund is provided must be returned to Telenav and becomes Telenav’s property.
Telenav is not responsible for your shipping and other costs to return the Shotgun to Telenav or its authorized representative.
To request a refund, call Telenav at 1-88-Telenav-8 (1-888-353-6288). You will be asked for your email address for Telenav to send you a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) number and details for returning the Shotgun unit to Telenav. Alternatively, you may receive this information verbally over the phone. The Shotgun unit must be returned in the original packaging including all original accessories and with (i) a copy of the email from Telenav identifying your RMA number, or some other writing specifying your RMA number, and (ii) proof of purchase in the form of a copy of your original receipt. The Shotgun unit and all original accessories must be in good physical and operational condition; damaged product will not be accepted for return. Telenav must receive your return of the Shotgun unit per the terms of this return policy within ten (10) days from the date the RMA number is provided to you. Failure to return the Shotgun unit in this timeframe, or otherwise not in compliance with the terms herein, will invalidate your RMA.
Telenav Connected Service™
Use of the Telenav Connected Service (“TCS”) which includes downloads to your wireless device of selected upgrades, modifications, or additions to TCS, requires payment of a monthly fee.
If you pay for TCS through a credit card payment at www.telenav.com or through a direct billing arrangement with Telenav, then you or Telenav may cancel your account at any time subject to the following policies:

The first 3 months of TCS is free with your purchase of a Telenav Shotgun unit, and begins from the date of first TCS activation. If you or Telenav cancel TCS within the first 30 days of first TCS activation, all charges for TCS (and the Shotgun unit purchased from Telenav that you return per Telenav’s Shotgun return policy and procedures) will be credited back to your credit card or otherwise refunded to you, unless your TCS is cancelled by Telenav for cause.
If you or Telenav cancel TCS at any time after the first 30 days of first TCS activation, Telenav will discontinue charging your credit card for your monthly service fee or otherwise cease assessing charges under your direct billing arrangement, but will not refund any amounts for the current or previous months of service and will not provide a refund for any hardware purchased from Telenav. In addition, Telenav will not refund any amount of prepaid service. For example, if you purchased twelve (12) months of prepaid service and cancel your account after three (3) months, there will be no refund of any amount to you on your account.
You will not be provided a refund for any month for which you were not charged for TCS (i.e., as a result of any free usage period or other promotion). Should you or Telenav choose to cancel TCS for any reason, you shall not be entitled to any refund of or reduction in the price of the Shotgun unit (except as expressly provided under Telenav’s Shotgun return policy and procedures).

Telenav Open Source Statement last updated as of January 20, 2015.


Telenav Privacy Policy for Navigation and NavConnect

en
fr
es

This Privacy Policy governs your use of Navigation and/or NavConnect service offered by Telenav, Inc. ("Telenav") for select automotive vehicles produced or distributed by General Motors Holdings LLC or its affiliates ("GM").  In order to provide you with navigation and related services we collect and store certain information relating to your account, your location, and your use of the navigation services.  Please review this Privacy Policy for more detail about the information that may be collected and used in connection with your use of Navigation, NavConnect, and NavConnect with Predictive Navigation. By using these products or otherwise by interacting with us, you consent to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Policy, please do not engage in any of these activities.
Telenav understands and respects your concerns about the use of your personally identifiable information, collected from you as a user of Navigation and/or NavConnect ("Personal Information"). Personal Information includes name, home address, telephone numbers including mobile telephone numbers, email addresses, and VIN numbers. Personal Information does not include anonymous or aggregate information, which after processing cannot be associated with a specific person or entity. We believe that you should know what information about you we collect, as well as how that information is used, maintained, and, in some cases, shared. The following sets forth our privacy practices and policies, applicable to Navigation and/or NavConnect users.
You acknowledge and understand that this Privacy Policy does not apply to other Telenav products or services, our business partners or other companies that Telenav does not own or operate. For information about other Telenav products and services as well as the Telenav.com website, please visit http://www.telenav.com/legal/policies. For information on how other providers of products or services handle personal information you provide through other web sites or through the use of our services in conjunction with a third party, please consult their privacy policies.
INFORMATION COLLECTED ABOUT YOU AND OUR USE OF SUCH INFORMATION
The types of personal and other information we may collect about you are primarily from three sources: (1) information you provide; (2) information automatically collected; and (3) information from other sources. How we use and maintain that information is described below.
1. Information You Provide
(a) Register/Information Related to Your Account
We receive and store Personal Information about you when you authorize our business partners to share that information with us for use with Navigation and/or NavConnect or login to Navigation and/or NavConnect using your information, and when you otherwise transmit such information to us via Navigation and/or NavConnect, or contact us by phone or email regarding our products and services. For instance, to maintain and/or verify your account we may receive certain account information from other of your accounts, with your consent, including your name, email address, vehicle information and whether your NavConnect subscription is active. We may also assign you a separate and unique Telenav ID number, which may be stored and used to manage your account and provide you with customer support, and perform research and analysis about your use of our products and services.
Through GM, Navigation and/or NavConnect, you have the option of providing us with your home and work addresses, which we store in our database, to enable you to quickly navigate to those destinations and readily access other features of Navigation and/or NavConnect. Through Navigation or NavConnect you can also create a list of "favorite" addresses and points of interest. Within Navigation and/or NavConnect you also have the option to use Navigation and/or NavConnect settings menu to customize your experience, for example by selecting your navigation preferences, setting up traffic reports, and selecting your preferred gas grade for searches. For NavConnect subscribers, we store these addresses and setting preferences in our cloud database so that you can access them from Navigation and/or NavConnect. For Navigation users, this information is stored locally on the navigation system in your vehicle.
We may also use the information that we collect about you to manage your account and provide you with customer support, perform research and analysis about your use of our products and services, to inform you from time to time within Navigation and/or NavConnect about products or services that we think may interest you, unless you inform us that you opt out from receiving such communications.  We may share certain information we collect about you and your usage activity with GM on a non-identifiable basis for the purpose of performing research and analysis about users of its products and services.
(b) Contact Our Customer Service Representatives/ Feedback
GM may use your email address or phone number to contact you with regard to Navigation or your NavConnect subscription, such as to communicate that it is about to expire or to respond to any inquiry or feedback you submit with GM Customer Service Representatives, by email or from within Navigation and/or NavConnect.
If you provide feedback regarding a routing or map issue, we may share your comments and anonymized location data with our third party map provider.
(c) Request for Information
When you request additional information about Navigation or NavConnect, the information collected through these requests may include your name, phone number, and email address. We will use this information to provide you with details about these services, and in accordance with requirements under applicable law, we may use this information to promote our services to you in the future, unless you inform us that you opt out from receiving such communications.
(d) Public Forums
If you use or link to public forums such as social networking services, blogs on Telenav or non-Telenav websites, internet bulletin boards, or chat rooms, be aware that any personal information you submit can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, including to send you unsolicited messages. Telenav cannot prevent the distribution and use of such information by other parties.
2. Information Automatically Collected
We automatically receive certain types of information, some of which may be associated with Personal Information, when you use Navigation and/or NavConnect.
(a) Information Related to Your Location and Route or Other User Content
Each time you access Navigation, we record your location, search and route information, including your point of origin or current location, the address of your destination, the starting time of your trip, and the route you are instructed to follow. When you are in an active Navigation session, we periodically record your current location, data from your vehicle's sensors, and GPS heading and speed from the GPS hardware associated with your vehicle in order to provide you with your route. Navigation will save and display your most recent destinations to allow you to easily navigate to these destinations again.
When you choose to use your current location for specifying the locale for a business finder search, or obtaining a map, we use your location information for the requested purpose, and then discard it. We anonymously record any search activities and results for comparative analysis.
For NavConnect users with an active subscription who have opted-in to use Connectivity, this location and route information will be stored in our secure cloud database, where we may keep such information for up to five years to improve our services and to provide other features that may enhance your service capabilities, functions, and your user experience.  For NavConnect users, other address data, including home and work addresses, favorite places, and recent destinations will also be stored with your account information in our secure cloud database until your account is deleted.
For NavConnect users who have enabled the Predictive Navigation functionality, we will regularly receive and record location data from your vehicle's GPS hardware, whenever you are operating your vehicle.  This data will be stored in our secured cloud database and we will use such information to customize and improve your navigation and search experience, for example to provide preferred brand point of interest search results, personalized routing, and commute alerts.
You can update your Predictive Navigation options (including disabling Predictive Navigation) at any time by accessing the Navigation Settings menu.
(b) Information About Your Vehicle Systems
We may receive and store limited vehicle data from the vehicle systems, for example, ambient temperature, seat sensors on/off, and ignition on/off, which may be used to optimize the safety functionality of Navigation.  For Navigation-only users, this data will be stored indefinitely in your Navigation system's local memory.  For NavConnect users with an active subscription, this data will be stored in our secure cloud database for up to five years from the date of collection.
(c) Information About Your Use of Navigation Services
When you use Navigation and/or NavConnect, we log certain information relating to your use of Navigation and/or NavConnect and the Navigation performance.

La présente politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels régit votre utilisation du service Navigation et/ou NavConnect offert par Telenav, Inc. (« Telenav ») pour certains véhicules motorisés fabriqués ou distribués par General Motors Holdings LLC ou les membres de son groupe (« GM »). Afin de vous fournir des services de navigation et des services connexes, nous recueillons et stockons certains renseignements relatifs à votre compte, à votre localisation et à votre utilisation des services de navigation. Veuillez lire la présente politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels pour obtenir des détails supplémentaires au sujet des renseignements qui pourraient être recueillis et utilisés dans le cadre de votre utilisation de Navigation, de NavConnect et de NavConnect avec Predictive Navigation. En utilisant ces produits ou en interagissant autrement avec nous, vous indiquez être d'accord avec la présente politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels. Si vous n'êtes pas d'accord avec les modalités de la présente politique, veuillez ne pas vous adonner à ces activités. Telenav comprend et respecte vos préoccupations au sujet de l'utilisation des renseignements permettant de vous identifier qui sont recueillis à votre sujet en tant qu'utilisateur de Navigation et/ou de NavConnect (les « renseignements personnels »). Les renseignements personnels comprennent le nom, l'adresse domiciliaire, les numéros de téléphone, y compris les numéros de téléphone cellulaire, adresses électroniques et numéros d'identification de véhicule. Les renseignements personnels ne comprennent pas les renseignements anonymes ou regroupés qui, une fois traités, ne peuvent être associés à une personne ou à une entité en particulier. Nous estimons que vous devriez savoir quel type de renseignements nous recueillons et comment ces renseignements sont utilisés, conservés et, dans certains cas, partagés. Nos pratiques et politiques en matière de protection des renseignements personnels applicables aux utilisateurs de Navigation et/ou de NavConnect sont décrites ci après.
Vous comprenez que la présente politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels ne s'applique pas à d'autres produits ou services de Telenav, à nos partenaires commerciaux et à d'autres sociétés dont Telenav n'a pas la propriété ou qu'elle n'exploite pas. Pour obtenir des renseignements au sujet d'autres produits et services de Telenav ainsi que sur le site Web Telenav.com, veuillez visiter http://www.telenav.com/legal/policies. Pour obtenir des renseignements sur la façon dont d'autres fournisseurs de produits ou services traitent les renseignements personnels que vous fournissez par l'intermédiaire d'autres sites Web ou dans le cadre de l'utilisation de nos services conjointement avec un tiers, veuillez consulter leurs politiques en matière de protection des renseignements personnels.
RENSEIGNEMENTS RECUEILLIS À VOTRE SUJET ET MANIÈRE DONT NOUS LES UTILISONS
Le type de renseignements personnels et d'autres renseignements que nous pourrions recueillir à votre sujet proviennent principalement de trois sources : 1) l'information que vous fournissez; 2) l'information qui est recueillie automatiquement et 3) l'information provenant d'autres sources. La manière dont nous utilisons et conservons cette information est décrite ci après.
1. Information que vous fournissez
a) Inscription/information liée à votre compte
Nous recevons et stockons des renseignements personnels à votre sujet lorsque vous autorisez nos partenaires commerciaux à partager cette information avec nous aux fins d'utilisation avec Navigation et/ou NavConnect ou que vous vous connectez à Navigation et/ou à NavConnect à l'aide de vos renseignements, et lorsque vous nous transmettez autrement cette information par l'intermédiaire de Navigation et/ou de NavConnect ou que vous communiquez avec nous par téléphone ou par courriel au sujet de nos produits et services. Par exemple, aux fins de la tenue et/ou de la vérification de votre compte, nous pourrions recevoir certains renseignements sur le compte provenant de certains autres de vos comptes, avec votre consentement, notamment votre nom, votre adresse électronique, des renseignements sur votre véhicule et si votre abonnement à NavConnect est actif. Nous pourrions également vous attribuer un numéro d'identification Telenav distinct et unique, qui pourrait être stocké et utilisé aux fins de gestion de votre compte et pour vous fournir le service de soutien à la clientèle ainsi qu'effectuer des recherches et analyses au sujet de votre utilisation de nos produits et services.
Par l'intermédiaire de GM, de Navigation et/ou de NavConnect, vous avez la possibilité de nous fournir vos adresses à domicile et au travail, que nous stockons dans notre base de données, pour vous permettre de naviguer rapidement vers ces destinations et d'accéder facilement à d'autres fonctionnalités de Navigation et/ou de NavConnect. Par l'intermédiaire de Navigation ou de NavConnect, vous pouvez également créer une liste d'adresses « favorites » et de points d'intérêt. Navigation et/ou NavConnect vous permettent également d'utiliser le menu des paramètres de Navigation et/ou de NavConnect afin de personnaliser votre expérience, par exemple en choisissant vos préférences de navigation, en établissant des rapports de circulation et en établissant vos préférences en matière de qualité d'essence pour les recherches. À l'égard des abonnés à NavConnect, nous stockons ces adresses et préférences de paramètres dans nos serveurs de bases de données de sorte qu'ils puissent y accéder à partir de Navigation et/ou de NavConnect. En ce qui concerne les utilisateurs de Navigation, cette information est stockée localement sur le système de navigation situé dans votre véhicule.
Nous pourrions également utiliser l'information que nous recueillons auprès de vous pour gérer votre compte et vous fournir un soutien à la clientèle, effectuer des recherches et des analyses à propos de votre utilisation de nos produits et services, vous informer à l'occasion à l'aide de Navigation et/ou de NavConnect des produits ou services qui, selon nous, pourraient vous intéresser, sauf si vous nous indiquez ne plus vouloir recevoir ces communications. Nous pourrions partager avec GM certains renseignements que nous recueillons à votre sujet et au sujet de votre utilisation et que nous avons rendus non identifiables dans le but d'effectuer des recherches et des analyses au sujet des utilisateurs des produits et services de GM.
b) Communication avec nos représentants du service à la clientèle/commentaires
Le service à la clientèle pour Navigation and NavConnect est fourni par GM. GM peut utiliser votre adresse électronique ou votre numéro de téléphone pour communiquer avec vous au sujet de votre abonnement à Navigation ou à NavConnect, notamment pour vous indiquer que votre abonnement prend fin ou pour répondre à une demande de renseignements ou à un commentaire que vous avez présenté ou formulé à des représentants du service à la clientèle de GM, par courriel ou à l'aide de Navigation et/ou de NavConnect.
Si vous formulez des commentaires au sujet d'un problème avec un itinéraire ou une carte, nous pourrions partager vos commentaires et vos données de localisation rendues anonymes avec notre fournisseur de carte tiers.
c) Demande de renseignements
Lorsque vous demandez des renseignements supplémentaires au sujet de Navigation ou de NavConnect, les renseignements alors recueillis peuvent comprendre votre nom, votre numéro de téléphone et votre adresse électronique. Nous utiliserons ces renseignements pour vous fournir des détails au sujet de ces services et, conformément aux exigences prévues par les lois applicables, nous pourrions les utiliser pour faire la promotion de nos services dans l'avenir, sauf si vous nous indiquez ne plus vouloir recevoir ces communications.

Telenav ne peut empêcher la distribution et l'utilisation de ces renseignements par d'autres parties.
2. Information recueillie automatiquement
Nous recevons automatiquement certains types de renseignements, dont certains peuvent être associés à des renseignements personnels, lorsque vous utilisez Navigation et/ou NavConnect.
a) Information relative à votre localisation et itinéraire ou d'autre contenu sur l'utilisateur
Chaque fois que vous accédez à Navigation, nous enregistrons votre localisation, vos recherches et vos itinéraires, y compris votre point d'origine ou localisation actuelle, l'adresse de votre destination, l'heure du début de votre déplacement et l'itinéraire qu'on vous a indiqué de suivre. Pendant que vous utilisez Navigation, nous enregistrons périodiquement votre localisation, des données provenant des capteurs de votre véhicule et la direction indiquée par le GPS ainsi que la vitesse de votre véhicule à partir du matériel GPS associé à votre véhicule afin de vous fournir votre itinéraire. Navigation sauvegardera et affichera vos destinations les plus récentes afin de vous permettre d'y retourner facilement.
Si vous choisissez d'utiliser votre localisation pour trouver une entreprise ou obtenir une carte, nous utiliserons les renseignements relatifs à votre localisation d'origine pour faire la recherche demandée, puis les supprimerons. Nous enregistrons de façon anonyme les activités et résultats de recherche aux fins d'analyses comparatives.
À l'égard des utilisateurs de NavConnect dont l'abonnement est actif et qui ont choisi d'utiliser Connectivity, les renseignements sur la localisation et les itinéraires seront stockés dans nos serveurs de bases de données sécurisés pendant au plus cinq ans afin d'améliorer nos services et d'offrir d'autres fonctionnalités pouvant améliorer vos capacités de service, fonctions et votre expérience utilisateur. À l'égard des utilisateurs de NavConnect, les autres données concernant les adresses, notamment les adresses à la maison et au travail, les lieux favoris et les destinations récentes, seront également stockées avec les renseignements sur votre compte dans nos serveurs de bases de données sécurisés jusqu'à ce que votre compte soit supprimé.
À l'égard des utilisateurs de NavConnect qui ont activé la fonction Predictive Navigation, nous recevrons régulièrement et enregistrerons les données relatives à la localisation provenant du matériel GPS de votre véhicule, chaque fois que vous utiliserez votre véhicule. Ces données seront stockées dans nos serveurs de bases de données sécurisés et nous utiliserons cette information afin de personnaliser et d'améliorer votre expérience de navigation et de recherche, par exemple pour fournir des résultats de recherche sur vos points d'intérêt préférés, des itinéraires personnalisés et des alertes de circulation.
Vous pouvez mettre à jour vos options Predictive Navigation (y compris désactiver la fonction Predictive Navigation) à tout moment en accédant au menu des paramètres de navigation.
b) Information au sujet des systèmes de votre véhicule
Nous pourrions recevoir et stocker des données restreintes sur votre véhicule provenant des systèmes de votre véhicule, par exemple la température ambiante, les détecteurs de présence du siège (marche/arrêt) et le système d'allumage (marche/arrêt), qui peuvent être utilisés pour optimiser la fonctionnalité de sécurité de Navigation. Pour les utilisateurs de Navigation seulement, ces données seront stockées indéfiniment dans la mémoire locale du système Navigation. À l'égard des utilisateurs de NavConnect dont l'abonnement est actif, ces données seront stockées dans nos serveurs de bases de données sécurisés pendant au plus cinq ans à compter de la date de cueillette.
c) Information au sujet de votre utilisation des services de Navigation
Lorsque vous utilisez Navigation et/ou NavConnect, nous stockons certains renseignements au sujet de votre utilisation de Navigation et/ou de NavConnect et du rendement de Navigation. Par exemple, nous pourrions recueillir des données au sujet de vos activités au cours d'une session, comme le type de recherche que vous avez effectuée ou le type d'itinéraire que vous avez choisi.
d) Information supplémentaire
Lorsque vous utilisez les fonctions de commande ou de saisie vocale de nos services, nous recevons la transcription texte de vos instructions vocales et ces données texte peuvent être stockées pendant au plus cinq ans. Nous pouvons utiliser et conserver cette information afin d'améliorer nos services de reconnaissance de la voix.
MOMENT OÙ VOTRE INFORMATION SERA PARTAGÉE OU COMMUNIQUÉE
Telenav ne vend pas ni ne loue, ne concède sous licence ou ne partage autrement les renseignements concernant votre utilisation de Navigation ou de NavConnect avec des parties qui ne sont pas membres de son groupe, sauf comme il est indiqué dans la présente politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels ou comme les lois applicables l'exigent ou l'autorisent.
Consentements donnés/traitement d'opérations
Nous pourrions communiquer des renseignements personnels à votre sujet à des tiers qui effectuent des opérations ou fournissent des services pour notre compte. Votre utilisation de Navigation et/ou de NavConnect peut constituer un consentement à la communication de tels renseignements.
Services de tiers ou fournisseurs de services tiers
Telenav peut rendre certains renseignements personnels non personnels et les partager ou partager des données regroupées anonymes avec des partenaires stratégiques qui travaillent avec nous pour analyser l'utilisation de produits ou services ainsi que fournir et améliorer des produits ou services ou qui nous aident à commercialiser des produits ou services auprès de clients, ou à des fins similaires. Les renseignements qui ne permettent pas d'identifier une personne ou qui sont regroupés ne sont assujettis à aucune restriction d'utilisation ou de communication en vertu de la présente politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels.
Certains des services et fonctionnalités de Navigation et de NavConnect sont fournis par ou conjointement avec des fournisseurs de services tiers. Ces fournisseurs de services tiers traitent les renseignements personnels pour notre compte et sont tenus de le faire en conformité avec la présente politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels et d'autres mesures appropriées en matière de sécurité et de confidentialité. Nos fournisseurs de services obtiennent l'information dont ils ont besoin pour s'acquitter de leurs fonctions désignées, et nous ne les autorisons pas à utiliser ou à communiquer des renseignements personnels aux fins de commercialisation ou à d'autres fins personnelles. Nous, les membres de notre groupe ou d'autres fournisseurs de services tiers aux États Unis ou dans d'autres territoires pouvons tenir et traiter les renseignements personnels. En cas de transfert ultérieur à des tiers de données concernant des personnes de l'UE reçues en vertu du « Bouclier de confidentialité UE-US » (UE-US Privacy Shield), Telenav est potentiellement responsable.
Procédures judiciaires
Nous, les membres de notre groupe et nos fournisseurs de services canadiens, américains et autres nous conformerons aux assignations à témoigner, aux ordonnances des tribunaux ou aux autres procédures judiciaires applicables relativement aux renseignements à votre sujet que nous avons en notre possession, et nous pourrions utiliser et communiquer des renseignements personnels pour établir vos ou nos droits ou ceux de tiers, exercer nos droits ou pour nous défendre contre des réclamations.

Telenav ne garantit pas que l'entité qui recevra ces renseignements dans le cadre de l'une de ces opérations se conformera à toutes les modalités de la présente politique.
Utilisateurs internationaux
Les informations que nous recueillons à votre sujet peuvent également être transférées parmi nos différentes divisions et sociétés affiliées situées dans le monde entier, ce qui peut impliquer leur transfert à partir de pays de l'Espace économique européen (EEE) et de la Suisse vers des pays hors EEE.

SÉCURITÉ DES RENSEIGNEMENTS PERSONNELS
Telenav a mis en place diverses mesures de sauvegarde physiques, électroniques et procédurales dans le but de préserver la confidentialité et la sécurité des renseignements personnels sous notre garde et notre contrôle. Par exemple, Telenav réserve l'accès aux systèmes de Telenav qui stockent ces renseignements au personnel autorisé.
Bien que Telenav ait mis en place une multitude de mesures de sécurité pour prévenir l'accès non autorisé à vos renseignements personnels ou la communication de ceux ci, aucune mesure de sécurité n'est absolue ou pleinement garantie. Telenav tentera raisonnablement de vous aviser si elle détermine que des tiers ont posé des actes non autorisés qui violent la loi ou la présente politique ou que d'autres infractions à la sécurité sont survenues ou encore si elle y est tenue par la loi.
Telenav conservera vos renseignements personnels aussi longtemps que nécessaire pour l'exercice de ses activités ou conformément aux exigences des lois, règlements ou ordonnances gouvernementales applicables. Au moment d'éliminer des renseignements personnels, nous utilisons des procédures raisonnables sur le plan commercial pour les effacer ou les rendre anonymes ou illisibles.
PROTECTION DES RENSEIGNEMENTS PERSONNELS DES ENFANTS
Telenav ne demandera pas sciemment à  une personne âgée de moins de 13 ans de lui fournir des renseignements personnels ni ne recueillera de tels renseignements auprès d'une telle personne sans le consentement vérifiable préalable de ses parents ou de son tuteur légal. Cependant, si vous autorisez un enfant à utiliser nos services ou produits en leur donnant accès à un véhicule ou à un appareil ayant accès à Navigation, à NavConnect et/ou à d'autres services ou produits Telenav, les renseignements personnels associés à cette utilisation seront traités comme s'il s'agissait de vos renseignements conformément à la présente politique. Telenav encourage les parents à s'intéresser aux activités en ligne (y compris la navigation Internet sans fil) de leurs enfants pour s'assurer qu'aucun renseignement n'est recueilli auprès d'eux sans le consentement d'un parent ou du tuteur.
DEMANDE DE RENSEIGNEMENTS PROVENANT DE CLIENTS
Les clients ont le droit de demander des renseignements pour savoir si une entreprise a communiqué des renseignements personnels à des sociétés membres de son groupe ou à des tiers aux fins de commercialisation directe. Ils ont également le droit de demander l'accès à leurs renseignements personnels qui sont sous le contrôle de Telenav ainsi que de les mettre à jour et de les corriger. Pour protéger vos renseignements personnels et préserver votre sécurité, Telenav prendra des mesures raisonnables pour vérifier votre identité avant de vous donner accès à vos renseignements personnels ou d'y apporter des corrections. Telenav déploiera de bonne foi des efforts pour répondre aux demandes de correction de renseignements personnels, sauf si la demande est déraisonnable. Comme il est indiqué dans la présente politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels, Telenav ne vendra pas vos renseignements personnels ni ne les partagera avec des tiers aux fins de commercialisation directe par ceux ci sans votre consentement. Les clients qui souhaitent demander des renseignements supplémentaires au sujet de notre conformité avec cette loi ou qui ont des questions ou des préoccupations au sujet de nos pratiques et politiques en matière de protection des renseignements personnels peuvent communiquer avec nous à support@telenav.com ou par écrit avec le responsable de la protection des renseignements personnels, à Telenav, Inc., Attn : Privacy Policy Officer, 950 DeGuigne Dr., Sunnyvale, CA 94085 3900, USA

AUTRES CONVENTIONS
Telenav peut conclure avec des clients des conventions écrites relatives à des produits ou à des services qui renferment des dispositions particulières en matière de confidentialité, de sécurité ou de traitement d'information.

Dans tous les autres cas, les modalités de la présente politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels s'appliqueront.
DROIT APPLICABLE

Los tipos de información, personal y de otra naturaleza, que recabamos de usted, provienen inicialmente de tres fuentes: (1) la información proporcionada por usted; (2) la información que se recaba automáticamente, y ; (3)la información que se recaba mediante otras fuentes.  La manera en que utilizamos y administramos toda esta información se describe a continuación.
1.  Información proporcionada por usted:
(a) Para registrar / Información relativa a su cuenta.
Nosotros recibimos y guardamos información personal suya, cuando usted autoriza a nuestros socios de negocio para que la compartan con nosotros,  para usarla con la Navegación y/o NavConnet, o ingresar a estos, utilizándola; cuando usted, de alguna otra manera, nos transmite dicha información vía la Navegación y/o el NavConnet, o; cuando usted nos contacta telefónicamente o por correo electrónico, con relación a nuestros productos y servicios.  Por ejemplo, para administrar y/o verificar su cuenta, podemos recibir, con su consentimiento,  determinada información relativa a otra de sus cuentas, incluyendo su nombre, correo electrónico, información de su vehículo y el saber si su suscripción a NavConnect se encuentra activa.  También podremos asignarle un número de identificación Telenav, único y separado, el cual podrá almacenarse y ser utilizado para administrar su cuenta, brindarle el servicio al cliente, así como realizar la investigación y análisis del uso que haga de nuestros productos y servicios.
A través de GM, de la navegación y/o de NavConnect, usted tiene la opción de proporcionarnos las direcciones de su casa y oficina, mismas que guardaremos en nuestra base de datos, para permitirle un rápido desplazamiento a dichos destinos e que ingrese a otras características de navegación y/o NavConnect.  Con nuestros productos usted también puede generar una lista de direcciones y lugares de interés "favoritos".  Dentro de la navegación y/o de NavConnect usted también tiene la opción de utilizar el menú de configuración para personalizar su experiencia, por ejemplo, al seleccionar las preferencias de navegación, activar reportes del tránsito, así como seleccionar el tipo de combustible que prefiere y realizar su búsqueda.  Para nuestros suscriptores a NavConnect, almacenamos estas direcciones y preferencias en nuestra base de datos de la nube, a fin de que usted pueda acceder a ellas desde la navegación  y/o el NavConnect mismo.
Podremos también utilizar su información para administrar su cuenta y proporcionarle servicio de apoyo al cliente; conducir investigaciones y análisis acerca del uso que realiza de nuestros productos y servicios; informarle periódicamente,  a través de la navegación y/o de NavConnect acerca de los productos y servicios que pensamos pueden ser de su interés, a menos que nos informe que desea quedar fuera de la recepción de dichas comunicaciones.

Telenav no puede prevenir la distribución y uso de dicha información por parte de terceros.
2.  Información recabada automáticamente
Cuando usted utiliza la navegación o NavConnect, nosotros recibimos automáticamente cierto tipo de información, parte de la cual puede estar asociada con  información personal.
(a) Información relacionada con su ubicación y ruta o contenido de otro usuario:
Cada vez que usted ingresa a la navegación, nosotros grabamos su ubicación, la información sobre búsquedas y rutas, incluyendo su punto de origen o ubicación actual, domicilio de destino, hora en que inicia su viaje, así como la ruta que ha instruido a seguir. Cuando se encuentra en una sesión de navegación activa,  grabamos periódicamente su ubicación actual, datos de los sensores de su vehículo, encabezado de su GPS, así como su velocidad, a partir del hardware del GPS asociado a su vehículo.  La navegación salvará y mostrará sus destinos más recientes para que pueda trasladarse nuevamente hacia ellos con facilidad.
Cuando usted elige su ubicación actual de geolocalización para especificar el lugar, a fin de realizar la búsqueda de un negocio u obtener un mapa, usaremos dicha información sólo para la finalidad necesaria y después la desecharemos. Grabaremos, de manera anónima, todas los ejercicios de búsqueda y resultados con fines de análisis comparativos.
Para los usuarios, con suscripción activa a NavConnect, que han optado por usar la conectividad, dicha ubicación e información de ruta se alojará en nuestra base de datos virtual (en la Nube) segura, donde podremos almacenarla hasta por cinco años a fin de mejorar nuestros servicios y proporcionarles otras características que mejoren sus capacidades, funciones y su experiencia de usuario.  Para los usuarios de Navconnect, otros datos de dirección, incluyendo las de casa y trabajo, lugares preferidos y destinos recientes se guardarán también junto con su información de cuenta en nuestra base de datos segura en la nube hasta que su cuenta sea borrada.
Para los usuarios de NavConnect que han habilitado la función de navegación predictiva, recibiremos y guardaremos de manera regular sus datos de ubicación proporcionados por el hardware de geolocalización de su vehículo, siempre que se encuentren utilizando el automóvil.  Dichos datos se almacenarán en nuestra base de datos segura en la nube hasta por 5 años, para poder personalizar y mejorar su navegación y experiencia de búsqueda y así proporcionarles, por ejemplo, los resultados sobre puntos de interés de marcas preferidos, personalizando rutas y alertas de viajes al trabajo.
Usted puede actualizar las opciones de navegación predictiva (incluyendo su inhabilitación) en cualquier momento, ingresando al menú de opciones de navegación.
(b)  Información de los sistemas de su vehículo.
Nosotros podemos recibir una cantidad limitada de datos su vehículo, emitidos por   los sistemas del mismo, por ejemplo, temperatura ambiente, activación o apagado de los sensores de los asientos, los cuales pueden utilizarse para optimizar la funcionalidad segura de la navegación.  Únicamente para los usuarios de la Navegación, estos datos se guardarán en la memoria local de su sistema de navegación indefinidamente.  Para los usuarios NavConnect, estos datos se guardarán en una base de datos segura en la nube por hasta cinco años a partir de la fecha en que sean recabados.
(c) Información acerca del uso que haga de los servicios de navegación.
Cuando use la navegación y/o NavConnect, registraremos cierta información sobre el uso que hace de la Navegación y/o NavConnect, así como de la ejecución de dicha Navegación.

This Privacy Policy governs your use of the Scout GPS Link application offered by Telenav, Inc. ("Telenav") for mobile devices and use with certain Toyota and Lexus vehicles.  By using this application or otherwise by interacting with us, you consent to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Policy, please do not engage in any of these activities.
Telenav understands and respects your concerns about the use of your personally identifiable information, collected from you as a user of the Scout GPS Link application that identifies you as a specific person or entity ("personal information"). Personal information includes name, nicknames, home address, telephone numbers including mobile telephone numbers, credit card numbers, Mobile Subscriber Identifier, Mobile Equipment Identifier, email addresses. Personal information does not include anonymous or aggregate information, which after processing may not be associated with a specific person or entity. We believe that you should know what information about you we collect, as well as how that information is used, maintained, and, in some cases, shared. The following sets forth our privacy practices and policies, applicable to the Scout GPS Link application users and account holders.
You acknowledge and understand that this privacy policy does not apply to other Telenav products or services, our business partners or other companies that Telenav does not own or operate. For information about other Telenav products and services as well as the Telenav.com website, please visit http://www.telenav.com/legal/policies.html. For information on how other providers of products or services handle personal information you provide through other web sites or through the use of our services in conjunction with a third party, please consult their privacy policies.
INFORMATION COLLECTED ABOUT YOU AND OUR USE OF SUCH INFORMATION
The types of personal and other information we may collect about you are primarily from three sources: (1) information you provide; (2) information automatically collected; and (3) information from other sources. How we use and maintain that information is described below.
1. Information You Provide
(a) Register/Information Related to Your Account
We collect and store personal information about you when you register for an account to use our Scout GPS Link application or login to Scout GPS Link using your Scout mobile account information, and when you otherwise transmit such information to us via the Scout GPS Link application, or contact us by phone or email regarding your account. For instance, to maintain and/or verify your account we collect and store in a database your User ID, name, email address, account password your mobile operating system, mobile phone model, head unit device-type ID. You may also be given the option to provide a profile photo, which will be stored with your account information.  From the device, we collect IDFA, (or Android ID if IDFA is unavailable) 
When you choose to access Scout GPS Link through a Facebook log-in, we collect your name, profile picture, email, Facebook password and your Facebook contacts list with your permission.  Your name will be displayed and stored within our application and your email and Facebook password will be stored to provide future access to our application. We may use this email to contact you regarding your account and/or to respond to any inquiry or feedback you submit from within our applications as described in section (b) below. If you want to revoke authorization for the application to interact with your Facebook account, you can remove the application from the list of permitted Apps or turn off the Platform for Apps, Plugin and Websites from the Settings menu for your Facebook account.
When you choose to access Scout GPS Link through a Google Sign in, we collect your email, basic profile information and Google password with your permission, which will be stored to provide future access to our application. We may use this email to contact you regarding your account and/or to respond to any inquiry or feedback you submit from within our applications as described in section (b) below.
You have the option of providing us with your home and work addresses, which we store in our database, to enable you to quickly navigate to those destinations and readily access other features of the application. You can also create a list of "favorite" addresses and points of interest. Within the application you also have the option to use the application's settings menu to personalize your experience, for example by selecting your navigation preferences, setting up traffic reports, and selecting your preferred gas grade for searches. We store these addresses and settings in our database so that you can access them from your account, even if you change vehicles or mobile devices.
We may also use the information that we collect about you to manage your account and provide you with customer support, perform research and analysis about your use of our products and services, to inform you from time to time about features, products or services that we think will interest you, unless you inform us that you opt out from receiving such communications.  We may share certain information we collect about you and your usage activity with our third party auto partners for the purpose of performing research and analysis about users of our products and services. However, any data will be aggregated and all of your Personal Information will be removed before sharing with such partners.
(b) Contact Our Customer Service Representatives/In-App Feedback
We may use your email address to contact you with regard to your account, such as to confirm any change to your phone number, and to respond to any inquiry or feedback you submit by email or from within the Scout GPS Link application.
Additionally, if you provide feedback regarding a routing or map issue within one of our applications, we may share your comments and anonymized data about your location and route with the OpenStreetMap community for purposes of improving OpenStreetMap data.
(d) Request for Information
When you request additional information about one of our services either via the Telenav website or via one of our partners, such as Toyota, the information we collect through these requests may include your name, phone number, and email address. We will use this information to provide you with details about our services, and we may use this information to promote our services to you in the future, unless you inform us that you opt out from receiving such communications. To understand what a partner of ours may do with information about you in the partner's custody, you should check the privacy policy of that partner.
(g) Public Forums
If you use or link to public forums such as social networking services, blogs on Telenav or non-Telenav websites, internet bulletin boards, or chat rooms, be aware that any personal information you submit can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, including to send you unsolicited messages. Telenav cannot prevent the distribution and use of such information by other parties.
2. Information Automatically Collected
We automatically receive certain types of information, some of which may be associated with personal information, when you use the Scout GPS Link application.
(a) Information Related to Your Location and Route or Other User Content
Each time you access the Scout GPS Link application, we record your location and route information, including your point of origin, the address of your destination, the starting time of your trip, the route you are instructed to follow, and your arrival time (if applicable). We record your current location when your wireless device requests a rerouting (which occurs, for example, when you deviate from the specified instructions). When you are in an active navigation session, we periodically receive your current location, GPS heading and speed from the GPS hardware associated with your wireless device. We maintain a database with these locations and route information, and may keep such information indefinitely to improve our map coverage and to provide other features that may enhance and personalize your service capabilities, functions, and your user experience. The application will display your most recent destinations to allow you to easily navigate to these destinations again. When you choose to use your current GPS location for specifying the locale for a business finder search, or obtaining a map, we use your location information for the requested purpose. We anonymously record any search activities and results for comparative analysis. Further, we anonymously record transactions for the purpose of paying directory listing providers.
Scout GPS Link includes a location and information sharing feature that enables you to share your location or other information with another party. These location exchanges are transmitted within the application or via the internet or text messages using SMS. For example, when you create, join, or navigate to a Meet Up with the Scout GPS Link application, your name, current location and/or ETA at the Meet Up location will be displayed on a map visible by other Meet Up participants.  The Meet Up and your location and/or ETA will be removed from the map visible to other participants when you delete the Meet Up.  We record these location exchanges, and may keep such information indefinitely. 
Additionally, you can allow the Scout GPS Link application to access the data stored in the address book on your mobile device. Our applications may use data from your address book or from your Facebook or Google+ contacts (if you signed in with a Facebook  or Google+ sign-in)  to allow you to search for and navigate to the addresses of your contacts or create a Meet Up within the application. We will only access this data if you have given permissions for the Scout GPS Link application to do so, and you can revoke such permissions at any time by changing the settings on your mobile device.
(b) Information About Your Use of the Application
When you use the Scout GPS Link application, we log certain information your use of the application and the application's performance. For example, we may collect data about what actions you take within the application such as whether the vehicle's head unit is being used, the type of search you performed or what caused an application crash. This data will be stored indefinitely to allow us to improve the application. This data may be shared with our third party auto partners in anonymized, aggregated form. Your Personal Information will be removed before any data is shared.

Privacy Policy for Scout® GPS Link (Canada)

en
fr

This Privacy Policy governs your use of the Scout GPS Link mobile application offered by Telenav, Inc. ("Telenav") for mobile devices and use with certain Toyota and Lexus vehicles. By using this application or otherwise by interacting with us, you consent to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Policy, please do not engage in any of these activities.
You acknowledge and understand that this privacy policy does not apply to Telenav websites, other Telenav products or services, our business partners or other companies that Telenav does not own or operate. For information about other Telenav products and services as well as the Telenav.com website, please visit http://www.telenav.com/legal/policies.html. For information on how other providers of products or services handle Personal Information you provide through other web sites or through the use of our services in conjunction with a third party, please consult their privacy policies.
Telenav understands and respects your concerns about the collection, use and treatment of your personally identifiable information in connection with the Scout GPS Link application ("Personal Information"). Personal Information may include name, home address, telephone numbers including mobile telephone numbers, location information, Mobile Subscriber Identifier, Mobile Equipment Identifier, and email addresses. Personal Information does not include anonymous or aggregate information, which cannot be associated with a specific person. We believe that you should know what information about you we collect, as well as how that information is used, maintained, and, in some cases, shared. The following sets forth our privacy practices and policies, applicable to the Scout GPS Link application users and account holders.
INFORMATION COLLECTED ABOUT YOU AND OUR USE OF SUCH INFORMATION
The types of Personal Information we may collect about you are primarily from three sources: (1) information you provide; (2) information automatically collected; and (3) information from other sources. How we use and maintain that information is described below.
1. Information You Provide
(a) Register/Information Related to Your Account
We collect and store Personal Information about you when you register for an account to use our Scout GPS Link application or login to Scout GPS Link, and when you otherwise transmit such information to us via the Scout GPS Link application, or contact us by phone or email regarding your account. For instance, to maintain and/or verify your account we collect and store in a database your name, email address, account password your mobile operating system, mobile phone model, head unit device-type ID. From the device, we collect a device ID such as IDFA or Android Advertising ID.
When you choose to access Scout GPS Link through a Facebook log-in, we collect your name, profile picture, email, and your Facebook contacts list with your permission in order to facilitate your log-in. Your name will be displayed and stored within our application and your email and Facebook password will be stored to provide future access to our application. We may use this email to contact you regarding your account and/or to respond to any inquiry or feedback you submit from within our applications as described in section (b) below. If you want to revoke authorization for the application to interact with your Facebook account, you can log-out of Facebook from within the Scout GPS Link account settings menu, remove the application from the list of permitted Apps, or turn off the Platform for Apps, Plugin and Websites from the Settings menu for your Facebook account.
When you choose to access Scout GPS Link through a Google Sign In, we collect your email and basic profile information, which will be stored to provide future access to our application in order to facilitate your log-in. We may use this email to contact you regarding your account and/or to respond to any inquiry or feedback you submit from within our applications as described in section (b) below.
You have the option of providing us with your home and work addresses, which we store in our database, to enable you to quickly navigate to those destinations and readily access other features of the application. You can also create a list of "favorite" addresses and points of interest. Within the application you also have the option to use the application's settings menu to personalize your experience, for example by selecting your navigation preferences, setting up traffic reports, and selecting your preferred gas grade for searches. We store these addresses and settings in our database so that you can access them from your account, even if you change vehicles or mobile devices.
We may also use the information that we collect about you to manage your account and provide you with customer support and to perform research and analysis about your use of our products and services. We may share certain information we collect about you and your usage activity with our third party auto partners for the purpose of performing research and analysis about users of our products and services. However, any data will be aggregated and all of your Personal Information will be removed before sharing with such partners.
(b) Contact Our Customer Service Representatives/In-App Feedback
We may use your email address to contact you with regard to your account, such as to confirm any change to your phone number, and to respond to any inquiry or feedback you submit by email or from within the Scout GPS Link application. If you contact us with a comment, question or complaint, you may be asked for information that identifies you (such as your name, address and a phone number) along with any additional information we may need to help us promptly answer your question or respond to your comment or complaint. We may retain this information to assist you in the future and to improve our customer service and product and service offerings.
Additionally, if you provide feedback regarding a routing or map issue within one of our applications, we may share your comments in non-identifiable form and anonymized data about your location and route with the OpenStreetMap community for purposes of improving OpenStreetMap data.
2. Information Automatically Collected
We automatically receive certain types of information, some of which may be Personal Information, when you use the Scout GPS Link application.
(a) Information Related to Your Location and Route or Other User Content
Each time you access or use the Scout GPS Link application (including when you search for a nearby address or Point of Interest within the application running on your mobile device, when you are in an active navigation session within the application running on your mobile device, or when your mobile device running the application is connected to your Toyota vehicle), we record your GPS location and route information, including your point of origin, the address of your destination, the starting time of your trip, the route you are instructed to follow, and your arrival time (if applicable). We record your current location when your wireless device requests a rerouting (which occurs, for example, when you deviate from the specified instructions). When you are in an active navigation session, we periodically receive your current location, GPS heading and speed from the GPS hardware associated with your wireless device in order to provide you with and update your route. We maintain a database with these locations and route information, and may keep such information for up to five (5) years to improve our map coverage and to provide other features that may enhance and personalize your service capabilities, functions, and your user experience.
We may also periodically receive your current location from the GPS hardware associated with your wireless device for the purpose of providing enhanced services, including traffic flow data for you and other users of the application. When your location, GPS heading and speed are used for these purposes, we remove any Personal Information, such as your phone number, prior to storing. We may share such location data in a non-identifiable or anonymized form with our third party partners performing research and analysis about traffic conditions and road segment usage. The application will display your most recent destinations to allow you to easily navigate to these destinations again. When you choose to use your current GPS location for specifying the locale for a business finder search, or obtaining a map, we use your location information for the requested purpose. We anonymously record any search activities and results in order to improve our search functionality. Further, we anonymously record transactions for the purpose of determining our payment obligations to directory listing providers.
Additionally, you can allow the Scout GPS Link application to access the data stored in the address book on your mobile device. Our applications may use data from your address book to allow you to search for and navigate to the addresses of your contacts within the application. We will only access this data if you have given permissions for the Scout GPS Link application to do so, and you can revoke such permissions at any time by changing the settings on your mobile device.
(b) Information About Your Use of the Application
When you use the Scout GPS Link application, we log certain information regarding your use of the application and the application's performance. For example, we may collect data about what actions you take within the application such as whether the vehicle's head unit is being used, the type of search you performed or what caused an application crash. This data will be stored indefinitely to allow us to improve the application. This data may be shared with our third party auto partners in a non-identifiable, aggregated form. Your Personal Information will be removed before any data is shared.
We will also collect information relating to the performance of our applications, including the state of your device at the time of an error or issue with the application, and such information is disclosed to and processed by third party providers, including but not limited to Crashlytics, for purposes of collecting information about errors or issues within our applications so we may improve our applications.
WHEN YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE SHARED OR DISCLOSED
Telenav does not sell, rent, license or otherwise share information with unaffiliated parties except as explained in this privacy policy.
Third Party Services and Service Providers
We may transfer or disclose certain information about you to third parties that perform services on our behalf, such as data hosting, application performance reporting, map and traffic data improvement and analysis, application usage analysis, and the list referenced below.
Some of the application's services and functionality are provided by or in conjunction with third party service providers. These third party service providers process Personal Information on our behalf and are obligated to process such information in compliance with this privacy policy and other appropriate security and confidentiality measures. We do not authorize them to use or disclose Personal Information for their own marketing or other purposes.  Personal Information may be maintained and processed by us, our affiliates and other third party service providers in the U.S. or other jurisdictions.
Telenav may share certain non-identifiable, aggregated data with strategic partners that work with us to analyze usage, provide and improve products or services, or that help us market to customers, or for similar purposes.
Third Party Partners
If you take advantage of a third party's services or products offered through the use of our services, we may disclose your Personal Information to such unaffiliated third parties. With your consent, these entities may use this information that you provide in the course of your use of Telenav's services (including your name, telephone number, and email address) to promote their products and services to you. Any such Personal Information that a third party uses will be subject to their applicable privacy policies.
Legal Processes
We and our authorized service providers and affiliates will comply with any subpoenas, court orders or other legal processes for any of the information about you in our possession, and we may use or disclose such information to establish or exercise yours, ours, or others' legal rights, or to defend against legal claims or as otherwise required or permitted by applicable Canadian, US or other law. We also may be required to disclose Personal Information in response to a lawful request by applicable US or other courts and governmental authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
Business Transfers
Information about you in our possession may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another provider, as well as in the unlikely event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which your Personal Information would be transferred as one of the business assets of the company.
SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
Telenav has implemented reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in an effort to protect the confidentiality and security of Personal Information in our custody and under our control.
While Telenav maintains security measures to help prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of your Personal Information, no security measures are absolute or wholly guaranteed.

Si vous souhaitez révoquer l’autorisation permettant à l’application d’interagir avec votre compte Facebook, vous pouvez vous déconnecter de Facebook à partir du menu des paramètres de compte de Scout GPS Link, retirer l’application de la liste d’applications autorisées ou désactiver la fonction Applications, sites Web et modules d’extension dans les paramètres de votre compte Facebook.
Si vous décidez d’accéder à Scout GPS Link au moyen de votre compte Google, nous recueillerons votre adresse de courriel et des données de base sur votre profil, lesquels seront conservés afin de permettre l’accès à notre application dans le futur et de simplifier l’ouverture de votre session.

Vous avez la possibilité de nous fournir vos adresses à domicile et au travail, que nous stockons dans notre base de données, pour vous permettre de naviguer rapidement vers ces destinations et d’accéder facilement à d’autres fonctionnalités de l’application. Vous pouvez également créer une liste d’adresses « favorites » et de points d’intérêt. L’application vous permet également d’utiliser son menu des paramètres afin de personnaliser votre expérience, par exemple en choisissant vos préférences de navigation, en établissant des rapports de circulation et en établissant vos préférences en matière de qualité d’essence pour les recherches. Nous stockons ces adresses et paramètres dans nos bases de données de sorte que vous puissiez y accéder à partir de votre compte, même si vous changez de véhicule ou d’appareil mobile.
Nous pourrions également utiliser les renseignements que nous recueillons sur vous pour gérer votre compte et vous fournir un soutien à la clientèle et pour effectuer des recherches et des analyses à propos de votre utilisation de nos produits et services. Nous pourrions communiquer à nos partenaires indépendants du secteur automobile certains renseignements que nous recueillons à votre sujet et au sujet de votre utilisation dans le but d’effectuer des recherches et des analyses au sujet des utilisateurs de nos produits et services. Toutefois, les données seront regroupées et tous vos renseignements personnels seront retirés avant que des renseignements soient communiqués à ces partenaires.
b) Communication avec nos représentants du service à la clientèle/commentaires formulés au moyen de l’application
Nous pouvons utiliser votre adresse de courriel pour communiquer avec vous au sujet de votre compte, notamment pour confirmer une modification apportée à votre numéro de téléphone, et pour répondre à une demande de renseignements ou à un commentaire que vous avez formulé par courriel ou au moyen de l’application Scout GPS Link. Si vous communiquez avec nous pour formuler un commentaire, une question ou une plainte, vous pourriez devoir fournir des renseignements pouvant vous identifier (comme votre nom, votre adresse et votre numéro de téléphone) ainsi que d’autres renseignements dont nous pourrions avoir besoin pour nous aider à répondre rapidement à votre question, à votre commentaire ou à votre plainte. Nous pourrions conserver ces renseignements pour vous aider dans le futur et pour améliorer notre service à la clientèle et notre gamme de produits et services.
De plus, si vous formulez des commentaires concernant un problème d’itinéraire ou de carte dans l’une de nos applications, nous pourrions partager vos commentaires selon un format qui ne risque pas de vous identifier ainsi que des données anonymisées sur votre emplacement et votre itinéraire avec la communauté OpenStreetMap en vue de perfectionner les données d’OpenStreetMap.
2. Renseignements recueillis automatiquement
Nous recevons automatiquement certains types de renseignements, dont certains peuvent être des renseignements personnels, lorsque vous utilisez l’application Scout GPS Link.
a) Renseignements relatifs à votre position et itinéraire ou d’autre contenu sur l’utilisateur
Chaque fois que vous accédez à l’application Scout GPS Link ou que vous l’utilisez (notamment lorsque vous recherchez une adresse à proximité ou un point d’intérêt au moyen de l’application ouverte sur votre appareil mobile, lorsque votre session de navigation est active dans l’application ouverte sur votre appareil mobile ou lorsque votre appareil mobile sur laquelle l’application est ouverte est connecté à votre véhicule Toyota), nous enregistrons votre position obtenue par GPS, vos itinéraires, y compris votre point d’origine, l’adresse de votre destination, l’heure du début de votre déplacement, l’itinéraire qu’on vous a indiqué de suivre et l’heure de votre arrivée (s’il y a lieu). Nous enregistrons votre position actuelle lorsque votre appareil sans fil demande un nouvel itinéraire (ce qui survient lorsque, par exemple, vous vous écartez de l’itinéraire fourni). Tant que votre session de navigation est active, nous recevons périodiquement votre position, la direction indiquée par le GPS et la vitesse de votre véhicule à partir du matériel GPS associé à votre appareil sans fil afin de vous fournir votre itinéraire et de le rajuster. Nous constituons une base de données composée de ces données de positionnement et d’itinéraire et nous pouvons les conserver jusqu’à cinq ans afin d’améliorer nos cartes et d’offrir d’autres fonctionnalités pouvant améliorer et personnaliser vos capacités à bénéficier du service, les fonctions et votre expérience utilisateur.
Nous pourrions également recevoir périodiquement des données sur votre position provenant du matériel GPS associé à votre appareil sans fil afin de vous fournir et de fournir à d’autres utilisateurs de l’application des services bonifiés, comme des données sur la fluidité de la circulation. Si les données sur votre position, votre direction indiquée par le GPS et votre vitesse sont utilisées à ces fins, nous en retirons tous les renseignements personnels, comme votre numéro de téléphone, avant de les stocker. Nous pourrions partager ces données de positionnement selon un format qui ne risque pas de vous identifier ou sous une forme anonyme avec nos partenaires indépendants qui effectuent de la recherche et de l’analyse sur les conditions de la circulation et l’utilisation du réseau routier. L’application affichera vos destinations les plus récentes afin de vous permettre d’y retourner facilement. Si vous choisissez d’utiliser votre position établie par GPS pour trouver une entreprise ou obtenir une carte, nous utiliserons les renseignements relatifs à votre position pour faire la recherche demandée. Nous enregistrons de façon anonyme les activités et les résultats de recherche afin d’améliorer notre fonction de recherche. De plus, nous enregistrons les opérations de façon anonyme afin de déterminer nos obligations de paiement aux fournisseurs de service d’annuaire.
De plus, vous pouvez permettre à l’application Scout GPS Link d’accéder aux données stockées dans le carnet d’adresses de votre appareil mobile. Nos applications peuvent utiliser les données de votre carnet d’adresses pour vous permettre d’effectuer une recherche dans vos contacts et d’activer la navigation pour vous diriger à leur adresse au moyen de l’application. Nous n’accéderons à ces données que si vous en avez donné la permission à l’application Scout GPS Link. Vous pouvez révoquer la permission à tout moment en modifiant les paramètres de votre appareil mobile.
b) Données sur l’utilisation que vous faites de l’application
Lorsque vous utilisez l’application Scout GPS Link, nous conservons certaines données sur votre utilisation de l’application et son rendement. Par exemple, nous pourrions recueillir des données au sujet de vos activités dans l’application, comme l’utilisation de l’unité centrale du véhicule, le type de recherche que vous avez effectuée ou la cause d’une défaillance de l’application. Ces données seront stockées pour une durée indéterminée afin de nous permettre d’apporter des améliorations à l’application. Elles pourraient être partagées avec nos partenaires indépendants du secteur automobile selon un format regroupé qui n’est pas susceptible de vous identifier. Vos renseignements personnels seront supprimés avant que des données soient partagées.
Nous recueillerons également des renseignements sur le rendement de nos applications, y compris l’état de votre appareil au moment où survient une erreur ou un problème dans l’application, et cette information sera communiquée à un tiers, notamment Crashlytics, et traitée par celui-ci afin de recueillir de l’information sur les erreurs ou les problèmes qui surviennent dans nos applications pour que nous puissions les améliorer.

Telenav
Transforming life on the go for millions of people around the world.
We’re on a mission to make people's lives less stressful, more productive, and more fun.
We're hiring.









At the frontier of doing "on the go" better
At Telenav, we've always been about making people's lives less stressful, more productive, and more fun when they are on the go. We started on this mission in 1999 when we pioneered GPS navigation for mobile phones and changed how people get from point A to point B. Over the years, we have paved the way for a bigger end-to-end mobility transformation for all people on the go — starting with connected car solutions for drivers.
Our Products
We provide connected car and advertising solutions that are built on our powerful location platform.
Connected car solutions that help people before, during, and after every drive



Intelligent navigation & ADAS services
Our deep expertise in location-based services and driver, car, and road intelligence enables proactive, predictive, and personalized navigation and ADAS experiences. These experiences are powered by our comprehensive set of location services across the car, mobile, and cloud including global one-box search, real-time traffic, dynamic routing, fully interactive maps, and ADAS features.



Global platform that meets regional needs
Our robust location platform enables top global automotive companies to deliver experiences that help their drivers save time, stay safe, and reduce stress. These experiences are delivered through connected-embedded, embedded, and brought-in systems that are customized to meet the regional needs of drivers.





Crowd-sourced map-making
Telenav is proud to be part of the OpenStreetMap® (OSM) community. Our map-making tools enable the OSM community of more than 3 million contributors to make OSM a richer map for navigation, ADAS, and autonomous driving applications.

Data is the currency of digital marketing and location data is the driving force of mobile. We leverage proprietary technologies to process, cleanse, and structure trillions of location-related data points to enable better insights, analytics and targeting tools for our clients. Location intelligence is helping brands better understand the consumer path to purchase and build experiences that more effectively engage with target audiences.

OTHER QUALIFICATIONS
You understand and agree that the Telenav Software is downloaded to your wireless device at your own discretion and risk and that you will be solely responsible for any damages to your wireless device, or loss of data, that results from the download of such software.

Telenav also does not warrant the accuracy of the map or other data used for the Telenav Services. Such data may not always reflect reality due to, among other things, road closures, construction, weather, new roads and other changing conditions. 
Telenav has technological and operational security policies and procedures to protect your information from loss, misuse, alteration, or unintentional destruction, but Telenav makes no representations or warranties regarding the security of the Telenav Services or the transmission of data or information to and from Telenav and your wireless device.

MISCELLANEOUS
This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Telenav and you with respect to the subject matter hereof. 
Telenav's or your failure to require performance of any provision shall not affect that party's right to require performance at any time thereafter, nor shall a waiver of any breach or default of this Agreement constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself.

Telenav GPS Navigator™ for BlackBerry™
Please read these terms and conditions of use ("Terms of Use") carefully before you launch Telenav GPS Navigator, Telenav GPS, or Telenav GPS Plus ("Telenav Services") on your wireless device. Your use of the Telenav GPS Navigator indicates that you accept these terms and conditions. If you do not accept these terms and conditions, do not launch or otherwise use the Telenav GPS Navigator.
INTRODUCTION
These Terms of Use represent the agreement ("Agreement") between you and Telenav, Inc. ("Telenav") with respect to the Telenav Services. All references herein to "you" and "your" means you, your employees, agents, and contractors, and any other entity on whose behalf you accept these terms and conditions, all of whom shall also be bound by this Agreement.
Telenav may revise these terms and conditions at any time, with or without notice to you. You should visit www.telenav.com from time to time to review the then current terms and conditions for the Telenav Service.
THE TELENAV SERVICE
The Telenav Service allows you to obtain via your wireless device GPS-assisted navigation instructions to destinations throughout most of the United States or Canada, depending on your cellular carrier. Use of the Telenav Service requires payment of a monthly fee, which includes download to your wireless device of the Telenav GPS Navigator software and any upgrades, modifications, or additions thereto (collectively, "Telenav Software"), but does not include any hardware that may be required for certain wireless devices (such as a standalone GPS receiver). A complete description of the Telenav Service is available at the Products link on Telenav’s website, located at www.telenav.com/products.
The Telenav Service is for your internal business and personal use and is not for resale or other transfer or disposition to any other person or entity.
The Telenav Service utilizes map and other data licensed to Telenav by third parties for the benefit of you and other end users. This Agreement includes end-user terms required by these companies (set forth at the end of this Agreement), and thus your use of the Telenav Service is limited by and subject to such terms.
Use of MyMileage within the Telenav Services is subject to additional terms located at www.telenav.com/legal/terms-of-use.html.
YOUR LOCATION AND ROUTE INFORMATION
For Telenav to provide the Telenav Service, Telenav must record your route information, including your point of origin, the address of your destination, the starting time of your trip, and the route you are instructed to follow, and must periodically receive your GPS location from the GPS hardware associated with your wireless device.
In using the Telenav Service, you allow Telenav to access your GPS hardware and otherwise obtain this location and route information, and to record, compile and display such information internally. Such information is subject to Telenav’s privacy policy located at www.telenav.com. Your use of the Telenav Service indicates that you accept the terms of Telenav’s privacy policy.
SAFE AND LAWFUL USE OF THE TELENAV SERVICE
You agree to comply with the following when using the Telenav Service:

Observe all traffic laws and otherwise drive safely.
Use your own personal judgment while driving. If you feel that a route suggested by the Telenav Service instructs you to perform an unsafe or illegal maneuver, places you in an unsafe situation, or directs you into an area that you consider to be unsafe, do not follow such instructions.
Do not input destinations, or otherwise interact with the Telenav Service, unless your vehicle is stationary and parked. 
Do not use the Telenav Service for any illegal, unauthorized, unintended, unsafe, hazardous, or unlawful purposes, or in any manner inconsistent with this Agreement.
Arrange all GPS and wireless devices and cables necessary for use of the Telenav Service in a secure manner in your vehicle so that they will not interfere with your driving and will not prevent the operation of any safety device (such as an airbag).

PAYMENT
Before your Telenav Service will be activated, you must: (i) provide Telenav with a valid major credit card (American Express, VISA or MasterCard); (ii) enter into a direct billing or prepaid agreement with Telenav; or (iii) subscribe to the Telenav Service through your wireless telephone carrier, and agree to pay the relevant charges to such carrier.

You will be charged such fees each month, even if you do not use the Telenav Service. Telenav reserves the right to change the fees for the Telenav Service at any time, upon prior notice to you.
If payment cannot be charged to your credit card or your credit card charge is returned to Telenav for any reason, or you otherwise fail to pay the charges for the Telenav Service when due, Telenav reserves the right to pursue any and all legal remedies to collect the amounts owed by you, and to suspend or terminate your access to the Telenav Service.
TELEPHONE CHARGES
You are responsible for any fees assessed by your wireless telephone carrier to access the Telenav Service, including any data plan charges, toll, out-of-area, roaming, or other telephone connection charges. Standard messaging rates and other charges may apply when using certain features in the Telenav Service, such as Shared Address.
Telenav reserves the right to change at any time the phone number designated for you to access the Telenav Service, including eliminating any toll-free numbers.
TERMINATION

For a copy of Telenav’s refund policy, visit www.telenav.com.
ACCOUNT INFORMATION
You agree: (a) when signing up for the Telenav Service, to provide Telenav with true, accurate, current, and complete information about yourself, and (b) to inform Telenav promptly of any changes to such information to keep it true, accurate, current and complete.
If you provide Telenav with any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Telenav has reasonable grounds to suspect so, Telenav has the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Telenav Service.
All of your account information, as well as other payment and personal information provided by you to Telenav, is subject to Telenav’s privacy policy located at www.telenav.com. Your use of the Telenav Service indicates that you accept the terms of Telenav’s privacy policy.

DISCLAIMERS
To the fullest extent permissible pursuant to applicable law, in no event will Telenav, its licensors and suppliers, or agents or employees of any of the foregoing, be liable for any decision made or action taken by you or anyone else in reliance on the information provided by the Telenav Service or the Telenav Software. You are responsible for the entire risk arising out of your use of the Telenav Service and the Telenav Software.
The Telenav Service and the Telenav Software are provided "as is" and without warranties of any kind either express or implied. Telenav disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.
Applicable law may not allow certain warranty exclusions, so one or more of the above disclaimers may not apply to you.
OTHER QUALIFICATIONS
You understand and agree that the Telenav Software is downloaded to your wireless device at your own discretion and risk and that you will be solely responsible for any damages to your wireless device, or loss of data, that results from the download of such software.
Telenav does not warrant that the Telenav Service or the Telenav Software will not infringe on third party intellectual property rights.
Telenav also does not warrant that your use of the Telenav Service will be uninterrupted or error-free. Rather, temporary interruptions of the Telenav Service may occur from time to time (such as when you drive into an area that has no cell phone coverage or when the Telenav Service or your carrier’s network is undergoing maintenance). Telenav will exercise reasonable efforts to attempt to limit or prevent such occurrences, but in no event will Telenav be liable for any financial or other damages due to such interruptions.
Telenav also does not warrant the accuracy of the map or other data used for the Telenav Service. Such data may not always reflect reality due to, among other things, road closures, construction, weather, new roads and other changing conditions.
Telenav has technological and operational security policies and procedures to protect your information from loss, misuse, alteration, or unintentional destruction, but Telenav makes no representations or warranties regarding the security of the Telenav Service or the transmission of data or information to and from Telenav and your wireless device. Telenav will not be liable to you or anyone else in the event of any unauthorized infiltration of any of its systems.
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
To the extent permitted under applicable law, under no circumstances shall Telenav or its licensors (or their licensors and suppliers) be liable to you or anyone else for any loss, injury, or damages (including but not limited to any compensatory, punitive, special, incidental, indirect, exemplary or consequential damages) arising out of or in connection with the use by you or anyone else of the Telenav Service or the Telenav Software, any defects in the Telenav Service or the Telenav Software, or any breach of this Agreement, even if Telenav or its licensors have been advised of the possibility of such damages.
Applicable law may not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability or incidental or consequential damages, so the above exclusion may not apply to you.
INDEMNIFICATION
To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to indemnify, defend and hold Telenav and its licensors (including their respective licensors, suppliers, assignees, subsidiaries, affiliated companies, and the respective officers, directors, employees, shareholders, agents and representatives of each of them) free and harmless from and against any liability, loss, injury (including injuries resulting in death), demand, action, cost, expense, or claim of any kind or character, including but not limited to attorney’s fees, arising out of or in connection with your use of the Telenav Service or the Telenav Software.

Note that there is no judge or jury in an arbitration proceeding and the decision of the arbitrator shall be binding upon both parties.
This Agreement and performance hereunder will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to its conflict of laws provisions. You agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the County of Santa Clara, California.
MISCELLANEOUS
This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Telenav and you with respect to the subject matter hereof.
Telenav’s or your failure to require performance of any provision shall not affect that party’s right to require performance at any time thereafter, nor shall a waiver of any breach or default of this Agreement constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself.
If any provision herein is held unenforceable, then such provision will be modified to reflect the intention of the parties, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.
You may not resell, assign, or transfer any of your rights hereunder. Any such attempt may result in termination of this Agreement, without liability to Telenav. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Telenav may assign this Agreement to any affiliate at any time without notice.
By using the Telenav Service, you consent to receive from Telenav all communications, including notices, agreements, legally required disclosures or other information in connection with the Telenav Service (collectively, "Notices") electronically. Telenav may provide such Notices by posting them on Telenav’s website or by downloading such Notices to your wireless device.

TELENAV EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS AND EXCLUDES ALL WARRANTIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE TELENAV SOFTWARE, WHETHER STATUTORY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ALL WARRANTIES WHICH MAY ARISE FROM COURSE OF DEALING, CUSTOM OR TRADE AND INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO THE TELENAV SOFTWARE. Certain jurisdictions do not permit the disclaimer of certain warranties, so this limitation may not apply to you.
5. Limitation of Liability
TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL TELENAV OR ITS LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES (INCLUDING IN EACH CASE, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR THE INABILITY TO USE THE EQUIPMENT OR ACCESS DATA, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF BUSINESS, LOSS OF PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR THE LIKE) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE TELENAV SOFTWARE, EVEN IF TELENAV HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
NOTWITHSTANDING ANY DAMAGES THAT YOU MIGHT INCUR FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ALL DAMAGES REFERENCED HEREIN AND ALL DIRECT OR GENERAL DAMAGES IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE), THE ENTIRE LIABILITY OF TELENAV AND OF ALL OF TELENAV’S SUPPLIERS SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU FOR THE TELENAV SOFTWARE. SOME STATES AND/OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
6. Arbitration and Governing Law
You agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Telenav Software shall be settled by independent arbitration involving a neutral arbitrator and administered by the American Arbitration Association in the County of Santa Clara, California. The arbitrator shall apply the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, and the judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered by any court having jurisdiction. Note that there is no judge or jury in an arbitration proceeding and the decision of the arbitrator shall be binding upon both parties. You expressly agree to waive your right to a jury trial.
This Agreement and performance hereunder will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to its conflict of laws provisions. To the extent judicial action is necessary in connection with the binding arbitration, both Telenav and you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the County of Santa Clara, California. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply.
7. Assignment
You may not resell, assign, or transfer this Agreement or any of your rights or obligations, except in totality, in connection with your permanent transfer of the Telenav Software, and expressly conditioned upon the new user of the Telenav Software agreeing to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Any such sale, assignment or transfer that is not expressly permitted under this paragraph will result in immediate termination of this Agreement, without liability to Telenav, in which case you and all other parties shall immediately cease all use of the Telenav Software. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Telenav may assign this Agreement to any other party at any time without notice, provided the assignee remains bound by this Agreement.
8. Miscellaneous
8.1 This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Telenav and you with respect to the subject matter hereof.
8.2 Except for the limited licenses expressly granted in this Agreement, Telenav retains all right, title and interest in and to the Telenav Software, including without limitation all related intellectual property rights. No licenses or other rights which are not expressly granted in this Agreement are intended to, or shall be, granted or conferred by implication, statute, inducement, estoppel or otherwise, and Telenav and its suppliers and licensors hereby reserve all of their respective rights other than the licenses explicitly granted in this Agreement.
8.3 By using the Telenav Software, you consent to receive from Telenav all communications, including notices, agreements, legally required disclosures or other information in connection with the Telenav Software (collectively, "Notices") electronically. Telenav may provide such Notices by posting them on Telenav’s Website or by downloading such Notices to your wireless device. If you desire to withdraw your consent to receive Notices electronically, you must discontinue your use of the Telenav Software.
8.4 Telenav’s or your failure to require performance of any provision shall not affect that party’s right to require performance at any time thereafter, nor shall a waiver of any breach or default of this Agreement constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself.
8.5 If any provision herein is held unenforceable, then such provision will be modified to reflect the intention of the parties, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.
8.6 The headings in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only, will not be deemed to be a part of this Agreement, and will not be referred to in connection with the construction or interpretation of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the words "include" and "including," and variations thereof, will not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather will be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."

                                    Very good wrapper, but without unicode support unfortunately. 
                                    So, I have reconstructed it for unicode.

                                    The FreeType Project LICENSE
                                    2006-Jan-27 Copyright 1996-2002, 2006 by David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg
Introduction
The FreeType Project is distributed in several archive packages; some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine, various tools and contributions which rely on, or relate to, the FreeType Project.
This license applies to all files found in such packages, and which do not fall under their own explicit license. The license affects thus the FreeType font engine, the test programs, documentation and makefiles, at the very least.
This license was inspired by the BSD, Artistic, and IJG (Independent JPEG Group) licenses, which all encourage inclusion and use of free software in commercial and freeware products alike. As a consequence, its main points are that:

We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be interested in any kind of bug reports. ('as is' distribution)
You can use this software for whatever you want, in parts or full form, without having to pay us. ('royalty-free' usage)
You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use it, or only parts of it, in a program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that you have used the FreeType code. ('credits')

We specifically permit and encourage the inclusion of this software, with or without modifications, in commercial products.
                                    We disclaim all warranties covering The FreeType Project and assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.
Finally, many people asked us for a preferred form for a credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license. We thus encourage you to use the following text:
 """ 
                                    Portions of this software are copyright © 20XX The FreeType
                                    Project (www.freetype.org). All rights reserved.
                                    """ 
Please replace 20XX with the value from the FreeType version you actually use.
Legal Terms
                                    0. Definitions
Throughout this license, the terms 'package', 'FreeType Project', and 'FreeType archive' refer to the set of files originally distributed by the authors (David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg) as the 'FreeType Project', be they named as alpha, beta or final release.
'You' refers to the licensee, or person using the project, where 'using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source code as well as linking it to form a 'program' or 'executable'.
This program is referred to as 'a program using the FreeType engine'.
This license applies to all files distributed in the original FreeType Project, including all source code, binaries and documentation, unless otherwise stated in the file in its original, unmodified form as distributed in the original archive.
                                    If you are unsure whether or not a particular file is covered by this license, you must contact us to verify this.
The FreeType Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000 by David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg. All rights reserved except as specified below.
1. No Warranty
                                    THE FREETYPE PROJECT IS PROVIDED 'AS IS' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.
2. Redistribution
                                    This license grants a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable right and license to use, execute, perform, compile, display, copy, create derivative works of, distribute and sublicense the FreeType Project (in both source and object code forms) and derivative works thereof for any purpose; and to authorize others to exercise some or all of the rights granted herein, subject to the following conditions:

Redistribution of source code must retain this license file ('FTL.TXT') unaltered; any additions, deletions or changes to the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation. The copyright notices of the unaltered, original files must be preserved in all copies of source files.
Redistribution in binary form must provide a disclaimer that states that the software is based in part of the work of the FreeType Team, in the distribution documentation. We also encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page in your documentation, though this isn't mandatory.

These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the FreeType Project, not just the unmodified files. If you use our work, you must acknowledge us. However, no fee need be paid to us.
3. Advertising
                                    Neither the FreeType authors and contributors nor you shall use the name of the other for commercial, advertising, or promotional purposes without specific prior written permission.
We suggest, but do not require, that you use one or more of the following phrases to refer to this software in your documentation or advertising materials: 'FreeType Project', 'FreeType Engine', 'FreeType library', or 'FreeType Distribution'.
As you have not signed this license, you are not required to accept it. However, as the FreeType Project is copyrighted material, only this license, or another one contracted with the, grants you the right to use, distribute, and modify it.
                                    Therefore, by using, distributing, or modifying the FreeType Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms of this license.
4. Contacts
                                    There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:

 freetype@nongnu.org
                                        Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as future and wanted additions to the library and distribution.
                                        If you are looking for support, start in this list if you haven't found anything to help you in the documentation.

Wireless Short Messaging Service (SMS)
Telenav makes every effort to comply with the Mobile Marketing Association (MMA) Consumer Best Practices Guideline for the use of text messages for conducting its word-of-mouth marketing campaign. To review these guidelines, go to http://www.mmaglobal.com/documents/best-practices.
Messages Delieverd by Telenav 
Case 1: Upon receiving activation notification from a wireless carrier, Telenav may send text messages to advise its subscriber that their Telenav accounts have been activated. Generally, these messages are sent via the messaging gateway owned by the wireless carrier that provisioned the order for Telenav services. Except for these activation confirmation messages, Telenav does not send any text messages on its own. 
Case 2: Telenav allows its mobile device application subscribers to share addresses and other relevant content with other parties using text messaging via Telenav's short code address. For example, if John Doe wants to share the address of a new club he likes, he can send the address to his friend Tom Smith from within the Telenav mobile device application. When Tom Smith receives the message, it will be sent from Telenav, Inc's short code, but opening the message will reveal that John Doe originated it. 
In both Case 1 and Case 2 above, the standard messaging rates (charges) imposed by the wireless carrier, if any, for delivering or accepting a message will apply. 
Ending Message Delivery
Every message sent via Telenav's short code includes instructions to reply STOP to stop future messages being sent on behalf of Telenav's customers. When Telenav receives a STOP message via a reply to its short code, Telenav is compelled by the MMA guidelines to inform the recipient of the original message that no additional messages will be sent, and to not deliver any further messages for any reason.
Obtaining Help 
If a message recipient wishes to get HELP on the Telenav services to better explain why he received the message, the recipient can send reply with HELP to the message, or any other person can send HELP to the Telenav short code, 69355, at any time. Telenav will respond with a message that directs the sender to this portion of the Telenav.com web site.
Restarting Services 
If a recipient, or any other person, has sent STOP, CANCEL, or any other word that could be reasonably interpreted as meaning the recipient wanted text messages from Telenav's short code to cease, but later determines that he does want to receive messages from Telenav's short code, the party wishing to restart services should send RESTART as the subject of a text message to Telenav's short code, 69355.
Other Issues or Questions 
If this information does not address a concern you have about Telenav's use of text messages or SMS, please send an e-mail to support@telenav.com. 
Effective as of June 11, 2010


Your Navigator Deluxe™ on U.S. Cellular®
Please read these terms and conditions of use ("Terms of Use") carefully before you launch Your Navigator Deluxe on your wireless device. Your use of Your Navigator Deluxe indicates that you accept these terms and conditions. If you do not accept these terms and conditions, do not launch or otherwise use Your Navigator Deluxe.
INTRODUCTION
These Terms of Use represent the agreement ("Agreement") between you and Telenav, Inc. ("Telenav") with respect to the Your Navigator Deluxe service ("Your Navigator Deluxe Service"). All references herein to "you" and "your" means you, your employees, agents, and contractors, and any other entity on whose behalf you accept these terms and conditions, all of whom shall also be bound by this Agreement. These Terms of Use replace and supersede any license agreements or terms and conditions between Telenav and you for the Your Navigator Deluxe Service that may appear on your wireless carrier's web-site(s).
Telenav may revise these terms and conditions at any time, with or without notice to you. You should visit www.telenav.com from time to time to review the then current terms and conditions for the Your Navigator Deluxe Service.
THE YOUR NAVIGATOR DELUXE SERVICE
The Your Navigator Deluxe Service allows you to obtain via your wireless device GPS-assisted navigation instructions to destinations throughout most of the United States or Canada, depending on your cellular carrier. Use of the Your Navigator Deluxe Service requires payment of a monthly fee, which includes download to your wireless device of the Your Navigator Deluxe software and any upgrades, modifications, or additions thereto (collectively, "Your Navigator Deluxe Software"), but does not include any hardware that may be required for certain wireless devices (such as a standalone GPS receiver). A complete description of the Your Navigator Deluxe Service is available at the Products link on Telenav's website, located at www.telenav.com/products/tn/. 
The Your Navigator Deluxe Service is for your internal business and personal use and is not for resale or other transfer or disposition to any other person or entity.
The Your Navigator Deluxe Service utilizes map and other data licensed to Telenav by third parties for the benefit of you and other end users. This Agreement includes end-user terms required by these companies (set forth at the end of this Agreement), and thus your use of the Your Navigator Deluxe Service is limited by and subject to such terms. 
YOUR LOCATION AND ROUTE INFORMATION
For Telenav to provide the Your Navigator Deluxe Service, Telenav must record your route information, including your point of origin, the address of your destination, the starting time of your trip, and the route you are instructed to follow, and must periodically receive your GPS location from the GPS hardware associated with your wireless device.

Such information is subject to Telenav's privacy policy located at www.telenav.com. Your use of the Your Navigator Deluxe Service indicates that you accept the terms of Telenav's privacy policy.
If you are using Your Navigator Deluxe Service with Ford AppLink: (1) you allow Ford Motor Company to access your vehicle GPS hardware and send your GPS location to United States Cellular Corporation (“USCC”) and TeleNav so that TeleNav may record, compile and display GPS location and route information internally; and (2) your use of Your Navigator Deluxe Service with Ford AppLink indicates your consent to Ford Motor Company accessing your vehicle GPS along with the serial number of the SYNC module, and sharing your GPS with TeleNav and USCC (for information on SYNC, see your Owners Guide). If you do not want Ford to access your vehicle GPS, do not use Your Navigator Deluxe Service with Ford AppLink.
SAFE AND LAWFUL USE OF THE YOUR NAVIGATOR DELUXE SERVICE
You agree to comply with the following when using the Your Navigator Deluxe Service:

Observe all traffic laws and otherwise drive safely.
Use your own personal judgment while driving. If you feel that a route suggested by the Your Navigator Deluxe Service instructs you to perform an unsafe or illegal maneuver, places you in an unsafe situation, or directs you into an area that you consider to be unsafe, do not follow such instructions.
Do not input destinations, or otherwise interact with the Your Navigator Deluxe Service, unless your vehicle is stationary and parked. 
Do not use the Your Navigator Deluxe Service for any illegal, unauthorized, unintended, unsafe, hazardous, or unlawful purposes, or in any manner inconsistent with this Agreement.
Arrange all GPS and wireless devices and cables necessary for use of the Your Navigator Deluxe Service in a secure manner in your vehicle so that they will not interfere with your driving and will not prevent the operation of any safety device (such as an airbag).

PAYMENT
Your payment is made in connection with and though your relationship with your wireless telephone carrier. Any questions that you have related to payment should be referred to your wireless telephone carrier.
TELEPHONE CHARGES
You are responsible for any fees assessed by your wireless telephone carrier to access the Your Navigator Deluxe Service, including any data plan charges, toll, out-of-area, roaming, or other telephone connection charges. Standard messaging rates and other charges may apply when using certain features in the Your Navigator Deluxe Service, such as Shared Address.
Telenav reserves the right to change at any time the phone number designated for you to access the Your Navigator Deluxe Service, including eliminating any toll-free numbers.
TERMINATION
Telenav reserves the right to terminate your access to the Your Navigator Deluxe Service at any time in the event that you are not complying with these Terms of Use. You may terminate the Your Navigator Deluxe Service at any time by notifying your wireless telephone carrier of your desire to terminate.

All of your account information, as well as other payment and personal information provided by you to Telenav, is subject to Telenav's privacy policy located at www.telenav.com. Your use of the Your Navigator Deluxe Service indicates that you accept the terms of Telenav's privacy policy.
SOFTWARE LICENSE
Subject to your compliance with the terms of this Agreement, Telenav hereby grants to you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to: (i) download or otherwise copy the Your Navigator Deluxe Software onto your wireless device, and (ii) use the Your Navigator Deluxe Software (in object code form only) on such wireless device in order to access and use the Your Navigator Deluxe Service.

Telenav does not warrant that the Your Navigator Deluxe Service or the Your Navigator Deluxe Software will not infringe on third party intellectual property rights. 
Telenav also does not warrant that your use of the Your Navigator Deluxe Service will be uninterrupted or error-free.

Telenav will exercise reasonable efforts to attempt to limit or prevent such occurrences, but in no event will Telenav be liable for any financial or other damages due to such interruptions.
Telenav also does not warrant the accuracy of the map or other data used for the Your Navigator Deluxe Service. Such data may not always reflect reality due to, among other things, road closures, construction, weather, new roads and other changing conditions.
Telenav has technological and operational security policies and procedures to protect your information from loss, misuse, alteration, or unintentional destruction, but Telenav makes no representations or warranties regarding the security of the Your Navigator Deluxe Service or the transmission of data or information to and from Telenav and your wireless device. Telenav will not be liable to you or anyone else in the event of any unauthorized infiltration of any of its systems.

APPLICABLE LAW MAY NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY OR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

Your use of the Telenav Software indicates that you accept the terms of this Privacy Policy.
3. Software License
Subject to your compliance with the terms of this Agreement, Telenav hereby grants to you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable license (except as expressly permitted below in connection with your permanent transfer of the Telenav Software license), without the right to sublicense, to access and use the Telenav Software (in object code form only).  This license shall terminate upon any termination or expiration of this Agreement.  You agree that you will use the Telenav Software only for your personal business or leisure purposes, and not to provide commercial navigation services to other parties.
3.1 License Limitations
You agree not to do any of the following: (a) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, translate, modify, alter or otherwise change the Telenav Software or any part thereof; (b) attempt to derive the source code, audio library or structure of the Telenav Software without the prior express written consent of Telenav; (c) remove from the Telenav Software, or alter, any of Telenav's or its suppliers' trademarks, trade names, logos, patent or copyright notices, or other notices or markings; (d) distribute, sublicense or otherwise transfer the Telenav Software to others, except as part of your permanent transfer of the Telenav Software; or (e) use the Telenav Software in any manner that (i) infringes the intellectual property or proprietary rights, rights of publicity or privacy or other rights of any party, (ii) violates any law, statute, ordinance or regulation, including but not limited to laws and regulations related to spamming, privacy, consumer and child protection, obscenity or defamation, or (iii) is harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortuous, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, libelous, or otherwise objectionable; and (f) lease, rent out, or otherwise permit unauthorized access by third parties to the Telenav Software without advanced written permission of Telenav.
4. Disclaimers
Except where prohibited by applicable law (which may include the Province of Quebec), in no event will Telenav, its licensors and suppliers, GM, or agents or employees of any of the foregoing, be liable for any decision made or action taken by you or anyone else in reliance on the information provided by the Telenav Software.  Unless otherwise provided under applicable laws, Telenav and GM also do not warrant or condition the accuracy of the map or other data used for the Telenav Software. Such data may not always reflect reality due to, among other things, road closures, construction, weather, new roads and other changing conditions.  You are responsible for the entire risk arising out of your use of the Telenav Software.  For example but without limitation, you agree not to rely on the Telenav Software for critical navigation in areas where the well-being or survival of you or others is dependent on the accuracy of navigation, as the maps or functionality of the Telenav Software are not intended to support such high risk applications, especially in more remote geographical areas.
EXCEPT WHERE PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW (WHICH MAY INCLUDE THE PROVINCE OF QUEBEC), TELENAV AND GM EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM AND EXCLUDE ALL WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THE TELENAV SOFTWARE, WHETHER STATUTORY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ALL WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS WHICH MAY ARISE FROM COURSE OF DEALING, CUSTOM OR TRADE AND INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO THE TELENAV SOFTWARE. Certain jurisdictions do not permit the disclaimer of certain warranties, so this limitation may not apply to you.
5. Limitation of Liability
EXCEPT WHERE PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW (WHICH MAY INCLUDE THE PROVINCE OF QUEBEC), UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL TELENAV OR ITS LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS OR GM BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES (INCLUDING IN EACH CASE, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR THE INABILITY TO USE THE EQUIPMENT OR ACCESS DATA, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF BUSINESS, LOSS OF PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR THE LIKE) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE TELENAV SOFTWARE, EVEN IF TELENAV HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
EXCEPT WHERE PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW (WHICH MAY INCLUDE THE PROVINCE OF QUEBEC), NOTWITHSTANDING ANY DAMAGES THAT YOU MIGHT INCUR FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ALL DAMAGES REFERENCED HEREIN AND ALL DIRECT OR GENERAL DAMAGES IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE), THE ENTIRE LIABILITY OF TELENAV AND OF ALL OF TELENAV'S SUPPLIERS AND OF GM SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU FOR THE TELENAV SOFTWARE.  SOME PROVINCES, STATES AND/OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
6. Arbitration and Governing Law
Unless you are a resident of Canada, You agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Telenav Software shall be settled by independent arbitration involving a neutral arbitrator and administered by the American Arbitration Association in the County of Santa Clara, California.  The arbitrator shall apply the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, and the judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered by any court having jurisdiction. Note that there is no judge or jury in an arbitration proceeding and the decision of the arbitrator shall be binding upon both parties.  You expressly agree to waive your right to a jury trial.
This Agreement and performance hereunder will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to its conflict of laws provisions. To the extent judicial action is necessary in connection with the binding arbitration, both Telenav and you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the County of Santa Clara, California.  The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you reside in Canada, this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the province or territory in which You reside at the time of entering into this Agreement and the laws of Canada applicable therein.  Any action brought by Telenav or You shall be brought exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction located within the province or territory in which You resided at the time of entering into this Agreement.
It is the express wish of the parties that this Agreement and any directly or indirectly related documents be drawn up in English. Les parties ont exprimé la volonté expresse que cette convention et tous les documents s'y rattachant directement ou indirectement soient rédigés en anglais.
7. Assignment
You may not resell, assign, or transfer this Agreement or any of your rights or obligations, except in totality, in connection with your permanent transfer of the Telenav Software, and expressly conditioned upon the new user of the Telenav Software agreeing to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.  Any such sale, assignment or transfer that is not expressly permitted under this paragraph will result in immediate termination of this Agreement, without liability to Telenav, in which case you and all other parties shall immediately cease all use of the Telenav Software.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Telenav may assign this Agreement to any other party at any time without notice, provided the assignee remains bound by this Agreement.
8. Miscellaneous
8.1 This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Telenav and you with respect to the subject matter hereof.
8.2 Except for the limited licenses expressly granted in this Agreement, Telenav retains all right, title and interest in and to the Telenav Software, including without limitation all related intellectual property rights.

If you desire to withdraw your consent to receive Notices electronically, you must discontinue your use of the Telenav Software.
8.4 Telenav's or your failure to require performance of any provision shall not affect that party's right to require performance at any time thereafter, nor shall a waiver of any breach or default of this Agreement constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself.
8.5 If any provision herein is held unenforceable, then such provision will be modified to reflect the intention of the parties, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.
8.6 The headings in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only, will not be deemed to be a part of this Agreement, and will not be referred to in connection with the construction or interpretation of this Agreement.  As used in this Agreement, the words "include" and "including," and variations thereof, will not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather will be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."

Version 2.1, February 1999
Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".
A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)
"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.

You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
•a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
•b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
•c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
•d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.
3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.
4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.
If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:
•a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)
•b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
•c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.
•d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.
•e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.
7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
•a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.
•b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.
10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.
12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
NO WARRANTY
15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied, with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided "AS IS", and you, its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.
Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these conditions:
(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group".
(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.
These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code, not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to acknowledge us.
Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's software".
We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are assumed by the product vendor.
ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch, sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA. ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally, that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than the foregoing paragraphs do.
The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf. It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable. The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by X Consortium but is also freely distributable.
The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files. To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce "uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard GIF decoders.
We are required to state that "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of CompuServe Incorporated. GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of CompuServe Incorporated."

Par conséquent, vous vous engagez à suivre les règles suivantes lors de l'utilisation du logiciel Telenav : a) respecter les lois en matière de circulation routière et conduire par ailleurs prudemment; b) faire preuve de jugement lors de la conduite. Si vous pensez qu'un itinéraire suggéré par le logiciel Télénav vous oblige à effectuer une manœuvre dangereuse ou illégale, vous place dans une situation dangereuse ou vous conduit dans une région que vous considérez comme étant non sécuritaire, ne suivez par ces instructions; c) avant d'entrer une destination dans le logiciel Telenav ou de manipuler celui ci, assurez-vous que votre véhicule est immobilisé et stationné; d) n'utilisez pas le logiciel Telenav à des fins illégales, non autorisées, involontaires, non sécuritaires, dangereuses ou illicites, ou d'une manière non conforme à la présente convention; e) installer tous les GPS et appareils sans fil et câbles nécessaires pour l'utilisation du logiciel Telenav d'une manière sécuritaire dans votre véhicule de sorte qu'ils n'interfèrent pas avec votre conduite et n'empêchent pas l'utilisation d'un dispositif de sécurité (comme un coussin gonflable).
Vous vous engagez à indemniser et à tenir à couvert Telenav à l'égard de toutes les réclamations découlant d'une utilisation dangereuse ou par ailleurs inappropriée du logiciel Telenav dans un véhicule en marche, y compris du fait que vous n'avez pas suivi les instructions ci dessus.
2. Information sur le compte et information de localisation et de recherche
Vous vous engagez : a) au moment d'inscrire le logiciel Telenav, à fournir à Telenav et à General Motors Holdings LLC et aux membres de son groupe (« GM ») des renseignements véridiques, exacts, à jour et complets à votre sujet et au sujet de votre compte et de votre véhicule et b) à tenir ces renseignements à jour.
Aux fins de l'utilisation du logiciel Telenav, Telenav pourrait recevoir de l'information de localisation et de recherche liée à votre utilisation du logiciel Telenav. En utilisant le logiciel Telenav, vous autorisez Telenav à obtenir, à utiliser et à partager (comme il est indiqué) cette information. Cette information est assujettie à la politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels, qui est affichée à http://www.telenav.com/legal/NavConnect-privacy.htm. Si vous utilisiez le logiciel Telenav, vous acceptez les modalités de cette politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels.
3. Licence relative au logiciel
Sous réserve de votre conformité avec les modalités de la présente convention, Telenav vous concède par les présentes une licence personnelle, non exclusive et incessible (sauf comme il est expressément autorisé ci après dans le cadre de votre transfert permanent de la licence relative au logiciel Telenav), sans droit de sous-licence, aux fins d'accès au logiciel Telenav (sous forme de code objet seulement) et d'utilisation de celui-ci. Cette licence prend fin à la résiliation ou à l'expiration de la présente convention. Sauf si les lois applicables l'interdisent (ce qui peut comprendre celles de la province de Québec), Telenav peut résilier la licence à tout moment et sans motif. Vous vous engagez à utiliser le logiciel Telenav uniquement à des fins commerciales personnelles ou de loisir et non pour fournir des services de navigation commerciale à d'autres parties.
3.1 Restrictions relatives à la licence
Vous vous engagez à ne pas faire ce qui suit : a) désosser, décompiler, désassembler, traduire ou autrement modifier le logiciel Telenav ou une partie de celui ci; b) tenter de déterminer le code source, la sonothèque ou la structure du logiciel Telenav sans le consentement écrit exprès préalable de Telenav; c) retirer du logiciel Telenav ou modifier les marques de commerce, noms de marque, logos, avis de brevet ou de droit d'auteur ou autre avis ou indications de Telenav ou de ses fournisseurs; d) distribuer, concéder aux termes d'une sous-licence ou autrement transférer le logiciel Telenav à des tiers, sauf dans le cadre du transfert permanent du logiciel Telenav ou e) utiliser le logiciel Telenav d'une manière qui i) contrevient aux droits de propriété intellectuelle ou exclusifs, aux droits à la protection de la personnalité ou aux droits en matière de protection des renseignements personnels ou autres d'une partie, ii) viole une loi, une ordonnance ou un règlement, notamment les lois et les règlements relatifs au pollupostage, à la protection des renseignements personnels, à la protection des consommateurs et des enfants, aux obscénités ou à la diffamation ou iii) est dangereuse, menaçante, abusive, malveillante, délictuelle, diffamatoire, vulgaire, obscène, calomnieuse ou autrement répréhensible et f) consiste à louer le logiciel Telenav ou à autrement permettre un accès non autorisé à celui ci à des tiers sans l'autorisation écrite préalable de Telenav.
4. Dénégation de responsabilité
Sauf si les lois applicables l'interdisent (ce qui peut comprendre celles de la province de Québec), Telenav, ses concédants de licence et fournisseurs, GM ou encore les mandataires ou employés des personnes précitées ne seront en aucun cas tenus responsables d'une décision ou d'une mesure prise par vous ou un tiers sur le fondement de l'information fournie par le logiciel Telenav. Sauf si les lois applicables l'y obligent, Telenav et GM ne garantissent pas non plus ni ne conditionnent l'exactitude de la carte ou des autres données utilisées pour le logiciel Telenav. Il se pourrait que ces données ne reflètent pas toujours la réalité en raison, notamment, de fermeture de routes, de travaux de construction, de la température, de nouvelles routes et d'autres changements. Vous assumez entièrement le risque découlant de votre utilisation du logiciel Telenav. Par exemple, vous vous engagez notamment à ne pas vous fier au logiciel Telenav dans des situations critiques et des régions où votre bien-être ou votre survie ou celle d'autres personnes dépend de l'exactitude de la navigation, étant donné que les cartes ou la fonctionnalité du logiciel Telenav ne sont pas conçues pour soutenir ces applications à haut risque, plus particulièrement dans des régions géographiques plus éloignées.
SAUF SI LES LOIS APPLICABLES L'INTERDISENT (CE QUI PEUT COMPRENDRE CELLES DE LA PROVINCE DE QUÉBEC), TELENAV ET GM REJETTENT EXPRESSÉMENT TOUTE GARANTIE OU CONDITION RELATIVE AU LOGICIEL TELENAV, QU'ELLE SOIT PRÉVUE PAR LA LOI, EXPRESSE OU IMPLICITE, Y COMPRIS TOUTES LES GARANTIES OU CONDITIONS POUVANT DÉCOULER DE LA CONDUITE HABITUELLE, DE LA COUTUME OU DE L'USAGE COMMERCIAL, NOTAMMENT LES GARANTIES IMPLICITES DE QUALITÉ MARCHANDE, D'ADAPTATION À UN USAGE PARTICULIER ET DE NON-VIOLATION DES DROITS DE TIERS À L'ÉGARD DU LOGICIEL TELENAV. Certains territoires ne permettent pas l'exclusion de certaines garanties. Par conséquent, la présente limitation pourrait ne pas s'appliquer à vous.
5. Responsabilité limitée
SAUF SI LES LOIS APPLICABLES L'INTERDISENT (CE QUI PEUT COMPRENDRE CELLES DE LA PROVINCE DE QUÉBEC), TELENAV OU SES CONCÉDANTS DE LICENCE ET FOURNISSEURS OU GM NE SERONT EN AUCUN CAS TENUS RESPONSABLES ENVERS VOUS OU UN TIERS DE DOMMAGES INDIRECTS, ACCESSOIRES, CONSÉCUTIFS, SPÉCIAUX OU EXEMPLAIRES (Y COMPRIS, DANS CHAQUE CAS, NOTAMMENT, LES DOMMAGES EN CAS D'INCAPACITÉ D'UTILISER LE MATÉRIEL OU LES DONNÉES D'ACCÈS, LA PERTE DE DONNÉES, LES PERTES COMMERCIALES, LA PERTE DE PROFITS, L'INTERRUPTION DES ACTIVITÉS OU DES SITUATIONS SIMILAIRES) DÉCOULANT DE L'UTILISATION OU DE L'INCAPACITÉ D'UTILISER LE LOGICIEL TELENAV, ET CE, MÊME SI TELENAV A ÉTÉ AVISÉE DE LA POSSIBILITÉ DE TELS DOMMAGES.
SAUF SI LES LOIS APPLICABLES L'INTERDISENT (CE QUI PEUT COMPRENDRE CELLES DE LA PROVINCE DE QUÉBEC), MALGRÉ LES DOMMAGES QUE VOUS POURRIEZ SUBIR POUR QUELQUE RAISON QUE CE SOIT (NOTAMMENT TOUS LES DOMMAGES MENTIONNÉS DANS LES PRÉSENTES AINSI QUE L'ENSEMBLE DES DOMMAGES DIRECTS OU GÉNÉRAUX, CONTRACTUELS, DÉLICTUELS (NOTAMMENT PAR SUITE D'UNE NÉGLIGENCE) OU AUTRES), L'ENTIÈRE RESPONSABILITÉ DE TELENAV AINSI QUE DE L'ENSEMBLE DE SES FOURNISSEURS ET DE GM SE LIMITERA AU MONTANT RÉELLEMENT PAYÉ PAR VOUS POUR LE LOGICIEL TELENAV. CERTAINES PROVINCES OU CERTAINS ÉTATS ET/OU TERRITOIRES NE PERMETTENT PAS L'EXCLUSION OU LA LIMITATION DES DOMMAGES ACCESSOIRES OU CONSÉCUTIFS. PAR CONSÉQUENT, LES RESTRICTIONS OU EXCLUSIONS PRÉCITÉES POURRAIENT NE PAS S'APPLIQUER À VOUS.
6. Arbitrage et droit applicable
Sauf si vous êtes un résident du Canada, vous convenez que les différends, réclamations ou litiges découlant de la présente convention ou du logiciel Telenav doivent être réglés dans le cadre d'une procédure d'arbitrage indépendante effectuée par un arbitre neutre et administrée par l'American Arbitration Association du comté de Santa Clara, en Californie. L'arbitre appliquera les Commercial Arbitration Rules de l'American Arbitration Association, et la décision rendue par l'arbitre peut être entérinée par n'importe quel tribunal compétent. Il y a lieu de préciser qu'aucun juge ou jury ne participe à une procédure d'arbitrage et que la décision de l'arbitre lie les deux parties. Vous vous engagez expressément à renoncer à votre droit à un procès devant jury.
La présente convention et son exécution seront régies par les lois de l'État de la Californie et interprétées conformément à celles ci, sans égard aux dispositions en matière de conflits de lois. Si une mesure judiciaire doit être prise dans le cadre de la procédure d'arbitrage qui lie les parties, Telenav et vous vous engagez à vous en remettre à la compétence exclusive des tribunaux du comté de Santa Clara, en Californie. La Convention des Nations Unies sur les contrats de vente internationale de marchandises ne s'applique pas.
Malgré ce qui précède, si vous résidez au Canada, la présente convention est régie par les lois de la province ou du territoire dans lequel vous résidez au moment de la conclusion de la présente convention et les lois du Canada qui s'appliquent dans cette province ou ce territoire et elle doit être interprétée conformément à celles-ci. Toute poursuite intentée par Telenav ou vous doit être intentée exclusivement devant un tribunal compétent situé dans la province ou le territoire dans lequel vous résidez au moment de la conclusion de la présente convention.
7. Cession
Il vous est interdit de revendre, de céder ou de transférer la présente convention ou vos droits ou obligations, sauf en totalité, dans le cadre de votre transfert permanent du logiciel Telenav, et à la condition expresse que le nouvel utilisateur du logiciel Telenav s'engage à être lié par les modalités de la présente convention. Une vente ou cession ou un transfert qui n'est pas expressément autorisé aux termes du présent paragraphe entraînera la résiliation immédiate de la présente convention, sans responsabilité pour Telenav, auquel cas vous et les autres parties devez cesser immédiatement toute utilisation du logiciel Telenav. Malgré ce qui précède, Telenav peut céder la présente convention à une autre partie à tout moment et sans préavis, pourvu que le cessionnaire demeure lié par la présente convention.
8. Divers
8.1 La présente convention constitue l'entente intégrale intervenue entre Telenav et vous à l'égard de l'objet des présentes.
8.2 Sauf en ce qui concerne les licences limitées expressément octroyées aux termes de la présente convention, Telenav conserve tous les droits, titres et intérêts à l'égard du logiciel Telenav, notamment tous les droits de propriété intellectuelle connexes. Aucune licence ni aucun autre droit non expressément octroyés aux termes de la présente convention ne visent à, ni ne doivent, être octroyés ou conférés implicitement, par la loi, par induction, par préclusion ou autrement, et Telenav ainsi que ses fournisseurs et concédants de licence se réservent par les présentes tous leurs droits respectifs, sauf les licences explicitement octroyées aux termes de la présente convention.
8.3 En utilisant le logiciel Telenav, vous consentez à recevoir par voie électronique de Telenav toutes les communications, y compris les avis, conventions, renseignements devant être fournis par la loi ou autres renseignements relatifs au logiciel Telenav (collectivement, les « avis »). Telenav peut fournir ces avis en les affichant sur son site Web ou en les téléchargeant vers votre appareil sans fil. Si vous souhaitez retirer votre consentement à recevoir des avis par voie électronique, vous devez cesser d'utiliser le logiciel Telenav.
8.4 L'omission, de la part de Telenav ou de votre part, d'exiger l'exécution d'une disposition n'a pas d'incidence sur le droit d'une partie d'en exiger l'exécution à tout moment par la suite. Une renonciation à invoquer une violation ou un défaut à l'égard de la présente convention ne constitue pas une renonciation à invoquer une violation ou à un défaut subséquent ni une renonciation à la disposition elle-même.
8.5 Si une disposition des présentes est jugée inopposable, elle sera alors modifiée afin de refléter l'intention des parties, et les autres dispositions de la présente convention demeureront pleinement en vigueur.
8.6 Les titres utilisés dans la présente convention sont fournis pour en faciliter la consultation seulement et ne sont pas réputés en faire partie et ne doivent pas servir à l'interpréter. Dans la présente convention, les termes et expressions « comprend » et « y compris » et les variations de ceux ci ne se veulent pas limitatifs, mais signifient « y compris, sans restriction ».
9. Autres modalités des fournisseurs
Le logiciel Telenav utilise des cartes et d'autres données concédées sous licence à Telenav par des fournisseurs tiers à votre avantage et à celui d'autres utilisateurs finaux. La présente convention comprend les modalités d'utilisation applicables à ces sociétés. Par conséquent, votre utilisation du logiciel Telenav est également assujettie à ces modalités. Vous vous engagez à vous conformer aux modalités supplémentaires suivantes, qui s'appliquent aux concédants de licence fournisseurs tiers de Telenav. Ces modalités sont affichées à l'adresse suivante : http://www.telenav.com/legal/terms-of-use.html#NavConnect.

Telenav Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy governs your use of certain services, product or websites offered by Telenav, Inc. ("Telenav"), including the Scout GPS application, Thinknear by Telenav, and the telenav.com and thinknear.com websites.  By using our services, products, websites, or otherwise by interacting with us, you consent to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Policy, please do not engage in any of these activities.
Telenav understands and respects your concerns about the use of your personally identifiable information, collected from you as a customer or visitor to our websites that identifies you as a specific person or entity ("Personal Information"). Personal Information may include name, telephone numbers including mobile telephone numbers, billing account number, Mobile Subscriber Identifier, Mobile Equipment Identifier, Network Address Identifier, IP address, and email addresses. Personal Information does not include anonymous or aggregate information, which after processing may not be associated with a specific person or entity. We believe that you should know what information about you we collect, as well as how that information is used, maintained, and, in some cases, shared. The following sets forth our privacy practices and policies, applicable to Telenav customers and visitors to the Telenav websites.
You acknowledge and understand that this Privacy Policy does not apply to our business partners or other companies that Telenav does not own or operate. For information on how other providers of products or services handle Personal Information you provide through other web sites or through the use of our services in conjunction with a third party, please consult their privacy policies.
INFORMATION COLLECTED ABOUT YOU AND OUR USE OF SUCH INFORMATION
The types of Personal Information and other information we may collect about you are primarily from three sources: (1) information you provide; (2) information automatically collected; and (3) information from other sources. How we use and maintain that information is described below.
1. Information You Provide
(a) Register/Information Related to Your Account
We may collect and store Personal Information about you when you register to become a customer of our services, and when you otherwise transmit such information to us via our applications, the internet (including partner websites) or by email. For instance, to maintain and/or verify your account we may collect and store in a database your name, nickname(s), mobile phone number, mobile phone model, wireless carrier, and in certain circumstances your email address, device ID/number, the last four digits of your credit card number, credit card holder's name, billing address, and credit card expiration date.
Where you have consented, we use your billing or PayPal account information for the purpose of billing you for certain of our services, and other services offered from within certain Telenav products, and with your permission, may store such information for future transactions. In certain versions of our applications, you may also be given the option to provide a profile photo.
When you choose to access one of our applications through a Facebook log-in, we collect your name, profile picture, email, Facebook password and your Facebook contacts list with your permission.  Your name will be displayed and stored within our application and your email and Facebook password will be stored to provide future access to our application. We may use this email to contact you regarding your account and/or to respond to any inquiry or feedback you submit from within our applications as described in section (b) below. If you want to revoke authorization for the application to interact with your Facebook account, you can sign out of Facebook from within the application's settings menu, remove the application from the list of permitted Apps, or turn off the Platform for Apps, Plugin and Websites from the Settings menu for your Facebook account.
When you choose to access one of our applications through a Google Sign in, we collect your email, basic profile information and Google password with your permission, which will be stored to provide future access to our application. We may use this email to contact you regarding your account and/or to respond to any inquiry or feedback you submit from within our applications as described in section (b) below. If you want to revoke authorization for the application to interact with your Google account, you can sign out of Google from within the application's settings menu.
We may also use the information that we collect about you to manage your account and provide you with customer support, perform research and analysis about your use of our products and services, to inform you from time to time by email, Short Messaging Service (SMS) message and/or within our application about products or services that we think will interest you, unless you inform us that you opt out from receiving such communications from within the email, SMS message or the application.  We may share the information we collect about you and your usage activity with our third party partners for the purpose of performing research and analysis about users of our products and services.
(b) Contact Our Customer Service Representatives/In-App Feedback
We may use your email address to contact you with regard to your account, such as to communicate that it is about to expire or to confirm any change to your phone number, and to respond to any inquiry or feedback you submit via our websites by email or from within any of our applications. You may opt-out of receiving such communications using the link provided within the email.
Additionally, if you provide feedback regarding a routing or map issue within one of our applications, we may share your comments and anonymized data about your location and route with the OpenStreetMap community for purposes of improving OpenStreetMap data.
(c) Accessing Our Services
When you use any of our services, including when you use a mobile device equipped with one of our applications, you will be asked to provide certain information. We may use your mobile phone number as your account number and if you consent may provide you with a verification code via SMS message. We may also assign you a separate and unique ID number as your account number. Your account number may be stored and used to manage your account and provide you with customer support, perform research and analysis about your use of our products and services, to inform you from time to time by email, SMS message and/or within our application about products or services that we think will interest you, unless you inform us that you opt out from receiving such communications from within the email, SMS message or the application.
Some of our applications also allow you to create a personal identification number (PIN), which we store in our database, for the purpose of you logging into your account. In some cases, this PIN is generated for you automatically on your wireless device, and cannot be altered.
Some of our applications also give you the option of providing us with your home and work addresses, which we store in our database, to enable you to access readily other features of our services.
On some versions of our applications you can also create a list of "favorite" addresses that can include your home and work addresses. We store these addresses in our database so that you can access them from your mobile device, and so that should you change devices, this collection of addresses will still be available to you.
(d) Third Party Applications
Some of Telenav's services provide you with access to third party applications. When you enable a third party application, information collected by Telenav is processed under our Privacy Policy while information collected by the third party application provider is governed by its own privacy policy.
(e) Promotions
When you participate in a Telenav promotion, such as a sweepstakes or contest, you may be asked to provide your name and email address, and possibly other information such as your mailing address and telephone number.
We store this information in our database and will use it to communicate with you about the promotion. We also may use your email address from time to time to inform you about our products and services that we think will interest you, unless you inform us that you opt out from receiving such communications using the link provided within the email.
(f) Request for Information
When you request additional information about one of our services either via one of our websites or via one of our partners through which our services are offered, such as a mobile telecommunications provider, information we collect through these requests include your name, nickname(s), phone number, and email address, and if you are seeking information on behalf of your company, the name of that company. We will use this information to provide you with details about our services, and we may use this information to promote our services to you in the future, unless you inform us that you opt out from receiving such communications using the link provided within the email you may receive or by contacting support@telenav.com. To understand what a partner of ours may do with information about you in the partner's custody, you should check the privacy policy of that partner.
(g) Public Forums
If you use or link to public forums such as social networking services, blogs on Telenav or non-Telenav websites, internet bulletin boards, or chat rooms, be aware that any Personal Information you submit can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, including to send you unsolicited messages. Telenav cannot prevent the distribution and use of such information by other parties.
(h) Other Submissions
We collect Personal Information about you when you submit survey responses, a job application or resume. Such information will be used only for the stated purposes.
2. Information Automatically Collected
We automatically receive certain types of information, some of which may be associated with Personal Information, when you visit our websites or use our products and services.
(a) Information Related to Your Location and Route or Other User Content
Each time you access the Telenav GPS Navigator™ or Scout® service or our partnered branded versions of our Navigator services, we record your location and route information, including your point of origin (which may be your then-current location), the address of your destination, the starting time of your trip, and the route you are instructed to follow. We record your current location when your wireless device requests a rerouting (which occurs, for example, when you deviate from the specified instructions). We maintain a database with these locations and route information, and may keep such information indefinitely to improve our map coverage and to provide other features that may enhance your service capabilities, functions, and your user experience. We may periodically receive your current location from the GPS hardware associated with your wireless device for the purpose of providing enhanced services, including traffic flow data. When your location, GPS heading and speed are used for these purposes, we strip it of your Personal Information, such as your phone number, prior to storing. We may share such location data in anonymized form with our third party partners performing research and analysis about traffic conditions and road segment usage.
When your mobile device's Location Services are being used by Scout or other third party applications or your mobile operating systems services, the Scout application may periodically collect and store data about your current location along with a non-personally identifiable version of your device ID to create an anonymous profile for advertising purposes.  This profile may be shared with third parties for advertising purposes. For additional information about this data usage and how to opt-out, please see below regarding geohistorical-based and interest-based advertising. Additionally, this location data may also be used by us for anonymous traffic flow data or floating car data.
When you choose to use your current GPS location for specifying the locale for a business finder search, or obtaining a map, we use your location information for the requested purpose, and then discard it. We anonymously record any search activities and results for comparative analysis. Further, we anonymously record transactions for the purpose of paying directory listing and mapping data providers.
Some versions of our applications include a location and information sharing feature that enables you to share your location or other information with another party. These location exchanges are transmitted within the application or via the internet or text messages using SMS. For example, when you create, join, or navigate to a Meet Up with the Scout application, your name, profile photo, current location and/or ETA at the Meet Up location will be displayed on a map visible by other Meet Up participants.  The Meet Up and your location and/or ETA will be removed from the map visible to other participants when you delete the Meet Up.  We record these location exchanges, and may keep such information indefinitely. Also, if you set up a Notification within the app, the phone numbers you provide will be automatically notified via SMS message each time you arrive at or depart from the location you select. You can turn off a Notification from within the application's settings menu.
Additionally, in some versions of our applications, you can allow our application to access the data stored in the address book and/or calendar on your mobile device. Our applications may use data from your address book or for your Facebook or Google+ contacts (if you signed in with a Facebook  or Google+ sign-in)   to allow you to search for and navigate to the addresses of your contacts, chat with your contacts within the application, or create a Meet Up within the application. Our applications may use calendar entry data to provide you with reminders about upcoming appointments and to provide navigation to the locations of your appointments. We will only access this data if you have given permissions for a particular Telenav application to do so, and you can revoke such permissions at any time by changing the settings on your mobile device.
When you access Telenav map and data services through a third party application, we receive and store your location information from your device along with any address or point of interest search requests along with associated destination location information.  We maintain a database with locations and search information, and may keep such information indefinitely to improve our map coverage and to provide other features that may enhance your service capabilities, functions, and your user experience. Such data does not contain any Personal Information, such as your phone number.
(b) Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technologies on our Websites
When you visit one of our websites (including telenav.com or thinknear.com), register on one of our websites, and/or fill out a form on one of our websites we collect data from you in several ways. The types of personal data that our websites collect by themselves or through third parties, include: cookies, usage data, your name, your company name, your email address, your phone number, and other contact information.

We may employ browser cookies or similar technologies to identify the computer, mobile device, or some of our services and record your preferences and other data. We use cookies or similar technologies to evaluate how our websites, devices or applications are used and to provide continuous improvement to our services, make recommendations, and complete transactions you request. Cookies may be stored locally on mobile devices or on computer servers operated or controlled by Telenav. We may use a tracking pixel, agent or other visitor identification technology that collects anonymous data about your use of some of our services. We may also use Web beacons, also known as Web bugs, which are mostly invisible small graphic images (1-by-1 pixel), in the same color as the background of the web page or an HTML email, to monitor interaction with our websites or emails. In addition, when you visit our website our systems automatically collect your IP address and the type of browser that you use. When you browse our websites our systems log the Telenav web pages that you visit. Server log files are records of activity automatically created by the server and stored. If we combine or link cookie or Web beacons with Personal Information, we will treat the combined or linked information as Personal Information under this policy. We may employ third-parties to place advertisements about our products and services on other web sites. The use of cookies, Web beacons or other similar technologies by such third parties is governed by their privacy policies.
You may limit the automatic collection of certain information through the use of cookies by our websites by disabling the cookies using your browser options. Please be aware that disabling cookies may prevent you from using specific features on our websites, such as ordering services, or maintaining an online account.
Our websites may collect data about your activity and some user identifying information, including Personal Information. This collected information is disclosed to and processed by Google and is used to enable features including but not limited to remarketing and display advertising. We use remarketing, display retargeting and search retargeting with Google Adwords to advertise online and third party vendors, including but not limited to Google, show our ads on sites across the Internet. We also use Google Analytics to optimize our websites. Telenav and third-party vendors, including but not limited to Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads about our products and services based on your past visits to our website or your search history. These features are solely for purposes to allow us to maintain the interests of previous visitors and deliver advertisement content specifically targeting the visitors' previous interests and searches. You may opt-out of such advertising using the Google Ads Preference Manager or obtain additional information available about Google's Remarketing Privacy Guidelines, Policies, and Restrictions and how Google uses data when you use their partners' sites or apps.
Additionally, in connection with our thinknear.com website we use a marketing automation tool called Hubspot® to handle various marketing tasks, for example but not limited to, contacting visitors to thinknear.com who provided their contact information and requested additional information. HubSpot's software uses cookies to track thinknear.com visitors and contacts. You can read more about Hubspot's Privacy Policy and opt-out options here.
Also note that we do not have a system to comply with Do Not Track requests at this time, unless required by applicable laws or regulations.
(c) Information related to your personal interests for particular advertisements
When you search for a Point of Interest or address within our Scout applicatios or our partnered branded navigation applications, we may share your search and location data with our third party partners in order to provide you with more relevant advertisement results within the application. The information we share is de-identified so that it does not contain any Personal Information, such as your name, phone number or email address.
When Thinknear by Telenav has the opportunity to serve an ad to you on a third party mobile site or mobile application or within the Scout application, we may receive information about your device, including GPS location data or other precise location data from third party ad exchanges and/or mobile publishers, including the Scout application.  The device and location data collected from users of the Scout application may be shared with third party ad exchanges. This information does not contain Personal Information and does enable us to personally identify you by name, phone number, email address, or other similar means, but may include your device ID, your IP address and the geo-location of your device at the time. This information is provided so that we can improve the relevance of the ads served to you. Any such information is shared in accordance with the third party's privacy policies and subject to their terms and conditions. We do not use such information for any purpose other than serving you with interest-based ads on behalf of advertising partners. If you would like to opt out of the use and/or sharing of such data for interest-based advertising, please contact us at support@telenav.com or click here and follow the instructions provided.
We may also obtain Precise Location Data from your use of Telenav applications (and certain other third party location based applications and use that location data) about your "geohistory", which is the geo-location of your mobile device over time along with a de-identified version of your device ID to create a profile.  Additionally, in order to create a profile, we may use data about your location and online activity and interests, including things like real-world category types you visited (e.g. Shopping Mall), mobile apps with which you engage, information collected by our inventory partners and other third parties and shared with us.  This will involve the use of your de-identified device ID and will not include any Personal Information, such as your name, phone number, or email address.
If you would like to opt out of the use of data for geohistorical-based and interest-based advertising by Thinknear by Telenav, please contact us at support@telenav.com or click here and follow the instructions provided.
Our third-party service providers may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites, mobile websites and/or mobile applications across your various devices, in order to provide content and advertisements about goods and services of interest to you across those various devices. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices with respect to it, please: (1) visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices or the Ghostery Enterprise opt-out program to learn how to opt out of having your information collected in browsers for ad serving purposes; and (2) download the Ghostery Ad Control application, available for iOS and Android, to learn how to opt out of having your information collected in mobile apps.
(d) Other Information
When you use the voice command or entry features on our services, we record your audible utterance (what you said). We collect utterances from our entire subscriber population, organize them by what was said, and then use this information to adjust speech recognition performance parameters to improve accuracy.
We will also collect information relating to your use of and the performance of our applications, including the state of your device at the time of an error or issue with the application, and such information is disclosed to and processed by third party providers, including but not limited to Crashlytics, for purposes of collecting information about errors or issues within our applications so we may improve our applications.
We may retain any data you provide to us in an email inquiry, for the purpose of tracking the types of questions we receive.
3. Information From Other Sources
We may obtain information about you from outside sources and add to it or combine it with your Personal Information. For example, we may request credit information when you initially subscribe for service, collect demographic and marketing data about you from third parties for marketing research and analysis to improve our products/services, obtain updated address information from our shippers, or collect information from other vendors that promote and distribute our products through their own brands.
WHEN YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE SHARED OR DISCLOSED
Telenav does not sell, rent, license or otherwise share information with unaffiliated parties except as explained in this Privacy Policy.
Consent Given/Transaction Processing
We may disclose Personal Information about you to third parties with your consent. Consent is sometimes implicit, as in the disclosure of Personal Information to third-parties who complete transactions or perform services on our behalf.
If you do not want us to share your Personal Information with these companies, you may contact us at: support@telenav.com.
To the Primary Account Holder
We may disclose Personal Information of an account user to the primary account holder (the party financially responsible for the account). If a business, governmental agency, or other individual obtains service for you, that entity or individual is our customer, and we may provide Personal Information about you, or your use of the service to them or others at their direction.
Third Party Services or Third Party Service Providers
Telenav offers access to a variety of resources, including but not limited to various communication tools, search services, forums, and links to other World Wide Web sites in providing its services, products and websites. We may make certain Personal Information non-personal and share it or aggregated data with strategic partners that work with us to analyze usage, provide and improve products or services, or that help us market to customers, or for similar purposes. Information that is not Personal Information or is aggregated is not subject to any restrictions of use or disclosure under this Privacy Policy.
If you take advantage of a third party's services or products offered through the use of our services, we may disclose your Personal Information to such unaffiliated third parties. These entities may use this information that you provide in the course of your use of Telenav's services (including your name, nicknames, telephone numbers, audio files, and email and mailing addresses) to promote their products and services to you. Any such Personal Information that a third party uses will be subject to their applicable privacy policies.
Some of our services and functionality are provided in conjunction with third party service providers. These third party service providers process Personal Information on our behalf and are obligated to process such information in compliance with this Privacy Policy and other appropriate security and confidentiality measures. In cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU individuals received pursuant to the EU-US or Swiss-EU Privacy Shield, Telenav is potentially liable.
Legal Processes
We will comply with any subpoenas, court orders or other legal processes for any of the information about you in our possession, and we may use such information to establish or exercise yours, ours, or others' legal rights, or to defend against legal claims. We also may be required to disclose Personal Information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
Business Transfers
Information about you in our possession may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another provider, as well as in the unlikely event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which your Personal Information would be transferred as one of the business assets of the company. Telenav does not guarantee that any entity receiving such information in connection with one of these transactions will comply with all terms of this policy.
European Union Users
Information that we collect about you may also be transferred among our various divisions and affiliated companies around the world, which may involve transfer from countries within the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland to countries outside the EEA. By allowing Telenav to collect this information about you, you consent to these transfers, including transborder transmission of data covered by this Privacy Policy. As a result, that country's courts, governments or law enforcement agencies could obtain disclosure of such information under that country's laws.
Telenav complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss – U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States, respectively.  Telenav has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability.  If there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.
INFORMATION ON WIRELESS DEVICES
The Telenav software (and any upgrades, modifications, or additions thereto) that is factory installed or downloaded to, and resides upon your wireless device retains your manually entered account number and PIN, or reads it from the device. Having your carrier change the assigned phone number for your wireless device does not change the account number we maintain with regard to that device, which will result in your device not being able to access your Telenav account established using the previous phone number. If this happens, please contact Telenav customer care.
SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
Telenav has implemented various physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of Personal Information under our control. For instance, Telenav limits access to Telenav systems that store such information to authorized personnel. Telenav also employs the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to protect your Personal Information when you bill on our website.
While Telenav maintains a multitude of security measures to prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of your Personal Information, no security measures are absolute or wholly guaranteed. Telenav will make reasonable attempts to notify you if it determines there were unauthorized acts by third parties that violate the law or this policy, or other security breaches, or where otherwise required by law.
Telenav will maintain your Personal Information for as long as a business need exists, or as required by applicable laws, regulations, or government orders. When we dispose of Personal Information, we use commercially reasonable procedures to erase or render it unreadable.
CHILDREN'S PRIVACY
Telenav will not knowingly request or collect Personal Information from any person under 13 years of age without prior verifiable parental or legal guardian consent. If, however, you authorize a child to use our services or products by providing them a device associated with your Telenav service, any Personal Information associated with such use will be treated as your information in accordance with this policy. Telenav encourages parents to be involved in the online activities (including wireless Internet browsing) of their children to ensure that no information is collected from a child without parental or Guardian consent.
CUSTOMER REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION
Telenav acknowledges that individuals have the right to access the Personal Information/data that we maintain about them.  Customers are entitled to request information concerning whether a business has disclosed Personal Information to any affiliated companies or third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Customers are further entitled to request access to their Personal Information under Telenav's control. To protect your privacy and security, Telenav will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before providing you access or making corrections. Good faith efforts to resolve requests to correct inaccuracies in or delete Personal Information will be made by Telenav, except where the request is unreasonable. As stated in this Privacy Policy, Telenav will not sell or share your Personal Information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes without your consent. Customers who wish to request further information about our compliance with this law or have questions or concerns about our privacy practices and policies may contact us at support@telenav.com or write to the attention of Privacy Policy Officer, Telenav, Inc., 4655 Great America Parkway, Suite 300, Santa Clara, CA 95054, USA.

Telenav Warranty and Refunds Policy
Telenav Hardware Warranties and Refunds
Telenav Bluetooth® GPS Receivers One-Year Limited Warranty 
Telenav, Inc. warrants this Telenav Bluetooth® GPS receiver against defects in material and workmanship under normal use and service for a period of one (1) year from the date of purchase by the original purchaser. This warranty is extended only to the original purchaser.
If a defect in a receiver arises and a valid claim is received by Telenav within the one-year warranty period, Telenav will, at its option, either (1) exchange the receiver with another receiver, or (2) refund the purchase price of the receiver. When a receiver is exchanged, any replacement item becomes your property and the replaced item becomes Telenav’s property. When a refund is given, the receiver for which the refund is provided must be returned to Telenav and becomes Telenav’s property.
Telenav is not responsible for your shipping and other costs to return the receiver to Telenav or its authorized representative.
This warranty does not apply to: 

Damage or loss which occurs during shipment. 
Damage caused by accident, abuse, misuse, flood, fire, earthquake or other external causes. 
Damage caused by operating the product outside the permitted or intended uses described by Telenav. 
Damage caused by service performed by anyone who is not a representative of Telenav. 
Consumable parts, such as batteries, unless damage has occurred due to a defect in materials or workmanship. 

This warranty also does not apply to any item other than the receiver. Specifically, this warranty does not cover any of the accessories shipped with your receiver, including the plug-in wall charger, the plug-in car charger, the USB cable, and the installation CD. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THIS WARRANTY AND REMEDIES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE EXCLUSIVE AND IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, REMEDIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, STATUTORY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. AS PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, TELENAV SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL STATUTORY OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. IF TELENAV CANNOT LAWFULLY DISCLAIM STATUTORY OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES THEN TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ALL SUCH WARRANTIES SHALL BE LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE DURATION OF THIS EXPRESS WARRANTY AND TO REPLACEMENT SERVICE AS DETERMINED BY TELENAV IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION. 
No Telenav reseller, agent, or employee is authorized to make any modification, extension, or addition to this warranty. Some States do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, and some States do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so one or more of the above limitations may not apply to you. 
This warranty gives you specific legal rights. You may have other rights which vary from state to state. 
How to Obtain Warranty Service
To obtain service under this warranty, call Telenav at 1-88-Telenav-4 (1-888-353-6284). You will be asked for your email address for Telenav to send you a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) number and details for returning the receiver to Telenav. Alternatively, you may receive this information verbally over the phone. The receiver must be returned in the original packaging with (i) a copy of the email from Telenav identifying your RMA number, or some other writing specifying your RMA number, and (ii) proof of purchase in the form of a copy of your original receipt. (You may keep the receiver’s activation code and the installation CD.) 
Telenav Refund Policy
Telenav GPS Navigator™
Use of the Telenav GPS Navigator service (the “Telenav Service”) requires payment of a monthly fee, which includes downloads to your wireless device of the Telenav GPS Navigator software and any upgrades, modifications, or additions thereto, but does not include any hardware that may be required for certain wireless devices (such as a GPS receiver).



    
Telenav will not refund any payments for the Telenav Service or any necessary hardware made directly to a cellular carrier (e.g., Sprint Nextel, AT&T, etc.) or otherwise not directly made to Telenav. Check with your cellular carrier for its policy on refunds of such payments.
If you pay for the Telenav Service or for any necessary hardware through a credit card at www.telenav.com or through a direct billing arrangement with Telenav, then you or Telenav may cancel your account at any time subject to the following policies: 

If you or Telenav cancel your account within the first 30 days of activation, all charges for the Telenav Service (and any hardware purchased from Telenav that you return per Telenav’s hardware return policy and procedures) will be credited back to your credit card or otherwise refunded to you, unless your account is cancelled by Telenav for cause.
For any payments for the “Telenav GPS Kit Promotion” (a free GPS receiver kit with a two-year service plan commitment), if you or Telenav cancel your account within the first 30 days and you return all hardware in the GPS receiver kit, all charges will be credited back to your credit card or otherwise refunded to you, unless your account is cancelled by Telenav for cause. Beyond the initial 30-day period, the GPS receiver kit is no longer returnable and any charges assessed for the Telenav Service are not refundable. 
If you or Telenav cancel your account at any time after the first 30 days, Telenav will discontinue charging your credit card for your monthly service fee or otherwise cease assessing charges under your direct billing arrangement, but will not refund any amounts for the current or previous months of service and will not provide a refund for any hardware purchased from Telenav. In addition, Telenav will not refund any amount of prepaid service. For example, if you purchased twelve (12) months of prepaid service and cancel your account after three (3) months, there will be no refund of any amount to you on your account. 
You will not be provided a refund for any month for which you were not charged for the Telenav Service (i.e., as a result of any free usage or other promotion). 

Telenav Shotgun™
If you pay for the Telenav Shotgun (“Shotgun”) through a credit card payment at www.telenav.com or through a direct billing arrangement with Telenav, then you may request a refund within the first 30 days after the date of purchase. Upon Telenav’s receipt of the Shotgun unit from you per the terms of this policy, the purchase price you paid for the Shotgun unit will be credited back to your credit card or otherwise refunded to you, along with any applicable sales tax. No refund will be made for any shipping or handling charges. The Shotgun unit for which the refund is provided must be returned to Telenav and becomes Telenav’s property.
Telenav is not responsible for your shipping and other costs to return the Shotgun to Telenav or its authorized representative.
To request a refund, call Telenav at 1-88-Telenav-8 (1-888-353-6288). You will be asked for your email address for Telenav to send you a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) number and details for returning the Shotgun unit to Telenav. Alternatively, you may receive this information verbally over the phone. The Shotgun unit must be returned in the original packaging including all original accessories and with (i) a copy of the email from Telenav identifying your RMA number, or some other writing specifying your RMA number, and (ii) proof of purchase in the form of a copy of your original receipt. The Shotgun unit and all original accessories must be in good physical and operational condition; damaged product will not be accepted for return. Telenav must receive your return of the Shotgun unit per the terms of this return policy within ten (10) days from the date the RMA number is provided to you. Failure to return the Shotgun unit in this timeframe, or otherwise not in compliance with the terms herein, will invalidate your RMA.
Telenav Connected Service™
Use of the Telenav Connected Service (“TCS”) which includes downloads to your wireless device of selected upgrades, modifications, or additions to TCS, requires payment of a monthly fee.
If you pay for TCS through a credit card payment at www.telenav.com or through a direct billing arrangement with Telenav, then you or Telenav may cancel your account at any time subject to the following policies:

The first 3 months of TCS is free with your purchase of a Telenav Shotgun unit, and begins from the date of first TCS activation. If you or Telenav cancel TCS within the first 30 days of first TCS activation, all charges for TCS (and the Shotgun unit purchased from Telenav that you return per Telenav’s Shotgun return policy and procedures) will be credited back to your credit card or otherwise refunded to you, unless your TCS is cancelled by Telenav for cause.
If you or Telenav cancel TCS at any time after the first 30 days of first TCS activation, Telenav will discontinue charging your credit card for your monthly service fee or otherwise cease assessing charges under your direct billing arrangement, but will not refund any amounts for the current or previous months of service and will not provide a refund for any hardware purchased from Telenav. In addition, Telenav will not refund any amount of prepaid service. For example, if you purchased twelve (12) months of prepaid service and cancel your account after three (3) months, there will be no refund of any amount to you on your account.
You will not be provided a refund for any month for which you were not charged for TCS (i.e., as a result of any free usage period or other promotion). Should you or Telenav choose to cancel TCS for any reason, you shall not be entitled to any refund of or reduction in the price of the Shotgun unit (except as expressly provided under Telenav’s Shotgun return policy and procedures).

en
fr
es

This Privacy Policy governs your use of Navigation and/or NavConnect service offered by Telenav, Inc. ("Telenav") for select automotive vehicles produced or distributed by General Motors Holdings LLC or its affiliates ("GM").  In order to provide you with navigation and related services we collect and store certain information relating to your account, your location, and your use of the navigation services.  Please review this Privacy Policy for more detail about the information that may be collected and used in connection with your use of Navigation, NavConnect, and NavConnect with Predictive Navigation. By using these products or otherwise by interacting with us, you consent to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Policy, please do not engage in any of these activities.
Telenav understands and respects your concerns about the use of your personally identifiable information, collected from you as a user of Navigation and/or NavConnect ("Personal Information"). Personal Information includes name, home address, telephone numbers including mobile telephone numbers, email addresses, and VIN numbers. Personal Information does not include anonymous or aggregate information, which after processing cannot be associated with a specific person or entity. We believe that you should know what information about you we collect, as well as how that information is used, maintained, and, in some cases, shared. The following sets forth our privacy practices and policies, applicable to Navigation and/or NavConnect users.
You acknowledge and understand that this Privacy Policy does not apply to other Telenav products or services, our business partners or other companies that Telenav does not own or operate. For information about other Telenav products and services as well as the Telenav.com website, please visit http://www.telenav.com/legal/policies. For information on how other providers of products or services handle personal information you provide through other web sites or through the use of our services in conjunction with a third party, please consult their privacy policies.
INFORMATION COLLECTED ABOUT YOU AND OUR USE OF SUCH INFORMATION
The types of personal and other information we may collect about you are primarily from three sources: (1) information you provide; (2) information automatically collected; and (3) information from other sources. How we use and maintain that information is described below.
1. Information You Provide
(a) Register/Information Related to Your Account
We receive and store Personal Information about you when you authorize our business partners to share that information with us for use with Navigation and/or NavConnect or login to Navigation and/or NavConnect using your information, and when you otherwise transmit such information to us via Navigation and/or NavConnect, or contact us by phone or email regarding our products and services. For instance, to maintain and/or verify your account we may receive certain account information from other of your accounts, with your consent, including your name, email address, vehicle information and whether your NavConnect subscription is active. We may also assign you a separate and unique Telenav ID number, which may be stored and used to manage your account and provide you with customer support, and perform research and analysis about your use of our products and services.

2. Information Automatically Collected
We automatically receive certain types of information, some of which may be associated with Personal Information, when you use Navigation and/or NavConnect.
(a) Information Related to Your Location and Route or Other User Content
Each time you access Navigation, we record your location, search and route information, including your point of origin or current location, the address of your destination, the starting time of your trip, and the route you are instructed to follow. When you are in an active Navigation session, we periodically record your current location, data from your vehicle's sensors, and GPS heading and speed from the GPS hardware associated with your vehicle in order to provide you with your route. Navigation will save and display your most recent destinations to allow you to easily navigate to these destinations again.
When you choose to use your current location for specifying the locale for a business finder search, or obtaining a map, we use your location information for the requested purpose, and then discard it. We anonymously record any search activities and results for comparative analysis.
For NavConnect users with an active subscription who have opted-in to use Connectivity, this location and route information will be stored in our secure cloud database, where we may keep such information for up to five years to improve our services and to provide other features that may enhance your service capabilities, functions, and your user experience.  For NavConnect users, other address data, including home and work addresses, favorite places, and recent destinations will also be stored with your account information in our secure cloud database until your account is deleted.
For NavConnect users who have enabled the Predictive Navigation functionality, we will regularly receive and record location data from your vehicle's GPS hardware, whenever you are operating your vehicle.  This data will be stored in our secured cloud database and we will use such information to customize and improve your navigation and search experience, for example to provide preferred brand point of interest search results, personalized routing, and commute alerts.
You can update your Predictive Navigation options (including disabling Predictive Navigation) at any time by accessing the Navigation Settings menu.
(b) Information About Your Vehicle Systems
We may receive and store limited vehicle data from the vehicle systems, for example, ambient temperature, seat sensors on/off, and ignition on/off, which may be used to optimize the safety functionality of Navigation.  For Navigation-only users, this data will be stored indefinitely in your Navigation system's local memory.  For NavConnect users with an active subscription, this data will be stored in our secure cloud database for up to five years from the date of collection.
(c) Information About Your Use of Navigation Services
When you use Navigation and/or NavConnect, we log certain information relating to your use of Navigation and/or NavConnect and the Navigation performance. For example, we may collect data about what actions you take within a session, such as the type of search you performed or what kind of route you selected.

Afin de vous fournir des services de navigation et des services connexes, nous recueillons et stockons certains renseignements relatifs à votre compte, à votre localisation et à votre utilisation des services de navigation. Veuillez lire la présente politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels pour obtenir des détails supplémentaires au sujet des renseignements qui pourraient être recueillis et utilisés dans le cadre de votre utilisation de Navigation, de NavConnect et de NavConnect avec Predictive Navigation. En utilisant ces produits ou en interagissant autrement avec nous, vous indiquez être d'accord avec la présente politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels.

Telenav comprend et respecte vos préoccupations au sujet de l'utilisation des renseignements permettant de vous identifier qui sont recueillis à votre sujet en tant qu'utilisateur de Navigation et/ou de NavConnect (les « renseignements personnels »). Les renseignements personnels comprennent le nom, l'adresse domiciliaire, les numéros de téléphone, y compris les numéros de téléphone cellulaire, adresses électroniques et numéros d'identification de véhicule. Les renseignements personnels ne comprennent pas les renseignements anonymes ou regroupés qui, une fois traités, ne peuvent être associés à une personne ou à une entité en particulier. Nous estimons que vous devriez savoir quel type de renseignements nous recueillons et comment ces renseignements sont utilisés, conservés et, dans certains cas, partagés. Nos pratiques et politiques en matière de protection des renseignements personnels applicables aux utilisateurs de Navigation et/ou de NavConnect sont décrites ci après.
Vous comprenez que la présente politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels ne s'applique pas à d'autres produits ou services de Telenav, à nos partenaires commerciaux et à d'autres sociétés dont Telenav n'a pas la propriété ou qu'elle n'exploite pas.

RENSEIGNEMENTS RECUEILLIS À VOTRE SUJET ET MANIÈRE DONT NOUS LES UTILISONS
Le type de renseignements personnels et d'autres renseignements que nous pourrions recueillir à votre sujet proviennent principalement de trois sources : 1) l'information que vous fournissez; 2) l'information qui est recueillie automatiquement et 3) l'information provenant d'autres sources. La manière dont nous utilisons et conservons cette information est décrite ci après.

Nous recevons et stockons des renseignements personnels à votre sujet lorsque vous autorisez nos partenaires commerciaux à partager cette information avec nous aux fins d'utilisation avec Navigation et/ou NavConnect ou que vous vous connectez à Navigation et/ou à NavConnect à l'aide de vos renseignements, et lorsque vous nous transmettez autrement cette information par l'intermédiaire de Navigation et/ou de NavConnect ou que vous communiquez avec nous par téléphone ou par courriel au sujet de nos produits et services. Par exemple, aux fins de la tenue et/ou de la vérification de votre compte, nous pourrions recevoir certains renseignements sur le compte provenant de certains autres de vos comptes, avec votre consentement, notamment votre nom, votre adresse électronique, des renseignements sur votre véhicule et si votre abonnement à NavConnect est actif. Nous pourrions également vous attribuer un numéro d'identification Telenav distinct et unique, qui pourrait être stocké et utilisé aux fins de gestion de votre compte et pour vous fournir le service de soutien à la clientèle ainsi qu'effectuer des recherches et analyses au sujet de votre utilisation de nos produits et services.

INFORMACION QUE RECABAMOS DE USTED Y FORMA EN QUE LA UTILIZAMOS
Los tipos de información, personal y de otra naturaleza, que recabamos de usted, provienen inicialmente de tres fuentes: (1) la información proporcionada por usted; (2) la información que se recaba automáticamente, y ; (3)la información que se recaba mediante otras fuentes.  La manera en que utilizamos y administramos toda esta información se describe a continuación.
1.  Información proporcionada por usted:
(a) Para registrar / Información relativa a su cuenta.
Nosotros recibimos y guardamos información personal suya, cuando usted autoriza a nuestros socios de negocio para que la compartan con nosotros,  para usarla con la Navegación y/o NavConnet, o ingresar a estos, utilizándola; cuando usted, de alguna otra manera, nos transmite dicha información vía la Navegación y/o el NavConnet, o; cuando usted nos contacta telefónicamente o por correo electrónico, con relación a nuestros productos y servicios.  Por ejemplo, para administrar y/o verificar su cuenta, podemos recibir, con su consentimiento,  determinada información relativa a otra de sus cuentas, incluyendo su nombre, correo electrónico, información de su vehículo y el saber si su suscripción a NavConnect se encuentra activa.  También podremos asignarle un número de identificación Telenav, único y separado, el cual podrá almacenarse y ser utilizado para administrar su cuenta, brindarle el servicio al cliente, así como realizar la investigación y análisis del uso que haga de nuestros productos y servicios.
A través de GM, de la navegación y/o de NavConnect, usted tiene la opción de proporcionarnos las direcciones de su casa y oficina, mismas que guardaremos en nuestra base de datos, para permitirle un rápido desplazamiento a dichos destinos e que ingrese a otras características de navegación y/o NavConnect.  Con nuestros productos usted también puede generar una lista de direcciones y lugares de interés "favoritos".  Dentro de la navegación y/o de NavConnect usted también tiene la opción de utilizar el menú de configuración para personalizar su experiencia, por ejemplo, al seleccionar las preferencias de navegación, activar reportes del tránsito, así como seleccionar el tipo de combustible que prefiere y realizar su búsqueda.  Para nuestros suscriptores a NavConnect, almacenamos estas direcciones y preferencias en nuestra base de datos de la nube, a fin de que usted pueda acceder a ellas desde la navegación  y/o el NavConnect mismo.
Podremos también utilizar su información para administrar su cuenta y proporcionarle servicio de apoyo al cliente; conducir investigaciones y análisis acerca del uso que realiza de nuestros productos y servicios; informarle periódicamente,  a través de la navegación y/o de NavConnect acerca de los productos y servicios que pensamos pueden ser de su interés, a menos que nos informe que desea quedar fuera de la recepción de dichas comunicaciones.

Telenav no puede prevenir la distribución y uso de dicha información por parte de terceros.
2.  Información recabada automáticamente
Cuando usted utiliza la navegación o NavConnect, nosotros recibimos automáticamente cierto tipo de información, parte de la cual puede estar asociada con  información personal.
(a) Información relacionada con su ubicación y ruta o contenido de otro usuario:
Cada vez que usted ingresa a la navegación, nosotros grabamos su ubicación, la información sobre búsquedas y rutas, incluyendo su punto de origen o ubicación actual, domicilio de destino, hora en que inicia su viaje, así como la ruta que ha instruido a seguir. Cuando se encuentra en una sesión de navegación activa,  grabamos periódicamente su ubicación actual, datos de los sensores de su vehículo, encabezado de su GPS, así como su velocidad, a partir del hardware del GPS asociado a su vehículo.  La navegación salvará y mostrará sus destinos más recientes para que pueda trasladarse nuevamente hacia ellos con facilidad.
Cuando usted elige su ubicación actual de geolocalización para especificar el lugar, a fin de realizar la búsqueda de un negocio u obtener un mapa, usaremos dicha información sólo para la finalidad necesaria y después la desecharemos. Grabaremos, de manera anónima, todas los ejercicios de búsqueda y resultados con fines de análisis comparativos.
Para los usuarios, con suscripción activa a NavConnect, que han optado por usar la conectividad, dicha ubicación e información de ruta se alojará en nuestra base de datos virtual (en la Nube) segura, donde podremos almacenarla hasta por cinco años a fin de mejorar nuestros servicios y proporcionarles otras características que mejoren sus capacidades, funciones y su experiencia de usuario.  Para los usuarios de Navconnect, otros datos de dirección, incluyendo las de casa y trabajo, lugares preferidos y destinos recientes se guardarán también junto con su información de cuenta en nuestra base de datos segura en la nube hasta que su cuenta sea borrada.
Para los usuarios de NavConnect que han habilitado la función de navegación predictiva, recibiremos y guardaremos de manera regular sus datos de ubicación proporcionados por el hardware de geolocalización de su vehículo, siempre que se encuentren utilizando el automóvil.  Dichos datos se almacenarán en nuestra base de datos segura en la nube hasta por 5 años, para poder personalizar y mejorar su navegación y experiencia de búsqueda y así proporcionarles, por ejemplo, los resultados sobre puntos de interés de marcas preferidos, personalizando rutas y alertas de viajes al trabajo.
Usted puede actualizar las opciones de navegación predictiva (incluyendo su inhabilitación) en cualquier momento, ingresando al menú de opciones de navegación.
(b)  Información de los sistemas de su vehículo.
Nosotros podemos recibir una cantidad limitada de datos su vehículo, emitidos por   los sistemas del mismo, por ejemplo, temperatura ambiente, activación o apagado de los sensores de los asientos, los cuales pueden utilizarse para optimizar la funcionalidad segura de la navegación.  Únicamente para los usuarios de la Navegación, estos datos se guardarán en la memoria local de su sistema de navegación indefinidamente.  Para los usuarios NavConnect, estos datos se guardarán en una base de datos segura en la nube por hasta cinco años a partir de la fecha en que sean recabados.
(c) Información acerca del uso que haga de los servicios de navegación.
Cuando use la navegación y/o NavConnect, registraremos cierta información sobre el uso que hace de la Navegación y/o NavConnect, así como de la ejecución de dicha Navegación.

We may also use the information that we collect about you to manage your account and provide you with customer support, perform research and analysis about your use of our products and services, to inform you from time to time about features, products or services that we think will interest you, unless you inform us that you opt out from receiving such communications.  We may share certain information we collect about you and your usage activity with our third party auto partners for the purpose of performing research and analysis about users of our products and services. However, any data will be aggregated and all of your Personal Information will be removed before sharing with such partners.

When you request additional information about one of our services either via the Telenav website or via one of our partners, such as Toyota, the information we collect through these requests may include your name, phone number, and email address. We will use this information to provide you with details about our services, and we may use this information to promote our services to you in the future, unless you inform us that you opt out from receiving such communications.

Telenav cannot prevent the distribution and use of such information by other parties.
2. Information Automatically Collected
We automatically receive certain types of information, some of which may be associated with personal information, when you use the Scout GPS Link application.
(a) Information Related to Your Location and Route or Other User Content
Each time you access the Scout GPS Link application, we record your location and route information, including your point of origin, the address of your destination, the starting time of your trip, the route you are instructed to follow, and your arrival time (if applicable). We record your current location when your wireless device requests a rerouting (which occurs, for example, when you deviate from the specified instructions). When you are in an active navigation session, we periodically receive your current location, GPS heading and speed from the GPS hardware associated with your wireless device. We maintain a database with these locations and route information, and may keep such information indefinitely to improve our map coverage and to provide other features that may enhance and personalize your service capabilities, functions, and your user experience. The application will display your most recent destinations to allow you to easily navigate to these destinations again. When you choose to use your current GPS location for specifying the locale for a business finder search, or obtaining a map, we use your location information for the requested purpose. We anonymously record any search activities and results for comparative analysis. Further, we anonymously record transactions for the purpose of paying directory listing providers.
Scout GPS Link includes a location and information sharing feature that enables you to share your location or other information with another party. These location exchanges are transmitted within the application or via the internet or text messages using SMS. For example, when you create, join, or navigate to a Meet Up with the Scout GPS Link application, your name, current location and/or ETA at the Meet Up location will be displayed on a map visible by other Meet Up participants.  The Meet Up and your location and/or ETA will be removed from the map visible to other participants when you delete the Meet Up.  We record these location exchanges, and may keep such information indefinitely. 
Additionally, you can allow the Scout GPS Link application to access the data stored in the address book on your mobile device. Our applications may use data from your address book or from your Facebook or Google+ contacts (if you signed in with a Facebook  or Google+ sign-in)  to allow you to search for and navigate to the addresses of your contacts or create a Meet Up within the application. We will only access this data if you have given permissions for the Scout GPS Link application to do so, and you can revoke such permissions at any time by changing the settings on your mobile device.
(b) Information About Your Use of the Application
When you use the Scout GPS Link application, we log certain information your use of the application and the application's performance. For example, we may collect data about what actions you take within the application such as whether the vehicle's head unit is being used, the type of search you performed or what caused an application crash. This data will be stored indefinitely to allow us to improve the application. This data may be shared with our third party auto partners in anonymized, aggregated form. Your Personal Information will be removed before any data is shared.
We will also collect information relating to the performance of our applications, including the state of your device at the time of an error or issue with the application, and such information is disclosed to and processed by third party providers, including but not limited to Crashlytics, for purposes of collecting information about errors or issues within our applications so we may improve our applications.
(c) Other Information
When you use the voice command or entry features on our services, we record your audible utterance (what you said) and that recording is shared with our third party voice recognition partner, who will use the data solely for voice recognition purposes.
WHEN YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE SHARED OR DISCLOSED
Telenav does not sell, rent, license or otherwise share information with unaffiliated parties except as explained in this privacy policy.
Consent Given/Transaction Processing
We may disclose personal information about you to third parties with your consent. Consent is sometimes implicit, as in the disclosure of personal information to third-parties who complete transactions or perform services on our behalf. Third Party Services or Third Party Service Providers.
Telenav may make certain personally identifiable information non-personal and share it or anonymized, aggregated data with strategic partners that work with us to analyze usage, provide and improve products or services, or that help us market to customers, or for similar purposes. Information that is not personally identifiable or is aggregated is not subject to any restrictions of use or disclosure under this privacy policy.
If you take advantage of a third party's services or products offered through the use of our services, we may disclose your personal information to such unaffiliated third parties. These entities may use this information that you provide in the course of your use of Telenav's services (including your name, , telephone number, and email address) to promote their products and services to you. Any such personal information that a third party uses will be subject to their applicable privacy policies.

These third party service providers process personal information on our behalf and are obligated to process such information in compliance with this privacy policy and other appropriate security and confidentiality measures.
Legal Processes
We will comply with any subpoenas, court orders or other legal processes for any of the information about you in our possession, and we may use such information to establish or exercise yours, ours, or others' legal rights, or to defend against legal claims.
Business Transfers
Information about you in our possession may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another provider, as well as in the unlikely event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which your personal information would be transferred as one of the business assets of the company. Telenav does not guarantee that any entity receiving such information in connection with one of these transactions will comply with all terms of this policy.
SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
Telenav has implemented various physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of personal information under our control. For instance, Telenav limits access to Telenav systems that store such information to authorized personnel. Telenav also employs the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to protect your personal information when you bill on our website.

CHILDREN'S PRIVACY

Telenav encourages parents to be involved in the online activities (including wireless Internet browsing) of their children to ensure that no information is collected from a child without parental or Guardian consent.

You acknowledge and understand that this privacy policy does not apply to Telenav websites, other Telenav products or services, our business partners or other companies that Telenav does not own or operate. For information about other Telenav products and services as well as the Telenav.com website, please visit http://www.telenav.com/legal/policies.html. For information on how other providers of products or services handle Personal Information you provide through other web sites or through the use of our services in conjunction with a third party, please consult their privacy policies.
Telenav understands and respects your concerns about the collection, use and treatment of your personally identifiable information in connection with the Scout GPS Link application ("Personal Information"). Personal Information may include name, home address, telephone numbers including mobile telephone numbers, location information, Mobile Subscriber Identifier, Mobile Equipment Identifier, and email addresses. Personal Information does not include anonymous or aggregate information, which cannot be associated with a specific person. We believe that you should know what information about you we collect, as well as how that information is used, maintained, and, in some cases, shared. The following sets forth our privacy practices and policies, applicable to the Scout GPS Link application users and account holders.
INFORMATION COLLECTED ABOUT YOU AND OUR USE OF SUCH INFORMATION
The types of Personal Information we may collect about you are primarily from three sources: (1) information you provide; (2) information automatically collected; and (3) information from other sources. How we use and maintain that information is described below.
1. Information You Provide
(a) Register/Information Related to Your Account
We collect and store Personal Information about you when you register for an account to use our Scout GPS Link application or login to Scout GPS Link, and when you otherwise transmit such information to us via the Scout GPS Link application, or contact us by phone or email regarding your account. For instance, to maintain and/or verify your account we collect and store in a database your name, email address, account password your mobile operating system, mobile phone model, head unit device-type ID. From the device, we collect a device ID such as IDFA or Android Advertising ID.
When you choose to access Scout GPS Link through a Facebook log-in, we collect your name, profile picture, email, and your Facebook contacts list with your permission in order to facilitate your log-in. Your name will be displayed and stored within our application and your email and Facebook password will be stored to provide future access to our application. We may use this email to contact you regarding your account and/or to respond to any inquiry or feedback you submit from within our applications as described in section (b) below. If you want to revoke authorization for the application to interact with your Facebook account, you can log-out of Facebook from within the Scout GPS Link account settings menu, remove the application from the list of permitted Apps, or turn off the Platform for Apps, Plugin and Websites from the Settings menu for your Facebook account.
When you choose to access Scout GPS Link through a Google Sign In, we collect your email and basic profile information, which will be stored to provide future access to our application in order to facilitate your log-in. We may use this email to contact you regarding your account and/or to respond to any inquiry or feedback you submit from within our applications as described in section (b) below.
You have the option of providing us with your home and work addresses, which we store in our database, to enable you to quickly navigate to those destinations and readily access other features of the application. You can also create a list of "favorite" addresses and points of interest. Within the application you also have the option to use the application's settings menu to personalize your experience, for example by selecting your navigation preferences, setting up traffic reports, and selecting your preferred gas grade for searches. We store these addresses and settings in our database so that you can access them from your account, even if you change vehicles or mobile devices.
We may also use the information that we collect about you to manage your account and provide you with customer support and to perform research and analysis about your use of our products and services. We may share certain information we collect about you and your usage activity with our third party auto partners for the purpose of performing research and analysis about users of our products and services. However, any data will be aggregated and all of your Personal Information will be removed before sharing with such partners.
(b) Contact Our Customer Service Representatives/In-App Feedback
We may use your email address to contact you with regard to your account, such as to confirm any change to your phone number, and to respond to any inquiry or feedback you submit by email or from within the Scout GPS Link application. If you contact us with a comment, question or complaint, you may be asked for information that identifies you (such as your name, address and a phone number) along with any additional information we may need to help us promptly answer your question or respond to your comment or complaint. We may retain this information to assist you in the future and to improve our customer service and product and service offerings.
Additionally, if you provide feedback regarding a routing or map issue within one of our applications, we may share your comments in non-identifiable form and anonymized data about your location and route with the OpenStreetMap community for purposes of improving OpenStreetMap data.
2. Information Automatically Collected
We automatically receive certain types of information, some of which may be Personal Information, when you use the Scout GPS Link application.
(a) Information Related to Your Location and Route or Other User Content
Each time you access or use the Scout GPS Link application (including when you search for a nearby address or Point of Interest within the application running on your mobile device, when you are in an active navigation session within the application running on your mobile device, or when your mobile device running the application is connected to your Toyota vehicle), we record your GPS location and route information, including your point of origin, the address of your destination, the starting time of your trip, the route you are instructed to follow, and your arrival time (if applicable). We record your current location when your wireless device requests a rerouting (which occurs, for example, when you deviate from the specified instructions). When you are in an active navigation session, we periodically receive your current location, GPS heading and speed from the GPS hardware associated with your wireless device in order to provide you with and update your route. We maintain a database with these locations and route information, and may keep such information for up to five (5) years to improve our map coverage and to provide other features that may enhance and personalize your service capabilities, functions, and your user experience.
We may also periodically receive your current location from the GPS hardware associated with your wireless device for the purpose of providing enhanced services, including traffic flow data for you and other users of the application. When your location, GPS heading and speed are used for these purposes, we remove any Personal Information, such as your phone number, prior to storing. We may share such location data in a non-identifiable or anonymized form with our third party partners performing research and analysis about traffic conditions and road segment usage. The application will display your most recent destinations to allow you to easily navigate to these destinations again. When you choose to use your current GPS location for specifying the locale for a business finder search, or obtaining a map, we use your location information for the requested purpose. We anonymously record any search activities and results in order to improve our search functionality. Further, we anonymously record transactions for the purpose of determining our payment obligations to directory listing providers.
Additionally, you can allow the Scout GPS Link application to access the data stored in the address book on your mobile device. Our applications may use data from your address book to allow you to search for and navigate to the addresses of your contacts within the application. We will only access this data if you have given permissions for the Scout GPS Link application to do so, and you can revoke such permissions at any time by changing the settings on your mobile device.
(b) Information About Your Use of the Application
When you use the Scout GPS Link application, we log certain information regarding your use of the application and the application's performance. For example, we may collect data about what actions you take within the application such as whether the vehicle's head unit is being used, the type of search you performed or what caused an application crash. This data will be stored indefinitely to allow us to improve the application. This data may be shared with our third party auto partners in a non-identifiable, aggregated form. Your Personal Information will be removed before any data is shared.
We will also collect information relating to the performance of our applications, including the state of your device at the time of an error or issue with the application, and such information is disclosed to and processed by third party providers, including but not limited to Crashlytics, for purposes of collecting information about errors or issues within our applications so we may improve our applications.
WHEN YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE SHARED OR DISCLOSED

With your consent, these entities may use this information that you provide in the course of your use of Telenav's services (including your name, telephone number, and email address) to promote their products and services to you. Any such Personal Information that a third party uses will be subject to their applicable privacy policies.
Legal Processes

2. Renseignements recueillis automatiquement
Nous recevons automatiquement certains types de renseignements, dont certains peuvent être des renseignements personnels, lorsque vous utilisez l’application Scout GPS Link.
a) Renseignements relatifs à votre position et itinéraire ou d’autre contenu sur l’utilisateur
Chaque fois que vous accédez à l’application Scout GPS Link ou que vous l’utilisez (notamment lorsque vous recherchez une adresse à proximité ou un point d’intérêt au moyen de l’application ouverte sur votre appareil mobile, lorsque votre session de navigation est active dans l’application ouverte sur votre appareil mobile ou lorsque votre appareil mobile sur laquelle l’application est ouverte est connecté à votre véhicule Toyota), nous enregistrons votre position obtenue par GPS, vos itinéraires, y compris votre point d’origine, l’adresse de votre destination, l’heure du début de votre déplacement, l’itinéraire qu’on vous a indiqué de suivre et l’heure de votre arrivée (s’il y a lieu). Nous enregistrons votre position actuelle lorsque votre appareil sans fil demande un nouvel itinéraire (ce qui survient lorsque, par exemple, vous vous écartez de l’itinéraire fourni). Tant que votre session de navigation est active, nous recevons périodiquement votre position, la direction indiquée par le GPS et la vitesse de votre véhicule à partir du matériel GPS associé à votre appareil sans fil afin de vous fournir votre itinéraire et de le rajuster. Nous constituons une base de données composée de ces données de positionnement et d’itinéraire et nous pouvons les conserver jusqu’à cinq ans afin d’améliorer nos cartes et d’offrir d’autres fonctionnalités pouvant améliorer et personnaliser vos capacités à bénéficier du service, les fonctions et votre expérience utilisateur.
Nous pourrions également recevoir périodiquement des données sur votre position provenant du matériel GPS associé à votre appareil sans fil afin de vous fournir et de fournir à d’autres utilisateurs de l’application des services bonifiés, comme des données sur la fluidité de la circulation. Si les données sur votre position, votre direction indiquée par le GPS et votre vitesse sont utilisées à ces fins, nous en retirons tous les renseignements personnels, comme votre numéro de téléphone, avant de les stocker. Nous pourrions partager ces données de positionnement selon un format qui ne risque pas de vous identifier ou sous une forme anonyme avec nos partenaires indépendants qui effectuent de la recherche et de l’analyse sur les conditions de la circulation et l’utilisation du réseau routier. L’application affichera vos destinations les plus récentes afin de vous permettre d’y retourner facilement. Si vous choisissez d’utiliser votre position établie par GPS pour trouver une entreprise ou obtenir une carte, nous utiliserons les renseignements relatifs à votre position pour faire la recherche demandée. Nous enregistrons de façon anonyme les activités et les résultats de recherche afin d’améliorer notre fonction de recherche. De plus, nous enregistrons les opérations de façon anonyme afin de déterminer nos obligations de paiement aux fournisseurs de service d’annuaire.
De plus, vous pouvez permettre à l’application Scout GPS Link d’accéder aux données stockées dans le carnet d’adresses de votre appareil mobile. Nos applications peuvent utiliser les données de votre carnet d’adresses pour vous permettre d’effectuer une recherche dans vos contacts et d’activer la navigation pour vous diriger à leur adresse au moyen de l’application. Nous n’accéderons à ces données que si vous en avez donné la permission à l’application Scout GPS Link. Vous pouvez révoquer la permission à tout moment en modifiant les paramètres de votre appareil mobile.
b) Données sur l’utilisation que vous faites de l’application
Lorsque vous utilisez l’application Scout GPS Link, nous conservons certaines données sur votre utilisation de l’application et son rendement. Par exemple, nous pourrions recueillir des données au sujet de vos activités dans l’application, comme l’utilisation de l’unité centrale du véhicule, le type de recherche que vous avez effectuée ou la cause d’une défaillance de l’application. Ces données seront stockées pour une durée indéterminée afin de nous permettre d’apporter des améliorations à l’application. Elles pourraient être partagées avec nos partenaires indépendants du secteur automobile selon un format regroupé qui n’est pas susceptible de vous identifier. Vos renseignements personnels seront supprimés avant que des données soient partagées.
Nous recueillerons également des renseignements sur le rendement de nos applications, y compris l’état de votre appareil au moment où survient une erreur ou un problème dans l’application, et cette information sera communiquée à un tiers, notamment Crashlytics, et traitée par celui-ci afin de recueillir de l’information sur les erreurs ou les problèmes qui surviennent dans nos applications pour que nous puissions les améliorer.

Telenav
Transforming life on the go for millions of people around the world.
We’re on a mission to make people's lives less stressful, more productive, and more fun.
We're hiring.









At the frontier of doing "on the go" better
At Telenav, we've always been about making people's lives less stressful, more productive, and more fun when they are on the go. We started on this mission in 1999 when we pioneered GPS navigation for mobile phones and changed how people get from point A to point B. Over the years, we have paved the way for a bigger end-to-end mobility transformation for all people on the go — starting with connected car solutions for drivers.
Our Products
We provide connected car and advertising solutions that are built on our powerful location platform.
Connected car solutions that help people before, during, and after every drive



Intelligent navigation & ADAS services
Our deep expertise in location-based services and driver, car, and road intelligence enables proactive, predictive, and personalized navigation and ADAS experiences. These experiences are powered by our comprehensive set of location services across the car, mobile, and cloud including global one-box search, real-time traffic, dynamic routing, fully interactive maps, and ADAS features.



Global platform that meets regional needs
Our robust location platform enables top global automotive companies to deliver experiences that help their drivers save time, stay safe, and reduce stress. These experiences are delivered through connected-embedded, embedded, and brought-in systems that are customized to meet the regional needs of drivers.





Crowd-sourced map-making
Telenav is proud to be part of the OpenStreetMap® (OSM) community. Our map-making tools enable the OSM community of more than 3 million contributors to make OSM a richer map for navigation, ADAS, and autonomous driving applications.

We leverage proprietary technologies to process, cleanse, and structure trillions of location-related data points to enable better insights, analytics and targeting tools for our clients. Location intelligence is helping brands better understand the consumer path to purchase and build experiences that more effectively engage with target audiences.

Telenav also does not warrant the accuracy of the map or other data used for the Telenav Services. Such data may not always reflect reality due to, among other things, road closures, construction, weather, new roads and other changing conditions. 
Telenav has technological and operational security policies and procedures to protect your information from loss, misuse, alteration, or unintentional destruction, but Telenav makes no representations or warranties regarding the security of the Telenav Services or the transmission of data or information to and from Telenav and your wireless device.

Applicable law may not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability or incidental or consequential damages, so the above exclusion may not apply to you.

Telenav GPS Navigator™ for BlackBerry™
Please read these terms and conditions of use ("Terms of Use") carefully before you launch Telenav GPS Navigator, Telenav GPS, or Telenav GPS Plus ("Telenav Services") on your wireless device. Your use of the Telenav GPS Navigator indicates that you accept these terms and conditions. If you do not accept these terms and conditions, do not launch or otherwise use the Telenav GPS Navigator.
INTRODUCTION
These Terms of Use represent the agreement ("Agreement") between you and Telenav, Inc. ("Telenav") with respect to the Telenav Services. All references herein to "you" and "your" means you, your employees, agents, and contractors, and any other entity on whose behalf you accept these terms and conditions, all of whom shall also be bound by this Agreement.
Telenav may revise these terms and conditions at any time, with or without notice to you. You should visit www.telenav.com from time to time to review the then current terms and conditions for the Telenav Service.
THE TELENAV SERVICE
The Telenav Service allows you to obtain via your wireless device GPS-assisted navigation instructions to destinations throughout most of the United States or Canada, depending on your cellular carrier. Use of the Telenav Service requires payment of a monthly fee, which includes download to your wireless device of the Telenav GPS Navigator software and any upgrades, modifications, or additions thereto (collectively, "Telenav Software"), but does not include any hardware that may be required for certain wireless devices (such as a standalone GPS receiver). A complete description of the Telenav Service is available at the Products link on Telenav’s website, located at www.telenav.com/products.
The Telenav Service is for your internal business and personal use and is not for resale or other transfer or disposition to any other person or entity.
The Telenav Service utilizes map and other data licensed to Telenav by third parties for the benefit of you and other end users. This Agreement includes end-user terms required by these companies (set forth at the end of this Agreement), and thus your use of the Telenav Service is limited by and subject to such terms.
Use of MyMileage within the Telenav Services is subject to additional terms located at www.telenav.com/legal/terms-of-use.html.
YOUR LOCATION AND ROUTE INFORMATION
For Telenav to provide the Telenav Service, Telenav must record your route information, including your point of origin, the address of your destination, the starting time of your trip, and the route you are instructed to follow, and must periodically receive your GPS location from the GPS hardware associated with your wireless device.
In using the Telenav Service, you allow Telenav to access your GPS hardware and otherwise obtain this location and route information, and to record, compile and display such information internally. Such information is subject to Telenav’s privacy policy located at www.telenav.com. Your use of the Telenav Service indicates that you accept the terms of Telenav’s privacy policy.
SAFE AND LAWFUL USE OF THE TELENAV SERVICE
You agree to comply with the following when using the Telenav Service:

Observe all traffic laws and otherwise drive safely.
Use your own personal judgment while driving. If you feel that a route suggested by the Telenav Service instructs you to perform an unsafe or illegal maneuver, places you in an unsafe situation, or directs you into an area that you consider to be unsafe, do not follow such instructions.
Do not input destinations, or otherwise interact with the Telenav Service, unless your vehicle is stationary and parked. 
Do not use the Telenav Service for any illegal, unauthorized, unintended, unsafe, hazardous, or unlawful purposes, or in any manner inconsistent with this Agreement.
Arrange all GPS and wireless devices and cables necessary for use of the Telenav Service in a secure manner in your vehicle so that they will not interfere with your driving and will not prevent the operation of any safety device (such as an airbag).

PAYMENT
Before your Telenav Service will be activated, you must: (i) provide Telenav with a valid major credit card (American Express, VISA or MasterCard); (ii) enter into a direct billing or prepaid agreement with Telenav; or (iii) subscribe to the Telenav Service through your wireless telephone carrier, and agree to pay the relevant charges to such carrier.
You agree to pay all fees charged to your account for the Telenav Service (including applicable state and local taxes), in accordance with Telenav’s billing terms in effect at the time the charge becomes payable. You will be charged such fees each month, even if you do not use the Telenav Service. Telenav reserves the right to change the fees for the Telenav Service at any time, upon prior notice to you.
If payment cannot be charged to your credit card or your credit card charge is returned to Telenav for any reason, or you otherwise fail to pay the charges for the Telenav Service when due, Telenav reserves the right to pursue any and all legal remedies to collect the amounts owed by you, and to suspend or terminate your access to the Telenav Service.
TELEPHONE CHARGES
You are responsible for any fees assessed by your wireless telephone carrier to access the Telenav Service, including any data plan charges, toll, out-of-area, roaming, or other telephone connection charges. Standard messaging rates and other charges may apply when using certain features in the Telenav Service, such as Shared Address.
Telenav reserves the right to change at any time the phone number designated for you to access the Telenav Service, including eliminating any toll-free numbers.
TERMINATION
Telenav reserves the right to terminate your access to the Telenav Service at any time for any or no reason and without notice to you.
You may terminate the Telenav Service at any time by notifying Telenav via: (i) an email addressed to support@telenav.com; (ii) a letter addressed to Telenav, Inc., 950 DeGuigne Dr., Sunnyvale, CA 94085-3900. Any such cancellation by you shall become effective upon Telenav’s receipt of your notice.
Upon any termination of your Telenav Service, Telenav shall have no liability to you or any further obligations under this Agreement, other than to provide you with a refund in accordance with Telenav’s then current refund policy, unless such termination is for cause. For a copy of Telenav’s refund policy, visit www.telenav.com.
ACCOUNT INFORMATION
You agree: (a) when signing up for the Telenav Service, to provide Telenav with true, accurate, current, and complete information about yourself, and (b) to inform Telenav promptly of any changes to such information to keep it true, accurate, current and complete.
If you provide Telenav with any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Telenav has reasonable grounds to suspect so, Telenav has the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Telenav Service.
All of your account information, as well as other payment and personal information provided by you to Telenav, is subject to Telenav’s privacy policy located at www.telenav.com. Your use of the Telenav Service indicates that you accept the terms of Telenav’s privacy policy.
SOFTWARE LICENSE
Subject to your compliance with the terms of this Agreement, Telenav hereby grants to you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to: (i) download or otherwise copy the Telenav Software onto your wireless device, and (ii) use the Telenav Software (in object code form only) on such wireless device in order to access and use the Telenav Service.
This license shall terminate upon any termination of this Agreement, or upon any suspension, termination or cancellation of your access to the Telenav Service.

Telenav does not warrant that the Telenav Service or the Telenav Software will not infringe on third party intellectual property rights.
Telenav also does not warrant that your use of the Telenav Service will be uninterrupted or error-free.

Telenav also does not warrant the accuracy of the map or other data used for the Telenav Service. Such data may not always reflect reality due to, among other things, road closures, construction, weather, new roads and other changing conditions.
Telenav has technological and operational security policies and procedures to protect your information from loss, misuse, alteration, or unintentional destruction, but Telenav makes no representations or warranties regarding the security of the Telenav Service or the transmission of data or information to and from Telenav and your wireless device.

To the fullest extent permissible pursuant to applicable law, in no event will Telenav, its licensors and suppliers, or agents or employees of any of the foregoing, be liable for any decision made or action taken by you or anyone else in reliance on the information provided by the Telenav Software. Telenav also does not warrant the accuracy of the map or other data used for the Telenav Software. Such data may not always reflect reality due to, among other things, road closures, construction, weather, new roads and other changing conditions. You are responsible for the entire risk arising out of your use of the Telenav Software. For example but without limitation, you agree not to rely on the Telenav Software for critical navigation in areas where the well-being or survival of you or others is dependent on the accuracy of navigation, as the maps or functionality of the Telenav Software are not intended to support such high risk applications, especially in more remote geographical areas.

Certain jurisdictions do not permit the disclaimer of certain warranties, so this limitation may not apply to you.
5. Limitation of Liability
TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL TELENAV OR ITS LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES (INCLUDING IN EACH CASE, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR THE INABILITY TO USE THE EQUIPMENT OR ACCESS DATA, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF BUSINESS, LOSS OF PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR THE LIKE) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE TELENAV SOFTWARE, EVEN IF TELENAV HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
NOTWITHSTANDING ANY DAMAGES THAT YOU MIGHT INCUR FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ALL DAMAGES REFERENCED HEREIN AND ALL DIRECT OR GENERAL DAMAGES IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE), THE ENTIRE LIABILITY OF TELENAV AND OF ALL OF TELENAV’S SUPPLIERS SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU FOR THE TELENAV SOFTWARE. SOME STATES AND/OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

You agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Telenav Software shall be settled by independent arbitration involving a neutral arbitrator and administered by the American Arbitration Association in the County of Santa Clara, California. The arbitrator shall apply the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, and the judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered by any court having jurisdiction. Note that there is no judge or jury in an arbitration proceeding and the decision of the arbitrator shall be binding upon both parties. You expressly agree to waive your right to a jury trial.
This Agreement and performance hereunder will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to its conflict of laws provisions. To the extent judicial action is necessary in connection with the binding arbitration, both Telenav and you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the County of Santa Clara, California. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply.

                                    Very good wrapper, but without unicode support unfortunately. 
                                    So, I have reconstructed it for unicode.

                                    2006-Jan-27 Copyright 1996-2002, 2006 by David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg
Introduction
The FreeType Project is distributed in several archive packages; some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine, various tools and contributions which rely on, or relate to, the FreeType Project.
This license applies to all files found in such packages, and which do not fall under their own explicit license. The license affects thus the FreeType font engine, the test programs, documentation and makefiles, at the very least.
This license was inspired by the BSD, Artistic, and IJG (Independent JPEG Group) licenses, which all encourage inclusion and use of free software in commercial and freeware products alike. As a consequence, its main points are that:

We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be interested in any kind of bug reports. ('as is' distribution)
You can use this software for whatever you want, in parts or full form, without having to pay us. ('royalty-free' usage)
You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use it, or only parts of it, in a program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that you have used the FreeType code. ('credits')

We specifically permit and encourage the inclusion of this software, with or without modifications, in commercial products.
                                    We disclaim all warranties covering The FreeType Project and assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.
Finally, many people asked us for a preferred form for a credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license. We thus encourage you to use the following text:
 """ 
                                    Portions of this software are copyright © 20XX The FreeType
                                    Project (www.freetype.org). All rights reserved.
                                    """ 
Please replace 20XX with the value from the FreeType version you actually use.
Legal Terms
                                    0. Definitions
Throughout this license, the terms 'package', 'FreeType Project', and 'FreeType archive' refer to the set of files originally distributed by the authors (David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg) as the 'FreeType Project', be they named as alpha, beta or final release.
'You' refers to the licensee, or person using the project, where 'using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source code as well as linking it to form a 'program' or 'executable'.
This program is referred to as 'a program using the FreeType engine'.
This license applies to all files distributed in the original FreeType Project, including all source code, binaries and documentation, unless otherwise stated in the file in its original, unmodified form as distributed in the original archive.
                                    If you are unsure whether or not a particular file is covered by this license, you must contact us to verify this.
The FreeType Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000 by David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg. All rights reserved except as specified below.
1. No Warranty
                                    THE FREETYPE PROJECT IS PROVIDED 'AS IS' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.
2. Redistribution
                                    This license grants a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable right and license to use, execute, perform, compile, display, copy, create derivative works of, distribute and sublicense the FreeType Project (in both source and object code forms) and derivative works thereof for any purpose; and to authorize others to exercise some or all of the rights granted herein, subject to the following conditions:

Redistribution of source code must retain this license file ('FTL.TXT') unaltered; any additions, deletions or changes to the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation. The copyright notices of the unaltered, original files must be preserved in all copies of source files.
Redistribution in binary form must provide a disclaimer that states that the software is based in part of the work of the FreeType Team, in the distribution documentation. We also encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page in your documentation, though this isn't mandatory.

These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the FreeType Project, not just the unmodified files. If you use our work, you must acknowledge us. However, no fee need be paid to us.
3. Advertising
                                    Neither the FreeType authors and contributors nor you shall use the name of the other for commercial, advertising, or promotional purposes without specific prior written permission.
We suggest, but do not require, that you use one or more of the following phrases to refer to this software in your documentation or advertising materials: 'FreeType Project', 'FreeType Engine', 'FreeType library', or 'FreeType Distribution'.
As you have not signed this license, you are not required to accept it. However, as the FreeType Project is copyrighted material, only this license, or another one contracted with the, grants you the right to use, distribute, and modify it.
                                    Therefore, by using, distributing, or modifying the FreeType Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms of this license.
4. Contacts
                                    There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:

 freetype@nongnu.org
                                        Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as future and wanted additions to the library and distribution.
                                        If you are looking for support, start in this list if you haven't found anything to help you in the documentation.
freetype-devel@nongnu.org
                                        Discusses bugs, as well as engine internals, design issues, specific licenses, porting, etc.

Wireless Short Messaging Service (SMS)
Telenav makes every effort to comply with the Mobile Marketing Association (MMA) Consumer Best Practices Guideline for the use of text messages for conducting its word-of-mouth marketing campaign. To review these guidelines, go to http://www.mmaglobal.com/documents/best-practices.
Messages Delieverd by Telenav 
Case 1: Upon receiving activation notification from a wireless carrier, Telenav may send text messages to advise its subscriber that their Telenav accounts have been activated. Generally, these messages are sent via the messaging gateway owned by the wireless carrier that provisioned the order for Telenav services. Except for these activation confirmation messages, Telenav does not send any text messages on its own. 
Case 2: Telenav allows its mobile device application subscribers to share addresses and other relevant content with other parties using text messaging via Telenav's short code address. For example, if John Doe wants to share the address of a new club he likes, he can send the address to his friend Tom Smith from within the Telenav mobile device application. When Tom Smith receives the message, it will be sent from Telenav, Inc's short code, but opening the message will reveal that John Doe originated it. 
In both Case 1 and Case 2 above, the standard messaging rates (charges) imposed by the wireless carrier, if any, for delivering or accepting a message will apply. 
Ending Message Delivery
Every message sent via Telenav's short code includes instructions to reply STOP to stop future messages being sent on behalf of Telenav's customers. When Telenav receives a STOP message via a reply to its short code, Telenav is compelled by the MMA guidelines to inform the recipient of the original message that no additional messages will be sent, and to not deliver any further messages for any reason.
Obtaining Help 
If a message recipient wishes to get HELP on the Telenav services to better explain why he received the message, the recipient can send reply with HELP to the message, or any other person can send HELP to the Telenav short code, 69355, at any time. Telenav will respond with a message that directs the sender to this portion of the Telenav.com web site.
Restarting Services 
If a recipient, or any other person, has sent STOP, CANCEL, or any other word that could be reasonably interpreted as meaning the recipient wanted text messages from Telenav's short code to cease, but later determines that he does want to receive messages from Telenav's short code, the party wishing to restart services should send RESTART as the subject of a text message to Telenav's short code, 69355.
Other Issues or Questions 
If this information does not address a concern you have about Telenav's use of text messages or SMS, please send an e-mail to support@telenav.com. 
Effective as of June 11, 2010


Your Navigator Deluxe™ on U.S. Cellular®
Please read these terms and conditions of use ("Terms of Use") carefully before you launch Your Navigator Deluxe on your wireless device. Your use of Your Navigator Deluxe indicates that you accept these terms and conditions. If you do not accept these terms and conditions, do not launch or otherwise use Your Navigator Deluxe.
INTRODUCTION
These Terms of Use represent the agreement ("Agreement") between you and Telenav, Inc. ("Telenav") with respect to the Your Navigator Deluxe service ("Your Navigator Deluxe Service"). All references herein to "you" and "your" means you, your employees, agents, and contractors, and any other entity on whose behalf you accept these terms and conditions, all of whom shall also be bound by this Agreement. These Terms of Use replace and supersede any license agreements or terms and conditions between Telenav and you for the Your Navigator Deluxe Service that may appear on your wireless carrier's web-site(s).
Telenav may revise these terms and conditions at any time, with or without notice to you. You should visit www.telenav.com from time to time to review the then current terms and conditions for the Your Navigator Deluxe Service.
THE YOUR NAVIGATOR DELUXE SERVICE
The Your Navigator Deluxe Service allows you to obtain via your wireless device GPS-assisted navigation instructions to destinations throughout most of the United States or Canada, depending on your cellular carrier. Use of the Your Navigator Deluxe Service requires payment of a monthly fee, which includes download to your wireless device of the Your Navigator Deluxe software and any upgrades, modifications, or additions thereto (collectively, "Your Navigator Deluxe Software"), but does not include any hardware that may be required for certain wireless devices (such as a standalone GPS receiver). A complete description of the Your Navigator Deluxe Service is available at the Products link on Telenav's website, located at www.telenav.com/products/tn/. 
The Your Navigator Deluxe Service is for your internal business and personal use and is not for resale or other transfer or disposition to any other person or entity.
The Your Navigator Deluxe Service utilizes map and other data licensed to Telenav by third parties for the benefit of you and other end users. This Agreement includes end-user terms required by these companies (set forth at the end of this Agreement), and thus your use of the Your Navigator Deluxe Service is limited by and subject to such terms. 
YOUR LOCATION AND ROUTE INFORMATION
For Telenav to provide the Your Navigator Deluxe Service, Telenav must record your route information, including your point of origin, the address of your destination, the starting time of your trip, and the route you are instructed to follow, and must periodically receive your GPS location from the GPS hardware associated with your wireless device. In using the Your Navigator Deluxe Service, you allow Telenav to access your GPS hardware and otherwise obtain this location and route information, and to record, compile and display such information internally. Such information is subject to Telenav's privacy policy located at www.telenav.com. Your use of the Your Navigator Deluxe Service indicates that you accept the terms of Telenav's privacy policy.
If you are using Your Navigator Deluxe Service with Ford AppLink: (1) you allow Ford Motor Company to access your vehicle GPS hardware and send your GPS location to United States Cellular Corporation (“USCC”) and TeleNav so that TeleNav may record, compile and display GPS location and route information internally; and (2) your use of Your Navigator Deluxe Service with Ford AppLink indicates your consent to Ford Motor Company accessing your vehicle GPS along with the serial number of the SYNC module, and sharing your GPS with TeleNav and USCC (for information on SYNC, see your Owners Guide). If you do not want Ford to access your vehicle GPS, do not use Your Navigator Deluxe Service with Ford AppLink.
SAFE AND LAWFUL USE OF THE YOUR NAVIGATOR DELUXE SERVICE
You agree to comply with the following when using the Your Navigator Deluxe Service:

Observe all traffic laws and otherwise drive safely.
Use your own personal judgment while driving. If you feel that a route suggested by the Your Navigator Deluxe Service instructs you to perform an unsafe or illegal maneuver, places you in an unsafe situation, or directs you into an area that you consider to be unsafe, do not follow such instructions.
Do not input destinations, or otherwise interact with the Your Navigator Deluxe Service, unless your vehicle is stationary and parked. 
Do not use the Your Navigator Deluxe Service for any illegal, unauthorized, unintended, unsafe, hazardous, or unlawful purposes, or in any manner inconsistent with this Agreement.
Arrange all GPS and wireless devices and cables necessary for use of the Your Navigator Deluxe Service in a secure manner in your vehicle so that they will not interfere with your driving and will not prevent the operation of any safety device (such as an airbag).

PAYMENT
Your payment is made in connection with and though your relationship with your wireless telephone carrier. Any questions that you have related to payment should be referred to your wireless telephone carrier.
TELEPHONE CHARGES
You are responsible for any fees assessed by your wireless telephone carrier to access the Your Navigator Deluxe Service, including any data plan charges, toll, out-of-area, roaming, or other telephone connection charges. Standard messaging rates and other charges may apply when using certain features in the Your Navigator Deluxe Service, such as Shared Address.
Telenav reserves the right to change at any time the phone number designated for you to access the Your Navigator Deluxe Service, including eliminating any toll-free numbers.
TERMINATION
Telenav reserves the right to terminate your access to the Your Navigator Deluxe Service at any time in the event that you are not complying with these Terms of Use. You may terminate the Your Navigator Deluxe Service at any time by notifying your wireless telephone carrier of your desire to terminate. If your wireless telephone carrier is U.S. Cellular, you may call 1-888-944-9400 to terminate the Telenav Service. You will no longer receive the Your Navigator Deluxe Service once you terminate it.
ACCOUNT INFORMATION
You agree: (a) when signing up for the Your Navigator Deluxe Service, to provide Telenav with true, accurate, current, and complete information about yourself, and (b) to inform Telenav promptly of any changes to such information to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. 
If you provide Telenav with any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Telenav has reasonable grounds to suspect so, Telenav has the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Your Navigator Deluxe Service.
All of your account information, as well as other payment and personal information provided by you to Telenav, is subject to Telenav's privacy policy located at www.telenav.com. Your use of the Your Navigator Deluxe Service indicates that you accept the terms of Telenav's privacy policy.
SOFTWARE LICENSE
Subject to your compliance with the terms of this Agreement, Telenav hereby grants to you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to: (i) download or otherwise copy the Your Navigator Deluxe Software onto your wireless device, and (ii) use the Your Navigator Deluxe Software (in object code form only) on such wireless device in order to access and use the Your Navigator Deluxe Service. 
This license shall terminate upon any termination of this Agreement, or upon any suspension, termination or cancellation of your access to the Your Navigator Deluxe Service. 
Except for the limited license expressly granted herein, Telenav shall own all right, title and interest in and to the Your Navigator Deluxe Software, including without limitation all intellectual property rights therein. 
You agree not to do any of the following:

Reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, translate, modify, alter or otherwise change the Your Navigator Deluxe Software, or any part thereof.
Attempt to derive the source code, audio library or structure of the Your Navigator Deluxe Software without the prior express written consent of Telenav.
Remove from the Your Navigator Deluxe Software, or alter, any of Telenav's or its suppliers' trademarks, trade names, logos, patent or copyright notices, or other notices or markings.
Distribute, sublicense or otherwise transfer the Your Navigator Deluxe Software to others.

DISCLAIMERS
To the fullest extent permissible pursuant to applicable law, in no event will Telenav, its licensors and suppliers, or agents or employees of any of the foregoing, be liable for any decision made or action taken by you or anyone else in reliance on the information provided by the Your Navigator Deluxe Service or the Your Navigator Deluxe Software. You are responsible for the entire risk arising out of your use of the Your Navigator Deluxe Service and the Your Navigator Deluxe Software.
The Your Navigator Deluxe Service and the Your Navigator Deluxe Software are provided "as is" and without warranties of any kind either express or implied. Telenav disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. 
Applicable law may not allow certain warranty exclusions, so one or more of the above disclaimers may not apply to you.
OTHER QUALIFICATIONS
You understand and agree that the Your Navigator Deluxe Software is downloaded to your wireless device at your own discretion and risk and that you will be solely responsible for any damages to your wireless device, or loss of data, that results from the download of such software.
Telenav does not warrant that the Your Navigator Deluxe Service or the Your Navigator Deluxe Software will not infringe on third party intellectual property rights. 
Telenav also does not warrant that your use of the Your Navigator Deluxe Service will be uninterrupted or error-free. Rather, temporary interruptions of the Your Navigator Deluxe Service may occur from time to time (such as when you drive into an area that has no cell phone coverage or when the Your Navigator Deluxe Service or your carrier's network is undergoing maintenance). Telenav will exercise reasonable efforts to attempt to limit or prevent such occurrences, but in no event will Telenav be liable for any financial or other damages due to such interruptions.
Telenav also does not warrant the accuracy of the map or other data used for the Your Navigator Deluxe Service. Such data may not always reflect reality due to, among other things, road closures, construction, weather, new roads and other changing conditions.

You agree not to do any of the following: (a) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, translate, modify, alter or otherwise change the Telenav Software or any part thereof; (b) attempt to derive the source code, audio library or structure of the Telenav Software without the prior express written consent of Telenav; (c) remove from the Telenav Software, or alter, any of Telenav's or its suppliers' trademarks, trade names, logos, patent or copyright notices, or other notices or markings; (d) distribute, sublicense or otherwise transfer the Telenav Software to others, except as part of your permanent transfer of the Telenav Software; or (e) use the Telenav Software in any manner that (i) infringes the intellectual property or proprietary rights, rights of publicity or privacy or other rights of any party, (ii) violates any law, statute, ordinance or regulation, including but not limited to laws and regulations related to spamming, privacy, consumer and child protection, obscenity or defamation, or (iii) is harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortuous, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, libelous, or otherwise objectionable; and (f) lease, rent out, or otherwise permit unauthorized access by third parties to the Telenav Software without advanced written permission of Telenav.

Unless otherwise provided under applicable laws, Telenav and GM also do not warrant or condition the accuracy of the map or other data used for the Telenav Software. Such data may not always reflect reality due to, among other things, road closures, construction, weather, new roads and other changing conditions.  You are responsible for the entire risk arising out of your use of the Telenav Software.  For example but without limitation, you agree not to rely on the Telenav Software for critical navigation in areas where the well-being or survival of you or others is dependent on the accuracy of navigation, as the maps or functionality of the Telenav Software are not intended to support such high risk applications, especially in more remote geographical areas.

EXCEPT WHERE PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW (WHICH MAY INCLUDE THE PROVINCE OF QUEBEC), NOTWITHSTANDING ANY DAMAGES THAT YOU MIGHT INCUR FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ALL DAMAGES REFERENCED HEREIN AND ALL DIRECT OR GENERAL DAMAGES IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE), THE ENTIRE LIABILITY OF TELENAV AND OF ALL OF TELENAV'S SUPPLIERS AND OF GM SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU FOR THE TELENAV SOFTWARE.  SOME PROVINCES, STATES AND/OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
6. Arbitration and Governing Law
Unless you are a resident of Canada, You agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Telenav Software shall be settled by independent arbitration involving a neutral arbitrator and administered by the American Arbitration Association in the County of Santa Clara, California.

Note that there is no judge or jury in an arbitration proceeding and the decision of the arbitrator shall be binding upon both parties.  You expressly agree to waive your right to a jury trial.
This Agreement and performance hereunder will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to its conflict of laws provisions.

7. Assignment
You may not resell, assign, or transfer this Agreement or any of your rights or obligations, except in totality, in connection with your permanent transfer of the Telenav Software, and expressly conditioned upon the new user of the Telenav Software agreeing to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

Licensed under GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 2.1, February 1999
Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".
A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)
"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
•a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
•b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
•c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
•d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.
3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.
4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.
If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:
•a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)
•b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
•c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.
•d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.
•e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.
7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
•a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.
•b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.
10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.
12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
NO WARRANTY
15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied, with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided "AS IS", and you, its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.
Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these conditions:
(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group".
(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.
These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code, not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to acknowledge us.
Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's software".
We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are assumed by the product vendor.
ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch, sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA. ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally, that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than the foregoing paragraphs do.
The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf. It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable. The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by X Consortium but is also freely distributable.
The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files. To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce "uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard GIF decoders.
We are required to state that "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of CompuServe Incorporated. GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of CompuServe Incorporated."

1. Utilisation sécuritaire et légale

Par conséquent, vous vous engagez à suivre les règles suivantes lors de l'utilisation du logiciel Telenav : a) respecter les lois en matière de circulation routière et conduire par ailleurs prudemment; b) faire preuve de jugement lors de la conduite. Si vous pensez qu'un itinéraire suggéré par le logiciel Télénav vous oblige à effectuer une manœuvre dangereuse ou illégale, vous place dans une situation dangereuse ou vous conduit dans une région que vous considérez comme étant non sécuritaire, ne suivez par ces instructions; c) avant d'entrer une destination dans le logiciel Telenav ou de manipuler celui ci, assurez-vous que votre véhicule est immobilisé et stationné; d) n'utilisez pas le logiciel Telenav à des fins illégales, non autorisées, involontaires, non sécuritaires, dangereuses ou illicites, ou d'une manière non conforme à la présente convention; e) installer tous les GPS et appareils sans fil et câbles nécessaires pour l'utilisation du logiciel Telenav d'une manière sécuritaire dans votre véhicule de sorte qu'ils n'interfèrent pas avec votre conduite et n'empêchent pas l'utilisation d'un dispositif de sécurité (comme un coussin gonflable).
Vous vous engagez à indemniser et à tenir à couvert Telenav à l'égard de toutes les réclamations découlant d'une utilisation dangereuse ou par ailleurs inappropriée du logiciel Telenav dans un véhicule en marche, y compris du fait que vous n'avez pas suivi les instructions ci dessus.
2. Information sur le compte et information de localisation et de recherche
Vous vous engagez : a) au moment d'inscrire le logiciel Telenav, à fournir à Telenav et à General Motors Holdings LLC et aux membres de son groupe (« GM ») des renseignements véridiques, exacts, à jour et complets à votre sujet et au sujet de votre compte et de votre véhicule et b) à tenir ces renseignements à jour.
Aux fins de l'utilisation du logiciel Telenav, Telenav pourrait recevoir de l'information de localisation et de recherche liée à votre utilisation du logiciel Telenav. En utilisant le logiciel Telenav, vous autorisez Telenav à obtenir, à utiliser et à partager (comme il est indiqué) cette information. Cette information est assujettie à la politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels, qui est affichée à http://www.telenav.com/legal/NavConnect-privacy.htm. Si vous utilisiez le logiciel Telenav, vous acceptez les modalités de cette politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels.
3. Licence relative au logiciel
Sous réserve de votre conformité avec les modalités de la présente convention, Telenav vous concède par les présentes une licence personnelle, non exclusive et incessible (sauf comme il est expressément autorisé ci après dans le cadre de votre transfert permanent de la licence relative au logiciel Telenav), sans droit de sous-licence, aux fins d'accès au logiciel Telenav (sous forme de code objet seulement) et d'utilisation de celui-ci. Cette licence prend fin à la résiliation ou à l'expiration de la présente convention. Sauf si les lois applicables l'interdisent (ce qui peut comprendre celles de la province de Québec), Telenav peut résilier la licence à tout moment et sans motif. Vous vous engagez à utiliser le logiciel Telenav uniquement à des fins commerciales personnelles ou de loisir et non pour fournir des services de navigation commerciale à d'autres parties.
3.1 Restrictions relatives à la licence
Vous vous engagez à ne pas faire ce qui suit : a) désosser, décompiler, désassembler, traduire ou autrement modifier le logiciel Telenav ou une partie de celui ci; b) tenter de déterminer le code source, la sonothèque ou la structure du logiciel Telenav sans le consentement écrit exprès préalable de Telenav; c) retirer du logiciel Telenav ou modifier les marques de commerce, noms de marque, logos, avis de brevet ou de droit d'auteur ou autre avis ou indications de Telenav ou de ses fournisseurs; d) distribuer, concéder aux termes d'une sous-licence ou autrement transférer le logiciel Telenav à des tiers, sauf dans le cadre du transfert permanent du logiciel Telenav ou e) utiliser le logiciel Telenav d'une manière qui i) contrevient aux droits de propriété intellectuelle ou exclusifs, aux droits à la protection de la personnalité ou aux droits en matière de protection des renseignements personnels ou autres d'une partie, ii) viole une loi, une ordonnance ou un règlement, notamment les lois et les règlements relatifs au pollupostage, à la protection des renseignements personnels, à la protection des consommateurs et des enfants, aux obscénités ou à la diffamation ou iii) est dangereuse, menaçante, abusive, malveillante, délictuelle, diffamatoire, vulgaire, obscène, calomnieuse ou autrement répréhensible et f) consiste à louer le logiciel Telenav ou à autrement permettre un accès non autorisé à celui ci à des tiers sans l'autorisation écrite préalable de Telenav.
4. Dénégation de responsabilité
Sauf si les lois applicables l'interdisent (ce qui peut comprendre celles de la province de Québec), Telenav, ses concédants de licence et fournisseurs, GM ou encore les mandataires ou employés des personnes précitées ne seront en aucun cas tenus responsables d'une décision ou d'une mesure prise par vous ou un tiers sur le fondement de l'information fournie par le logiciel Telenav. Sauf si les lois applicables l'y obligent, Telenav et GM ne garantissent pas non plus ni ne conditionnent l'exactitude de la carte ou des autres données utilisées pour le logiciel Telenav. Il se pourrait que ces données ne reflètent pas toujours la réalité en raison, notamment, de fermeture de routes, de travaux de construction, de la température, de nouvelles routes et d'autres changements. Vous assumez entièrement le risque découlant de votre utilisation du logiciel Telenav. Par exemple, vous vous engagez notamment à ne pas vous fier au logiciel Telenav dans des situations critiques et des régions où votre bien-être ou votre survie ou celle d'autres personnes dépend de l'exactitude de la navigation, étant donné que les cartes ou la fonctionnalité du logiciel Telenav ne sont pas conçues pour soutenir ces applications à haut risque, plus particulièrement dans des régions géographiques plus éloignées.
SAUF SI LES LOIS APPLICABLES L'INTERDISENT (CE QUI PEUT COMPRENDRE CELLES DE LA PROVINCE DE QUÉBEC), TELENAV ET GM REJETTENT EXPRESSÉMENT TOUTE GARANTIE OU CONDITION RELATIVE AU LOGICIEL TELENAV, QU'ELLE SOIT PRÉVUE PAR LA LOI, EXPRESSE OU IMPLICITE, Y COMPRIS TOUTES LES GARANTIES OU CONDITIONS POUVANT DÉCOULER DE LA CONDUITE HABITUELLE, DE LA COUTUME OU DE L'USAGE COMMERCIAL, NOTAMMENT LES GARANTIES IMPLICITES DE QUALITÉ MARCHANDE, D'ADAPTATION À UN USAGE PARTICULIER ET DE NON-VIOLATION DES DROITS DE TIERS À L'ÉGARD DU LOGICIEL TELENAV. Certains territoires ne permettent pas l'exclusion de certaines garanties. Par conséquent, la présente limitation pourrait ne pas s'appliquer à vous.
5. Responsabilité limitée
SAUF SI LES LOIS APPLICABLES L'INTERDISENT (CE QUI PEUT COMPRENDRE CELLES DE LA PROVINCE DE QUÉBEC), TELENAV OU SES CONCÉDANTS DE LICENCE ET FOURNISSEURS OU GM NE SERONT EN AUCUN CAS TENUS RESPONSABLES ENVERS VOUS OU UN TIERS DE DOMMAGES INDIRECTS, ACCESSOIRES, CONSÉCUTIFS, SPÉCIAUX OU EXEMPLAIRES (Y COMPRIS, DANS CHAQUE CAS, NOTAMMENT, LES DOMMAGES EN CAS D'INCAPACITÉ D'UTILISER LE MATÉRIEL OU LES DONNÉES D'ACCÈS, LA PERTE DE DONNÉES, LES PERTES COMMERCIALES, LA PERTE DE PROFITS, L'INTERRUPTION DES ACTIVITÉS OU DES SITUATIONS SIMILAIRES) DÉCOULANT DE L'UTILISATION OU DE L'INCAPACITÉ D'UTILISER LE LOGICIEL TELENAV, ET CE, MÊME SI TELENAV A ÉTÉ AVISÉE DE LA POSSIBILITÉ DE TELS DOMMAGES.
SAUF SI LES LOIS APPLICABLES L'INTERDISENT (CE QUI PEUT COMPRENDRE CELLES DE LA PROVINCE DE QUÉBEC), MALGRÉ LES DOMMAGES QUE VOUS POURRIEZ SUBIR POUR QUELQUE RAISON QUE CE SOIT (NOTAMMENT TOUS LES DOMMAGES MENTIONNÉS DANS LES PRÉSENTES AINSI QUE L'ENSEMBLE DES DOMMAGES DIRECTS OU GÉNÉRAUX, CONTRACTUELS, DÉLICTUELS (NOTAMMENT PAR SUITE D'UNE NÉGLIGENCE) OU AUTRES), L'ENTIÈRE RESPONSABILITÉ DE TELENAV AINSI QUE DE L'ENSEMBLE DE SES FOURNISSEURS ET DE GM SE LIMITERA AU MONTANT RÉELLEMENT PAYÉ PAR VOUS POUR LE LOGICIEL TELENAV. CERTAINES PROVINCES OU CERTAINS ÉTATS ET/OU TERRITOIRES NE PERMETTENT PAS L'EXCLUSION OU LA LIMITATION DES DOMMAGES ACCESSOIRES OU CONSÉCUTIFS. PAR CONSÉQUENT, LES RESTRICTIONS OU EXCLUSIONS PRÉCITÉES POURRAIENT NE PAS S'APPLIQUER À VOUS.
6. Arbitrage et droit applicable
Sauf si vous êtes un résident du Canada, vous convenez que les différends, réclamations ou litiges découlant de la présente convention ou du logiciel Telenav doivent être réglés dans le cadre d'une procédure d'arbitrage indépendante effectuée par un arbitre neutre et administrée par l'American Arbitration Association du comté de Santa Clara, en Californie. L'arbitre appliquera les Commercial Arbitration Rules de l'American Arbitration Association, et la décision rendue par l'arbitre peut être entérinée par n'importe quel tribunal compétent. Il y a lieu de préciser qu'aucun juge ou jury ne participe à une procédure d'arbitrage et que la décision de l'arbitre lie les deux parties. Vous vous engagez expressément à renoncer à votre droit à un procès devant jury.
La présente convention et son exécution seront régies par les lois de l'État de la Californie et interprétées conformément à celles ci, sans égard aux dispositions en matière de conflits de lois. Si une mesure judiciaire doit être prise dans le cadre de la procédure d'arbitrage qui lie les parties, Telenav et vous vous engagez à vous en remettre à la compétence exclusive des tribunaux du comté de Santa Clara, en Californie. La Convention des Nations Unies sur les contrats de vente internationale de marchandises ne s'applique pas.
Malgré ce qui précède, si vous résidez au Canada, la présente convention est régie par les lois de la province ou du territoire dans lequel vous résidez au moment de la conclusion de la présente convention et les lois du Canada qui s'appliquent dans cette province ou ce territoire et elle doit être interprétée conformément à celles-ci. Toute poursuite intentée par Telenav ou vous doit être intentée exclusivement devant un tribunal compétent situé dans la province ou le territoire dans lequel vous résidez au moment de la conclusion de la présente convention.
7. Cession
Il vous est interdit de revendre, de céder ou de transférer la présente convention ou vos droits ou obligations, sauf en totalité, dans le cadre de votre transfert permanent du logiciel Telenav, et à la condition expresse que le nouvel utilisateur du logiciel Telenav s'engage à être lié par les modalités de la présente convention. Une vente ou cession ou un transfert qui n'est pas expressément autorisé aux termes du présent paragraphe entraînera la résiliation immédiate de la présente convention, sans responsabilité pour Telenav, auquel cas vous et les autres parties devez cesser immédiatement toute utilisation du logiciel Telenav.

Hasta el extremo en que una acción judicial  sea necesaria, con relación al arbitraje vinculante; ambas partes, Telenav y usted, convienen en sujetarse de forma exclusiva a la jurisdicción del condado de Santa Clara, California. No aplicará la Convención de las Naciones Unidas sobre Compraventa Internacional de Mercaderías.

Telenav Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy governs your use of certain services, product or websites offered by Telenav, Inc. ("Telenav"), including the Scout GPS application, Thinknear by Telenav, and the telenav.com and thinknear.com websites.  By using our services, products, websites, or otherwise by interacting with us, you consent to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Policy, please do not engage in any of these activities.
Telenav understands and respects your concerns about the use of your personally identifiable information, collected from you as a customer or visitor to our websites that identifies you as a specific person or entity ("Personal Information"). Personal Information may include name, telephone numbers including mobile telephone numbers, billing account number, Mobile Subscriber Identifier, Mobile Equipment Identifier, Network Address Identifier, IP address, and email addresses. Personal Information does not include anonymous or aggregate information, which after processing may not be associated with a specific person or entity. We believe that you should know what information about you we collect, as well as how that information is used, maintained, and, in some cases, shared. The following sets forth our privacy practices and policies, applicable to Telenav customers and visitors to the Telenav websites.
You acknowledge and understand that this Privacy Policy does not apply to our business partners or other companies that Telenav does not own or operate. For information on how other providers of products or services handle Personal Information you provide through other web sites or through the use of our services in conjunction with a third party, please consult their privacy policies.
INFORMATION COLLECTED ABOUT YOU AND OUR USE OF SUCH INFORMATION
The types of Personal Information and other information we may collect about you are primarily from three sources: (1) information you provide; (2) information automatically collected; and (3) information from other sources. How we use and maintain that information is described below.
1. Information You Provide
(a) Register/Information Related to Your Account
We may collect and store Personal Information about you when you register to become a customer of our services, and when you otherwise transmit such information to us via our applications, the internet (including partner websites) or by email. For instance, to maintain and/or verify your account we may collect and store in a database your name, nickname(s), mobile phone number, mobile phone model, wireless carrier, and in certain circumstances your email address, device ID/number, the last four digits of your credit card number, credit card holder's name, billing address, and credit card expiration date.
Where you have consented, we use your billing or PayPal account information for the purpose of billing you for certain of our services, and other services offered from within certain Telenav products, and with your permission, may store such information for future transactions. In certain versions of our applications, you may also be given the option to provide a profile photo.
When you choose to access one of our applications through a Facebook log-in, we collect your name, profile picture, email, Facebook password and your Facebook contacts list with your permission.  Your name will be displayed and stored within our application and your email and Facebook password will be stored to provide future access to our application. We may use this email to contact you regarding your account and/or to respond to any inquiry or feedback you submit from within our applications as described in section (b) below. If you want to revoke authorization for the application to interact with your Facebook account, you can sign out of Facebook from within the application's settings menu, remove the application from the list of permitted Apps, or turn off the Platform for Apps, Plugin and Websites from the Settings menu for your Facebook account.
When you choose to access one of our applications through a Google Sign in, we collect your email, basic profile information and Google password with your permission, which will be stored to provide future access to our application. We may use this email to contact you regarding your account and/or to respond to any inquiry or feedback you submit from within our applications as described in section (b) below. If you want to revoke authorization for the application to interact with your Google account, you can sign out of Google from within the application's settings menu.
We may also use the information that we collect about you to manage your account and provide you with customer support, perform research and analysis about your use of our products and services, to inform you from time to time by email, Short Messaging Service (SMS) message and/or within our application about products or services that we think will interest you, unless you inform us that you opt out from receiving such communications from within the email, SMS message or the application.  We may share the information we collect about you and your usage activity with our third party partners for the purpose of performing research and analysis about users of our products and services.
(b) Contact Our Customer Service Representatives/In-App Feedback
We may use your email address to contact you with regard to your account, such as to communicate that it is about to expire or to confirm any change to your phone number, and to respond to any inquiry or feedback you submit via our websites by email or from within any of our applications. You may opt-out of receiving such communications using the link provided within the email.
Additionally, if you provide feedback regarding a routing or map issue within one of our applications, we may share your comments and anonymized data about your location and route with the OpenStreetMap community for purposes of improving OpenStreetMap data.
(c) Accessing Our Services
When you use any of our services, including when you use a mobile device equipped with one of our applications, you will be asked to provide certain information. We may use your mobile phone number as your account number and if you consent may provide you with a verification code via SMS message. We may also assign you a separate and unique ID number as your account number. Your account number may be stored and used to manage your account and provide you with customer support, perform research and analysis about your use of our products and services, to inform you from time to time by email, SMS message and/or within our application about products or services that we think will interest you, unless you inform us that you opt out from receiving such communications from within the email, SMS message or the application.
Some of our applications also allow you to create a personal identification number (PIN), which we store in our database, for the purpose of you logging into your account. In some cases, this PIN is generated for you automatically on your wireless device, and cannot be altered.
Some of our applications also give you the option of providing us with your home and work addresses, which we store in our database, to enable you to access readily other features of our services.
On some versions of our applications you can also create a list of "favorite" addresses that can include your home and work addresses. We store these addresses in our database so that you can access them from your mobile device, and so that should you change devices, this collection of addresses will still be available to you.
(d) Third Party Applications
Some of Telenav's services provide you with access to third party applications. When you enable a third party application, information collected by Telenav is processed under our Privacy Policy while information collected by the third party application provider is governed by its own privacy policy.
(e) Promotions
When you participate in a Telenav promotion, such as a sweepstakes or contest, you may be asked to provide your name and email address, and possibly other information such as your mailing address and telephone number.
We store this information in our database and will use it to communicate with you about the promotion. We also may use your email address from time to time to inform you about our products and services that we think will interest you, unless you inform us that you opt out from receiving such communications using the link provided within the email.
(f) Request for Information
When you request additional information about one of our services either via one of our websites or via one of our partners through which our services are offered, such as a mobile telecommunications provider, information we collect through these requests include your name, nickname(s), phone number, and email address, and if you are seeking information on behalf of your company, the name of that company. We will use this information to provide you with details about our services, and we may use this information to promote our services to you in the future, unless you inform us that you opt out from receiving such communications using the link provided within the email you may receive or by contacting support@telenav.com. To understand what a partner of ours may do with information about you in the partner's custody, you should check the privacy policy of that partner.
(g) Public Forums
If you use or link to public forums such as social networking services, blogs on Telenav or non-Telenav websites, internet bulletin boards, or chat rooms, be aware that any Personal Information you submit can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, including to send you unsolicited messages. Telenav cannot prevent the distribution and use of such information by other parties.
(h) Other Submissions
We collect Personal Information about you when you submit survey responses, a job application or resume. Such information will be used only for the stated purposes.
2. Information Automatically Collected
We automatically receive certain types of information, some of which may be associated with Personal Information, when you visit our websites or use our products and services.
(a) Information Related to Your Location and Route or Other User Content
Each time you access the Telenav GPS Navigator™ or Scout® service or our partnered branded versions of our Navigator services, we record your location and route information, including your point of origin (which may be your then-current location), the address of your destination, the starting time of your trip, and the route you are instructed to follow. We record your current location when your wireless device requests a rerouting (which occurs, for example, when you deviate from the specified instructions). We maintain a database with these locations and route information, and may keep such information indefinitely to improve our map coverage and to provide other features that may enhance your service capabilities, functions, and your user experience. We may periodically receive your current location from the GPS hardware associated with your wireless device for the purpose of providing enhanced services, including traffic flow data. When your location, GPS heading and speed are used for these purposes, we strip it of your Personal Information, such as your phone number, prior to storing. We may share such location data in anonymized form with our third party partners performing research and analysis about traffic conditions and road segment usage.
When your mobile device's Location Services are being used by Scout or other third party applications or your mobile operating systems services, the Scout application may periodically collect and store data about your current location along with a non-personally identifiable version of your device ID to create an anonymous profile for advertising purposes.  This profile may be shared with third parties for advertising purposes. For additional information about this data usage and how to opt-out, please see below regarding geohistorical-based and interest-based advertising. Additionally, this location data may also be used by us for anonymous traffic flow data or floating car data.
When you choose to use your current GPS location for specifying the locale for a business finder search, or obtaining a map, we use your location information for the requested purpose, and then discard it. We anonymously record any search activities and results for comparative analysis. Further, we anonymously record transactions for the purpose of paying directory listing and mapping data providers.
Some versions of our applications include a location and information sharing feature that enables you to share your location or other information with another party. These location exchanges are transmitted within the application or via the internet or text messages using SMS. For example, when you create, join, or navigate to a Meet Up with the Scout application, your name, profile photo, current location and/or ETA at the Meet Up location will be displayed on a map visible by other Meet Up participants.  The Meet Up and your location and/or ETA will be removed from the map visible to other participants when you delete the Meet Up.  We record these location exchanges, and may keep such information indefinitely. Also, if you set up a Notification within the app, the phone numbers you provide will be automatically notified via SMS message each time you arrive at or depart from the location you select. You can turn off a Notification from within the application's settings menu.
Additionally, in some versions of our applications, you can allow our application to access the data stored in the address book and/or calendar on your mobile device. Our applications may use data from your address book or for your Facebook or Google+ contacts (if you signed in with a Facebook  or Google+ sign-in)   to allow you to search for and navigate to the addresses of your contacts, chat with your contacts within the application, or create a Meet Up within the application. Our applications may use calendar entry data to provide you with reminders about upcoming appointments and to provide navigation to the locations of your appointments. We will only access this data if you have given permissions for a particular Telenav application to do so, and you can revoke such permissions at any time by changing the settings on your mobile device.
When you access Telenav map and data services through a third party application, we receive and store your location information from your device along with any address or point of interest search requests along with associated destination location information.  We maintain a database with locations and search information, and may keep such information indefinitely to improve our map coverage and to provide other features that may enhance your service capabilities, functions, and your user experience. Such data does not contain any Personal Information, such as your phone number.
(b) Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technologies on our Websites

We may employ browser cookies or similar technologies to identify the computer, mobile device, or some of our services and record your preferences and other data. We use cookies or similar technologies to evaluate how our websites, devices or applications are used and to provide continuous improvement to our services, make recommendations, and complete transactions you request. Cookies may be stored locally on mobile devices or on computer servers operated or controlled by Telenav. We may use a tracking pixel, agent or other visitor identification technology that collects anonymous data about your use of some of our services. We may also use Web beacons, also known as Web bugs, which are mostly invisible small graphic images (1-by-1 pixel), in the same color as the background of the web page or an HTML email, to monitor interaction with our websites or emails. In addition, when you visit our website our systems automatically collect your IP address and the type of browser that you use. When you browse our websites our systems log the Telenav web pages that you visit. Server log files are records of activity automatically created by the server and stored. If we combine or link cookie or Web beacons with Personal Information, we will treat the combined or linked information as Personal Information under this policy. We may employ third-parties to place advertisements about our products and services on other web sites. The use of cookies, Web beacons or other similar technologies by such third parties is governed by their privacy policies.
You may limit the automatic collection of certain information through the use of cookies by our websites by disabling the cookies using your browser options. Please be aware that disabling cookies may prevent you from using specific features on our websites, such as ordering services, or maintaining an online account.
Our websites may collect data about your activity and some user identifying information, including Personal Information. This collected information is disclosed to and processed by Google and is used to enable features including but not limited to remarketing and display advertising. We use remarketing, display retargeting and search retargeting with Google Adwords to advertise online and third party vendors, including but not limited to Google, show our ads on sites across the Internet. We also use Google Analytics to optimize our websites. Telenav and third-party vendors, including but not limited to Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads about our products and services based on your past visits to our website or your search history. These features are solely for purposes to allow us to maintain the interests of previous visitors and deliver advertisement content specifically targeting the visitors' previous interests and searches. You may opt-out of such advertising using the Google Ads Preference Manager or obtain additional information available about Google's Remarketing Privacy Guidelines, Policies, and Restrictions and how Google uses data when you use their partners' sites or apps.
Additionally, in connection with our thinknear.com website we use a marketing automation tool called Hubspot® to handle various marketing tasks, for example but not limited to, contacting visitors to thinknear.com who provided their contact information and requested additional information. HubSpot's software uses cookies to track thinknear.com visitors and contacts. You can read more about Hubspot's Privacy Policy and opt-out options here.
Also note that we do not have a system to comply with Do Not Track requests at this time, unless required by applicable laws or regulations.
(c) Information related to your personal interests for particular advertisements
When you search for a Point of Interest or address within our Scout applicatios or our partnered branded navigation applications, we may share your search and location data with our third party partners in order to provide you with more relevant advertisement results within the application. The information we share is de-identified so that it does not contain any Personal Information, such as your name, phone number or email address.
When Thinknear by Telenav has the opportunity to serve an ad to you on a third party mobile site or mobile application or within the Scout application, we may receive information about your device, including GPS location data or other precise location data from third party ad exchanges and/or mobile publishers, including the Scout application.  The device and location data collected from users of the Scout application may be shared with third party ad exchanges. This information does not contain Personal Information and does enable us to personally identify you by name, phone number, email address, or other similar means, but may include your device ID, your IP address and the geo-location of your device at the time. This information is provided so that we can improve the relevance of the ads served to you. Any such information is shared in accordance with the third party's privacy policies and subject to their terms and conditions. We do not use such information for any purpose other than serving you with interest-based ads on behalf of advertising partners. If you would like to opt out of the use and/or sharing of such data for interest-based advertising, please contact us at support@telenav.com or click here and follow the instructions provided.
We may also obtain Precise Location Data from your use of Telenav applications (and certain other third party location based applications and use that location data) about your "geohistory", which is the geo-location of your mobile device over time along with a de-identified version of your device ID to create a profile.  Additionally, in order to create a profile, we may use data about your location and online activity and interests, including things like real-world category types you visited (e.g. Shopping Mall), mobile apps with which you engage, information collected by our inventory partners and other third parties and shared with us.  This will involve the use of your de-identified device ID and will not include any Personal Information, such as your name, phone number, or email address.
If you would like to opt out of the use of data for geohistorical-based and interest-based advertising by Thinknear by Telenav, please contact us at support@telenav.com or click here and follow the instructions provided.
Our third-party service providers may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites, mobile websites and/or mobile applications across your various devices, in order to provide content and advertisements about goods and services of interest to you across those various devices.

(d) Other Information
When you use the voice command or entry features on our services, we record your audible utterance (what you said). We collect utterances from our entire subscriber population, organize them by what was said, and then use this information to adjust speech recognition performance parameters to improve accuracy.
We will also collect information relating to your use of and the performance of our applications, including the state of your device at the time of an error or issue with the application, and such information is disclosed to and processed by third party providers, including but not limited to Crashlytics, for purposes of collecting information about errors or issues within our applications so we may improve our applications.
We may retain any data you provide to us in an email inquiry, for the purpose of tracking the types of questions we receive.
3. Information From Other Sources
We may obtain information about you from outside sources and add to it or combine it with your Personal Information. For example, we may request credit information when you initially subscribe for service, collect demographic and marketing data about you from third parties for marketing research and analysis to improve our products/services, obtain updated address information from our shippers, or collect information from other vendors that promote and distribute our products through their own brands.
WHEN YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE SHARED OR DISCLOSED
Telenav does not sell, rent, license or otherwise share information with unaffiliated parties except as explained in this Privacy Policy.
Consent Given/Transaction Processing
We may disclose Personal Information about you to third parties with your consent. Consent is sometimes implicit, as in the disclosure of Personal Information to third-parties who complete transactions or perform services on our behalf.
If you do not want us to share your Personal Information with these companies, you may contact us at: support@telenav.com.
To the Primary Account Holder
We may disclose Personal Information of an account user to the primary account holder (the party financially responsible for the account). If a business, governmental agency, or other individual obtains service for you, that entity or individual is our customer, and we may provide Personal Information about you, or your use of the service to them or others at their direction.
Third Party Services or Third Party Service Providers
Telenav offers access to a variety of resources, including but not limited to various communication tools, search services, forums, and links to other World Wide Web sites in providing its services, products and websites. We may make certain Personal Information non-personal and share it or aggregated data with strategic partners that work with us to analyze usage, provide and improve products or services, or that help us market to customers, or for similar purposes. Information that is not Personal Information or is aggregated is not subject to any restrictions of use or disclosure under this Privacy Policy.
If you take advantage of a third party's services or products offered through the use of our services, we may disclose your Personal Information to such unaffiliated third parties. These entities may use this information that you provide in the course of your use of Telenav's services (including your name, nicknames, telephone numbers, audio files, and email and mailing addresses) to promote their products and services to you. Any such Personal Information that a third party uses will be subject to their applicable privacy policies.
Some of our services and functionality are provided in conjunction with third party service providers. These third party service providers process Personal Information on our behalf and are obligated to process such information in compliance with this Privacy Policy and other appropriate security and confidentiality measures. In cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU individuals received pursuant to the EU-US or Swiss-EU Privacy Shield, Telenav is potentially liable.
Legal Processes
We will comply with any subpoenas, court orders or other legal processes for any of the information about you in our possession, and we may use such information to establish or exercise yours, ours, or others' legal rights, or to defend against legal claims. We also may be required to disclose Personal Information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
Business Transfers
Information about you in our possession may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another provider, as well as in the unlikely event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which your Personal Information would be transferred as one of the business assets of the company. Telenav does not guarantee that any entity receiving such information in connection with one of these transactions will comply with all terms of this policy.
European Union Users
Information that we collect about you may also be transferred among our various divisions and affiliated companies around the world, which may involve transfer from countries within the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland to countries outside the EEA. By allowing Telenav to collect this information about you, you consent to these transfers, including transborder transmission of data covered by this Privacy Policy. As a result, that country's courts, governments or law enforcement agencies could obtain disclosure of such information under that country's laws.
Telenav complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss – U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States, respectively.  Telenav has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability.  If there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.
INFORMATION ON WIRELESS DEVICES
The Telenav software (and any upgrades, modifications, or additions thereto) that is factory installed or downloaded to, and resides upon your wireless device retains your manually entered account number and PIN, or reads it from the device. Having your carrier change the assigned phone number for your wireless device does not change the account number we maintain with regard to that device, which will result in your device not being able to access your Telenav account established using the previous phone number. If this happens, please contact Telenav customer care.
SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
Telenav has implemented various physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of Personal Information under our control. For instance, Telenav limits access to Telenav systems that store such information to authorized personnel. Telenav also employs the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to protect your Personal Information when you bill on our website.

Telenav Warranty and Refunds Policy
Telenav Hardware Warranties and Refunds
Telenav Bluetooth® GPS Receivers One-Year Limited Warranty 
Telenav, Inc. warrants this Telenav Bluetooth® GPS receiver against defects in material and workmanship under normal use and service for a period of one (1) year from the date of purchase by the original purchaser. This warranty is extended only to the original purchaser.
If a defect in a receiver arises and a valid claim is received by Telenav within the one-year warranty period, Telenav will, at its option, either (1) exchange the receiver with another receiver, or (2) refund the purchase price of the receiver. When a receiver is exchanged, any replacement item becomes your property and the replaced item becomes Telenav’s property. When a refund is given, the receiver for which the refund is provided must be returned to Telenav and becomes Telenav’s property.
Telenav is not responsible for your shipping and other costs to return the receiver to Telenav or its authorized representative.
This warranty does not apply to: 

Damage or loss which occurs during shipment. 
Damage caused by accident, abuse, misuse, flood, fire, earthquake or other external causes. 
Damage caused by operating the product outside the permitted or intended uses described by Telenav. 
Damage caused by service performed by anyone who is not a representative of Telenav. 
Consumable parts, such as batteries, unless damage has occurred due to a defect in materials or workmanship. 

This warranty also does not apply to any item other than the receiver. Specifically, this warranty does not cover any of the accessories shipped with your receiver, including the plug-in wall charger, the plug-in car charger, the USB cable, and the installation CD. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THIS WARRANTY AND REMEDIES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE EXCLUSIVE AND IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, REMEDIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, STATUTORY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. AS PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, TELENAV SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL STATUTORY OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. IF TELENAV CANNOT LAWFULLY DISCLAIM STATUTORY OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES THEN TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ALL SUCH WARRANTIES SHALL BE LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE DURATION OF THIS EXPRESS WARRANTY AND TO REPLACEMENT SERVICE AS DETERMINED BY TELENAV IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION. 
No Telenav reseller, agent, or employee is authorized to make any modification, extension, or addition to this warranty. Some States do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, and some States do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so one or more of the above limitations may not apply to you. 
This warranty gives you specific legal rights. You may have other rights which vary from state to state. 
How to Obtain Warranty Service
To obtain service under this warranty, call Telenav at 1-88-Telenav-4 (1-888-353-6284). You will be asked for your email address for Telenav to send you a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) number and details for returning the receiver to Telenav. Alternatively, you may receive this information verbally over the phone. The receiver must be returned in the original packaging with (i) a copy of the email from Telenav identifying your RMA number, or some other writing specifying your RMA number, and (ii) proof of purchase in the form of a copy of your original receipt. (You may keep the receiver’s activation code and the installation CD.) 
Telenav Refund Policy
Telenav GPS Navigator™
Use of the Telenav GPS Navigator service (the “Telenav Service”) requires payment of a monthly fee, which includes downloads to your wireless device of the Telenav GPS Navigator software and any upgrades, modifications, or additions thereto, but does not include any hardware that may be required for certain wireless devices (such as a GPS receiver).



    
Telenav will not refund any payments for the Telenav Service or any necessary hardware made directly to a cellular carrier (e.g., Sprint Nextel, AT&T, etc.) or otherwise not directly made to Telenav. Check with your cellular carrier for its policy on refunds of such payments.
If you pay for the Telenav Service or for any necessary hardware through a credit card at www.telenav.com or through a direct billing arrangement with Telenav, then you or Telenav may cancel your account at any time subject to the following policies: 

If you or Telenav cancel your account within the first 30 days of activation, all charges for the Telenav Service (and any hardware purchased from Telenav that you return per Telenav’s hardware return policy and procedures) will be credited back to your credit card or otherwise refunded to you, unless your account is cancelled by Telenav for cause.
For any payments for the “Telenav GPS Kit Promotion” (a free GPS receiver kit with a two-year service plan commitment), if you or Telenav cancel your account within the first 30 days and you return all hardware in the GPS receiver kit, all charges will be credited back to your credit card or otherwise refunded to you, unless your account is cancelled by Telenav for cause. Beyond the initial 30-day period, the GPS receiver kit is no longer returnable and any charges assessed for the Telenav Service are not refundable. 
If you or Telenav cancel your account at any time after the first 30 days, Telenav will discontinue charging your credit card for your monthly service fee or otherwise cease assessing charges under your direct billing arrangement, but will not refund any amounts for the current or previous months of service and will not provide a refund for any hardware purchased from Telenav. In addition, Telenav will not refund any amount of prepaid service. For example, if you purchased twelve (12) months of prepaid service and cancel your account after three (3) months, there will be no refund of any amount to you on your account. 
You will not be provided a refund for any month for which you were not charged for the Telenav Service (i.e., as a result of any free usage or other promotion). 

Telenav Shotgun™
If you pay for the Telenav Shotgun (“Shotgun”) through a credit card payment at www.telenav.com or through a direct billing arrangement with Telenav, then you may request a refund within the first 30 days after the date of purchase. Upon Telenav’s receipt of the Shotgun unit from you per the terms of this policy, the purchase price you paid for the Shotgun unit will be credited back to your credit card or otherwise refunded to you, along with any applicable sales tax. No refund will be made for any shipping or handling charges. The Shotgun unit for which the refund is provided must be returned to Telenav and becomes Telenav’s property.
Telenav is not responsible for your shipping and other costs to return the Shotgun to Telenav or its authorized representative.
To request a refund, call Telenav at 1-88-Telenav-8 (1-888-353-6288). You will be asked for your email address for Telenav to send you a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) number and details for returning the Shotgun unit to Telenav. Alternatively, you may receive this information verbally over the phone. The Shotgun unit must be returned in the original packaging including all original accessories and with (i) a copy of the email from Telenav identifying your RMA number, or some other writing specifying your RMA number, and (ii) proof of purchase in the form of a copy of your original receipt. The Shotgun unit and all original accessories must be in good physical and operational condition; damaged product will not be accepted for return. Telenav must receive your return of the Shotgun unit per the terms of this return policy within ten (10) days from the date the RMA number is provided to you. Failure to return the Shotgun unit in this timeframe, or otherwise not in compliance with the terms herein, will invalidate your RMA.
Telenav Connected Service™
Use of the Telenav Connected Service (“TCS”) which includes downloads to your wireless device of selected upgrades, modifications, or additions to TCS, requires payment of a monthly fee.
If you pay for TCS through a credit card payment at www.telenav.com or through a direct billing arrangement with Telenav, then you or Telenav may cancel your account at any time subject to the following policies:

The first 3 months of TCS is free with your purchase of a Telenav Shotgun unit, and begins from the date of first TCS activation. If you or Telenav cancel TCS within the first 30 days of first TCS activation, all charges for TCS (and the Shotgun unit purchased from Telenav that you return per Telenav’s Shotgun return policy and procedures) will be credited back to your credit card or otherwise refunded to you, unless your TCS is cancelled by Telenav for cause.
If you or Telenav cancel TCS at any time after the first 30 days of first TCS activation, Telenav will discontinue charging your credit card for your monthly service fee or otherwise cease assessing charges under your direct billing arrangement, but will not refund any amounts for the current or previous months of service and will not provide a refund for any hardware purchased from Telenav. In addition, Telenav will not refund any amount of prepaid service. For example, if you purchased twelve (12) months of prepaid service and cancel your account after three (3) months, there will be no refund of any amount to you on your account.
You will not be provided a refund for any month for which you were not charged for TCS (i.e., as a result of any free usage period or other promotion). Should you or Telenav choose to cancel TCS for any reason, you shall not be entitled to any refund of or reduction in the price of the Shotgun unit (except as expressly provided under Telenav’s Shotgun return policy and procedures).

en
fr
es

This Privacy Policy governs your use of Navigation and/or NavConnect service offered by Telenav, Inc. ("Telenav") for select automotive vehicles produced or distributed by General Motors Holdings LLC or its affiliates ("GM").  In order to provide you with navigation and related services we collect and store certain information relating to your account, your location, and your use of the navigation services.  Please review this Privacy Policy for more detail about the information that may be collected and used in connection with your use of Navigation, NavConnect, and NavConnect with Predictive Navigation. By using these products or otherwise by interacting with us, you consent to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Policy, please do not engage in any of these activities.
Telenav understands and respects your concerns about the use of your personally identifiable information, collected from you as a user of Navigation and/or NavConnect ("Personal Information"). Personal Information includes name, home address, telephone numbers including mobile telephone numbers, email addresses, and VIN numbers. Personal Information does not include anonymous or aggregate information, which after processing cannot be associated with a specific person or entity. We believe that you should know what information about you we collect, as well as how that information is used, maintained, and, in some cases, shared. The following sets forth our privacy practices and policies, applicable to Navigation and/or NavConnect users.
You acknowledge and understand that this Privacy Policy does not apply to other Telenav products or services, our business partners or other companies that Telenav does not own or operate. For information about other Telenav products and services as well as the Telenav.com website, please visit http://www.telenav.com/legal/policies. For information on how other providers of products or services handle personal information you provide through other web sites or through the use of our services in conjunction with a third party, please consult their privacy policies.
INFORMATION COLLECTED ABOUT YOU AND OUR USE OF SUCH INFORMATION
The types of personal and other information we may collect about you are primarily from three sources: (1) information you provide; (2) information automatically collected; and (3) information from other sources. How we use and maintain that information is described below.
1. Information You Provide
(a) Register/Information Related to Your Account
We receive and store Personal Information about you when you authorize our business partners to share that information with us for use with Navigation and/or NavConnect or login to Navigation and/or NavConnect using your information, and when you otherwise transmit such information to us via Navigation and/or NavConnect, or contact us by phone or email regarding our products and services. For instance, to maintain and/or verify your account we may receive certain account information from other of your accounts, with your consent, including your name, email address, vehicle information and whether your NavConnect subscription is active. We may also assign you a separate and unique Telenav ID number, which may be stored and used to manage your account and provide you with customer support, and perform research and analysis about your use of our products and services.
Through GM, Navigation and/or NavConnect, you have the option of providing us with your home and work addresses, which we store in our database, to enable you to quickly navigate to those destinations and readily access other features of Navigation and/or NavConnect. Through Navigation or NavConnect you can also create a list of "favorite" addresses and points of interest. Within Navigation and/or NavConnect you also have the option to use Navigation and/or NavConnect settings menu to customize your experience, for example by selecting your navigation preferences, setting up traffic reports, and selecting your preferred gas grade for searches. For NavConnect subscribers, we store these addresses and setting preferences in our cloud database so that you can access them from Navigation and/or NavConnect. For Navigation users, this information is stored locally on the navigation system in your vehicle.
We may also use the information that we collect about you to manage your account and provide you with customer support, perform research and analysis about your use of our products and services, to inform you from time to time within Navigation and/or NavConnect about products or services that we think may interest you, unless you inform us that you opt out from receiving such communications.  We may share certain information we collect about you and your usage activity with GM on a non-identifiable basis for the purpose of performing research and analysis about users of its products and services.
(b) Contact Our Customer Service Representatives/ Feedback
GM may use your email address or phone number to contact you with regard to Navigation or your NavConnect subscription, such as to communicate that it is about to expire or to respond to any inquiry or feedback you submit with GM Customer Service Representatives, by email or from within Navigation and/or NavConnect.
If you provide feedback regarding a routing or map issue, we may share your comments and anonymized location data with our third party map provider.
(c) Request for Information
When you request additional information about Navigation or NavConnect, the information collected through these requests may include your name, phone number, and email address. We will use this information to provide you with details about these services, and in accordance with requirements under applicable law, we may use this information to promote our services to you in the future, unless you inform us that you opt out from receiving such communications.
(d) Public Forums
If you use or link to public forums such as social networking services, blogs on Telenav or non-Telenav websites, internet bulletin boards, or chat rooms, be aware that any personal information you submit can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, including to send you unsolicited messages. Telenav cannot prevent the distribution and use of such information by other parties.
2. Information Automatically Collected
We automatically receive certain types of information, some of which may be associated with Personal Information, when you use Navigation and/or NavConnect.
(a) Information Related to Your Location and Route or Other User Content
Each time you access Navigation, we record your location, search and route information, including your point of origin or current location, the address of your destination, the starting time of your trip, and the route you are instructed to follow. When you are in an active Navigation session, we periodically record your current location, data from your vehicle's sensors, and GPS heading and speed from the GPS hardware associated with your vehicle in order to provide you with your route. Navigation will save and display your most recent destinations to allow you to easily navigate to these destinations again.
When you choose to use your current location for specifying the locale for a business finder search, or obtaining a map, we use your location information for the requested purpose, and then discard it. We anonymously record any search activities and results for comparative analysis.
For NavConnect users with an active subscription who have opted-in to use Connectivity, this location and route information will be stored in our secure cloud database, where we may keep such information for up to five years to improve our services and to provide other features that may enhance your service capabilities, functions, and your user experience.  For NavConnect users, other address data, including home and work addresses, favorite places, and recent destinations will also be stored with your account information in our secure cloud database until your account is deleted.
For NavConnect users who have enabled the Predictive Navigation functionality, we will regularly receive and record location data from your vehicle's GPS hardware, whenever you are operating your vehicle.  This data will be stored in our secured cloud database and we will use such information to customize and improve your navigation and search experience, for example to provide preferred brand point of interest search results, personalized routing, and commute alerts.
You can update your Predictive Navigation options (including disabling Predictive Navigation) at any time by accessing the Navigation Settings menu.
(b) Information About Your Vehicle Systems
We may receive and store limited vehicle data from the vehicle systems, for example, ambient temperature, seat sensors on/off, and ignition on/off, which may be used to optimize the safety functionality of Navigation.  For Navigation-only users, this data will be stored indefinitely in your Navigation system's local memory.  For NavConnect users with an active subscription, this data will be stored in our secure cloud database for up to five years from the date of collection.
(c) Information About Your Use of Navigation Services
When you use Navigation and/or NavConnect, we log certain information relating to your use of Navigation and/or NavConnect and the Navigation performance. For example, we may collect data about what actions you take within a session, such as the type of search you performed or what kind of route you selected.
(d) Other Information
When you use the voice command or entry features on our services, we receive the text transcription from your audible utterance (what you said) and that text data may be stored for up to five years.
WHEN YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE SHARED OR DISCLOSED
Telenav does not sell, rent, license or otherwise share information relating to your use of Navigation or NavConnect with unaffiliated parties except as explained in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required or permitted by applicable law.
Consent Given/Transaction Processing
We may disclose Personal Information about you to third parties who complete transactions or perform services on our behalf.  Your use of the Navigation and/or NavConnect may constitute consent to such disclosure.
Third Party Services or Third Party Service Providers
Telenav may make certain Personally Information non-personal and share it or anonymous, aggregated data with strategic partners that work with us to analyze usage, provide and improve products or services, or that help us market to customers, or for similar purposes. Information that is not personally identifiable or is aggregated is not subject to any restrictions of use or disclosure under this Privacy Policy.
Some of the Navigation and NavConnect services and functionality are provided by or in conjunction with third party service providers. These third party service providers process Personal Information on our behalf and are obligated to process such information in compliance with this Privacy Policy and other appropriate security and confidentiality measures. Our service providers are given the information they need to perform their designated functions, and we do not authorize them to use or disclose personal information for their own marketing or other purposes. Personal information may be maintained and processed by us, our affiliates and other third party service providers in the US or other jurisdictions. In cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU individuals received pursuant to the EU-US Privacy Shield, Telenav is potentially liable.
Legal Processes
We, our affiliates and service providers will comply with any applicable subpoenas, court orders or other legal processes for information about you in our possession, and we may use and disclose Personal Information to establish or exercise yours, ours, or others' legal rights, or to defend against legal claims. We also may be required to disclose Personal Information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
Business Transfers
Information about you in our possession may be disclosed as part of a prospective or completed merger, acquisition, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another provider, as well as in the unlikely event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which your personal information would be transferred as one of the business assets of the company. Telenav does not guarantee that any entity receiving such information in connection with one of these transactions will comply with all terms of this policy.
European Union Users
Information that we collect about you may also be transferred among our various divisions and affiliated companies around the world, which may involve transfer from countries within the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland to countries outside the EEA. By allowing Telenav to collect this information about you, you consent to these transfers, including transborder transmission of data covered by this privacy policy. As a result, that country's courts, governments or law enforcement agencies could obtain disclosure of such information under that country's laws.
Telenav complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries.  Telenav has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability.

Telenav has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.  If there is any conflict between the policies in this privacy policy and the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles, the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles shall govern.

SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
Telenav has implemented various physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in an effort to protect the confidentiality and security of personal information in our custody and under our control. For instance, Telenav limits access to Telenav systems that store such information to authorized personnel.
While Telenav maintains a multitude of security measures to prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of your Personal Information, no security measures are absolute or wholly guaranteed. Telenav will make reasonable attempts to notify you if it determines there were unauthorized acts by third parties that violate the law or this policy, or other security breaches, or where otherwise required by law.
Telenav will maintain your Personal Information for as long as a business need exists, or as required by applicable laws, regulations, or government orders. When we dispose of Personal Information, we use commercially reasonable procedures to erase, anonymize or render it unreadable.
CHILDREN'S PRIVACY
Telenav will not knowingly request or collect Personal Information from any person under 13 years of age without prior verifiable parental or legal guardian consent. If, however, you authorize a child to use our services or products by providing them access to a vehicle or device with access to Navigation, NavConnect and/or other Telenav services or products, any Personal Information associated with such use will be treated as your information in accordance with this policy. Telenav encourages parents to be involved in the online activities (including wireless Internet browsing) of their children to ensure that no information is collected from a child without parental or Guardian consent.

Afin de vous fournir des services de navigation et des services connexes, nous recueillons et stockons certains renseignements relatifs à votre compte, à votre localisation et à votre utilisation des services de navigation. Veuillez lire la présente politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels pour obtenir des détails supplémentaires au sujet des renseignements qui pourraient être recueillis et utilisés dans le cadre de votre utilisation de Navigation, de NavConnect et de NavConnect avec Predictive Navigation. En utilisant ces produits ou en interagissant autrement avec nous, vous indiquez être d'accord avec la présente politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels.

Telenav comprend et respecte vos préoccupations au sujet de l'utilisation des renseignements permettant de vous identifier qui sont recueillis à votre sujet en tant qu'utilisateur de Navigation et/ou de NavConnect (les « renseignements personnels »). Les renseignements personnels comprennent le nom, l'adresse domiciliaire, les numéros de téléphone, y compris les numéros de téléphone cellulaire, adresses électroniques et numéros d'identification de véhicule. Les renseignements personnels ne comprennent pas les renseignements anonymes ou regroupés qui, une fois traités, ne peuvent être associés à une personne ou à une entité en particulier. Nous estimons que vous devriez savoir quel type de renseignements nous recueillons et comment ces renseignements sont utilisés, conservés et, dans certains cas, partagés. Nos pratiques et politiques en matière de protection des renseignements personnels applicables aux utilisateurs de Navigation et/ou de NavConnect sont décrites ci après.
Vous comprenez que la présente politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels ne s'applique pas à d'autres produits ou services de Telenav, à nos partenaires commerciaux et à d'autres sociétés dont Telenav n'a pas la propriété ou qu'elle n'exploite pas. Pour obtenir des renseignements au sujet d'autres produits et services de Telenav ainsi que sur le site Web Telenav.com, veuillez visiter http://www.telenav.com/legal/policies.

RENSEIGNEMENTS RECUEILLIS À VOTRE SUJET ET MANIÈRE DONT NOUS LES UTILISONS
Le type de renseignements personnels et d'autres renseignements que nous pourrions recueillir à votre sujet proviennent principalement de trois sources : 1) l'information que vous fournissez; 2) l'information qui est recueillie automatiquement et 3) l'information provenant d'autres sources. La manière dont nous utilisons et conservons cette information est décrite ci après.
1. Information que vous fournissez
a) Inscription/information liée à votre compte
Nous recevons et stockons des renseignements personnels à votre sujet lorsque vous autorisez nos partenaires commerciaux à partager cette information avec nous aux fins d'utilisation avec Navigation et/ou NavConnect ou que vous vous connectez à Navigation et/ou à NavConnect à l'aide de vos renseignements, et lorsque vous nous transmettez autrement cette information par l'intermédiaire de Navigation et/ou de NavConnect ou que vous communiquez avec nous par téléphone ou par courriel au sujet de nos produits et services. Par exemple, aux fins de la tenue et/ou de la vérification de votre compte, nous pourrions recevoir certains renseignements sur le compte provenant de certains autres de vos comptes, avec votre consentement, notamment votre nom, votre adresse électronique, des renseignements sur votre véhicule et si votre abonnement à NavConnect est actif. Nous pourrions également vous attribuer un numéro d'identification Telenav distinct et unique, qui pourrait être stocké et utilisé aux fins de gestion de votre compte et pour vous fournir le service de soutien à la clientèle ainsi qu'effectuer des recherches et analyses au sujet de votre utilisation de nos produits et services.
Par l'intermédiaire de GM, de Navigation et/ou de NavConnect, vous avez la possibilité de nous fournir vos adresses à domicile et au travail, que nous stockons dans notre base de données, pour vous permettre de naviguer rapidement vers ces destinations et d'accéder facilement à d'autres fonctionnalités de Navigation et/ou de NavConnect.

À l'égard des abonnés à NavConnect, nous stockons ces adresses et préférences de paramètres dans nos serveurs de bases de données de sorte qu'ils puissent y accéder à partir de Navigation et/ou de NavConnect. En ce qui concerne les utilisateurs de Navigation, cette information est stockée localement sur le système de navigation situé dans votre véhicule.
Nous pourrions également utiliser l'information que nous recueillons auprès de vous pour gérer votre compte et vous fournir un soutien à la clientèle, effectuer des recherches et des analyses à propos de votre utilisation de nos produits et services, vous informer à l'occasion à l'aide de Navigation et/ou de NavConnect des produits ou services qui, selon nous, pourraient vous intéresser, sauf si vous nous indiquez ne plus vouloir recevoir ces communications.

2. Information recueillie automatiquement
Nous recevons automatiquement certains types de renseignements, dont certains peuvent être associés à des renseignements personnels, lorsque vous utilisez Navigation et/ou NavConnect.

Chaque fois que vous accédez à Navigation, nous enregistrons votre localisation, vos recherches et vos itinéraires, y compris votre point d'origine ou localisation actuelle, l'adresse de votre destination, l'heure du début de votre déplacement et l'itinéraire qu'on vous a indiqué de suivre.

c) Information au sujet de votre utilisation des services de Navigation
Lorsque vous utilisez Navigation et/ou NavConnect, nous stockons certains renseignements au sujet de votre utilisation de Navigation et/ou de NavConnect et du rendement de Navigation.

Telenav ne vend pas ni ne loue, ne concède sous licence ou ne partage autrement les renseignements concernant votre utilisation de Navigation ou de NavConnect avec des parties qui ne sont pas membres de son groupe, sauf comme il est indiqué dans la présente politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels ou comme les lois applicables l'exigent ou l'autorisent.
Consentements donnés/traitement d'opérations
Nous pourrions communiquer des renseignements personnels à votre sujet à des tiers qui effectuent des opérations ou fournissent des services pour notre compte. Votre utilisation de Navigation et/ou de NavConnect peut constituer un consentement à la communication de tels renseignements.
Services de tiers ou fournisseurs de services tiers
Telenav peut rendre certains renseignements personnels non personnels et les partager ou partager des données regroupées anonymes avec des partenaires stratégiques qui travaillent avec nous pour analyser l'utilisation de produits ou services ainsi que fournir et améliorer des produits ou services ou qui nous aident à commercialiser des produits ou services auprès de clients, ou à des fins similaires. Les renseignements qui ne permettent pas d'identifier une personne ou qui sont regroupés ne sont assujettis à aucune restriction d'utilisation ou de communication en vertu de la présente politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels.
Certains des services et fonctionnalités de Navigation et de NavConnect sont fournis par ou conjointement avec des fournisseurs de services tiers. Ces fournisseurs de services tiers traitent les renseignements personnels pour notre compte et sont tenus de le faire en conformité avec la présente politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels et d'autres mesures appropriées en matière de sécurité et de confidentialité. Nos fournisseurs de services obtiennent l'information dont ils ont besoin pour s'acquitter de leurs fonctions désignées, et nous ne les autorisons pas à utiliser ou à communiquer des renseignements personnels aux fins de commercialisation ou à d'autres fins personnelles. Nous, les membres de notre groupe ou d'autres fournisseurs de services tiers aux États Unis ou dans d'autres territoires pouvons tenir et traiter les renseignements personnels. En cas de transfert ultérieur à des tiers de données concernant des personnes de l'UE reçues en vertu du « Bouclier de confidentialité UE-US » (UE-US Privacy Shield), Telenav est potentiellement responsable.
Procédures judiciaires
Nous, les membres de notre groupe et nos fournisseurs de services canadiens, américains et autres nous conformerons aux assignations à témoigner, aux ordonnances des tribunaux ou aux autres procédures judiciaires applicables relativement aux renseignements à votre sujet que nous avons en notre possession, et nous pourrions utiliser et communiquer des renseignements personnels pour établir vos ou nos droits ou ceux de tiers, exercer nos droits ou pour nous défendre contre des réclamations.

INFORMACION QUE RECABAMOS DE USTED Y FORMA EN QUE LA UTILIZAMOS
Los tipos de información, personal y de otra naturaleza, que recabamos de usted, provienen inicialmente de tres fuentes: (1) la información proporcionada por usted; (2) la información que se recaba automáticamente, y ; (3)la información que se recaba mediante otras fuentes.  La manera en que utilizamos y administramos toda esta información se describe a continuación.
1.  Información proporcionada por usted:
(a) Para registrar / Información relativa a su cuenta.
Nosotros recibimos y guardamos información personal suya, cuando usted autoriza a nuestros socios de negocio para que la compartan con nosotros,  para usarla con la Navegación y/o NavConnet, o ingresar a estos, utilizándola; cuando usted, de alguna otra manera, nos transmite dicha información vía la Navegación y/o el NavConnet, o; cuando usted nos contacta telefónicamente o por correo electrónico, con relación a nuestros productos y servicios.  Por ejemplo, para administrar y/o verificar su cuenta, podemos recibir, con su consentimiento,  determinada información relativa a otra de sus cuentas, incluyendo su nombre, correo electrónico, información de su vehículo y el saber si su suscripción a NavConnect se encuentra activa.  También podremos asignarle un número de identificación Telenav, único y separado, el cual podrá almacenarse y ser utilizado para administrar su cuenta, brindarle el servicio al cliente, así como realizar la investigación y análisis del uso que haga de nuestros productos y servicios.
A través de GM, de la navegación y/o de NavConnect, usted tiene la opción de proporcionarnos las direcciones de su casa y oficina, mismas que guardaremos en nuestra base de datos, para permitirle un rápido desplazamiento a dichos destinos e que ingrese a otras características de navegación y/o NavConnect.  Con nuestros productos usted también puede generar una lista de direcciones y lugares de interés "favoritos".  Dentro de la navegación y/o de NavConnect usted también tiene la opción de utilizar el menú de configuración para personalizar su experiencia, por ejemplo, al seleccionar las preferencias de navegación, activar reportes del tránsito, así como seleccionar el tipo de combustible que prefiere y realizar su búsqueda.  Para nuestros suscriptores a NavConnect, almacenamos estas direcciones y preferencias en nuestra base de datos de la nube, a fin de que usted pueda acceder a ellas desde la navegación  y/o el NavConnect mismo.
Podremos también utilizar su información para administrar su cuenta y proporcionarle servicio de apoyo al cliente; conducir investigaciones y análisis acerca del uso que realiza de nuestros productos y servicios; informarle periódicamente,  a través de la navegación y/o de NavConnect acerca de los productos y servicios que pensamos pueden ser de su interés, a menos que nos informe que desea quedar fuera de la recepción de dichas comunicaciones.

Telenav no puede prevenir la distribución y uso de dicha información por parte de terceros.
2.  Información recabada automáticamente
Cuando usted utiliza la navegación o NavConnect, nosotros recibimos automáticamente cierto tipo de información, parte de la cual puede estar asociada con  información personal.
(a) Información relacionada con su ubicación y ruta o contenido de otro usuario:
Cada vez que usted ingresa a la navegación, nosotros grabamos su ubicación, la información sobre búsquedas y rutas, incluyendo su punto de origen o ubicación actual, domicilio de destino, hora en que inicia su viaje, así como la ruta que ha instruido a seguir. Cuando se encuentra en una sesión de navegación activa,  grabamos periódicamente su ubicación actual, datos de los sensores de su vehículo, encabezado de su GPS, así como su velocidad, a partir del hardware del GPS asociado a su vehículo.  La navegación salvará y mostrará sus destinos más recientes para que pueda trasladarse nuevamente hacia ellos con facilidad.
Cuando usted elige su ubicación actual de geolocalización para especificar el lugar, a fin de realizar la búsqueda de un negocio u obtener un mapa, usaremos dicha información sólo para la finalidad necesaria y después la desecharemos. Grabaremos, de manera anónima, todas los ejercicios de búsqueda y resultados con fines de análisis comparativos.
Para los usuarios, con suscripción activa a NavConnect, que han optado por usar la conectividad, dicha ubicación e información de ruta se alojará en nuestra base de datos virtual (en la Nube) segura, donde podremos almacenarla hasta por cinco años a fin de mejorar nuestros servicios y proporcionarles otras características que mejoren sus capacidades, funciones y su experiencia de usuario.  Para los usuarios de Navconnect, otros datos de dirección, incluyendo las de casa y trabajo, lugares preferidos y destinos recientes se guardarán también junto con su información de cuenta en nuestra base de datos segura en la nube hasta que su cuenta sea borrada.
Para los usuarios de NavConnect que han habilitado la función de navegación predictiva, recibiremos y guardaremos de manera regular sus datos de ubicación proporcionados por el hardware de geolocalización de su vehículo, siempre que se encuentren utilizando el automóvil.  Dichos datos se almacenarán en nuestra base de datos segura en la nube hasta por 5 años, para poder personalizar y mejorar su navegación y experiencia de búsqueda y así proporcionarles, por ejemplo, los resultados sobre puntos de interés de marcas preferidos, personalizando rutas y alertas de viajes al trabajo.
Usted puede actualizar las opciones de navegación predictiva (incluyendo su inhabilitación) en cualquier momento, ingresando al menú de opciones de navegación.
(b)  Información de los sistemas de su vehículo.
Nosotros podemos recibir una cantidad limitada de datos su vehículo, emitidos por   los sistemas del mismo, por ejemplo, temperatura ambiente, activación o apagado de los sensores de los asientos, los cuales pueden utilizarse para optimizar la funcionalidad segura de la navegación.  Únicamente para los usuarios de la Navegación, estos datos se guardarán en la memoria local de su sistema de navegación indefinidamente.  Para los usuarios NavConnect, estos datos se guardarán en una base de datos segura en la nube por hasta cinco años a partir de la fecha en que sean recabados.
(c) Información acerca del uso que haga de los servicios de navegación.
Cuando use la navegación y/o NavConnect, registraremos cierta información sobre el uso que hace de la Navegación y/o NavConnect, así como de la ejecución de dicha Navegación.

We believe that you should know what information about you we collect, as well as how that information is used, maintained, and, in some cases, shared. The following sets forth our privacy practices and policies, applicable to the Scout GPS Link application users and account holders.
You acknowledge and understand that this privacy policy does not apply to other Telenav products or services, our business partners or other companies that Telenav does not own or operate. For information about other Telenav products and services as well as the Telenav.com website, please visit http://www.telenav.com/legal/policies.html. For information on how other providers of products or services handle personal information you provide through other web sites or through the use of our services in conjunction with a third party, please consult their privacy policies.
INFORMATION COLLECTED ABOUT YOU AND OUR USE OF SUCH INFORMATION
The types of personal and other information we may collect about you are primarily from three sources: (1) information you provide; (2) information automatically collected; and (3) information from other sources. How we use and maintain that information is described below.
1. Information You Provide
(a) Register/Information Related to Your Account
We collect and store personal information about you when you register for an account to use our Scout GPS Link application or login to Scout GPS Link using your Scout mobile account information, and when you otherwise transmit such information to us via the Scout GPS Link application, or contact us by phone or email regarding your account. For instance, to maintain and/or verify your account we collect and store in a database your User ID, name, email address, account password your mobile operating system, mobile phone model, head unit device-type ID. You may also be given the option to provide a profile photo, which will be stored with your account information.  From the device, we collect IDFA, (or Android ID if IDFA is unavailable) 
When you choose to access Scout GPS Link through a Facebook log-in, we collect your name, profile picture, email, Facebook password and your Facebook contacts list with your permission.  Your name will be displayed and stored within our application and your email and Facebook password will be stored to provide future access to our application. We may use this email to contact you regarding your account and/or to respond to any inquiry or feedback you submit from within our applications as described in section (b) below. If you want to revoke authorization for the application to interact with your Facebook account, you can remove the application from the list of permitted Apps or turn off the Platform for Apps, Plugin and Websites from the Settings menu for your Facebook account.
When you choose to access Scout GPS Link through a Google Sign in, we collect your email, basic profile information and Google password with your permission, which will be stored to provide future access to our application. We may use this email to contact you regarding your account and/or to respond to any inquiry or feedback you submit from within our applications as described in section (b) below.
You have the option of providing us with your home and work addresses, which we store in our database, to enable you to quickly navigate to those destinations and readily access other features of the application. You can also create a list of "favorite" addresses and points of interest. Within the application you also have the option to use the application's settings menu to personalize your experience, for example by selecting your navigation preferences, setting up traffic reports, and selecting your preferred gas grade for searches. We store these addresses and settings in our database so that you can access them from your account, even if you change vehicles or mobile devices.
We may also use the information that we collect about you to manage your account and provide you with customer support, perform research and analysis about your use of our products and services, to inform you from time to time about features, products or services that we think will interest you, unless you inform us that you opt out from receiving such communications.  We may share certain information we collect about you and your usage activity with our third party auto partners for the purpose of performing research and analysis about users of our products and services. However, any data will be aggregated and all of your Personal Information will be removed before sharing with such partners.
(b) Contact Our Customer Service Representatives/In-App Feedback
We may use your email address to contact you with regard to your account, such as to confirm any change to your phone number, and to respond to any inquiry or feedback you submit by email or from within the Scout GPS Link application.
Additionally, if you provide feedback regarding a routing or map issue within one of our applications, we may share your comments and anonymized data about your location and route with the OpenStreetMap community for purposes of improving OpenStreetMap data.
(d) Request for Information
When you request additional information about one of our services either via the Telenav website or via one of our partners, such as Toyota, the information we collect through these requests may include your name, phone number, and email address. We will use this information to provide you with details about our services, and we may use this information to promote our services to you in the future, unless you inform us that you opt out from receiving such communications. To understand what a partner of ours may do with information about you in the partner's custody, you should check the privacy policy of that partner.
(g) Public Forums
If you use or link to public forums such as social networking services, blogs on Telenav or non-Telenav websites, internet bulletin boards, or chat rooms, be aware that any personal information you submit can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, including to send you unsolicited messages. Telenav cannot prevent the distribution and use of such information by other parties.
2. Information Automatically Collected
We automatically receive certain types of information, some of which may be associated with personal information, when you use the Scout GPS Link application.
(a) Information Related to Your Location and Route or Other User Content
Each time you access the Scout GPS Link application, we record your location and route information, including your point of origin, the address of your destination, the starting time of your trip, the route you are instructed to follow, and your arrival time (if applicable). We record your current location when your wireless device requests a rerouting (which occurs, for example, when you deviate from the specified instructions). When you are in an active navigation session, we periodically receive your current location, GPS heading and speed from the GPS hardware associated with your wireless device. We maintain a database with these locations and route information, and may keep such information indefinitely to improve our map coverage and to provide other features that may enhance and personalize your service capabilities, functions, and your user experience. The application will display your most recent destinations to allow you to easily navigate to these destinations again. When you choose to use your current GPS location for specifying the locale for a business finder search, or obtaining a map, we use your location information for the requested purpose. We anonymously record any search activities and results for comparative analysis. Further, we anonymously record transactions for the purpose of paying directory listing providers.
Scout GPS Link includes a location and information sharing feature that enables you to share your location or other information with another party. These location exchanges are transmitted within the application or via the internet or text messages using SMS. For example, when you create, join, or navigate to a Meet Up with the Scout GPS Link application, your name, current location and/or ETA at the Meet Up location will be displayed on a map visible by other Meet Up participants.  The Meet Up and your location and/or ETA will be removed from the map visible to other participants when you delete the Meet Up.  We record these location exchanges, and may keep such information indefinitely. 
Additionally, you can allow the Scout GPS Link application to access the data stored in the address book on your mobile device. Our applications may use data from your address book or from your Facebook or Google+ contacts (if you signed in with a Facebook  or Google+ sign-in)  to allow you to search for and navigate to the addresses of your contacts or create a Meet Up within the application. We will only access this data if you have given permissions for the Scout GPS Link application to do so, and you can revoke such permissions at any time by changing the settings on your mobile device.
(b) Information About Your Use of the Application
When you use the Scout GPS Link application, we log certain information your use of the application and the application's performance. For example, we may collect data about what actions you take within the application such as whether the vehicle's head unit is being used, the type of search you performed or what caused an application crash. This data will be stored indefinitely to allow us to improve the application. This data may be shared with our third party auto partners in anonymized, aggregated form. Your Personal Information will be removed before any data is shared.
We will also collect information relating to the performance of our applications, including the state of your device at the time of an error or issue with the application, and such information is disclosed to and processed by third party providers, including but not limited to Crashlytics, for purposes of collecting information about errors or issues within our applications so we may improve our applications.
(c) Other Information
When you use the voice command or entry features on our services, we record your audible utterance (what you said) and that recording is shared with our third party voice recognition partner, who will use the data solely for voice recognition purposes.
WHEN YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE SHARED OR DISCLOSED
Telenav does not sell, rent, license or otherwise share information with unaffiliated parties except as explained in this privacy policy.
Consent Given/Transaction Processing
We may disclose personal information about you to third parties with your consent. Consent is sometimes implicit, as in the disclosure of personal information to third-parties who complete transactions or perform services on our behalf. Third Party Services or Third Party Service Providers.
Telenav may make certain personally identifiable information non-personal and share it or anonymized, aggregated data with strategic partners that work with us to analyze usage, provide and improve products or services, or that help us market to customers, or for similar purposes. Information that is not personally identifiable or is aggregated is not subject to any restrictions of use or disclosure under this privacy policy.
If you take advantage of a third party's services or products offered through the use of our services, we may disclose your personal information to such unaffiliated third parties. These entities may use this information that you provide in the course of your use of Telenav's services (including your name, , telephone number, and email address) to promote their products and services to you. Any such personal information that a third party uses will be subject to their applicable privacy policies.
Some of the application's services and functionality are provided in conjunction with third party service providers. These third party service providers process personal information on our behalf and are obligated to process such information in compliance with this privacy policy and other appropriate security and confidentiality measures.
Legal Processes
We will comply with any subpoenas, court orders or other legal processes for any of the information about you in our possession, and we may use such information to establish or exercise yours, ours, or others' legal rights, or to defend against legal claims.
Business Transfers
Information about you in our possession may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another provider, as well as in the unlikely event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which your personal information would be transferred as one of the business assets of the company. Telenav does not guarantee that any entity receiving such information in connection with one of these transactions will comply with all terms of this policy.
SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
Telenav has implemented various physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of personal information under our control. For instance, Telenav limits access to Telenav systems that store such information to authorized personnel. Telenav also employs the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to protect your personal information when you bill on our website.
While Telenav maintains a multitude of security measures to prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of your personal information, no security measures are absolute or wholly guaranteed. Telenav will make reasonable attempts to notify you if it determines there were unauthorized acts by third parties that violate the law or this policy, or other security breaches, or where otherwise required by law.
Telenav will maintain your personal information for as long as a business need exists, or as required by applicable laws, regulations, or government orders. When we dispose of personal information, we use commercially reasonable procedures to erase or render it unreadable.
CHILDREN'S PRIVACY
Telenav will not knowingly request or collect personal information from any person under 13 years of age without prior verifiable parental or legal guardian consent. If, however, you authorize a child to use our services or products by providing them a device associated with your Telenav service, any personal information associated with such use will be treated as your information in accordance with this policy. Telenav encourages parents to be involved in the online activities (including wireless Internet browsing) of their children to ensure that no information is collected from a child without parental or Guardian consent.
CUSTOMER REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION
Customers are entitled to request information concerning whether a business has disclosed personal information to any affiliated companies or third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Customers are further entitled to request access to their personal information under Telenav's control. To protect your privacy and security, Telenav will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before providing you access or making corrections. Good faith efforts to resolve requests to correct inaccuracies in personal information will be made by Telenav, except where the request is unreasonable. As stated in this privacy policy, Telenav will not sell or share your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes without your consent. Customers who wish to request further information about our compliance with this law or have questions or concerns about our privacy practices and policies may contact us at support@telenav.com or write to the attention of Privacy Policy Officer, Telenav, Inc., 950 DeGuigne Dr., Sunnyvale, CA 94085-3900, USA.

OTHER AGREEMENTS
Telenav may enter into written product or service agreements with customers that contain specific provisions related to confidentiality, security or other handling of information. If this privacy policy conflicts with any provision of those terms and agreements (both US and international), those terms and agreements govern to the extent of the inconsistency.

You acknowledge and understand that this privacy policy does not apply to Telenav websites, other Telenav products or services, our business partners or other companies that Telenav does not own or operate.

Personal Information may include name, home address, telephone numbers including mobile telephone numbers, location information, Mobile Subscriber Identifier, Mobile Equipment Identifier, and email addresses. Personal Information does not include anonymous or aggregate information, which cannot be associated with a specific person. We believe that you should know what information about you we collect, as well as how that information is used, maintained, and, in some cases, shared. The following sets forth our privacy practices and policies, applicable to the Scout GPS Link application users and account holders.
INFORMATION COLLECTED ABOUT YOU AND OUR USE OF SUCH INFORMATION
The types of Personal Information we may collect about you are primarily from three sources: (1) information you provide; (2) information automatically collected; and (3) information from other sources. How we use and maintain that information is described below.
1. Information You Provide
(a) Register/Information Related to Your Account
We collect and store Personal Information about you when you register for an account to use our Scout GPS Link application or login to Scout GPS Link, and when you otherwise transmit such information to us via the Scout GPS Link application, or contact us by phone or email regarding your account. For instance, to maintain and/or verify your account we collect and store in a database your name, email address, account password your mobile operating system, mobile phone model, head unit device-type ID. From the device, we collect a device ID such as IDFA or Android Advertising ID.
When you choose to access Scout GPS Link through a Facebook log-in, we collect your name, profile picture, email, and your Facebook contacts list with your permission in order to facilitate your log-in. Your name will be displayed and stored within our application and your email and Facebook password will be stored to provide future access to our application. We may use this email to contact you regarding your account and/or to respond to any inquiry or feedback you submit from within our applications as described in section (b) below. If you want to revoke authorization for the application to interact with your Facebook account, you can log-out of Facebook from within the Scout GPS Link account settings menu, remove the application from the list of permitted Apps, or turn off the Platform for Apps, Plugin and Websites from the Settings menu for your Facebook account.
When you choose to access Scout GPS Link through a Google Sign In, we collect your email and basic profile information, which will be stored to provide future access to our application in order to facilitate your log-in. We may use this email to contact you regarding your account and/or to respond to any inquiry or feedback you submit from within our applications as described in section (b) below.
You have the option of providing us with your home and work addresses, which we store in our database, to enable you to quickly navigate to those destinations and readily access other features of the application. You can also create a list of "favorite" addresses and points of interest. Within the application you also have the option to use the application's settings menu to personalize your experience, for example by selecting your navigation preferences, setting up traffic reports, and selecting your preferred gas grade for searches. We store these addresses and settings in our database so that you can access them from your account, even if you change vehicles or mobile devices.
We may also use the information that we collect about you to manage your account and provide you with customer support and to perform research and analysis about your use of our products and services. We may share certain information we collect about you and your usage activity with our third party auto partners for the purpose of performing research and analysis about users of our products and services. However, any data will be aggregated and all of your Personal Information will be removed before sharing with such partners.
(b) Contact Our Customer Service Representatives/In-App Feedback
We may use your email address to contact you with regard to your account, such as to confirm any change to your phone number, and to respond to any inquiry or feedback you submit by email or from within the Scout GPS Link application. If you contact us with a comment, question or complaint, you may be asked for information that identifies you (such as your name, address and a phone number) along with any additional information we may need to help us promptly answer your question or respond to your comment or complaint. We may retain this information to assist you in the future and to improve our customer service and product and service offerings.
Additionally, if you provide feedback regarding a routing or map issue within one of our applications, we may share your comments in non-identifiable form and anonymized data about your location and route with the OpenStreetMap community for purposes of improving OpenStreetMap data.
2. Information Automatically Collected
We automatically receive certain types of information, some of which may be Personal Information, when you use the Scout GPS Link application.
(a) Information Related to Your Location and Route or Other User Content
Each time you access or use the Scout GPS Link application (including when you search for a nearby address or Point of Interest within the application running on your mobile device, when you are in an active navigation session within the application running on your mobile device, or when your mobile device running the application is connected to your Toyota vehicle), we record your GPS location and route information, including your point of origin, the address of your destination, the starting time of your trip, the route you are instructed to follow, and your arrival time (if applicable). We record your current location when your wireless device requests a rerouting (which occurs, for example, when you deviate from the specified instructions). When you are in an active navigation session, we periodically receive your current location, GPS heading and speed from the GPS hardware associated with your wireless device in order to provide you with and update your route. We maintain a database with these locations and route information, and may keep such information for up to five (5) years to improve our map coverage and to provide other features that may enhance and personalize your service capabilities, functions, and your user experience.
We may also periodically receive your current location from the GPS hardware associated with your wireless device for the purpose of providing enhanced services, including traffic flow data for you and other users of the application. When your location, GPS heading and speed are used for these purposes, we remove any Personal Information, such as your phone number, prior to storing. We may share such location data in a non-identifiable or anonymized form with our third party partners performing research and analysis about traffic conditions and road segment usage. The application will display your most recent destinations to allow you to easily navigate to these destinations again. When you choose to use your current GPS location for specifying the locale for a business finder search, or obtaining a map, we use your location information for the requested purpose. We anonymously record any search activities and results in order to improve our search functionality. Further, we anonymously record transactions for the purpose of determining our payment obligations to directory listing providers.
Additionally, you can allow the Scout GPS Link application to access the data stored in the address book on your mobile device. Our applications may use data from your address book to allow you to search for and navigate to the addresses of your contacts within the application. We will only access this data if you have given permissions for the Scout GPS Link application to do so, and you can revoke such permissions at any time by changing the settings on your mobile device.
(b) Information About Your Use of the Application
When you use the Scout GPS Link application, we log certain information regarding your use of the application and the application's performance. For example, we may collect data about what actions you take within the application such as whether the vehicle's head unit is being used, the type of search you performed or what caused an application crash. This data will be stored indefinitely to allow us to improve the application. This data may be shared with our third party auto partners in a non-identifiable, aggregated form. Your Personal Information will be removed before any data is shared.
We will also collect information relating to the performance of our applications, including the state of your device at the time of an error or issue with the application, and such information is disclosed to and processed by third party providers, including but not limited to Crashlytics, for purposes of collecting information about errors or issues within our applications so we may improve our applications.
WHEN YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE SHARED OR DISCLOSED
Telenav does not sell, rent, license or otherwise share information with unaffiliated parties except as explained in this privacy policy.
Third Party Services and Service Providers

With your consent, these entities may use this information that you provide in the course of your use of Telenav's services (including your name, telephone number, and email address) to promote their products and services to you. Any such Personal Information that a third party uses will be subject to their applicable privacy policies.
Legal Processes

We also may be required to disclose Personal Information in response to a lawful request by applicable US or other courts and governmental authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

Information about you in our possession may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another provider, as well as in the unlikely event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which your Personal Information would be transferred as one of the business assets of the company.

Si vous n’êtes pas d’accord avec les modalités de la présente politique, veuillez ne pas vous adonner à ces activités.
Vous comprenez que la présente politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels ne s’applique pas aux sites Web de Telenav, à d’autres produits ou services de Telenav, à nos partenaires commerciaux et à d’autres sociétés dont Telenav n’a pas la propriété ou qu’elle n’exploite pas. Pour obtenir des renseignements au sujet d’autres produits et services de Telenav ainsi que sur le site Web Telenav.com, veuillez visiter http://www.telenav.com/legal/policies.html. Pour obtenir des renseignements sur la façon dont d’autres fournisseurs de produits ou services traitent les renseignements personnels que vous fournissez par l’intermédiaire d’autres sites Web ou dans le cadre de l’utilisation de nos services conjointement avec un tiers, veuillez consulter leurs politiques en matière de protection des renseignements personnels.
Telenav comprend et respecte vos préoccupations au sujet de la collecte, de l’utilisation et du traitement des renseignements permettant de vous identifier dans le cadre de l’application Scout GPS Link (les « renseignements personnels »). Parmi les renseignements personnels peuvent figurer le nom, l’adresse domiciliaire, les numéros de téléphone, y compris les numéros de téléphone mobile, les données de positionnement, le numéro d’identification d’abonné mobile, le numéro d’identification d’équipement mobile et les adresses de courriel. Les renseignements personnels ne comprennent pas les renseignements anonymes ou regroupés qui ne peuvent être associés à une personne en particulier. Nous estimons que vous devriez savoir quel type de renseignements nous recueillons et comment ces renseignements sont utilisés, conservés et, dans certains cas, partagés. Nos pratiques et politiques en matière de protection des renseignements personnels applicables aux utilisateurs et aux titulaires de compte de l’application Scout GPS Link sont décrites ci après.
RENSEIGNEMENTS RECUEILLIS À VOTRE SUJET ET MANIÈRE DONT NOUS LES UTILISONS
Le type de renseignements personnels que nous pourrions recueillir à votre sujet proviennent principalement de trois sources : 1) l’information que vous fournissez; 2) l’information qui est recueillie automatiquement et 3) l’information provenant d’autres sources. La manière dont nous utilisons et conservons cette information est décrite ci après.
1. Renseignements que vous fournissez
a) Inscription/renseignements liés à votre compte
Nous recueillons et conservons des renseignements personnels à votre sujet lorsque vous ouvrez un compte en vue d’utiliser notre application Scout GPS Link ou que vous vous connectez à Scout GPS Link, et lorsque vous nous transmettez autrement cette information par l’intermédiaire de l’application Scout GPS Link ou que vous communiquez avec nous par téléphone ou par courriel au sujet de votre compte. Par exemple, aux fins de la tenue et/ou de la vérification de votre compte, nous recueillons et conservons dans une base de données votre nom, votre adresse de courriel, le mot de passe du compte, des données sur votre système d’exploitation mobile, le modèle de votre téléphone mobile et l’identifiant de type d’appareil de l’unité centrale. Sur l’appareil, nous recueillons un numéro d’identification comme l’identifiant publicitaire IDFA ou Android.
Si vous décidez d’accéder à Scout GPS Link au moyen de votre compte Facebook, nous recueillerons votre nom, votre photo de profil, votre adresse de courriel et la liste de vos contacts Facebook avec votre permission afin de simplifier l’ouverture de la session. Votre nom sera affiché et stocké dans notre application et votre adresse de courriel et votre mot de passe Facebook seront stockés afin de permettre l’accès à notre application dans le futur. Nous pourrions utiliser cette adresse de courriel afin de communiquer avec vous concernant votre compte et/ou de répondre à des questions ou à des commentaires que vous formulez au moyen de notre application comme il est décrit au paragraphe b) ci-après. Si vous souhaitez révoquer l’autorisation permettant à l’application d’interagir avec votre compte Facebook, vous pouvez vous déconnecter de Facebook à partir du menu des paramètres de compte de Scout GPS Link, retirer l’application de la liste d’applications autorisées ou désactiver la fonction Applications, sites Web et modules d’extension dans les paramètres de votre compte Facebook.
Si vous décidez d’accéder à Scout GPS Link au moyen de votre compte Google, nous recueillerons votre adresse de courriel et des données de base sur votre profil, lesquels seront conservés afin de permettre l’accès à notre application dans le futur et de simplifier l’ouverture de votre session. Nous pourrions utiliser cette adresse de courriel afin de communiquer avec vous concernant votre compte et/ou de répondre à des questions ou à des commentaires que vous formulez au sein de notre application comme il est décrit au paragraphe b) ci-après.
Vous avez la possibilité de nous fournir vos adresses à domicile et au travail, que nous stockons dans notre base de données, pour vous permettre de naviguer rapidement vers ces destinations et d’accéder facilement à d’autres fonctionnalités de l’application. Vous pouvez également créer une liste d’adresses « favorites » et de points d’intérêt. L’application vous permet également d’utiliser son menu des paramètres afin de personnaliser votre expérience, par exemple en choisissant vos préférences de navigation, en établissant des rapports de circulation et en établissant vos préférences en matière de qualité d’essence pour les recherches. Nous stockons ces adresses et paramètres dans nos bases de données de sorte que vous puissiez y accéder à partir de votre compte, même si vous changez de véhicule ou d’appareil mobile.
Nous pourrions également utiliser les renseignements que nous recueillons sur vous pour gérer votre compte et vous fournir un soutien à la clientèle et pour effectuer des recherches et des analyses à propos de votre utilisation de nos produits et services. Nous pourrions communiquer à nos partenaires indépendants du secteur automobile certains renseignements que nous recueillons à votre sujet et au sujet de votre utilisation dans le but d’effectuer des recherches et des analyses au sujet des utilisateurs de nos produits et services. Toutefois, les données seront regroupées et tous vos renseignements personnels seront retirés avant que des renseignements soient communiqués à ces partenaires.
b) Communication avec nos représentants du service à la clientèle/commentaires formulés au moyen de l’application
Nous pouvons utiliser votre adresse de courriel pour communiquer avec vous au sujet de votre compte, notamment pour confirmer une modification apportée à votre numéro de téléphone, et pour répondre à une demande de renseignements ou à un commentaire que vous avez formulé par courriel ou au moyen de l’application Scout GPS Link. Si vous communiquez avec nous pour formuler un commentaire, une question ou une plainte, vous pourriez devoir fournir des renseignements pouvant vous identifier (comme votre nom, votre adresse et votre numéro de téléphone) ainsi que d’autres renseignements dont nous pourrions avoir besoin pour nous aider à répondre rapidement à votre question, à votre commentaire ou à votre plainte. Nous pourrions conserver ces renseignements pour vous aider dans le futur et pour améliorer notre service à la clientèle et notre gamme de produits et services.
De plus, si vous formulez des commentaires concernant un problème d’itinéraire ou de carte dans l’une de nos applications, nous pourrions partager vos commentaires selon un format qui ne risque pas de vous identifier ainsi que des données anonymisées sur votre emplacement et votre itinéraire avec la communauté OpenStreetMap en vue de perfectionner les données d’OpenStreetMap.
2. Renseignements recueillis automatiquement
Nous recevons automatiquement certains types de renseignements, dont certains peuvent être des renseignements personnels, lorsque vous utilisez l’application Scout GPS Link.
a) Renseignements relatifs à votre position et itinéraire ou d’autre contenu sur l’utilisateur
Chaque fois que vous accédez à l’application Scout GPS Link ou que vous l’utilisez (notamment lorsque vous recherchez une adresse à proximité ou un point d’intérêt au moyen de l’application ouverte sur votre appareil mobile, lorsque votre session de navigation est active dans l’application ouverte sur votre appareil mobile ou lorsque votre appareil mobile sur laquelle l’application est ouverte est connecté à votre véhicule Toyota), nous enregistrons votre position obtenue par GPS, vos itinéraires, y compris votre point d’origine, l’adresse de votre destination, l’heure du début de votre déplacement, l’itinéraire qu’on vous a indiqué de suivre et l’heure de votre arrivée (s’il y a lieu). Nous enregistrons votre position actuelle lorsque votre appareil sans fil demande un nouvel itinéraire (ce qui survient lorsque, par exemple, vous vous écartez de l’itinéraire fourni). Tant que votre session de navigation est active, nous recevons périodiquement votre position, la direction indiquée par le GPS et la vitesse de votre véhicule à partir du matériel GPS associé à votre appareil sans fil afin de vous fournir votre itinéraire et de le rajuster. Nous constituons une base de données composée de ces données de positionnement et d’itinéraire et nous pouvons les conserver jusqu’à cinq ans afin d’améliorer nos cartes et d’offrir d’autres fonctionnalités pouvant améliorer et personnaliser vos capacités à bénéficier du service, les fonctions et votre expérience utilisateur.
Nous pourrions également recevoir périodiquement des données sur votre position provenant du matériel GPS associé à votre appareil sans fil afin de vous fournir et de fournir à d’autres utilisateurs de l’application des services bonifiés, comme des données sur la fluidité de la circulation. Si les données sur votre position, votre direction indiquée par le GPS et votre vitesse sont utilisées à ces fins, nous en retirons tous les renseignements personnels, comme votre numéro de téléphone, avant de les stocker. Nous pourrions partager ces données de positionnement selon un format qui ne risque pas de vous identifier ou sous une forme anonyme avec nos partenaires indépendants qui effectuent de la recherche et de l’analyse sur les conditions de la circulation et l’utilisation du réseau routier. L’application affichera vos destinations les plus récentes afin de vous permettre d’y retourner facilement. Si vous choisissez d’utiliser votre position établie par GPS pour trouver une entreprise ou obtenir une carte, nous utiliserons les renseignements relatifs à votre position pour faire la recherche demandée. Nous enregistrons de façon anonyme les activités et les résultats de recherche afin d’améliorer notre fonction de recherche. De plus, nous enregistrons les opérations de façon anonyme afin de déterminer nos obligations de paiement aux fournisseurs de service d’annuaire.
De plus, vous pouvez permettre à l’application Scout GPS Link d’accéder aux données stockées dans le carnet d’adresses de votre appareil mobile. Nos applications peuvent utiliser les données de votre carnet d’adresses pour vous permettre d’effectuer une recherche dans vos contacts et d’activer la navigation pour vous diriger à leur adresse au moyen de l’application. Nous n’accéderons à ces données que si vous en avez donné la permission à l’application Scout GPS Link. Vous pouvez révoquer la permission à tout moment en modifiant les paramètres de votre appareil mobile.
b) Données sur l’utilisation que vous faites de l’application
Lorsque vous utilisez l’application Scout GPS Link, nous conservons certaines données sur votre utilisation de l’application et son rendement. Par exemple, nous pourrions recueillir des données au sujet de vos activités dans l’application, comme l’utilisation de l’unité centrale du véhicule, le type de recherche que vous avez effectuée ou la cause d’une défaillance de l’application. Ces données seront stockées pour une durée indéterminée afin de nous permettre d’apporter des améliorations à l’application. Elles pourraient être partagées avec nos partenaires indépendants du secteur automobile selon un format regroupé qui n’est pas susceptible de vous identifier. Vos renseignements personnels seront supprimés avant que des données soient partagées.
Nous recueillerons également des renseignements sur le rendement de nos applications, y compris l’état de votre appareil au moment où survient une erreur ou un problème dans l’application, et cette information sera communiquée à un tiers, notamment Crashlytics, et traitée par celui-ci afin de recueillir de l’information sur les erreurs ou les problèmes qui surviennent dans nos applications pour que nous puissions les améliorer.
PARTAGE OU COMMUNICATION DE VOS RENSEIGNEMENTS
Telenav ne vend pas de données à des parties qui ne sont pas membres de son groupe, ne leur en loue pas, ne leur en concède pas sous licence et ne les leur communique pas, sauf comme il est indiqué dans la présente politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels.
Services fournis par des tiers et fournisseurs de services
Nous pourrions transférer ou communiquer certains renseignements sur vous à des tiers qui fournissent des services pour notre compte, comme l’hébergement de données, la production de rapports sur le rendement d’une application, l’amélioration et l’analyse de données de cartographie et de circulation, l’analyse de l’utilisation d’une application et la liste dont il est question ci-après.
Certains des services et des fonctionnalités de l’application sont fournis par des fournisseurs de services indépendants ou conjointement avec ceux-ci. Ces fournisseurs de services indépendants traitent les renseignements personnels pour notre compte et sont tenus de le faire conformément à la présente politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels et à d’autres mesures appropriées en matière de sécurité et de confidentialité. Nous ne les autorisons pas à utiliser ou à communiquer des renseignements personnels aux fins de commercialisation ou à d’autres fins personnelles. Nous, les membres de notre groupe ou d’autres fournisseurs de services indépendants aux États Unis ou dans d’autres territoires pouvons tenir et traiter des renseignements personnels.
Telenav peut communiquer certaines données regroupées qui ne sont pas susceptibles d’identifier qui que ce soit avec des partenaires stratégiques qui collaborent avec nous pour analyser l’utilisation de produits ou de services et pour en fournir et les améliorer ou qui nous aident à les commercialiser auprès de clients, ou à des fins similaires.
Partenaires indépendants
Si vous tirez parti des services ou des produits d’un tiers offerts dans le cadre de l’utilisation de nos services, nous pourrions communiquer vos renseignements personnels à ces tiers qui ne sont pas membres de notre groupe. Avec votre consentement, ces entités peuvent utiliser les renseignements que vous fournissez dans le cadre de votre utilisation des services de Telenav (dont votre nom, votre numéro de téléphone et votre adresse de courriel) afin de promouvoir leurs produits et leurs services auprès de vous. Les renseignements personnels qu’un tiers utilise seront visés par sa politique applicable en matière de protection des renseignements personnels.
Procédures judiciaires
Nous, ainsi que nos fournisseurs de services et les membres de notre groupe autorisés, nous conformerons aux assignations à témoigner, aux ordonnances des tribunaux ou aux autres procédures judiciaires relativement aux renseignements à votre sujet que nous avons en notre possession, et nous pourrions utiliser et communiquer ces renseignements pour établir vos ou nos droits ou ceux de tiers, pour exercer nos droits ou permettre à d’autres d’exercer leurs droits ou pour nous défendre contre des réclamations ou comme l’exigent ou le permettent autrement les lois du Canada ou des États-Unis ou d’autres lois. Nous pourrions également être tenus de divulguer des renseignements personnels en réponse à une demande légitime de tribunaux et d’autorités gouvernementales compétentes, dont ceux des États-Unis, notamment pour nous conformer à des exigences relatives à la sécurité nationale ou à l’application de la loi.
Transferts commerciaux
Les renseignements à votre sujet que nous avons en notre possession pourraient être communiqués dans le cadre d’une fusion, d’une acquisition, de la vente d’actifs de la société ou de la transition de services vers un autre fournisseur ainsi que dans un cas improbable d’insolvabilité, de faillite ou de mise sous séquestre dans le cadre de laquelle vos renseignements personnels seraient transférés en tant qu’actifs de la société.
SÉCURITÉ DES RENSEIGNEMENTS PERSONNELS
Telenav a mis en place des mesures de sauvegarde physiques, électroniques et procédurales raisonnables dans le but de préserver la confidentialité et la sécurité des renseignements personnels sous notre garde et notre contrôle.
Bien que Telenav ait mis en place des mesures de sécurité pour contribuer à prévenir l’accès non autorisé à vos renseignements personnels ou la communication de ceux ci, aucune mesure de sécurité n’est absolue ni pleinement garantie. Telenav conservera vos renseignements personnels aussi longtemps qu’elle en aura besoin sur le plan des activités ou conformément aux exigences des lois, des règlements ou des ordonnances gouvernementales applicables. Au moment d’éliminer des renseignements personnels, nous appliquons une procédure raisonnable sur le plan commercial pour les supprimer ou les rendre anonymes ou illisibles.
DEMANDE DE RENSEIGNEMENTS PROVENANT DE CLIENTS
Telenav reconnaît que les gens ont le droit d’avoir accès aux renseignements personnels et aux données dont elle dispose sur eux (sous réserve de certaines exceptions prévues par la loi), de les mettre à jour et de corriger les erreurs qui s’y sont glissées. Les clients ont le droit de demander si une entreprise a communiqué des renseignements personnels à des sociétés membres de son groupe ou à des tiers aux fins de commercialisation directe par eux. Ils ont également le droit de demander l’accès à leurs renseignements personnels que Telenav contrôle et dont elle a la garde. Pour protéger vos renseignements personnels et pour votre sécurité, Telenav prendra des mesures raisonnables pour vérifier votre identité avant de vous donner accès à vos renseignements personnels ou d’y apporter des corrections. Telenav déploiera des efforts de bonne foi pour répondre aux demandes de correction de renseignements personnels conformément aux lois applicables. Telenav ne vendra pas vos renseignements personnels ni ne les communiquera à des tiers aux fins de commercialisation directe par eux sans votre consentement. Les clients qui souhaitent obtenir de plus amples renseignements sur la façon dont nous nous y prenons pour nous conformer aux lois ou qui ont des questions ou des préoccupations au sujet de nos pratiques et politiques en matière de protection des renseignements personnels ou de celles de nos fournisseurs de services peuvent communiquer avec nous par courriel à support@telenav.com ou par la poste aux soins du responsable de la protection des renseignements personnels, à Telenav, Inc., Attn : Privacy Policy Officer, 4655 Great America Parkway, Suite 300, Santa Clara, CA 95054, États-Unis
MODIFICATION DE LA PRÉSENTE POLITIQUE
À l’occasion, Telenav peut mettre à jour la présente politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels, et nous vous recommandons de la consulter périodiquement pour être informé des derniers changements. Si Telenav devait fusionner avec une autre société ou être acquise par une autre société, la présente politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels pourrait être modifiée.
AUTRES CONVENTIONS
Telenav peut conclure avec des clients des conventions écrites relatives à des produits ou à des services qui renferment des dispositions particulières en matière de confidentialité, de sécurité ou de traitement de l’information. Si la présente politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels est incompatible avec une disposition de ces modalités et conventions (aussi bien aux États-Unis qu’ailleurs), ces modalités et conventions auront préséance en ce qui a trait à l’incompatibilité. Dans tous les autres cas, les modalités de la présente politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels s’appliqueront.
MISE À JOUR DE RENSEIGNEMENTS / RÉVOCATION DE CHOIX / SUGGESTIONS ET COORDONNÉES
Si vous souhaitez accéder à des renseignements personnels que vous avez fournis à Telenav dans le cadre de votre utilisation de l’application Scout GPS Link, les mettre à jour ou les corriger ou fermer votre compte Scout GPS Link et supprimer les renseignements qui y sont associés (sous réserve de toute obligation que nous pourrions avoir en vertu de la loi de conserver ces renseignements) ou si vous avez des suggestions en vue d’améliorer la présente politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels, veuillez envoyer un courriel à support@telenav.com. Nous ferons raisonnablement de notre mieux, sur le plan commercial, pour répondre à vos préoccupations.
Dernière mise à jour de la politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels de Telenav : 28 juillet 2017.

Ken Xie




	A seasoned and successful entrepreneur, Ken Xie started his first network security company SIS in 1993, designing software firewalls while studying at Stanford University. In 1996, he realized the performance limitations of software firewalls running on PCs/servers, and as a result started NetScreen. As founder, president, and CEO, he led the company to develop the industry's first ASIC and dedicated hardware systems for high-performance firewalls and VPNs. NetScreen (NASDAQ: NSCN) was acquired by Juniper (NASDAQ: JNPR) for $4 billion.

Fortinet first pioneered the concept of Unified Threat Management (UTM), which unified these functions into single, highly functional appliances. With the rise of IoT, cloud, and mobility, Fortinet is now leading the way in evolving to the next generation of cybersecurity with its holistic Security Fabric vision and portfolio of solutions, which secure the entire attack service from IoT to the cloud and from user to data.  Fortinet completed its IPO (NASDAQ: FTNT) in 2009, which was lauded by Renaissance Capital as "IPO of the Year."

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

OTHER QUALIFICATIONS
You understand and agree that the Telenav Software is downloaded to your wireless device at your own discretion and risk and that you will be solely responsible for any damages to your wireless device, or loss of data, that results from the download of such software. 
Telenav does not warrant that the Telenav Services or the Telenav Software will not infringe on third party intellectual property rights.

Telenav also does not warrant the accuracy of the map or other data used for the Telenav Services. Such data may not always reflect reality due to, among other things, road closures, construction, weather, new roads and other changing conditions. 
Telenav has technological and operational security policies and procedures to protect your information from loss, misuse, alteration, or unintentional destruction, but Telenav makes no representations or warranties regarding the security of the Telenav Services or the transmission of data or information to and from Telenav and your wireless device.

Applicable law may not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability or incidental or consequential damages, so the above exclusion may not apply to you.
INDEMNIFICATION
To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to indemnify, defend and hold Telenav and its licensors (including their respective licensors, suppliers, assignees, subsidiaries, affiliated companies, and the respective officers, directors, employees, shareholders, agents and representatives of each of them) free and harmless from and against any liability, loss, injury (including injuries resulting in death), demand, action, cost, expense, or claim of any kind or character, including but not limited to attorney's fees, arising out of or in connection with your use of the Telenav Services or the Telenav Software.

Telenav's or your failure to require performance of any provision shall not affect that party's right to require performance at any time thereafter, nor shall a waiver of any breach or default of this Agreement constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself.

Telenav GPS Navigator™ for BlackBerry™
Please read these terms and conditions of use ("Terms of Use") carefully before you launch Telenav GPS Navigator, Telenav GPS, or Telenav GPS Plus ("Telenav Services") on your wireless device. Your use of the Telenav GPS Navigator indicates that you accept these terms and conditions. If you do not accept these terms and conditions, do not launch or otherwise use the Telenav GPS Navigator.
INTRODUCTION
These Terms of Use represent the agreement ("Agreement") between you and Telenav, Inc. ("Telenav") with respect to the Telenav Services. All references herein to "you" and "your" means you, your employees, agents, and contractors, and any other entity on whose behalf you accept these terms and conditions, all of whom shall also be bound by this Agreement.
Telenav may revise these terms and conditions at any time, with or without notice to you. You should visit www.telenav.com from time to time to review the then current terms and conditions for the Telenav Service.
THE TELENAV SERVICE
The Telenav Service allows you to obtain via your wireless device GPS-assisted navigation instructions to destinations throughout most of the United States or Canada, depending on your cellular carrier. Use of the Telenav Service requires payment of a monthly fee, which includes download to your wireless device of the Telenav GPS Navigator software and any upgrades, modifications, or additions thereto (collectively, "Telenav Software"), but does not include any hardware that may be required for certain wireless devices (such as a standalone GPS receiver). A complete description of the Telenav Service is available at the Products link on Telenav’s website, located at www.telenav.com/products.
The Telenav Service is for your internal business and personal use and is not for resale or other transfer or disposition to any other person or entity.
The Telenav Service utilizes map and other data licensed to Telenav by third parties for the benefit of you and other end users. This Agreement includes end-user terms required by these companies (set forth at the end of this Agreement), and thus your use of the Telenav Service is limited by and subject to such terms.
Use of MyMileage within the Telenav Services is subject to additional terms located at www.telenav.com/legal/terms-of-use.html.
YOUR LOCATION AND ROUTE INFORMATION
For Telenav to provide the Telenav Service, Telenav must record your route information, including your point of origin, the address of your destination, the starting time of your trip, and the route you are instructed to follow, and must periodically receive your GPS location from the GPS hardware associated with your wireless device.
In using the Telenav Service, you allow Telenav to access your GPS hardware and otherwise obtain this location and route information, and to record, compile and display such information internally. Such information is subject to Telenav’s privacy policy located at www.telenav.com. Your use of the Telenav Service indicates that you accept the terms of Telenav’s privacy policy.
SAFE AND LAWFUL USE OF THE TELENAV SERVICE
You agree to comply with the following when using the Telenav Service:

Observe all traffic laws and otherwise drive safely.
Use your own personal judgment while driving. If you feel that a route suggested by the Telenav Service instructs you to perform an unsafe or illegal maneuver, places you in an unsafe situation, or directs you into an area that you consider to be unsafe, do not follow such instructions.
Do not input destinations, or otherwise interact with the Telenav Service, unless your vehicle is stationary and parked. 
Do not use the Telenav Service for any illegal, unauthorized, unintended, unsafe, hazardous, or unlawful purposes, or in any manner inconsistent with this Agreement.
Arrange all GPS and wireless devices and cables necessary for use of the Telenav Service in a secure manner in your vehicle so that they will not interfere with your driving and will not prevent the operation of any safety device (such as an airbag).

PAYMENT
Before your Telenav Service will be activated, you must: (i) provide Telenav with a valid major credit card (American Express, VISA or MasterCard); (ii) enter into a direct billing or prepaid agreement with Telenav; or (iii) subscribe to the Telenav Service through your wireless telephone carrier, and agree to pay the relevant charges to such carrier.
You agree to pay all fees charged to your account for the Telenav Service (including applicable state and local taxes), in accordance with Telenav’s billing terms in effect at the time the charge becomes payable. You will be charged such fees each month, even if you do not use the Telenav Service. Telenav reserves the right to change the fees for the Telenav Service at any time, upon prior notice to you.
If payment cannot be charged to your credit card or your credit card charge is returned to Telenav for any reason, or you otherwise fail to pay the charges for the Telenav Service when due, Telenav reserves the right to pursue any and all legal remedies to collect the amounts owed by you, and to suspend or terminate your access to the Telenav Service.
TELEPHONE CHARGES
You are responsible for any fees assessed by your wireless telephone carrier to access the Telenav Service, including any data plan charges, toll, out-of-area, roaming, or other telephone connection charges. Standard messaging rates and other charges may apply when using certain features in the Telenav Service, such as Shared Address.
Telenav reserves the right to change at any time the phone number designated for you to access the Telenav Service, including eliminating any toll-free numbers.
TERMINATION
Telenav reserves the right to terminate your access to the Telenav Service at any time for any or no reason and without notice to you.
You may terminate the Telenav Service at any time by notifying Telenav via: (i) an email addressed to support@telenav.com; (ii) a letter addressed to Telenav, Inc., 950 DeGuigne Dr., Sunnyvale, CA 94085-3900. Any such cancellation by you shall become effective upon Telenav’s receipt of your notice.
Upon any termination of your Telenav Service, Telenav shall have no liability to you or any further obligations under this Agreement, other than to provide you with a refund in accordance with Telenav’s then current refund policy, unless such termination is for cause. For a copy of Telenav’s refund policy, visit www.telenav.com.
ACCOUNT INFORMATION
You agree: (a) when signing up for the Telenav Service, to provide Telenav with true, accurate, current, and complete information about yourself, and (b) to inform Telenav promptly of any changes to such information to keep it true, accurate, current and complete.
If you provide Telenav with any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Telenav has reasonable grounds to suspect so, Telenav has the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Telenav Service.
All of your account information, as well as other payment and personal information provided by you to Telenav, is subject to Telenav’s privacy policy located at www.telenav.com. Your use of the Telenav Service indicates that you accept the terms of Telenav’s privacy policy.
SOFTWARE LICENSE
Subject to your compliance with the terms of this Agreement, Telenav hereby grants to you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to: (i) download or otherwise copy the Telenav Software onto your wireless device, and (ii) use the Telenav Software (in object code form only) on such wireless device in order to access and use the Telenav Service.
This license shall terminate upon any termination of this Agreement, or upon any suspension, termination or cancellation of your access to the Telenav Service.

DISCLAIMERS
To the fullest extent permissible pursuant to applicable law, in no event will Telenav, its licensors and suppliers, or agents or employees of any of the foregoing, be liable for any decision made or action taken by you or anyone else in reliance on the information provided by the Telenav Service or the Telenav Software. You are responsible for the entire risk arising out of your use of the Telenav Service and the Telenav Software.
The Telenav Service and the Telenav Software are provided "as is" and without warranties of any kind either express or implied. Telenav disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.
Applicable law may not allow certain warranty exclusions, so one or more of the above disclaimers may not apply to you.
OTHER QUALIFICATIONS
You understand and agree that the Telenav Software is downloaded to your wireless device at your own discretion and risk and that you will be solely responsible for any damages to your wireless device, or loss of data, that results from the download of such software.
Telenav does not warrant that the Telenav Service or the Telenav Software will not infringe on third party intellectual property rights.
Telenav also does not warrant that your use of the Telenav Service will be uninterrupted or error-free. Rather, temporary interruptions of the Telenav Service may occur from time to time (such as when you drive into an area that has no cell phone coverage or when the Telenav Service or your carrier’s network is undergoing maintenance). Telenav will exercise reasonable efforts to attempt to limit or prevent such occurrences, but in no event will Telenav be liable for any financial or other damages due to such interruptions.
Telenav also does not warrant the accuracy of the map or other data used for the Telenav Service. Such data may not always reflect reality due to, among other things, road closures, construction, weather, new roads and other changing conditions.
Telenav has technological and operational security policies and procedures to protect your information from loss, misuse, alteration, or unintentional destruction, but Telenav makes no representations or warranties regarding the security of the Telenav Service or the transmission of data or information to and from Telenav and your wireless device. Telenav will not be liable to you or anyone else in the event of any unauthorized infiltration of any of its systems.
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
To the extent permitted under applicable law, under no circumstances shall Telenav or its licensors (or their licensors and suppliers) be liable to you or anyone else for any loss, injury, or damages (including but not limited to any compensatory, punitive, special, incidental, indirect, exemplary or consequential damages) arising out of or in connection with the use by you or anyone else of the Telenav Service or the Telenav Software, any defects in the Telenav Service or the Telenav Software, or any breach of this Agreement, even if Telenav or its licensors have been advised of the possibility of such damages.
Applicable law may not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability or incidental or consequential damages, so the above exclusion may not apply to you.
INDEMNIFICATION

To the fullest extent permissible pursuant to applicable law, in no event will Telenav, its licensors and suppliers, or agents or employees of any of the foregoing, be liable for any decision made or action taken by you or anyone else in reliance on the information provided by the Telenav Software. Telenav also does not warrant the accuracy of the map or other data used for the Telenav Software. Such data may not always reflect reality due to, among other things, road closures, construction, weather, new roads and other changing conditions. You are responsible for the entire risk arising out of your use of the Telenav Software. For example but without limitation, you agree not to rely on the Telenav Software for critical navigation in areas where the well-being or survival of you or others is dependent on the accuracy of navigation, as the maps or functionality of the Telenav Software are not intended to support such high risk applications, especially in more remote geographical areas.
TELENAV EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS AND EXCLUDES ALL WARRANTIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE TELENAV SOFTWARE, WHETHER STATUTORY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ALL WARRANTIES WHICH MAY ARISE FROM COURSE OF DEALING, CUSTOM OR TRADE AND INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO THE TELENAV SOFTWARE. Certain jurisdictions do not permit the disclaimer of certain warranties, so this limitation may not apply to you.
5. Limitation of Liability
TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL TELENAV OR ITS LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES (INCLUDING IN EACH CASE, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR THE INABILITY TO USE THE EQUIPMENT OR ACCESS DATA, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF BUSINESS, LOSS OF PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR THE LIKE) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE TELENAV SOFTWARE, EVEN IF TELENAV HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
NOTWITHSTANDING ANY DAMAGES THAT YOU MIGHT INCUR FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ALL DAMAGES REFERENCED HEREIN AND ALL DIRECT OR GENERAL DAMAGES IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE), THE ENTIRE LIABILITY OF TELENAV AND OF ALL OF TELENAV’S SUPPLIERS SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU FOR THE TELENAV SOFTWARE. SOME STATES AND/OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
6. Arbitration and Governing Law
You agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Telenav Software shall be settled by independent arbitration involving a neutral arbitrator and administered by the American Arbitration Association in the County of Santa Clara, California. The arbitrator shall apply the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, and the judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered by any court having jurisdiction. Note that there is no judge or jury in an arbitration proceeding and the decision of the arbitrator shall be binding upon both parties. You expressly agree to waive your right to a jury trial.
This Agreement and performance hereunder will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to its conflict of laws provisions. To the extent judicial action is necessary in connection with the binding arbitration, both Telenav and you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the County of Santa Clara, California. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply.

                                    Very good wrapper, but without unicode support unfortunately. 
                                    So, I have reconstructed it for unicode.

                                    2006-Jan-27 Copyright 1996-2002, 2006 by David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg
Introduction
The FreeType Project is distributed in several archive packages; some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine, various tools and contributions which rely on, or relate to, the FreeType Project.
This license applies to all files found in such packages, and which do not fall under their own explicit license. The license affects thus the FreeType font engine, the test programs, documentation and makefiles, at the very least.
This license was inspired by the BSD, Artistic, and IJG (Independent JPEG Group) licenses, which all encourage inclusion and use of free software in commercial and freeware products alike. As a consequence, its main points are that:

We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be interested in any kind of bug reports. ('as is' distribution)
You can use this software for whatever you want, in parts or full form, without having to pay us. ('royalty-free' usage)
You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use it, or only parts of it, in a program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that you have used the FreeType code. ('credits')

We specifically permit and encourage the inclusion of this software, with or without modifications, in commercial products.
                                    We disclaim all warranties covering The FreeType Project and assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.
Finally, many people asked us for a preferred form for a credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license. We thus encourage you to use the following text:
 """ 
                                    Portions of this software are copyright © 20XX The FreeType
                                    Project (www.freetype.org). All rights reserved.
                                    """ 
Please replace 20XX with the value from the FreeType version you actually use.
Legal Terms
                                    0. Definitions
Throughout this license, the terms 'package', 'FreeType Project', and 'FreeType archive' refer to the set of files originally distributed by the authors (David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg) as the 'FreeType Project', be they named as alpha, beta or final release.
'You' refers to the licensee, or person using the project, where 'using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source code as well as linking it to form a 'program' or 'executable'.
This program is referred to as 'a program using the FreeType engine'.
This license applies to all files distributed in the original FreeType Project, including all source code, binaries and documentation, unless otherwise stated in the file in its original, unmodified form as distributed in the original archive.
                                    If you are unsure whether or not a particular file is covered by this license, you must contact us to verify this.
The FreeType Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000 by David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg. All rights reserved except as specified below.
1. No Warranty
                                    THE FREETYPE PROJECT IS PROVIDED 'AS IS' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.
2. Redistribution
                                    This license grants a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable right and license to use, execute, perform, compile, display, copy, create derivative works of, distribute and sublicense the FreeType Project (in both source and object code forms) and derivative works thereof for any purpose; and to authorize others to exercise some or all of the rights granted herein, subject to the following conditions:

Redistribution of source code must retain this license file ('FTL.TXT') unaltered; any additions, deletions or changes to the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation. The copyright notices of the unaltered, original files must be preserved in all copies of source files.
Redistribution in binary form must provide a disclaimer that states that the software is based in part of the work of the FreeType Team, in the distribution documentation. We also encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page in your documentation, though this isn't mandatory.

These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the FreeType Project, not just the unmodified files. If you use our work, you must acknowledge us. However, no fee need be paid to us.
3. Advertising
                                    Neither the FreeType authors and contributors nor you shall use the name of the other for commercial, advertising, or promotional purposes without specific prior written permission.
We suggest, but do not require, that you use one or more of the following phrases to refer to this software in your documentation or advertising materials: 'FreeType Project', 'FreeType Engine', 'FreeType library', or 'FreeType Distribution'.
As you have not signed this license, you are not required to accept it. However, as the FreeType Project is copyrighted material, only this license, or another one contracted with the, grants you the right to use, distribute, and modify it.
                                    Therefore, by using, distributing, or modifying the FreeType Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms of this license.
4. Contacts
                                    There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:

 freetype@nongnu.org
                                        Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as future and wanted additions to the library and distribution.
                                        If you are looking for support, start in this list if you haven't found anything to help you in the documentation.
freetype-devel@nongnu.org
                                        Discusses bugs, as well as engine internals, design issues, specific licenses, porting, etc.

Wireless Short Messaging Service (SMS)
Telenav makes every effort to comply with the Mobile Marketing Association (MMA) Consumer Best Practices Guideline for the use of text messages for conducting its word-of-mouth marketing campaign. To review these guidelines, go to http://www.mmaglobal.com/documents/best-practices.
Messages Delieverd by Telenav 
Case 1: Upon receiving activation notification from a wireless carrier, Telenav may send text messages to advise its subscriber that their Telenav accounts have been activated. Generally, these messages are sent via the messaging gateway owned by the wireless carrier that provisioned the order for Telenav services. Except for these activation confirmation messages, Telenav does not send any text messages on its own. 
Case 2: Telenav allows its mobile device application subscribers to share addresses and other relevant content with other parties using text messaging via Telenav's short code address. For example, if John Doe wants to share the address of a new club he likes, he can send the address to his friend Tom Smith from within the Telenav mobile device application. When Tom Smith receives the message, it will be sent from Telenav, Inc's short code, but opening the message will reveal that John Doe originated it. 
In both Case 1 and Case 2 above, the standard messaging rates (charges) imposed by the wireless carrier, if any, for delivering or accepting a message will apply. 
Ending Message Delivery
Every message sent via Telenav's short code includes instructions to reply STOP to stop future messages being sent on behalf of Telenav's customers. When Telenav receives a STOP message via a reply to its short code, Telenav is compelled by the MMA guidelines to inform the recipient of the original message that no additional messages will be sent, and to not deliver any further messages for any reason.
Obtaining Help 
If a message recipient wishes to get HELP on the Telenav services to better explain why he received the message, the recipient can send reply with HELP to the message, or any other person can send HELP to the Telenav short code, 69355, at any time. Telenav will respond with a message that directs the sender to this portion of the Telenav.com web site.
Restarting Services 
If a recipient, or any other person, has sent STOP, CANCEL, or any other word that could be reasonably interpreted as meaning the recipient wanted text messages from Telenav's short code to cease, but later determines that he does want to receive messages from Telenav's short code, the party wishing to restart services should send RESTART as the subject of a text message to Telenav's short code, 69355.
Other Issues or Questions 
If this information does not address a concern you have about Telenav's use of text messages or SMS, please send an e-mail to support@telenav.com. 
Effective as of June 11, 2010


Your Navigator Deluxe™ on U.S. Cellular®
Please read these terms and conditions of use ("Terms of Use") carefully before you launch Your Navigator Deluxe on your wireless device. Your use of Your Navigator Deluxe indicates that you accept these terms and conditions. If you do not accept these terms and conditions, do not launch or otherwise use Your Navigator Deluxe.
INTRODUCTION
These Terms of Use represent the agreement ("Agreement") between you and Telenav, Inc. ("Telenav") with respect to the Your Navigator Deluxe service ("Your Navigator Deluxe Service"). All references herein to "you" and "your" means you, your employees, agents, and contractors, and any other entity on whose behalf you accept these terms and conditions, all of whom shall also be bound by this Agreement. These Terms of Use replace and supersede any license agreements or terms and conditions between Telenav and you for the Your Navigator Deluxe Service that may appear on your wireless carrier's web-site(s).
Telenav may revise these terms and conditions at any time, with or without notice to you. You should visit www.telenav.com from time to time to review the then current terms and conditions for the Your Navigator Deluxe Service.
THE YOUR NAVIGATOR DELUXE SERVICE
The Your Navigator Deluxe Service allows you to obtain via your wireless device GPS-assisted navigation instructions to destinations throughout most of the United States or Canada, depending on your cellular carrier. Use of the Your Navigator Deluxe Service requires payment of a monthly fee, which includes download to your wireless device of the Your Navigator Deluxe software and any upgrades, modifications, or additions thereto (collectively, "Your Navigator Deluxe Software"), but does not include any hardware that may be required for certain wireless devices (such as a standalone GPS receiver). A complete description of the Your Navigator Deluxe Service is available at the Products link on Telenav's website, located at www.telenav.com/products/tn/. 
The Your Navigator Deluxe Service is for your internal business and personal use and is not for resale or other transfer or disposition to any other person or entity.
The Your Navigator Deluxe Service utilizes map and other data licensed to Telenav by third parties for the benefit of you and other end users. This Agreement includes end-user terms required by these companies (set forth at the end of this Agreement), and thus your use of the Your Navigator Deluxe Service is limited by and subject to such terms. 
YOUR LOCATION AND ROUTE INFORMATION
For Telenav to provide the Your Navigator Deluxe Service, Telenav must record your route information, including your point of origin, the address of your destination, the starting time of your trip, and the route you are instructed to follow, and must periodically receive your GPS location from the GPS hardware associated with your wireless device. In using the Your Navigator Deluxe Service, you allow Telenav to access your GPS hardware and otherwise obtain this location and route information, and to record, compile and display such information internally. Such information is subject to Telenav's privacy policy located at www.telenav.com. Your use of the Your Navigator Deluxe Service indicates that you accept the terms of Telenav's privacy policy.
If you are using Your Navigator Deluxe Service with Ford AppLink: (1) you allow Ford Motor Company to access your vehicle GPS hardware and send your GPS location to United States Cellular Corporation (“USCC”) and TeleNav so that TeleNav may record, compile and display GPS location and route information internally; and (2) your use of Your Navigator Deluxe Service with Ford AppLink indicates your consent to Ford Motor Company accessing your vehicle GPS along with the serial number of the SYNC module, and sharing your GPS with TeleNav and USCC (for information on SYNC, see your Owners Guide). If you do not want Ford to access your vehicle GPS, do not use Your Navigator Deluxe Service with Ford AppLink.
SAFE AND LAWFUL USE OF THE YOUR NAVIGATOR DELUXE SERVICE
You agree to comply with the following when using the Your Navigator Deluxe Service:

Observe all traffic laws and otherwise drive safely.
Use your own personal judgment while driving. If you feel that a route suggested by the Your Navigator Deluxe Service instructs you to perform an unsafe or illegal maneuver, places you in an unsafe situation, or directs you into an area that you consider to be unsafe, do not follow such instructions.
Do not input destinations, or otherwise interact with the Your Navigator Deluxe Service, unless your vehicle is stationary and parked. 
Do not use the Your Navigator Deluxe Service for any illegal, unauthorized, unintended, unsafe, hazardous, or unlawful purposes, or in any manner inconsistent with this Agreement.
Arrange all GPS and wireless devices and cables necessary for use of the Your Navigator Deluxe Service in a secure manner in your vehicle so that they will not interfere with your driving and will not prevent the operation of any safety device (such as an airbag).

PAYMENT
Your payment is made in connection with and though your relationship with your wireless telephone carrier. Any questions that you have related to payment should be referred to your wireless telephone carrier.
TELEPHONE CHARGES
You are responsible for any fees assessed by your wireless telephone carrier to access the Your Navigator Deluxe Service, including any data plan charges, toll, out-of-area, roaming, or other telephone connection charges. Standard messaging rates and other charges may apply when using certain features in the Your Navigator Deluxe Service, such as Shared Address.
Telenav reserves the right to change at any time the phone number designated for you to access the Your Navigator Deluxe Service, including eliminating any toll-free numbers.
TERMINATION
Telenav reserves the right to terminate your access to the Your Navigator Deluxe Service at any time in the event that you are not complying with these Terms of Use. You may terminate the Your Navigator Deluxe Service at any time by notifying your wireless telephone carrier of your desire to terminate. If your wireless telephone carrier is U.S. Cellular, you may call 1-888-944-9400 to terminate the Telenav Service. You will no longer receive the Your Navigator Deluxe Service once you terminate it.
ACCOUNT INFORMATION
You agree: (a) when signing up for the Your Navigator Deluxe Service, to provide Telenav with true, accurate, current, and complete information about yourself, and (b) to inform Telenav promptly of any changes to such information to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. 
If you provide Telenav with any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Telenav has reasonable grounds to suspect so, Telenav has the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Your Navigator Deluxe Service.
All of your account information, as well as other payment and personal information provided by you to Telenav, is subject to Telenav's privacy policy located at www.telenav.com. Your use of the Your Navigator Deluxe Service indicates that you accept the terms of Telenav's privacy policy.
SOFTWARE LICENSE
Subject to your compliance with the terms of this Agreement, Telenav hereby grants to you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to: (i) download or otherwise copy the Your Navigator Deluxe Software onto your wireless device, and (ii) use the Your Navigator Deluxe Software (in object code form only) on such wireless device in order to access and use the Your Navigator Deluxe Service. 
This license shall terminate upon any termination of this Agreement, or upon any suspension, termination or cancellation of your access to the Your Navigator Deluxe Service. 
Except for the limited license expressly granted herein, Telenav shall own all right, title and interest in and to the Your Navigator Deluxe Software, including without limitation all intellectual property rights therein. 
You agree not to do any of the following:

Reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, translate, modify, alter or otherwise change the Your Navigator Deluxe Software, or any part thereof.
Attempt to derive the source code, audio library or structure of the Your Navigator Deluxe Software without the prior express written consent of Telenav.
Remove from the Your Navigator Deluxe Software, or alter, any of Telenav's or its suppliers' trademarks, trade names, logos, patent or copyright notices, or other notices or markings.
Distribute, sublicense or otherwise transfer the Your Navigator Deluxe Software to others.

DISCLAIMERS
To the fullest extent permissible pursuant to applicable law, in no event will Telenav, its licensors and suppliers, or agents or employees of any of the foregoing, be liable for any decision made or action taken by you or anyone else in reliance on the information provided by the Your Navigator Deluxe Service or the Your Navigator Deluxe Software. You are responsible for the entire risk arising out of your use of the Your Navigator Deluxe Service and the Your Navigator Deluxe Software.
The Your Navigator Deluxe Service and the Your Navigator Deluxe Software are provided "as is" and without warranties of any kind either express or implied. Telenav disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. 
Applicable law may not allow certain warranty exclusions, so one or more of the above disclaimers may not apply to you.
OTHER QUALIFICATIONS
You understand and agree that the Your Navigator Deluxe Software is downloaded to your wireless device at your own discretion and risk and that you will be solely responsible for any damages to your wireless device, or loss of data, that results from the download of such software.
Telenav does not warrant that the Your Navigator Deluxe Service or the Your Navigator Deluxe Software will not infringe on third party intellectual property rights. 
Telenav also does not warrant that your use of the Your Navigator Deluxe Service will be uninterrupted or error-free. Rather, temporary interruptions of the Your Navigator Deluxe Service may occur from time to time (such as when you drive into an area that has no cell phone coverage or when the Your Navigator Deluxe Service or your carrier's network is undergoing maintenance). Telenav will exercise reasonable efforts to attempt to limit or prevent such occurrences, but in no event will Telenav be liable for any financial or other damages due to such interruptions.
Telenav also does not warrant the accuracy of the map or other data used for the Your Navigator Deluxe Service. Such data may not always reflect reality due to, among other things, road closures, construction, weather, new roads and other changing conditions.
Telenav has technological and operational security policies and procedures to protect your information from loss, misuse, alteration, or unintentional destruction, but Telenav makes no representations or warranties regarding the security of the Your Navigator Deluxe Service or the transmission of data or information to and from Telenav and your wireless device.

You agree not to do any of the following: (a) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, translate, modify, alter or otherwise change the Telenav Software or any part thereof; (b) attempt to derive the source code, audio library or structure of the Telenav Software without the prior express written consent of Telenav; (c) remove from the Telenav Software, or alter, any of Telenav's or its suppliers' trademarks, trade names, logos, patent or copyright notices, or other notices or markings; (d) distribute, sublicense or otherwise transfer the Telenav Software to others, except as part of your permanent transfer of the Telenav Software; or (e) use the Telenav Software in any manner that (i) infringes the intellectual property or proprietary rights, rights of publicity or privacy or other rights of any party, (ii) violates any law, statute, ordinance or regulation, including but not limited to laws and regulations related to spamming, privacy, consumer and child protection, obscenity or defamation, or (iii) is harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortuous, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, libelous, or otherwise objectionable; and (f) lease, rent out, or otherwise permit unauthorized access by third parties to the Telenav Software without advanced written permission of Telenav.

Except where prohibited by applicable law (which may include the Province of Quebec), in no event will Telenav, its licensors and suppliers, GM, or agents or employees of any of the foregoing, be liable for any decision made or action taken by you or anyone else in reliance on the information provided by the Telenav Software.  Unless otherwise provided under applicable laws, Telenav and GM also do not warrant or condition the accuracy of the map or other data used for the Telenav Software. Such data may not always reflect reality due to, among other things, road closures, construction, weather, new roads and other changing conditions.  You are responsible for the entire risk arising out of your use of the Telenav Software.  For example but without limitation, you agree not to rely on the Telenav Software for critical navigation in areas where the well-being or survival of you or others is dependent on the accuracy of navigation, as the maps or functionality of the Telenav Software are not intended to support such high risk applications, especially in more remote geographical areas.

EXCEPT WHERE PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW (WHICH MAY INCLUDE THE PROVINCE OF QUEBEC), NOTWITHSTANDING ANY DAMAGES THAT YOU MIGHT INCUR FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ALL DAMAGES REFERENCED HEREIN AND ALL DIRECT OR GENERAL DAMAGES IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE), THE ENTIRE LIABILITY OF TELENAV AND OF ALL OF TELENAV'S SUPPLIERS AND OF GM SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU FOR THE TELENAV SOFTWARE.  SOME PROVINCES, STATES AND/OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
6. Arbitration and Governing Law
Unless you are a resident of Canada, You agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Telenav Software shall be settled by independent arbitration involving a neutral arbitrator and administered by the American Arbitration Association in the County of Santa Clara, California.

Note that there is no judge or jury in an arbitration proceeding and the decision of the arbitrator shall be binding upon both parties.  You expressly agree to waive your right to a jury trial.
This Agreement and performance hereunder will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to its conflict of laws provisions.

7. Assignment
You may not resell, assign, or transfer this Agreement or any of your rights or obligations, except in totality, in connection with your permanent transfer of the Telenav Software, and expressly conditioned upon the new user of the Telenav Software agreeing to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

Licensed under GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 2.1, February 1999
Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".
A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)
"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
•a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
•b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
•c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
•d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.
3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.
4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.
If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:
•a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)
•b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
•c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.
•d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.
•e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.
7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
•a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.
•b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.
10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.
12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
NO WARRANTY
15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied, with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided "AS IS", and you, its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.
Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these conditions:
(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group".
(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.
These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code, not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to acknowledge us.
Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's software".
We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are assumed by the product vendor.
ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch, sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA. ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally, that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than the foregoing paragraphs do.
The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf. It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable. The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by X Consortium but is also freely distributable.
The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files. To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce "uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard GIF decoders.
We are required to state that "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of CompuServe Incorporated. GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of CompuServe Incorporated."

Par conséquent, vous vous engagez à suivre les règles suivantes lors de l'utilisation du logiciel Telenav : a) respecter les lois en matière de circulation routière et conduire par ailleurs prudemment; b) faire preuve de jugement lors de la conduite. Si vous pensez qu'un itinéraire suggéré par le logiciel Télénav vous oblige à effectuer une manœuvre dangereuse ou illégale, vous place dans une situation dangereuse ou vous conduit dans une région que vous considérez comme étant non sécuritaire, ne suivez par ces instructions; c) avant d'entrer une destination dans le logiciel Telenav ou de manipuler celui ci, assurez-vous que votre véhicule est immobilisé et stationné; d) n'utilisez pas le logiciel Telenav à des fins illégales, non autorisées, involontaires, non sécuritaires, dangereuses ou illicites, ou d'une manière non conforme à la présente convention; e) installer tous les GPS et appareils sans fil et câbles nécessaires pour l'utilisation du logiciel Telenav d'une manière sécuritaire dans votre véhicule de sorte qu'ils n'interfèrent pas avec votre conduite et n'empêchent pas l'utilisation d'un dispositif de sécurité (comme un coussin gonflable).
Vous vous engagez à indemniser et à tenir à couvert Telenav à l'égard de toutes les réclamations découlant d'une utilisation dangereuse ou par ailleurs inappropriée du logiciel Telenav dans un véhicule en marche, y compris du fait que vous n'avez pas suivi les instructions ci dessus.
2. Information sur le compte et information de localisation et de recherche
Vous vous engagez : a) au moment d'inscrire le logiciel Telenav, à fournir à Telenav et à General Motors Holdings LLC et aux membres de son groupe (« GM ») des renseignements véridiques, exacts, à jour et complets à votre sujet et au sujet de votre compte et de votre véhicule et b) à tenir ces renseignements à jour.
Aux fins de l'utilisation du logiciel Telenav, Telenav pourrait recevoir de l'information de localisation et de recherche liée à votre utilisation du logiciel Telenav. En utilisant le logiciel Telenav, vous autorisez Telenav à obtenir, à utiliser et à partager (comme il est indiqué) cette information. Cette information est assujettie à la politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels, qui est affichée à http://www.telenav.com/legal/NavConnect-privacy.htm. Si vous utilisiez le logiciel Telenav, vous acceptez les modalités de cette politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels.
3. Licence relative au logiciel
Sous réserve de votre conformité avec les modalités de la présente convention, Telenav vous concède par les présentes une licence personnelle, non exclusive et incessible (sauf comme il est expressément autorisé ci après dans le cadre de votre transfert permanent de la licence relative au logiciel Telenav), sans droit de sous-licence, aux fins d'accès au logiciel Telenav (sous forme de code objet seulement) et d'utilisation de celui-ci. Cette licence prend fin à la résiliation ou à l'expiration de la présente convention. Sauf si les lois applicables l'interdisent (ce qui peut comprendre celles de la province de Québec), Telenav peut résilier la licence à tout moment et sans motif. Vous vous engagez à utiliser le logiciel Telenav uniquement à des fins commerciales personnelles ou de loisir et non pour fournir des services de navigation commerciale à d'autres parties.
3.1 Restrictions relatives à la licence
Vous vous engagez à ne pas faire ce qui suit : a) désosser, décompiler, désassembler, traduire ou autrement modifier le logiciel Telenav ou une partie de celui ci; b) tenter de déterminer le code source, la sonothèque ou la structure du logiciel Telenav sans le consentement écrit exprès préalable de Telenav; c) retirer du logiciel Telenav ou modifier les marques de commerce, noms de marque, logos, avis de brevet ou de droit d'auteur ou autre avis ou indications de Telenav ou de ses fournisseurs; d) distribuer, concéder aux termes d'une sous-licence ou autrement transférer le logiciel Telenav à des tiers, sauf dans le cadre du transfert permanent du logiciel Telenav ou e) utiliser le logiciel Telenav d'une manière qui i) contrevient aux droits de propriété intellectuelle ou exclusifs, aux droits à la protection de la personnalité ou aux droits en matière de protection des renseignements personnels ou autres d'une partie, ii) viole une loi, une ordonnance ou un règlement, notamment les lois et les règlements relatifs au pollupostage, à la protection des renseignements personnels, à la protection des consommateurs et des enfants, aux obscénités ou à la diffamation ou iii) est dangereuse, menaçante, abusive, malveillante, délictuelle, diffamatoire, vulgaire, obscène, calomnieuse ou autrement répréhensible et f) consiste à louer le logiciel Telenav ou à autrement permettre un accès non autorisé à celui ci à des tiers sans l'autorisation écrite préalable de Telenav.
4. Dénégation de responsabilité
Sauf si les lois applicables l'interdisent (ce qui peut comprendre celles de la province de Québec), Telenav, ses concédants de licence et fournisseurs, GM ou encore les mandataires ou employés des personnes précitées ne seront en aucun cas tenus responsables d'une décision ou d'une mesure prise par vous ou un tiers sur le fondement de l'information fournie par le logiciel Telenav. Sauf si les lois applicables l'y obligent, Telenav et GM ne garantissent pas non plus ni ne conditionnent l'exactitude de la carte ou des autres données utilisées pour le logiciel Telenav. Il se pourrait que ces données ne reflètent pas toujours la réalité en raison, notamment, de fermeture de routes, de travaux de construction, de la température, de nouvelles routes et d'autres changements. Vous assumez entièrement le risque découlant de votre utilisation du logiciel Telenav. Par exemple, vous vous engagez notamment à ne pas vous fier au logiciel Telenav dans des situations critiques et des régions où votre bien-être ou votre survie ou celle d'autres personnes dépend de l'exactitude de la navigation, étant donné que les cartes ou la fonctionnalité du logiciel Telenav ne sont pas conçues pour soutenir ces applications à haut risque, plus particulièrement dans des régions géographiques plus éloignées.
SAUF SI LES LOIS APPLICABLES L'INTERDISENT (CE QUI PEUT COMPRENDRE CELLES DE LA PROVINCE DE QUÉBEC), TELENAV ET GM REJETTENT EXPRESSÉMENT TOUTE GARANTIE OU CONDITION RELATIVE AU LOGICIEL TELENAV, QU'ELLE SOIT PRÉVUE PAR LA LOI, EXPRESSE OU IMPLICITE, Y COMPRIS TOUTES LES GARANTIES OU CONDITIONS POUVANT DÉCOULER DE LA CONDUITE HABITUELLE, DE LA COUTUME OU DE L'USAGE COMMERCIAL, NOTAMMENT LES GARANTIES IMPLICITES DE QUALITÉ MARCHANDE, D'ADAPTATION À UN USAGE PARTICULIER ET DE NON-VIOLATION DES DROITS DE TIERS À L'ÉGARD DU LOGICIEL TELENAV. Certains territoires ne permettent pas l'exclusion de certaines garanties. Par conséquent, la présente limitation pourrait ne pas s'appliquer à vous.
5. Responsabilité limitée
SAUF SI LES LOIS APPLICABLES L'INTERDISENT (CE QUI PEUT COMPRENDRE CELLES DE LA PROVINCE DE QUÉBEC), TELENAV OU SES CONCÉDANTS DE LICENCE ET FOURNISSEURS OU GM NE SERONT EN AUCUN CAS TENUS RESPONSABLES ENVERS VOUS OU UN TIERS DE DOMMAGES INDIRECTS, ACCESSOIRES, CONSÉCUTIFS, SPÉCIAUX OU EXEMPLAIRES (Y COMPRIS, DANS CHAQUE CAS, NOTAMMENT, LES DOMMAGES EN CAS D'INCAPACITÉ D'UTILISER LE MATÉRIEL OU LES DONNÉES D'ACCÈS, LA PERTE DE DONNÉES, LES PERTES COMMERCIALES, LA PERTE DE PROFITS, L'INTERRUPTION DES ACTIVITÉS OU DES SITUATIONS SIMILAIRES) DÉCOULANT DE L'UTILISATION OU DE L'INCAPACITÉ D'UTILISER LE LOGICIEL TELENAV, ET CE, MÊME SI TELENAV A ÉTÉ AVISÉE DE LA POSSIBILITÉ DE TELS DOMMAGES.
SAUF SI LES LOIS APPLICABLES L'INTERDISENT (CE QUI PEUT COMPRENDRE CELLES DE LA PROVINCE DE QUÉBEC), MALGRÉ LES DOMMAGES QUE VOUS POURRIEZ SUBIR POUR QUELQUE RAISON QUE CE SOIT (NOTAMMENT TOUS LES DOMMAGES MENTIONNÉS DANS LES PRÉSENTES AINSI QUE L'ENSEMBLE DES DOMMAGES DIRECTS OU GÉNÉRAUX, CONTRACTUELS, DÉLICTUELS (NOTAMMENT PAR SUITE D'UNE NÉGLIGENCE) OU AUTRES), L'ENTIÈRE RESPONSABILITÉ DE TELENAV AINSI QUE DE L'ENSEMBLE DE SES FOURNISSEURS ET DE GM SE LIMITERA AU MONTANT RÉELLEMENT PAYÉ PAR VOUS POUR LE LOGICIEL TELENAV. CERTAINES PROVINCES OU CERTAINS ÉTATS ET/OU TERRITOIRES NE PERMETTENT PAS L'EXCLUSION OU LA LIMITATION DES DOMMAGES ACCESSOIRES OU CONSÉCUTIFS. PAR CONSÉQUENT, LES RESTRICTIONS OU EXCLUSIONS PRÉCITÉES POURRAIENT NE PAS S'APPLIQUER À VOUS.
6. Arbitrage et droit applicable
Sauf si vous êtes un résident du Canada, vous convenez que les différends, réclamations ou litiges découlant de la présente convention ou du logiciel Telenav doivent être réglés dans le cadre d'une procédure d'arbitrage indépendante effectuée par un arbitre neutre et administrée par l'American Arbitration Association du comté de Santa Clara, en Californie. L'arbitre appliquera les Commercial Arbitration Rules de l'American Arbitration Association, et la décision rendue par l'arbitre peut être entérinée par n'importe quel tribunal compétent. Il y a lieu de préciser qu'aucun juge ou jury ne participe à une procédure d'arbitrage et que la décision de l'arbitre lie les deux parties. Vous vous engagez expressément à renoncer à votre droit à un procès devant jury.
La présente convention et son exécution seront régies par les lois de l'État de la Californie et interprétées conformément à celles ci, sans égard aux dispositions en matière de conflits de lois. Si une mesure judiciaire doit être prise dans le cadre de la procédure d'arbitrage qui lie les parties, Telenav et vous vous engagez à vous en remettre à la compétence exclusive des tribunaux du comté de Santa Clara, en Californie. La Convention des Nations Unies sur les contrats de vente internationale de marchandises ne s'applique pas.
Malgré ce qui précède, si vous résidez au Canada, la présente convention est régie par les lois de la province ou du territoire dans lequel vous résidez au moment de la conclusion de la présente convention et les lois du Canada qui s'appliquent dans cette province ou ce territoire et elle doit être interprétée conformément à celles-ci. Toute poursuite intentée par Telenav ou vous doit être intentée exclusivement devant un tribunal compétent situé dans la province ou le territoire dans lequel vous résidez au moment de la conclusion de la présente convention.
7. Cession
Il vous est interdit de revendre, de céder ou de transférer la présente convention ou vos droits ou obligations, sauf en totalité, dans le cadre de votre transfert permanent du logiciel Telenav, et à la condition expresse que le nouvel utilisateur du logiciel Telenav s'engage à être lié par les modalités de la présente convention. Une vente ou cession ou un transfert qui n'est pas expressément autorisé aux termes du présent paragraphe entraînera la résiliation immédiate de la présente convention, sans responsabilité pour Telenav, auquel cas vous et les autres parties devez cesser immédiatement toute utilisation du logiciel Telenav.

Hasta el extremo en que una acción judicial  sea necesaria, con relación al arbitraje vinculante; ambas partes, Telenav y usted, convienen en sujetarse de forma exclusiva a la jurisdicción del condado de Santa Clara, California. No aplicará la Convención de las Naciones Unidas sobre Compraventa Internacional de Mercaderías.

Telenav Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy governs your use of certain services, product or websites offered by Telenav, Inc. ("Telenav"), including the Scout GPS application, Thinknear by Telenav, and the telenav.com and thinknear.com websites.  By using our services, products, websites, or otherwise by interacting with us, you consent to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Policy, please do not engage in any of these activities.
Telenav understands and respects your concerns about the use of your personally identifiable information, collected from you as a customer or visitor to our websites that identifies you as a specific person or entity ("Personal Information"). Personal Information may include name, telephone numbers including mobile telephone numbers, billing account number, Mobile Subscriber Identifier, Mobile Equipment Identifier, Network Address Identifier, IP address, and email addresses. Personal Information does not include anonymous or aggregate information, which after processing may not be associated with a specific person or entity. We believe that you should know what information about you we collect, as well as how that information is used, maintained, and, in some cases, shared. The following sets forth our privacy practices and policies, applicable to Telenav customers and visitors to the Telenav websites.
You acknowledge and understand that this Privacy Policy does not apply to our business partners or other companies that Telenav does not own or operate. For information on how other providers of products or services handle Personal Information you provide through other web sites or through the use of our services in conjunction with a third party, please consult their privacy policies.
INFORMATION COLLECTED ABOUT YOU AND OUR USE OF SUCH INFORMATION
The types of Personal Information and other information we may collect about you are primarily from three sources: (1) information you provide; (2) information automatically collected; and (3) information from other sources. How we use and maintain that information is described below.
1. Information You Provide
(a) Register/Information Related to Your Account
We may collect and store Personal Information about you when you register to become a customer of our services, and when you otherwise transmit such information to us via our applications, the internet (including partner websites) or by email. For instance, to maintain and/or verify your account we may collect and store in a database your name, nickname(s), mobile phone number, mobile phone model, wireless carrier, and in certain circumstances your email address, device ID/number, the last four digits of your credit card number, credit card holder's name, billing address, and credit card expiration date.
Where you have consented, we use your billing or PayPal account information for the purpose of billing you for certain of our services, and other services offered from within certain Telenav products, and with your permission, may store such information for future transactions. In certain versions of our applications, you may also be given the option to provide a profile photo.
When you choose to access one of our applications through a Facebook log-in, we collect your name, profile picture, email, Facebook password and your Facebook contacts list with your permission.  Your name will be displayed and stored within our application and your email and Facebook password will be stored to provide future access to our application. We may use this email to contact you regarding your account and/or to respond to any inquiry or feedback you submit from within our applications as described in section (b) below. If you want to revoke authorization for the application to interact with your Facebook account, you can sign out of Facebook from within the application's settings menu, remove the application from the list of permitted Apps, or turn off the Platform for Apps, Plugin and Websites from the Settings menu for your Facebook account.
When you choose to access one of our applications through a Google Sign in, we collect your email, basic profile information and Google password with your permission, which will be stored to provide future access to our application. We may use this email to contact you regarding your account and/or to respond to any inquiry or feedback you submit from within our applications as described in section (b) below. If you want to revoke authorization for the application to interact with your Google account, you can sign out of Google from within the application's settings menu.
We may also use the information that we collect about you to manage your account and provide you with customer support, perform research and analysis about your use of our products and services, to inform you from time to time by email, Short Messaging Service (SMS) message and/or within our application about products or services that we think will interest you, unless you inform us that you opt out from receiving such communications from within the email, SMS message or the application.  We may share the information we collect about you and your usage activity with our third party partners for the purpose of performing research and analysis about users of our products and services.
(b) Contact Our Customer Service Representatives/In-App Feedback
We may use your email address to contact you with regard to your account, such as to communicate that it is about to expire or to confirm any change to your phone number, and to respond to any inquiry or feedback you submit via our websites by email or from within any of our applications. You may opt-out of receiving such communications using the link provided within the email.
Additionally, if you provide feedback regarding a routing or map issue within one of our applications, we may share your comments and anonymized data about your location and route with the OpenStreetMap community for purposes of improving OpenStreetMap data.
(c) Accessing Our Services
When you use any of our services, including when you use a mobile device equipped with one of our applications, you will be asked to provide certain information. We may use your mobile phone number as your account number and if you consent may provide you with a verification code via SMS message. We may also assign you a separate and unique ID number as your account number. Your account number may be stored and used to manage your account and provide you with customer support, perform research and analysis about your use of our products and services, to inform you from time to time by email, SMS message and/or within our application about products or services that we think will interest you, unless you inform us that you opt out from receiving such communications from within the email, SMS message or the application.
Some of our applications also allow you to create a personal identification number (PIN), which we store in our database, for the purpose of you logging into your account. In some cases, this PIN is generated for you automatically on your wireless device, and cannot be altered.
Some of our applications also give you the option of providing us with your home and work addresses, which we store in our database, to enable you to access readily other features of our services.
On some versions of our applications you can also create a list of "favorite" addresses that can include your home and work addresses. We store these addresses in our database so that you can access them from your mobile device, and so that should you change devices, this collection of addresses will still be available to you.
(d) Third Party Applications
Some of Telenav's services provide you with access to third party applications. When you enable a third party application, information collected by Telenav is processed under our Privacy Policy while information collected by the third party application provider is governed by its own privacy policy.
(e) Promotions
When you participate in a Telenav promotion, such as a sweepstakes or contest, you may be asked to provide your name and email address, and possibly other information such as your mailing address and telephone number.
We store this information in our database and will use it to communicate with you about the promotion. We also may use your email address from time to time to inform you about our products and services that we think will interest you, unless you inform us that you opt out from receiving such communications using the link provided within the email.
(f) Request for Information
When you request additional information about one of our services either via one of our websites or via one of our partners through which our services are offered, such as a mobile telecommunications provider, information we collect through these requests include your name, nickname(s), phone number, and email address, and if you are seeking information on behalf of your company, the name of that company. We will use this information to provide you with details about our services, and we may use this information to promote our services to you in the future, unless you inform us that you opt out from receiving such communications using the link provided within the email you may receive or by contacting support@telenav.com. To understand what a partner of ours may do with information about you in the partner's custody, you should check the privacy policy of that partner.
(g) Public Forums
If you use or link to public forums such as social networking services, blogs on Telenav or non-Telenav websites, internet bulletin boards, or chat rooms, be aware that any Personal Information you submit can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, including to send you unsolicited messages. Telenav cannot prevent the distribution and use of such information by other parties.
(h) Other Submissions
We collect Personal Information about you when you submit survey responses, a job application or resume. Such information will be used only for the stated purposes.
2. Information Automatically Collected
We automatically receive certain types of information, some of which may be associated with Personal Information, when you visit our websites or use our products and services.
(a) Information Related to Your Location and Route or Other User Content
Each time you access the Telenav GPS Navigator™ or Scout® service or our partnered branded versions of our Navigator services, we record your location and route information, including your point of origin (which may be your then-current location), the address of your destination, the starting time of your trip, and the route you are instructed to follow. We record your current location when your wireless device requests a rerouting (which occurs, for example, when you deviate from the specified instructions). We maintain a database with these locations and route information, and may keep such information indefinitely to improve our map coverage and to provide other features that may enhance your service capabilities, functions, and your user experience. We may periodically receive your current location from the GPS hardware associated with your wireless device for the purpose of providing enhanced services, including traffic flow data. When your location, GPS heading and speed are used for these purposes, we strip it of your Personal Information, such as your phone number, prior to storing. We may share such location data in anonymized form with our third party partners performing research and analysis about traffic conditions and road segment usage.
When your mobile device's Location Services are being used by Scout or other third party applications or your mobile operating systems services, the Scout application may periodically collect and store data about your current location along with a non-personally identifiable version of your device ID to create an anonymous profile for advertising purposes.  This profile may be shared with third parties for advertising purposes. For additional information about this data usage and how to opt-out, please see below regarding geohistorical-based and interest-based advertising. Additionally, this location data may also be used by us for anonymous traffic flow data or floating car data.
When you choose to use your current GPS location for specifying the locale for a business finder search, or obtaining a map, we use your location information for the requested purpose, and then discard it. We anonymously record any search activities and results for comparative analysis. Further, we anonymously record transactions for the purpose of paying directory listing and mapping data providers.
Some versions of our applications include a location and information sharing feature that enables you to share your location or other information with another party. These location exchanges are transmitted within the application or via the internet or text messages using SMS. For example, when you create, join, or navigate to a Meet Up with the Scout application, your name, profile photo, current location and/or ETA at the Meet Up location will be displayed on a map visible by other Meet Up participants.  The Meet Up and your location and/or ETA will be removed from the map visible to other participants when you delete the Meet Up.  We record these location exchanges, and may keep such information indefinitely. Also, if you set up a Notification within the app, the phone numbers you provide will be automatically notified via SMS message each time you arrive at or depart from the location you select. You can turn off a Notification from within the application's settings menu.
Additionally, in some versions of our applications, you can allow our application to access the data stored in the address book and/or calendar on your mobile device. Our applications may use data from your address book or for your Facebook or Google+ contacts (if you signed in with a Facebook  or Google+ sign-in)   to allow you to search for and navigate to the addresses of your contacts, chat with your contacts within the application, or create a Meet Up within the application. Our applications may use calendar entry data to provide you with reminders about upcoming appointments and to provide navigation to the locations of your appointments. We will only access this data if you have given permissions for a particular Telenav application to do so, and you can revoke such permissions at any time by changing the settings on your mobile device.
When you access Telenav map and data services through a third party application, we receive and store your location information from your device along with any address or point of interest search requests along with associated destination location information.  We maintain a database with locations and search information, and may keep such information indefinitely to improve our map coverage and to provide other features that may enhance your service capabilities, functions, and your user experience. Such data does not contain any Personal Information, such as your phone number.
(b) Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technologies on our Websites

We may employ browser cookies or similar technologies to identify the computer, mobile device, or some of our services and record your preferences and other data. We use cookies or similar technologies to evaluate how our websites, devices or applications are used and to provide continuous improvement to our services, make recommendations, and complete transactions you request. Cookies may be stored locally on mobile devices or on computer servers operated or controlled by Telenav. We may use a tracking pixel, agent or other visitor identification technology that collects anonymous data about your use of some of our services. We may also use Web beacons, also known as Web bugs, which are mostly invisible small graphic images (1-by-1 pixel), in the same color as the background of the web page or an HTML email, to monitor interaction with our websites or emails. In addition, when you visit our website our systems automatically collect your IP address and the type of browser that you use. When you browse our websites our systems log the Telenav web pages that you visit. Server log files are records of activity automatically created by the server and stored. If we combine or link cookie or Web beacons with Personal Information, we will treat the combined or linked information as Personal Information under this policy. We may employ third-parties to place advertisements about our products and services on other web sites. The use of cookies, Web beacons or other similar technologies by such third parties is governed by their privacy policies.
You may limit the automatic collection of certain information through the use of cookies by our websites by disabling the cookies using your browser options. Please be aware that disabling cookies may prevent you from using specific features on our websites, such as ordering services, or maintaining an online account.
Our websites may collect data about your activity and some user identifying information, including Personal Information. This collected information is disclosed to and processed by Google and is used to enable features including but not limited to remarketing and display advertising. We use remarketing, display retargeting and search retargeting with Google Adwords to advertise online and third party vendors, including but not limited to Google, show our ads on sites across the Internet. We also use Google Analytics to optimize our websites. Telenav and third-party vendors, including but not limited to Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads about our products and services based on your past visits to our website or your search history. These features are solely for purposes to allow us to maintain the interests of previous visitors and deliver advertisement content specifically targeting the visitors' previous interests and searches. You may opt-out of such advertising using the Google Ads Preference Manager or obtain additional information available about Google's Remarketing Privacy Guidelines, Policies, and Restrictions and how Google uses data when you use their partners' sites or apps.
Additionally, in connection with our thinknear.com website we use a marketing automation tool called Hubspot® to handle various marketing tasks, for example but not limited to, contacting visitors to thinknear.com who provided their contact information and requested additional information. HubSpot's software uses cookies to track thinknear.com visitors and contacts. You can read more about Hubspot's Privacy Policy and opt-out options here.
Also note that we do not have a system to comply with Do Not Track requests at this time, unless required by applicable laws or regulations.
(c) Information related to your personal interests for particular advertisements
When you search for a Point of Interest or address within our Scout applicatios or our partnered branded navigation applications, we may share your search and location data with our third party partners in order to provide you with more relevant advertisement results within the application. The information we share is de-identified so that it does not contain any Personal Information, such as your name, phone number or email address.
When Thinknear by Telenav has the opportunity to serve an ad to you on a third party mobile site or mobile application or within the Scout application, we may receive information about your device, including GPS location data or other precise location data from third party ad exchanges and/or mobile publishers, including the Scout application.  The device and location data collected from users of the Scout application may be shared with third party ad exchanges. This information does not contain Personal Information and does enable us to personally identify you by name, phone number, email address, or other similar means, but may include your device ID, your IP address and the geo-location of your device at the time. This information is provided so that we can improve the relevance of the ads served to you. Any such information is shared in accordance with the third party's privacy policies and subject to their terms and conditions. We do not use such information for any purpose other than serving you with interest-based ads on behalf of advertising partners. If you would like to opt out of the use and/or sharing of such data for interest-based advertising, please contact us at support@telenav.com or click here and follow the instructions provided.
We may also obtain Precise Location Data from your use of Telenav applications (and certain other third party location based applications and use that location data) about your "geohistory", which is the geo-location of your mobile device over time along with a de-identified version of your device ID to create a profile.  Additionally, in order to create a profile, we may use data about your location and online activity and interests, including things like real-world category types you visited (e.g. Shopping Mall), mobile apps with which you engage, information collected by our inventory partners and other third parties and shared with us.  This will involve the use of your de-identified device ID and will not include any Personal Information, such as your name, phone number, or email address.
If you would like to opt out of the use of data for geohistorical-based and interest-based advertising by Thinknear by Telenav, please contact us at support@telenav.com or click here and follow the instructions provided.
Our third-party service providers may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites, mobile websites and/or mobile applications across your various devices, in order to provide content and advertisements about goods and services of interest to you across those various devices.

(d) Other Information
When you use the voice command or entry features on our services, we record your audible utterance (what you said). We collect utterances from our entire subscriber population, organize them by what was said, and then use this information to adjust speech recognition performance parameters to improve accuracy.
We will also collect information relating to your use of and the performance of our applications, including the state of your device at the time of an error or issue with the application, and such information is disclosed to and processed by third party providers, including but not limited to Crashlytics, for purposes of collecting information about errors or issues within our applications so we may improve our applications.
We may retain any data you provide to us in an email inquiry, for the purpose of tracking the types of questions we receive.
3. Information From Other Sources
We may obtain information about you from outside sources and add to it or combine it with your Personal Information. For example, we may request credit information when you initially subscribe for service, collect demographic and marketing data about you from third parties for marketing research and analysis to improve our products/services, obtain updated address information from our shippers, or collect information from other vendors that promote and distribute our products through their own brands.
WHEN YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE SHARED OR DISCLOSED
Telenav does not sell, rent, license or otherwise share information with unaffiliated parties except as explained in this Privacy Policy.
Consent Given/Transaction Processing
We may disclose Personal Information about you to third parties with your consent. Consent is sometimes implicit, as in the disclosure of Personal Information to third-parties who complete transactions or perform services on our behalf.
If you do not want us to share your Personal Information with these companies, you may contact us at: support@telenav.com.
To the Primary Account Holder
We may disclose Personal Information of an account user to the primary account holder (the party financially responsible for the account). If a business, governmental agency, or other individual obtains service for you, that entity or individual is our customer, and we may provide Personal Information about you, or your use of the service to them or others at their direction.
Third Party Services or Third Party Service Providers
Telenav offers access to a variety of resources, including but not limited to various communication tools, search services, forums, and links to other World Wide Web sites in providing its services, products and websites. We may make certain Personal Information non-personal and share it or aggregated data with strategic partners that work with us to analyze usage, provide and improve products or services, or that help us market to customers, or for similar purposes. Information that is not Personal Information or is aggregated is not subject to any restrictions of use or disclosure under this Privacy Policy.
If you take advantage of a third party's services or products offered through the use of our services, we may disclose your Personal Information to such unaffiliated third parties. These entities may use this information that you provide in the course of your use of Telenav's services (including your name, nicknames, telephone numbers, audio files, and email and mailing addresses) to promote their products and services to you. Any such Personal Information that a third party uses will be subject to their applicable privacy policies.
Some of our services and functionality are provided in conjunction with third party service providers. These third party service providers process Personal Information on our behalf and are obligated to process such information in compliance with this Privacy Policy and other appropriate security and confidentiality measures. In cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU individuals received pursuant to the EU-US or Swiss-EU Privacy Shield, Telenav is potentially liable.
Legal Processes
We will comply with any subpoenas, court orders or other legal processes for any of the information about you in our possession, and we may use such information to establish or exercise yours, ours, or others' legal rights, or to defend against legal claims. We also may be required to disclose Personal Information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
Business Transfers
Information about you in our possession may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another provider, as well as in the unlikely event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which your Personal Information would be transferred as one of the business assets of the company. Telenav does not guarantee that any entity receiving such information in connection with one of these transactions will comply with all terms of this policy.
European Union Users
Information that we collect about you may also be transferred among our various divisions and affiliated companies around the world, which may involve transfer from countries within the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland to countries outside the EEA. By allowing Telenav to collect this information about you, you consent to these transfers, including transborder transmission of data covered by this Privacy Policy. As a result, that country's courts, governments or law enforcement agencies could obtain disclosure of such information under that country's laws.
Telenav complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss – U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States, respectively.  Telenav has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability.  If there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.
INFORMATION ON WIRELESS DEVICES
The Telenav software (and any upgrades, modifications, or additions thereto) that is factory installed or downloaded to, and resides upon your wireless device retains your manually entered account number and PIN, or reads it from the device. Having your carrier change the assigned phone number for your wireless device does not change the account number we maintain with regard to that device, which will result in your device not being able to access your Telenav account established using the previous phone number. If this happens, please contact Telenav customer care.
SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
Telenav has implemented various physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of Personal Information under our control. For instance, Telenav limits access to Telenav systems that store such information to authorized personnel. Telenav also employs the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to protect your Personal Information when you bill on our website.

Telenav Warranty and Refunds Policy
Telenav Hardware Warranties and Refunds
Telenav Bluetooth® GPS Receivers One-Year Limited Warranty 
Telenav, Inc. warrants this Telenav Bluetooth® GPS receiver against defects in material and workmanship under normal use and service for a period of one (1) year from the date of purchase by the original purchaser. This warranty is extended only to the original purchaser.
If a defect in a receiver arises and a valid claim is received by Telenav within the one-year warranty period, Telenav will, at its option, either (1) exchange the receiver with another receiver, or (2) refund the purchase price of the receiver. When a receiver is exchanged, any replacement item becomes your property and the replaced item becomes Telenav’s property. When a refund is given, the receiver for which the refund is provided must be returned to Telenav and becomes Telenav’s property.
Telenav is not responsible for your shipping and other costs to return the receiver to Telenav or its authorized representative.
This warranty does not apply to: 

Damage or loss which occurs during shipment. 
Damage caused by accident, abuse, misuse, flood, fire, earthquake or other external causes. 
Damage caused by operating the product outside the permitted or intended uses described by Telenav. 
Damage caused by service performed by anyone who is not a representative of Telenav. 
Consumable parts, such as batteries, unless damage has occurred due to a defect in materials or workmanship. 

This warranty also does not apply to any item other than the receiver. Specifically, this warranty does not cover any of the accessories shipped with your receiver, including the plug-in wall charger, the plug-in car charger, the USB cable, and the installation CD. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THIS WARRANTY AND REMEDIES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE EXCLUSIVE AND IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, REMEDIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, STATUTORY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. AS PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, TELENAV SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL STATUTORY OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. IF TELENAV CANNOT LAWFULLY DISCLAIM STATUTORY OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES THEN TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ALL SUCH WARRANTIES SHALL BE LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE DURATION OF THIS EXPRESS WARRANTY AND TO REPLACEMENT SERVICE AS DETERMINED BY TELENAV IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION. 
No Telenav reseller, agent, or employee is authorized to make any modification, extension, or addition to this warranty. Some States do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, and some States do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so one or more of the above limitations may not apply to you. 
This warranty gives you specific legal rights. You may have other rights which vary from state to state. 
How to Obtain Warranty Service
To obtain service under this warranty, call Telenav at 1-88-Telenav-4 (1-888-353-6284). You will be asked for your email address for Telenav to send you a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) number and details for returning the receiver to Telenav. Alternatively, you may receive this information verbally over the phone. The receiver must be returned in the original packaging with (i) a copy of the email from Telenav identifying your RMA number, or some other writing specifying your RMA number, and (ii) proof of purchase in the form of a copy of your original receipt. (You may keep the receiver’s activation code and the installation CD.) 
Telenav Refund Policy
Telenav GPS Navigator™
Use of the Telenav GPS Navigator service (the “Telenav Service”) requires payment of a monthly fee, which includes downloads to your wireless device of the Telenav GPS Navigator software and any upgrades, modifications, or additions thereto, but does not include any hardware that may be required for certain wireless devices (such as a GPS receiver).



    
Telenav will not refund any payments for the Telenav Service or any necessary hardware made directly to a cellular carrier (e.g., Sprint Nextel, AT&T, etc.) or otherwise not directly made to Telenav. Check with your cellular carrier for its policy on refunds of such payments.
If you pay for the Telenav Service or for any necessary hardware through a credit card at www.telenav.com or through a direct billing arrangement with Telenav, then you or Telenav may cancel your account at any time subject to the following policies: 

If you or Telenav cancel your account within the first 30 days of activation, all charges for the Telenav Service (and any hardware purchased from Telenav that you return per Telenav’s hardware return policy and procedures) will be credited back to your credit card or otherwise refunded to you, unless your account is cancelled by Telenav for cause.
For any payments for the “Telenav GPS Kit Promotion” (a free GPS receiver kit with a two-year service plan commitment), if you or Telenav cancel your account within the first 30 days and you return all hardware in the GPS receiver kit, all charges will be credited back to your credit card or otherwise refunded to you, unless your account is cancelled by Telenav for cause. Beyond the initial 30-day period, the GPS receiver kit is no longer returnable and any charges assessed for the Telenav Service are not refundable. 
If you or Telenav cancel your account at any time after the first 30 days, Telenav will discontinue charging your credit card for your monthly service fee or otherwise cease assessing charges under your direct billing arrangement, but will not refund any amounts for the current or previous months of service and will not provide a refund for any hardware purchased from Telenav. In addition, Telenav will not refund any amount of prepaid service. For example, if you purchased twelve (12) months of prepaid service and cancel your account after three (3) months, there will be no refund of any amount to you on your account. 
You will not be provided a refund for any month for which you were not charged for the Telenav Service (i.e., as a result of any free usage or other promotion). 

Telenav Shotgun™
If you pay for the Telenav Shotgun (“Shotgun”) through a credit card payment at www.telenav.com or through a direct billing arrangement with Telenav, then you may request a refund within the first 30 days after the date of purchase. Upon Telenav’s receipt of the Shotgun unit from you per the terms of this policy, the purchase price you paid for the Shotgun unit will be credited back to your credit card or otherwise refunded to you, along with any applicable sales tax. No refund will be made for any shipping or handling charges. The Shotgun unit for which the refund is provided must be returned to Telenav and becomes Telenav’s property.
Telenav is not responsible for your shipping and other costs to return the Shotgun to Telenav or its authorized representative.
To request a refund, call Telenav at 1-88-Telenav-8 (1-888-353-6288). You will be asked for your email address for Telenav to send you a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) number and details for returning the Shotgun unit to Telenav. Alternatively, you may receive this information verbally over the phone. The Shotgun unit must be returned in the original packaging including all original accessories and with (i) a copy of the email from Telenav identifying your RMA number, or some other writing specifying your RMA number, and (ii) proof of purchase in the form of a copy of your original receipt. The Shotgun unit and all original accessories must be in good physical and operational condition; damaged product will not be accepted for return. Telenav must receive your return of the Shotgun unit per the terms of this return policy within ten (10) days from the date the RMA number is provided to you. Failure to return the Shotgun unit in this timeframe, or otherwise not in compliance with the terms herein, will invalidate your RMA.
Telenav Connected Service™
Use of the Telenav Connected Service (“TCS”) which includes downloads to your wireless device of selected upgrades, modifications, or additions to TCS, requires payment of a monthly fee.
If you pay for TCS through a credit card payment at www.telenav.com or through a direct billing arrangement with Telenav, then you or Telenav may cancel your account at any time subject to the following policies:

The first 3 months of TCS is free with your purchase of a Telenav Shotgun unit, and begins from the date of first TCS activation. If you or Telenav cancel TCS within the first 30 days of first TCS activation, all charges for TCS (and the Shotgun unit purchased from Telenav that you return per Telenav’s Shotgun return policy and procedures) will be credited back to your credit card or otherwise refunded to you, unless your TCS is cancelled by Telenav for cause.
If you or Telenav cancel TCS at any time after the first 30 days of first TCS activation, Telenav will discontinue charging your credit card for your monthly service fee or otherwise cease assessing charges under your direct billing arrangement, but will not refund any amounts for the current or previous months of service and will not provide a refund for any hardware purchased from Telenav. In addition, Telenav will not refund any amount of prepaid service. For example, if you purchased twelve (12) months of prepaid service and cancel your account after three (3) months, there will be no refund of any amount to you on your account.
You will not be provided a refund for any month for which you were not charged for TCS (i.e., as a result of any free usage period or other promotion). Should you or Telenav choose to cancel TCS for any reason, you shall not be entitled to any refund of or reduction in the price of the Shotgun unit (except as expressly provided under Telenav’s Shotgun return policy and procedures).

en
fr
es

This Privacy Policy governs your use of Navigation and/or NavConnect service offered by Telenav, Inc. ("Telenav") for select automotive vehicles produced or distributed by General Motors Holdings LLC or its affiliates ("GM").  In order to provide you with navigation and related services we collect and store certain information relating to your account, your location, and your use of the navigation services.  Please review this Privacy Policy for more detail about the information that may be collected and used in connection with your use of Navigation, NavConnect, and NavConnect with Predictive Navigation. By using these products or otherwise by interacting with us, you consent to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Policy, please do not engage in any of these activities.
Telenav understands and respects your concerns about the use of your personally identifiable information, collected from you as a user of Navigation and/or NavConnect ("Personal Information"). Personal Information includes name, home address, telephone numbers including mobile telephone numbers, email addresses, and VIN numbers. Personal Information does not include anonymous or aggregate information, which after processing cannot be associated with a specific person or entity. We believe that you should know what information about you we collect, as well as how that information is used, maintained, and, in some cases, shared. The following sets forth our privacy practices and policies, applicable to Navigation and/or NavConnect users.
You acknowledge and understand that this Privacy Policy does not apply to other Telenav products or services, our business partners or other companies that Telenav does not own or operate. For information about other Telenav products and services as well as the Telenav.com website, please visit http://www.telenav.com/legal/policies. For information on how other providers of products or services handle personal information you provide through other web sites or through the use of our services in conjunction with a third party, please consult their privacy policies.
INFORMATION COLLECTED ABOUT YOU AND OUR USE OF SUCH INFORMATION
The types of personal and other information we may collect about you are primarily from three sources: (1) information you provide; (2) information automatically collected; and (3) information from other sources. How we use and maintain that information is described below.
1. Information You Provide
(a) Register/Information Related to Your Account
We receive and store Personal Information about you when you authorize our business partners to share that information with us for use with Navigation and/or NavConnect or login to Navigation and/or NavConnect using your information, and when you otherwise transmit such information to us via Navigation and/or NavConnect, or contact us by phone or email regarding our products and services. For instance, to maintain and/or verify your account we may receive certain account information from other of your accounts, with your consent, including your name, email address, vehicle information and whether your NavConnect subscription is active. We may also assign you a separate and unique Telenav ID number, which may be stored and used to manage your account and provide you with customer support, and perform research and analysis about your use of our products and services.
Through GM, Navigation and/or NavConnect, you have the option of providing us with your home and work addresses, which we store in our database, to enable you to quickly navigate to those destinations and readily access other features of Navigation and/or NavConnect. Through Navigation or NavConnect you can also create a list of "favorite" addresses and points of interest. Within Navigation and/or NavConnect you also have the option to use Navigation and/or NavConnect settings menu to customize your experience, for example by selecting your navigation preferences, setting up traffic reports, and selecting your preferred gas grade for searches. For NavConnect subscribers, we store these addresses and setting preferences in our cloud database so that you can access them from Navigation and/or NavConnect. For Navigation users, this information is stored locally on the navigation system in your vehicle.
We may also use the information that we collect about you to manage your account and provide you with customer support, perform research and analysis about your use of our products and services, to inform you from time to time within Navigation and/or NavConnect about products or services that we think may interest you, unless you inform us that you opt out from receiving such communications.  We may share certain information we collect about you and your usage activity with GM on a non-identifiable basis for the purpose of performing research and analysis about users of its products and services.
(b) Contact Our Customer Service Representatives/ Feedback
GM may use your email address or phone number to contact you with regard to Navigation or your NavConnect subscription, such as to communicate that it is about to expire or to respond to any inquiry or feedback you submit with GM Customer Service Representatives, by email or from within Navigation and/or NavConnect.
If you provide feedback regarding a routing or map issue, we may share your comments and anonymized location data with our third party map provider.
(c) Request for Information
When you request additional information about Navigation or NavConnect, the information collected through these requests may include your name, phone number, and email address. We will use this information to provide you with details about these services, and in accordance with requirements under applicable law, we may use this information to promote our services to you in the future, unless you inform us that you opt out from receiving such communications.
(d) Public Forums
If you use or link to public forums such as social networking services, blogs on Telenav or non-Telenav websites, internet bulletin boards, or chat rooms, be aware that any personal information you submit can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, including to send you unsolicited messages. Telenav cannot prevent the distribution and use of such information by other parties.
2. Information Automatically Collected
We automatically receive certain types of information, some of which may be associated with Personal Information, when you use Navigation and/or NavConnect.
(a) Information Related to Your Location and Route or Other User Content
Each time you access Navigation, we record your location, search and route information, including your point of origin or current location, the address of your destination, the starting time of your trip, and the route you are instructed to follow. When you are in an active Navigation session, we periodically record your current location, data from your vehicle's sensors, and GPS heading and speed from the GPS hardware associated with your vehicle in order to provide you with your route. Navigation will save and display your most recent destinations to allow you to easily navigate to these destinations again.
When you choose to use your current location for specifying the locale for a business finder search, or obtaining a map, we use your location information for the requested purpose, and then discard it. We anonymously record any search activities and results for comparative analysis.
For NavConnect users with an active subscription who have opted-in to use Connectivity, this location and route information will be stored in our secure cloud database, where we may keep such information for up to five years to improve our services and to provide other features that may enhance your service capabilities, functions, and your user experience.  For NavConnect users, other address data, including home and work addresses, favorite places, and recent destinations will also be stored with your account information in our secure cloud database until your account is deleted.
For NavConnect users who have enabled the Predictive Navigation functionality, we will regularly receive and record location data from your vehicle's GPS hardware, whenever you are operating your vehicle.  This data will be stored in our secured cloud database and we will use such information to customize and improve your navigation and search experience, for example to provide preferred brand point of interest search results, personalized routing, and commute alerts.
You can update your Predictive Navigation options (including disabling Predictive Navigation) at any time by accessing the Navigation Settings menu.
(b) Information About Your Vehicle Systems
We may receive and store limited vehicle data from the vehicle systems, for example, ambient temperature, seat sensors on/off, and ignition on/off, which may be used to optimize the safety functionality of Navigation.  For Navigation-only users, this data will be stored indefinitely in your Navigation system's local memory.  For NavConnect users with an active subscription, this data will be stored in our secure cloud database for up to five years from the date of collection.
(c) Information About Your Use of Navigation Services
When you use Navigation and/or NavConnect, we log certain information relating to your use of Navigation and/or NavConnect and the Navigation performance. For example, we may collect data about what actions you take within a session, such as the type of search you performed or what kind of route you selected.
(d) Other Information
When you use the voice command or entry features on our services, we receive the text transcription from your audible utterance (what you said) and that text data may be stored for up to five years.
WHEN YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE SHARED OR DISCLOSED
Telenav does not sell, rent, license or otherwise share information relating to your use of Navigation or NavConnect with unaffiliated parties except as explained in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required or permitted by applicable law.
Consent Given/Transaction Processing
We may disclose Personal Information about you to third parties who complete transactions or perform services on our behalf.  Your use of the Navigation and/or NavConnect may constitute consent to such disclosure.
Third Party Services or Third Party Service Providers
Telenav may make certain Personally Information non-personal and share it or anonymous, aggregated data with strategic partners that work with us to analyze usage, provide and improve products or services, or that help us market to customers, or for similar purposes. Information that is not personally identifiable or is aggregated is not subject to any restrictions of use or disclosure under this Privacy Policy.
Some of the Navigation and NavConnect services and functionality are provided by or in conjunction with third party service providers. These third party service providers process Personal Information on our behalf and are obligated to process such information in compliance with this Privacy Policy and other appropriate security and confidentiality measures. Our service providers are given the information they need to perform their designated functions, and we do not authorize them to use or disclose personal information for their own marketing or other purposes. Personal information may be maintained and processed by us, our affiliates and other third party service providers in the US or other jurisdictions. In cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU individuals received pursuant to the EU-US Privacy Shield, Telenav is potentially liable.
Legal Processes
We, our affiliates and service providers will comply with any applicable subpoenas, court orders or other legal processes for information about you in our possession, and we may use and disclose Personal Information to establish or exercise yours, ours, or others' legal rights, or to defend against legal claims. We also may be required to disclose Personal Information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
Business Transfers
Information about you in our possession may be disclosed as part of a prospective or completed merger, acquisition, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another provider, as well as in the unlikely event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which your personal information would be transferred as one of the business assets of the company. Telenav does not guarantee that any entity receiving such information in connection with one of these transactions will comply with all terms of this policy.
European Union Users
Information that we collect about you may also be transferred among our various divisions and affiliated companies around the world, which may involve transfer from countries within the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland to countries outside the EEA. By allowing Telenav to collect this information about you, you consent to these transfers, including transborder transmission of data covered by this privacy policy. As a result, that country's courts, governments or law enforcement agencies could obtain disclosure of such information under that country's laws.
Telenav complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries.  Telenav has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability.

Telenav has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.  If there is any conflict between the policies in this privacy policy and the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles, the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles shall govern.

SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
Telenav has implemented various physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in an effort to protect the confidentiality and security of personal information in our custody and under our control. For instance, Telenav limits access to Telenav systems that store such information to authorized personnel.
While Telenav maintains a multitude of security measures to prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of your Personal Information, no security measures are absolute or wholly guaranteed. Telenav will make reasonable attempts to notify you if it determines there were unauthorized acts by third parties that violate the law or this policy, or other security breaches, or where otherwise required by law.
Telenav will maintain your Personal Information for as long as a business need exists, or as required by applicable laws, regulations, or government orders. When we dispose of Personal Information, we use commercially reasonable procedures to erase, anonymize or render it unreadable.
CHILDREN'S PRIVACY
Telenav will not knowingly request or collect Personal Information from any person under 13 years of age without prior verifiable parental or legal guardian consent. If, however, you authorize a child to use our services or products by providing them access to a vehicle or device with access to Navigation, NavConnect and/or other Telenav services or products, any Personal Information associated with such use will be treated as your information in accordance with this policy. Telenav encourages parents to be involved in the online activities (including wireless Internet browsing) of their children to ensure that no information is collected from a child without parental or Guardian consent.

Afin de vous fournir des services de navigation et des services connexes, nous recueillons et stockons certains renseignements relatifs à votre compte, à votre localisation et à votre utilisation des services de navigation. Veuillez lire la présente politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels pour obtenir des détails supplémentaires au sujet des renseignements qui pourraient être recueillis et utilisés dans le cadre de votre utilisation de Navigation, de NavConnect et de NavConnect avec Predictive Navigation. En utilisant ces produits ou en interagissant autrement avec nous, vous indiquez être d'accord avec la présente politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels.

Telenav comprend et respecte vos préoccupations au sujet de l'utilisation des renseignements permettant de vous identifier qui sont recueillis à votre sujet en tant qu'utilisateur de Navigation et/ou de NavConnect (les « renseignements personnels »). Les renseignements personnels comprennent le nom, l'adresse domiciliaire, les numéros de téléphone, y compris les numéros de téléphone cellulaire, adresses électroniques et numéros d'identification de véhicule. Les renseignements personnels ne comprennent pas les renseignements anonymes ou regroupés qui, une fois traités, ne peuvent être associés à une personne ou à une entité en particulier. Nous estimons que vous devriez savoir quel type de renseignements nous recueillons et comment ces renseignements sont utilisés, conservés et, dans certains cas, partagés. Nos pratiques et politiques en matière de protection des renseignements personnels applicables aux utilisateurs de Navigation et/ou de NavConnect sont décrites ci après.
Vous comprenez que la présente politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels ne s'applique pas à d'autres produits ou services de Telenav, à nos partenaires commerciaux et à d'autres sociétés dont Telenav n'a pas la propriété ou qu'elle n'exploite pas. Pour obtenir des renseignements au sujet d'autres produits et services de Telenav ainsi que sur le site Web Telenav.com, veuillez visiter http://www.telenav.com/legal/policies.

RENSEIGNEMENTS RECUEILLIS À VOTRE SUJET ET MANIÈRE DONT NOUS LES UTILISONS
Le type de renseignements personnels et d'autres renseignements que nous pourrions recueillir à votre sujet proviennent principalement de trois sources : 1) l'information que vous fournissez; 2) l'information qui est recueillie automatiquement et 3) l'information provenant d'autres sources. La manière dont nous utilisons et conservons cette information est décrite ci après.
1. Information que vous fournissez
a) Inscription/information liée à votre compte
Nous recevons et stockons des renseignements personnels à votre sujet lorsque vous autorisez nos partenaires commerciaux à partager cette information avec nous aux fins d'utilisation avec Navigation et/ou NavConnect ou que vous vous connectez à Navigation et/ou à NavConnect à l'aide de vos renseignements, et lorsque vous nous transmettez autrement cette information par l'intermédiaire de Navigation et/ou de NavConnect ou que vous communiquez avec nous par téléphone ou par courriel au sujet de nos produits et services. Par exemple, aux fins de la tenue et/ou de la vérification de votre compte, nous pourrions recevoir certains renseignements sur le compte provenant de certains autres de vos comptes, avec votre consentement, notamment votre nom, votre adresse électronique, des renseignements sur votre véhicule et si votre abonnement à NavConnect est actif. Nous pourrions également vous attribuer un numéro d'identification Telenav distinct et unique, qui pourrait être stocké et utilisé aux fins de gestion de votre compte et pour vous fournir le service de soutien à la clientèle ainsi qu'effectuer des recherches et analyses au sujet de votre utilisation de nos produits et services.
Par l'intermédiaire de GM, de Navigation et/ou de NavConnect, vous avez la possibilité de nous fournir vos adresses à domicile et au travail, que nous stockons dans notre base de données, pour vous permettre de naviguer rapidement vers ces destinations et d'accéder facilement à d'autres fonctionnalités de Navigation et/ou de NavConnect.

À l'égard des abonnés à NavConnect, nous stockons ces adresses et préférences de paramètres dans nos serveurs de bases de données de sorte qu'ils puissent y accéder à partir de Navigation et/ou de NavConnect. En ce qui concerne les utilisateurs de Navigation, cette information est stockée localement sur le système de navigation situé dans votre véhicule.
Nous pourrions également utiliser l'information que nous recueillons auprès de vous pour gérer votre compte et vous fournir un soutien à la clientèle, effectuer des recherches et des analyses à propos de votre utilisation de nos produits et services, vous informer à l'occasion à l'aide de Navigation et/ou de NavConnect des produits ou services qui, selon nous, pourraient vous intéresser, sauf si vous nous indiquez ne plus vouloir recevoir ces communications.

2. Information recueillie automatiquement
Nous recevons automatiquement certains types de renseignements, dont certains peuvent être associés à des renseignements personnels, lorsque vous utilisez Navigation et/ou NavConnect.

Chaque fois que vous accédez à Navigation, nous enregistrons votre localisation, vos recherches et vos itinéraires, y compris votre point d'origine ou localisation actuelle, l'adresse de votre destination, l'heure du début de votre déplacement et l'itinéraire qu'on vous a indiqué de suivre.

c) Information au sujet de votre utilisation des services de Navigation
Lorsque vous utilisez Navigation et/ou NavConnect, nous stockons certains renseignements au sujet de votre utilisation de Navigation et/ou de NavConnect et du rendement de Navigation.

Telenav ne vend pas ni ne loue, ne concède sous licence ou ne partage autrement les renseignements concernant votre utilisation de Navigation ou de NavConnect avec des parties qui ne sont pas membres de son groupe, sauf comme il est indiqué dans la présente politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels ou comme les lois applicables l'exigent ou l'autorisent.
Consentements donnés/traitement d'opérations
Nous pourrions communiquer des renseignements personnels à votre sujet à des tiers qui effectuent des opérations ou fournissent des services pour notre compte. Votre utilisation de Navigation et/ou de NavConnect peut constituer un consentement à la communication de tels renseignements.
Services de tiers ou fournisseurs de services tiers
Telenav peut rendre certains renseignements personnels non personnels et les partager ou partager des données regroupées anonymes avec des partenaires stratégiques qui travaillent avec nous pour analyser l'utilisation de produits ou services ainsi que fournir et améliorer des produits ou services ou qui nous aident à commercialiser des produits ou services auprès de clients, ou à des fins similaires. Les renseignements qui ne permettent pas d'identifier une personne ou qui sont regroupés ne sont assujettis à aucune restriction d'utilisation ou de communication en vertu de la présente politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels.
Certains des services et fonctionnalités de Navigation et de NavConnect sont fournis par ou conjointement avec des fournisseurs de services tiers. Ces fournisseurs de services tiers traitent les renseignements personnels pour notre compte et sont tenus de le faire en conformité avec la présente politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels et d'autres mesures appropriées en matière de sécurité et de confidentialité. Nos fournisseurs de services obtiennent l'information dont ils ont besoin pour s'acquitter de leurs fonctions désignées, et nous ne les autorisons pas à utiliser ou à communiquer des renseignements personnels aux fins de commercialisation ou à d'autres fins personnelles. Nous, les membres de notre groupe ou d'autres fournisseurs de services tiers aux États Unis ou dans d'autres territoires pouvons tenir et traiter les renseignements personnels. En cas de transfert ultérieur à des tiers de données concernant des personnes de l'UE reçues en vertu du « Bouclier de confidentialité UE-US » (UE-US Privacy Shield), Telenav est potentiellement responsable.
Procédures judiciaires
Nous, les membres de notre groupe et nos fournisseurs de services canadiens, américains et autres nous conformerons aux assignations à témoigner, aux ordonnances des tribunaux ou aux autres procédures judiciaires applicables relativement aux renseignements à votre sujet que nous avons en notre possession, et nous pourrions utiliser et communiquer des renseignements personnels pour établir vos ou nos droits ou ceux de tiers, exercer nos droits ou pour nous défendre contre des réclamations.

INFORMACION QUE RECABAMOS DE USTED Y FORMA EN QUE LA UTILIZAMOS
Los tipos de información, personal y de otra naturaleza, que recabamos de usted, provienen inicialmente de tres fuentes: (1) la información proporcionada por usted; (2) la información que se recaba automáticamente, y ; (3)la información que se recaba mediante otras fuentes.  La manera en que utilizamos y administramos toda esta información se describe a continuación.
1.  Información proporcionada por usted:
(a) Para registrar / Información relativa a su cuenta.
Nosotros recibimos y guardamos información personal suya, cuando usted autoriza a nuestros socios de negocio para que la compartan con nosotros,  para usarla con la Navegación y/o NavConnet, o ingresar a estos, utilizándola; cuando usted, de alguna otra manera, nos transmite dicha información vía la Navegación y/o el NavConnet, o; cuando usted nos contacta telefónicamente o por correo electrónico, con relación a nuestros productos y servicios.  Por ejemplo, para administrar y/o verificar su cuenta, podemos recibir, con su consentimiento,  determinada información relativa a otra de sus cuentas, incluyendo su nombre, correo electrónico, información de su vehículo y el saber si su suscripción a NavConnect se encuentra activa.  También podremos asignarle un número de identificación Telenav, único y separado, el cual podrá almacenarse y ser utilizado para administrar su cuenta, brindarle el servicio al cliente, así como realizar la investigación y análisis del uso que haga de nuestros productos y servicios.
A través de GM, de la navegación y/o de NavConnect, usted tiene la opción de proporcionarnos las direcciones de su casa y oficina, mismas que guardaremos en nuestra base de datos, para permitirle un rápido desplazamiento a dichos destinos e que ingrese a otras características de navegación y/o NavConnect.  Con nuestros productos usted también puede generar una lista de direcciones y lugares de interés "favoritos".  Dentro de la navegación y/o de NavConnect usted también tiene la opción de utilizar el menú de configuración para personalizar su experiencia, por ejemplo, al seleccionar las preferencias de navegación, activar reportes del tránsito, así como seleccionar el tipo de combustible que prefiere y realizar su búsqueda.  Para nuestros suscriptores a NavConnect, almacenamos estas direcciones y preferencias en nuestra base de datos de la nube, a fin de que usted pueda acceder a ellas desde la navegación  y/o el NavConnect mismo.
Podremos también utilizar su información para administrar su cuenta y proporcionarle servicio de apoyo al cliente; conducir investigaciones y análisis acerca del uso que realiza de nuestros productos y servicios; informarle periódicamente,  a través de la navegación y/o de NavConnect acerca de los productos y servicios que pensamos pueden ser de su interés, a menos que nos informe que desea quedar fuera de la recepción de dichas comunicaciones.

Telenav no puede prevenir la distribución y uso de dicha información por parte de terceros.
2.  Información recabada automáticamente
Cuando usted utiliza la navegación o NavConnect, nosotros recibimos automáticamente cierto tipo de información, parte de la cual puede estar asociada con  información personal.
(a) Información relacionada con su ubicación y ruta o contenido de otro usuario:
Cada vez que usted ingresa a la navegación, nosotros grabamos su ubicación, la información sobre búsquedas y rutas, incluyendo su punto de origen o ubicación actual, domicilio de destino, hora en que inicia su viaje, así como la ruta que ha instruido a seguir. Cuando se encuentra en una sesión de navegación activa,  grabamos periódicamente su ubicación actual, datos de los sensores de su vehículo, encabezado de su GPS, así como su velocidad, a partir del hardware del GPS asociado a su vehículo.  La navegación salvará y mostrará sus destinos más recientes para que pueda trasladarse nuevamente hacia ellos con facilidad.
Cuando usted elige su ubicación actual de geolocalización para especificar el lugar, a fin de realizar la búsqueda de un negocio u obtener un mapa, usaremos dicha información sólo para la finalidad necesaria y después la desecharemos. Grabaremos, de manera anónima, todas los ejercicios de búsqueda y resultados con fines de análisis comparativos.
Para los usuarios, con suscripción activa a NavConnect, que han optado por usar la conectividad, dicha ubicación e información de ruta se alojará en nuestra base de datos virtual (en la Nube) segura, donde podremos almacenarla hasta por cinco años a fin de mejorar nuestros servicios y proporcionarles otras características que mejoren sus capacidades, funciones y su experiencia de usuario.  Para los usuarios de Navconnect, otros datos de dirección, incluyendo las de casa y trabajo, lugares preferidos y destinos recientes se guardarán también junto con su información de cuenta en nuestra base de datos segura en la nube hasta que su cuenta sea borrada.
Para los usuarios de NavConnect que han habilitado la función de navegación predictiva, recibiremos y guardaremos de manera regular sus datos de ubicación proporcionados por el hardware de geolocalización de su vehículo, siempre que se encuentren utilizando el automóvil.  Dichos datos se almacenarán en nuestra base de datos segura en la nube hasta por 5 años, para poder personalizar y mejorar su navegación y experiencia de búsqueda y así proporcionarles, por ejemplo, los resultados sobre puntos de interés de marcas preferidos, personalizando rutas y alertas de viajes al trabajo.
Usted puede actualizar las opciones de navegación predictiva (incluyendo su inhabilitación) en cualquier momento, ingresando al menú de opciones de navegación.
(b)  Información de los sistemas de su vehículo.
Nosotros podemos recibir una cantidad limitada de datos su vehículo, emitidos por   los sistemas del mismo, por ejemplo, temperatura ambiente, activación o apagado de los sensores de los asientos, los cuales pueden utilizarse para optimizar la funcionalidad segura de la navegación.  Únicamente para los usuarios de la Navegación, estos datos se guardarán en la memoria local de su sistema de navegación indefinidamente.  Para los usuarios NavConnect, estos datos se guardarán en una base de datos segura en la nube por hasta cinco años a partir de la fecha en que sean recabados.
(c) Información acerca del uso que haga de los servicios de navegación.
Cuando use la navegación y/o NavConnect, registraremos cierta información sobre el uso que hace de la Navegación y/o NavConnect, así como de la ejecución de dicha Navegación.

We believe that you should know what information about you we collect, as well as how that information is used, maintained, and, in some cases, shared. The following sets forth our privacy practices and policies, applicable to the Scout GPS Link application users and account holders.
You acknowledge and understand that this privacy policy does not apply to other Telenav products or services, our business partners or other companies that Telenav does not own or operate. For information about other Telenav products and services as well as the Telenav.com website, please visit http://www.telenav.com/legal/policies.html. For information on how other providers of products or services handle personal information you provide through other web sites or through the use of our services in conjunction with a third party, please consult their privacy policies.
INFORMATION COLLECTED ABOUT YOU AND OUR USE OF SUCH INFORMATION
The types of personal and other information we may collect about you are primarily from three sources: (1) information you provide; (2) information automatically collected; and (3) information from other sources. How we use and maintain that information is described below.
1. Information You Provide
(a) Register/Information Related to Your Account
We collect and store personal information about you when you register for an account to use our Scout GPS Link application or login to Scout GPS Link using your Scout mobile account information, and when you otherwise transmit such information to us via the Scout GPS Link application, or contact us by phone or email regarding your account. For instance, to maintain and/or verify your account we collect and store in a database your User ID, name, email address, account password your mobile operating system, mobile phone model, head unit device-type ID. You may also be given the option to provide a profile photo, which will be stored with your account information.  From the device, we collect IDFA, (or Android ID if IDFA is unavailable) 
When you choose to access Scout GPS Link through a Facebook log-in, we collect your name, profile picture, email, Facebook password and your Facebook contacts list with your permission.  Your name will be displayed and stored within our application and your email and Facebook password will be stored to provide future access to our application. We may use this email to contact you regarding your account and/or to respond to any inquiry or feedback you submit from within our applications as described in section (b) below. If you want to revoke authorization for the application to interact with your Facebook account, you can remove the application from the list of permitted Apps or turn off the Platform for Apps, Plugin and Websites from the Settings menu for your Facebook account.
When you choose to access Scout GPS Link through a Google Sign in, we collect your email, basic profile information and Google password with your permission, which will be stored to provide future access to our application. We may use this email to contact you regarding your account and/or to respond to any inquiry or feedback you submit from within our applications as described in section (b) below.
You have the option of providing us with your home and work addresses, which we store in our database, to enable you to quickly navigate to those destinations and readily access other features of the application. You can also create a list of "favorite" addresses and points of interest. Within the application you also have the option to use the application's settings menu to personalize your experience, for example by selecting your navigation preferences, setting up traffic reports, and selecting your preferred gas grade for searches. We store these addresses and settings in our database so that you can access them from your account, even if you change vehicles or mobile devices.
We may also use the information that we collect about you to manage your account and provide you with customer support, perform research and analysis about your use of our products and services, to inform you from time to time about features, products or services that we think will interest you, unless you inform us that you opt out from receiving such communications.  We may share certain information we collect about you and your usage activity with our third party auto partners for the purpose of performing research and analysis about users of our products and services. However, any data will be aggregated and all of your Personal Information will be removed before sharing with such partners.
(b) Contact Our Customer Service Representatives/In-App Feedback
We may use your email address to contact you with regard to your account, such as to confirm any change to your phone number, and to respond to any inquiry or feedback you submit by email or from within the Scout GPS Link application.
Additionally, if you provide feedback regarding a routing or map issue within one of our applications, we may share your comments and anonymized data about your location and route with the OpenStreetMap community for purposes of improving OpenStreetMap data.
(d) Request for Information
When you request additional information about one of our services either via the Telenav website or via one of our partners, such as Toyota, the information we collect through these requests may include your name, phone number, and email address. We will use this information to provide you with details about our services, and we may use this information to promote our services to you in the future, unless you inform us that you opt out from receiving such communications. To understand what a partner of ours may do with information about you in the partner's custody, you should check the privacy policy of that partner.
(g) Public Forums
If you use or link to public forums such as social networking services, blogs on Telenav or non-Telenav websites, internet bulletin boards, or chat rooms, be aware that any personal information you submit can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, including to send you unsolicited messages. Telenav cannot prevent the distribution and use of such information by other parties.
2. Information Automatically Collected
We automatically receive certain types of information, some of which may be associated with personal information, when you use the Scout GPS Link application.
(a) Information Related to Your Location and Route or Other User Content
Each time you access the Scout GPS Link application, we record your location and route information, including your point of origin, the address of your destination, the starting time of your trip, the route you are instructed to follow, and your arrival time (if applicable). We record your current location when your wireless device requests a rerouting (which occurs, for example, when you deviate from the specified instructions). When you are in an active navigation session, we periodically receive your current location, GPS heading and speed from the GPS hardware associated with your wireless device. We maintain a database with these locations and route information, and may keep such information indefinitely to improve our map coverage and to provide other features that may enhance and personalize your service capabilities, functions, and your user experience. The application will display your most recent destinations to allow you to easily navigate to these destinations again. When you choose to use your current GPS location for specifying the locale for a business finder search, or obtaining a map, we use your location information for the requested purpose. We anonymously record any search activities and results for comparative analysis. Further, we anonymously record transactions for the purpose of paying directory listing providers.
Scout GPS Link includes a location and information sharing feature that enables you to share your location or other information with another party. These location exchanges are transmitted within the application or via the internet or text messages using SMS. For example, when you create, join, or navigate to a Meet Up with the Scout GPS Link application, your name, current location and/or ETA at the Meet Up location will be displayed on a map visible by other Meet Up participants.  The Meet Up and your location and/or ETA will be removed from the map visible to other participants when you delete the Meet Up.  We record these location exchanges, and may keep such information indefinitely. 
Additionally, you can allow the Scout GPS Link application to access the data stored in the address book on your mobile device. Our applications may use data from your address book or from your Facebook or Google+ contacts (if you signed in with a Facebook  or Google+ sign-in)  to allow you to search for and navigate to the addresses of your contacts or create a Meet Up within the application. We will only access this data if you have given permissions for the Scout GPS Link application to do so, and you can revoke such permissions at any time by changing the settings on your mobile device.
(b) Information About Your Use of the Application
When you use the Scout GPS Link application, we log certain information your use of the application and the application's performance. For example, we may collect data about what actions you take within the application such as whether the vehicle's head unit is being used, the type of search you performed or what caused an application crash. This data will be stored indefinitely to allow us to improve the application. This data may be shared with our third party auto partners in anonymized, aggregated form. Your Personal Information will be removed before any data is shared.
We will also collect information relating to the performance of our applications, including the state of your device at the time of an error or issue with the application, and such information is disclosed to and processed by third party providers, including but not limited to Crashlytics, for purposes of collecting information about errors or issues within our applications so we may improve our applications.
(c) Other Information
When you use the voice command or entry features on our services, we record your audible utterance (what you said) and that recording is shared with our third party voice recognition partner, who will use the data solely for voice recognition purposes.
WHEN YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE SHARED OR DISCLOSED
Telenav does not sell, rent, license or otherwise share information with unaffiliated parties except as explained in this privacy policy.
Consent Given/Transaction Processing
We may disclose personal information about you to third parties with your consent. Consent is sometimes implicit, as in the disclosure of personal information to third-parties who complete transactions or perform services on our behalf. Third Party Services or Third Party Service Providers.
Telenav may make certain personally identifiable information non-personal and share it or anonymized, aggregated data with strategic partners that work with us to analyze usage, provide and improve products or services, or that help us market to customers, or for similar purposes. Information that is not personally identifiable or is aggregated is not subject to any restrictions of use or disclosure under this privacy policy.
If you take advantage of a third party's services or products offered through the use of our services, we may disclose your personal information to such unaffiliated third parties. These entities may use this information that you provide in the course of your use of Telenav's services (including your name, , telephone number, and email address) to promote their products and services to you. Any such personal information that a third party uses will be subject to their applicable privacy policies.
Some of the application's services and functionality are provided in conjunction with third party service providers. These third party service providers process personal information on our behalf and are obligated to process such information in compliance with this privacy policy and other appropriate security and confidentiality measures.
Legal Processes
We will comply with any subpoenas, court orders or other legal processes for any of the information about you in our possession, and we may use such information to establish or exercise yours, ours, or others' legal rights, or to defend against legal claims.
Business Transfers
Information about you in our possession may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another provider, as well as in the unlikely event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which your personal information would be transferred as one of the business assets of the company. Telenav does not guarantee that any entity receiving such information in connection with one of these transactions will comply with all terms of this policy.
SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
Telenav has implemented various physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of personal information under our control. For instance, Telenav limits access to Telenav systems that store such information to authorized personnel. Telenav also employs the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to protect your personal information when you bill on our website.
While Telenav maintains a multitude of security measures to prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of your personal information, no security measures are absolute or wholly guaranteed. Telenav will make reasonable attempts to notify you if it determines there were unauthorized acts by third parties that violate the law or this policy, or other security breaches, or where otherwise required by law.
Telenav will maintain your personal information for as long as a business need exists, or as required by applicable laws, regulations, or government orders. When we dispose of personal information, we use commercially reasonable procedures to erase or render it unreadable.
CHILDREN'S PRIVACY
Telenav will not knowingly request or collect personal information from any person under 13 years of age without prior verifiable parental or legal guardian consent. If, however, you authorize a child to use our services or products by providing them a device associated with your Telenav service, any personal information associated with such use will be treated as your information in accordance with this policy. Telenav encourages parents to be involved in the online activities (including wireless Internet browsing) of their children to ensure that no information is collected from a child without parental or Guardian consent.
CUSTOMER REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION
Customers are entitled to request information concerning whether a business has disclosed personal information to any affiliated companies or third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Customers are further entitled to request access to their personal information under Telenav's control. To protect your privacy and security, Telenav will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before providing you access or making corrections. Good faith efforts to resolve requests to correct inaccuracies in personal information will be made by Telenav, except where the request is unreasonable. As stated in this privacy policy, Telenav will not sell or share your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes without your consent. Customers who wish to request further information about our compliance with this law or have questions or concerns about our privacy practices and policies may contact us at support@telenav.com or write to the attention of Privacy Policy Officer, Telenav, Inc., 950 DeGuigne Dr., Sunnyvale, CA 94085-3900, USA.

OTHER AGREEMENTS
Telenav may enter into written product or service agreements with customers that contain specific provisions related to confidentiality, security or other handling of information. If this privacy policy conflicts with any provision of those terms and agreements (both US and international), those terms and agreements govern to the extent of the inconsistency.

You acknowledge and understand that this privacy policy does not apply to Telenav websites, other Telenav products or services, our business partners or other companies that Telenav does not own or operate.

Personal Information may include name, home address, telephone numbers including mobile telephone numbers, location information, Mobile Subscriber Identifier, Mobile Equipment Identifier, and email addresses. Personal Information does not include anonymous or aggregate information, which cannot be associated with a specific person. We believe that you should know what information about you we collect, as well as how that information is used, maintained, and, in some cases, shared. The following sets forth our privacy practices and policies, applicable to the Scout GPS Link application users and account holders.
INFORMATION COLLECTED ABOUT YOU AND OUR USE OF SUCH INFORMATION
The types of Personal Information we may collect about you are primarily from three sources: (1) information you provide; (2) information automatically collected; and (3) information from other sources. How we use and maintain that information is described below.
1. Information You Provide
(a) Register/Information Related to Your Account
We collect and store Personal Information about you when you register for an account to use our Scout GPS Link application or login to Scout GPS Link, and when you otherwise transmit such information to us via the Scout GPS Link application, or contact us by phone or email regarding your account. For instance, to maintain and/or verify your account we collect and store in a database your name, email address, account password your mobile operating system, mobile phone model, head unit device-type ID. From the device, we collect a device ID such as IDFA or Android Advertising ID.
When you choose to access Scout GPS Link through a Facebook log-in, we collect your name, profile picture, email, and your Facebook contacts list with your permission in order to facilitate your log-in. Your name will be displayed and stored within our application and your email and Facebook password will be stored to provide future access to our application. We may use this email to contact you regarding your account and/or to respond to any inquiry or feedback you submit from within our applications as described in section (b) below. If you want to revoke authorization for the application to interact with your Facebook account, you can log-out of Facebook from within the Scout GPS Link account settings menu, remove the application from the list of permitted Apps, or turn off the Platform for Apps, Plugin and Websites from the Settings menu for your Facebook account.
When you choose to access Scout GPS Link through a Google Sign In, we collect your email and basic profile information, which will be stored to provide future access to our application in order to facilitate your log-in. We may use this email to contact you regarding your account and/or to respond to any inquiry or feedback you submit from within our applications as described in section (b) below.
You have the option of providing us with your home and work addresses, which we store in our database, to enable you to quickly navigate to those destinations and readily access other features of the application. You can also create a list of "favorite" addresses and points of interest. Within the application you also have the option to use the application's settings menu to personalize your experience, for example by selecting your navigation preferences, setting up traffic reports, and selecting your preferred gas grade for searches. We store these addresses and settings in our database so that you can access them from your account, even if you change vehicles or mobile devices.
We may also use the information that we collect about you to manage your account and provide you with customer support and to perform research and analysis about your use of our products and services. We may share certain information we collect about you and your usage activity with our third party auto partners for the purpose of performing research and analysis about users of our products and services. However, any data will be aggregated and all of your Personal Information will be removed before sharing with such partners.
(b) Contact Our Customer Service Representatives/In-App Feedback
We may use your email address to contact you with regard to your account, such as to confirm any change to your phone number, and to respond to any inquiry or feedback you submit by email or from within the Scout GPS Link application. If you contact us with a comment, question or complaint, you may be asked for information that identifies you (such as your name, address and a phone number) along with any additional information we may need to help us promptly answer your question or respond to your comment or complaint. We may retain this information to assist you in the future and to improve our customer service and product and service offerings.
Additionally, if you provide feedback regarding a routing or map issue within one of our applications, we may share your comments in non-identifiable form and anonymized data about your location and route with the OpenStreetMap community for purposes of improving OpenStreetMap data.
2. Information Automatically Collected
We automatically receive certain types of information, some of which may be Personal Information, when you use the Scout GPS Link application.
(a) Information Related to Your Location and Route or Other User Content
Each time you access or use the Scout GPS Link application (including when you search for a nearby address or Point of Interest within the application running on your mobile device, when you are in an active navigation session within the application running on your mobile device, or when your mobile device running the application is connected to your Toyota vehicle), we record your GPS location and route information, including your point of origin, the address of your destination, the starting time of your trip, the route you are instructed to follow, and your arrival time (if applicable). We record your current location when your wireless device requests a rerouting (which occurs, for example, when you deviate from the specified instructions). When you are in an active navigation session, we periodically receive your current location, GPS heading and speed from the GPS hardware associated with your wireless device in order to provide you with and update your route. We maintain a database with these locations and route information, and may keep such information for up to five (5) years to improve our map coverage and to provide other features that may enhance and personalize your service capabilities, functions, and your user experience.
We may also periodically receive your current location from the GPS hardware associated with your wireless device for the purpose of providing enhanced services, including traffic flow data for you and other users of the application. When your location, GPS heading and speed are used for these purposes, we remove any Personal Information, such as your phone number, prior to storing. We may share such location data in a non-identifiable or anonymized form with our third party partners performing research and analysis about traffic conditions and road segment usage. The application will display your most recent destinations to allow you to easily navigate to these destinations again. When you choose to use your current GPS location for specifying the locale for a business finder search, or obtaining a map, we use your location information for the requested purpose. We anonymously record any search activities and results in order to improve our search functionality. Further, we anonymously record transactions for the purpose of determining our payment obligations to directory listing providers.
Additionally, you can allow the Scout GPS Link application to access the data stored in the address book on your mobile device. Our applications may use data from your address book to allow you to search for and navigate to the addresses of your contacts within the application. We will only access this data if you have given permissions for the Scout GPS Link application to do so, and you can revoke such permissions at any time by changing the settings on your mobile device.
(b) Information About Your Use of the Application
When you use the Scout GPS Link application, we log certain information regarding your use of the application and the application's performance. For example, we may collect data about what actions you take within the application such as whether the vehicle's head unit is being used, the type of search you performed or what caused an application crash. This data will be stored indefinitely to allow us to improve the application. This data may be shared with our third party auto partners in a non-identifiable, aggregated form. Your Personal Information will be removed before any data is shared.
We will also collect information relating to the performance of our applications, including the state of your device at the time of an error or issue with the application, and such information is disclosed to and processed by third party providers, including but not limited to Crashlytics, for purposes of collecting information about errors or issues within our applications so we may improve our applications.
WHEN YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE SHARED OR DISCLOSED
Telenav does not sell, rent, license or otherwise share information with unaffiliated parties except as explained in this privacy policy.
Third Party Services and Service Providers

With your consent, these entities may use this information that you provide in the course of your use of Telenav's services (including your name, telephone number, and email address) to promote their products and services to you. Any such Personal Information that a third party uses will be subject to their applicable privacy policies.
Legal Processes

We also may be required to disclose Personal Information in response to a lawful request by applicable US or other courts and governmental authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

Information about you in our possession may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another provider, as well as in the unlikely event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which your Personal Information would be transferred as one of the business assets of the company.

Si vous n’êtes pas d’accord avec les modalités de la présente politique, veuillez ne pas vous adonner à ces activités.
Vous comprenez que la présente politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels ne s’applique pas aux sites Web de Telenav, à d’autres produits ou services de Telenav, à nos partenaires commerciaux et à d’autres sociétés dont Telenav n’a pas la propriété ou qu’elle n’exploite pas. Pour obtenir des renseignements au sujet d’autres produits et services de Telenav ainsi que sur le site Web Telenav.com, veuillez visiter http://www.telenav.com/legal/policies.html. Pour obtenir des renseignements sur la façon dont d’autres fournisseurs de produits ou services traitent les renseignements personnels que vous fournissez par l’intermédiaire d’autres sites Web ou dans le cadre de l’utilisation de nos services conjointement avec un tiers, veuillez consulter leurs politiques en matière de protection des renseignements personnels.
Telenav comprend et respecte vos préoccupations au sujet de la collecte, de l’utilisation et du traitement des renseignements permettant de vous identifier dans le cadre de l’application Scout GPS Link (les « renseignements personnels »). Parmi les renseignements personnels peuvent figurer le nom, l’adresse domiciliaire, les numéros de téléphone, y compris les numéros de téléphone mobile, les données de positionnement, le numéro d’identification d’abonné mobile, le numéro d’identification d’équipement mobile et les adresses de courriel. Les renseignements personnels ne comprennent pas les renseignements anonymes ou regroupés qui ne peuvent être associés à une personne en particulier. Nous estimons que vous devriez savoir quel type de renseignements nous recueillons et comment ces renseignements sont utilisés, conservés et, dans certains cas, partagés. Nos pratiques et politiques en matière de protection des renseignements personnels applicables aux utilisateurs et aux titulaires de compte de l’application Scout GPS Link sont décrites ci après.
RENSEIGNEMENTS RECUEILLIS À VOTRE SUJET ET MANIÈRE DONT NOUS LES UTILISONS
Le type de renseignements personnels que nous pourrions recueillir à votre sujet proviennent principalement de trois sources : 1) l’information que vous fournissez; 2) l’information qui est recueillie automatiquement et 3) l’information provenant d’autres sources. La manière dont nous utilisons et conservons cette information est décrite ci après.
1. Renseignements que vous fournissez
a) Inscription/renseignements liés à votre compte
Nous recueillons et conservons des renseignements personnels à votre sujet lorsque vous ouvrez un compte en vue d’utiliser notre application Scout GPS Link ou que vous vous connectez à Scout GPS Link, et lorsque vous nous transmettez autrement cette information par l’intermédiaire de l’application Scout GPS Link ou que vous communiquez avec nous par téléphone ou par courriel au sujet de votre compte. Par exemple, aux fins de la tenue et/ou de la vérification de votre compte, nous recueillons et conservons dans une base de données votre nom, votre adresse de courriel, le mot de passe du compte, des données sur votre système d’exploitation mobile, le modèle de votre téléphone mobile et l’identifiant de type d’appareil de l’unité centrale. Sur l’appareil, nous recueillons un numéro d’identification comme l’identifiant publicitaire IDFA ou Android.
Si vous décidez d’accéder à Scout GPS Link au moyen de votre compte Facebook, nous recueillerons votre nom, votre photo de profil, votre adresse de courriel et la liste de vos contacts Facebook avec votre permission afin de simplifier l’ouverture de la session. Votre nom sera affiché et stocké dans notre application et votre adresse de courriel et votre mot de passe Facebook seront stockés afin de permettre l’accès à notre application dans le futur. Nous pourrions utiliser cette adresse de courriel afin de communiquer avec vous concernant votre compte et/ou de répondre à des questions ou à des commentaires que vous formulez au moyen de notre application comme il est décrit au paragraphe b) ci-après. Si vous souhaitez révoquer l’autorisation permettant à l’application d’interagir avec votre compte Facebook, vous pouvez vous déconnecter de Facebook à partir du menu des paramètres de compte de Scout GPS Link, retirer l’application de la liste d’applications autorisées ou désactiver la fonction Applications, sites Web et modules d’extension dans les paramètres de votre compte Facebook.
Si vous décidez d’accéder à Scout GPS Link au moyen de votre compte Google, nous recueillerons votre adresse de courriel et des données de base sur votre profil, lesquels seront conservés afin de permettre l’accès à notre application dans le futur et de simplifier l’ouverture de votre session. Nous pourrions utiliser cette adresse de courriel afin de communiquer avec vous concernant votre compte et/ou de répondre à des questions ou à des commentaires que vous formulez au sein de notre application comme il est décrit au paragraphe b) ci-après.
Vous avez la possibilité de nous fournir vos adresses à domicile et au travail, que nous stockons dans notre base de données, pour vous permettre de naviguer rapidement vers ces destinations et d’accéder facilement à d’autres fonctionnalités de l’application. Vous pouvez également créer une liste d’adresses « favorites » et de points d’intérêt. L’application vous permet également d’utiliser son menu des paramètres afin de personnaliser votre expérience, par exemple en choisissant vos préférences de navigation, en établissant des rapports de circulation et en établissant vos préférences en matière de qualité d’essence pour les recherches. Nous stockons ces adresses et paramètres dans nos bases de données de sorte que vous puissiez y accéder à partir de votre compte, même si vous changez de véhicule ou d’appareil mobile.
Nous pourrions également utiliser les renseignements que nous recueillons sur vous pour gérer votre compte et vous fournir un soutien à la clientèle et pour effectuer des recherches et des analyses à propos de votre utilisation de nos produits et services. Nous pourrions communiquer à nos partenaires indépendants du secteur automobile certains renseignements que nous recueillons à votre sujet et au sujet de votre utilisation dans le but d’effectuer des recherches et des analyses au sujet des utilisateurs de nos produits et services. Toutefois, les données seront regroupées et tous vos renseignements personnels seront retirés avant que des renseignements soient communiqués à ces partenaires.
b) Communication avec nos représentants du service à la clientèle/commentaires formulés au moyen de l’application
Nous pouvons utiliser votre adresse de courriel pour communiquer avec vous au sujet de votre compte, notamment pour confirmer une modification apportée à votre numéro de téléphone, et pour répondre à une demande de renseignements ou à un commentaire que vous avez formulé par courriel ou au moyen de l’application Scout GPS Link. Si vous communiquez avec nous pour formuler un commentaire, une question ou une plainte, vous pourriez devoir fournir des renseignements pouvant vous identifier (comme votre nom, votre adresse et votre numéro de téléphone) ainsi que d’autres renseignements dont nous pourrions avoir besoin pour nous aider à répondre rapidement à votre question, à votre commentaire ou à votre plainte. Nous pourrions conserver ces renseignements pour vous aider dans le futur et pour améliorer notre service à la clientèle et notre gamme de produits et services.
De plus, si vous formulez des commentaires concernant un problème d’itinéraire ou de carte dans l’une de nos applications, nous pourrions partager vos commentaires selon un format qui ne risque pas de vous identifier ainsi que des données anonymisées sur votre emplacement et votre itinéraire avec la communauté OpenStreetMap en vue de perfectionner les données d’OpenStreetMap.
2. Renseignements recueillis automatiquement
Nous recevons automatiquement certains types de renseignements, dont certains peuvent être des renseignements personnels, lorsque vous utilisez l’application Scout GPS Link.
a) Renseignements relatifs à votre position et itinéraire ou d’autre contenu sur l’utilisateur
Chaque fois que vous accédez à l’application Scout GPS Link ou que vous l’utilisez (notamment lorsque vous recherchez une adresse à proximité ou un point d’intérêt au moyen de l’application ouverte sur votre appareil mobile, lorsque votre session de navigation est active dans l’application ouverte sur votre appareil mobile ou lorsque votre appareil mobile sur laquelle l’application est ouverte est connecté à votre véhicule Toyota), nous enregistrons votre position obtenue par GPS, vos itinéraires, y compris votre point d’origine, l’adresse de votre destination, l’heure du début de votre déplacement, l’itinéraire qu’on vous a indiqué de suivre et l’heure de votre arrivée (s’il y a lieu). Nous enregistrons votre position actuelle lorsque votre appareil sans fil demande un nouvel itinéraire (ce qui survient lorsque, par exemple, vous vous écartez de l’itinéraire fourni). Tant que votre session de navigation est active, nous recevons périodiquement votre position, la direction indiquée par le GPS et la vitesse de votre véhicule à partir du matériel GPS associé à votre appareil sans fil afin de vous fournir votre itinéraire et de le rajuster. Nous constituons une base de données composée de ces données de positionnement et d’itinéraire et nous pouvons les conserver jusqu’à cinq ans afin d’améliorer nos cartes et d’offrir d’autres fonctionnalités pouvant améliorer et personnaliser vos capacités à bénéficier du service, les fonctions et votre expérience utilisateur.
Nous pourrions également recevoir périodiquement des données sur votre position provenant du matériel GPS associé à votre appareil sans fil afin de vous fournir et de fournir à d’autres utilisateurs de l’application des services bonifiés, comme des données sur la fluidité de la circulation. Si les données sur votre position, votre direction indiquée par le GPS et votre vitesse sont utilisées à ces fins, nous en retirons tous les renseignements personnels, comme votre numéro de téléphone, avant de les stocker. Nous pourrions partager ces données de positionnement selon un format qui ne risque pas de vous identifier ou sous une forme anonyme avec nos partenaires indépendants qui effectuent de la recherche et de l’analyse sur les conditions de la circulation et l’utilisation du réseau routier. L’application affichera vos destinations les plus récentes afin de vous permettre d’y retourner facilement. Si vous choisissez d’utiliser votre position établie par GPS pour trouver une entreprise ou obtenir une carte, nous utiliserons les renseignements relatifs à votre position pour faire la recherche demandée. Nous enregistrons de façon anonyme les activités et les résultats de recherche afin d’améliorer notre fonction de recherche. De plus, nous enregistrons les opérations de façon anonyme afin de déterminer nos obligations de paiement aux fournisseurs de service d’annuaire.
De plus, vous pouvez permettre à l’application Scout GPS Link d’accéder aux données stockées dans le carnet d’adresses de votre appareil mobile. Nos applications peuvent utiliser les données de votre carnet d’adresses pour vous permettre d’effectuer une recherche dans vos contacts et d’activer la navigation pour vous diriger à leur adresse au moyen de l’application. Nous n’accéderons à ces données que si vous en avez donné la permission à l’application Scout GPS Link. Vous pouvez révoquer la permission à tout moment en modifiant les paramètres de votre appareil mobile.
b) Données sur l’utilisation que vous faites de l’application
Lorsque vous utilisez l’application Scout GPS Link, nous conservons certaines données sur votre utilisation de l’application et son rendement. Par exemple, nous pourrions recueillir des données au sujet de vos activités dans l’application, comme l’utilisation de l’unité centrale du véhicule, le type de recherche que vous avez effectuée ou la cause d’une défaillance de l’application. Ces données seront stockées pour une durée indéterminée afin de nous permettre d’apporter des améliorations à l’application. Elles pourraient être partagées avec nos partenaires indépendants du secteur automobile selon un format regroupé qui n’est pas susceptible de vous identifier. Vos renseignements personnels seront supprimés avant que des données soient partagées.
Nous recueillerons également des renseignements sur le rendement de nos applications, y compris l’état de votre appareil au moment où survient une erreur ou un problème dans l’application, et cette information sera communiquée à un tiers, notamment Crashlytics, et traitée par celui-ci afin de recueillir de l’information sur les erreurs ou les problèmes qui surviennent dans nos applications pour que nous puissions les améliorer.
PARTAGE OU COMMUNICATION DE VOS RENSEIGNEMENTS
Telenav ne vend pas de données à des parties qui ne sont pas membres de son groupe, ne leur en loue pas, ne leur en concède pas sous licence et ne les leur communique pas, sauf comme il est indiqué dans la présente politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels.
Services fournis par des tiers et fournisseurs de services
Nous pourrions transférer ou communiquer certains renseignements sur vous à des tiers qui fournissent des services pour notre compte, comme l’hébergement de données, la production de rapports sur le rendement d’une application, l’amélioration et l’analyse de données de cartographie et de circulation, l’analyse de l’utilisation d’une application et la liste dont il est question ci-après.
Certains des services et des fonctionnalités de l’application sont fournis par des fournisseurs de services indépendants ou conjointement avec ceux-ci. Ces fournisseurs de services indépendants traitent les renseignements personnels pour notre compte et sont tenus de le faire conformément à la présente politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels et à d’autres mesures appropriées en matière de sécurité et de confidentialité. Nous ne les autorisons pas à utiliser ou à communiquer des renseignements personnels aux fins de commercialisation ou à d’autres fins personnelles. Nous, les membres de notre groupe ou d’autres fournisseurs de services indépendants aux États Unis ou dans d’autres territoires pouvons tenir et traiter des renseignements personnels.
Telenav peut communiquer certaines données regroupées qui ne sont pas susceptibles d’identifier qui que ce soit avec des partenaires stratégiques qui collaborent avec nous pour analyser l’utilisation de produits ou de services et pour en fournir et les améliorer ou qui nous aident à les commercialiser auprès de clients, ou à des fins similaires.
Partenaires indépendants
Si vous tirez parti des services ou des produits d’un tiers offerts dans le cadre de l’utilisation de nos services, nous pourrions communiquer vos renseignements personnels à ces tiers qui ne sont pas membres de notre groupe. Avec votre consentement, ces entités peuvent utiliser les renseignements que vous fournissez dans le cadre de votre utilisation des services de Telenav (dont votre nom, votre numéro de téléphone et votre adresse de courriel) afin de promouvoir leurs produits et leurs services auprès de vous. Les renseignements personnels qu’un tiers utilise seront visés par sa politique applicable en matière de protection des renseignements personnels.
Procédures judiciaires
Nous, ainsi que nos fournisseurs de services et les membres de notre groupe autorisés, nous conformerons aux assignations à témoigner, aux ordonnances des tribunaux ou aux autres procédures judiciaires relativement aux renseignements à votre sujet que nous avons en notre possession, et nous pourrions utiliser et communiquer ces renseignements pour établir vos ou nos droits ou ceux de tiers, pour exercer nos droits ou permettre à d’autres d’exercer leurs droits ou pour nous défendre contre des réclamations ou comme l’exigent ou le permettent autrement les lois du Canada ou des États-Unis ou d’autres lois. Nous pourrions également être tenus de divulguer des renseignements personnels en réponse à une demande légitime de tribunaux et d’autorités gouvernementales compétentes, dont ceux des États-Unis, notamment pour nous conformer à des exigences relatives à la sécurité nationale ou à l’application de la loi.
Transferts commerciaux
Les renseignements à votre sujet que nous avons en notre possession pourraient être communiqués dans le cadre d’une fusion, d’une acquisition, de la vente d’actifs de la société ou de la transition de services vers un autre fournisseur ainsi que dans un cas improbable d’insolvabilité, de faillite ou de mise sous séquestre dans le cadre de laquelle vos renseignements personnels seraient transférés en tant qu’actifs de la société.
SÉCURITÉ DES RENSEIGNEMENTS PERSONNELS
Telenav a mis en place des mesures de sauvegarde physiques, électroniques et procédurales raisonnables dans le but de préserver la confidentialité et la sécurité des renseignements personnels sous notre garde et notre contrôle.
Bien que Telenav ait mis en place des mesures de sécurité pour contribuer à prévenir l’accès non autorisé à vos renseignements personnels ou la communication de ceux ci, aucune mesure de sécurité n’est absolue ni pleinement garantie. Telenav conservera vos renseignements personnels aussi longtemps qu’elle en aura besoin sur le plan des activités ou conformément aux exigences des lois, des règlements ou des ordonnances gouvernementales applicables. Au moment d’éliminer des renseignements personnels, nous appliquons une procédure raisonnable sur le plan commercial pour les supprimer ou les rendre anonymes ou illisibles.
DEMANDE DE RENSEIGNEMENTS PROVENANT DE CLIENTS
Telenav reconnaît que les gens ont le droit d’avoir accès aux renseignements personnels et aux données dont elle dispose sur eux (sous réserve de certaines exceptions prévues par la loi), de les mettre à jour et de corriger les erreurs qui s’y sont glissées. Les clients ont le droit de demander si une entreprise a communiqué des renseignements personnels à des sociétés membres de son groupe ou à des tiers aux fins de commercialisation directe par eux. Ils ont également le droit de demander l’accès à leurs renseignements personnels que Telenav contrôle et dont elle a la garde. Pour protéger vos renseignements personnels et pour votre sécurité, Telenav prendra des mesures raisonnables pour vérifier votre identité avant de vous donner accès à vos renseignements personnels ou d’y apporter des corrections. Telenav déploiera des efforts de bonne foi pour répondre aux demandes de correction de renseignements personnels conformément aux lois applicables. Telenav ne vendra pas vos renseignements personnels ni ne les communiquera à des tiers aux fins de commercialisation directe par eux sans votre consentement. Les clients qui souhaitent obtenir de plus amples renseignements sur la façon dont nous nous y prenons pour nous conformer aux lois ou qui ont des questions ou des préoccupations au sujet de nos pratiques et politiques en matière de protection des renseignements personnels ou de celles de nos fournisseurs de services peuvent communiquer avec nous par courriel à support@telenav.com ou par la poste aux soins du responsable de la protection des renseignements personnels, à Telenav, Inc., Attn : Privacy Policy Officer, 4655 Great America Parkway, Suite 300, Santa Clara, CA 95054, États-Unis
MODIFICATION DE LA PRÉSENTE POLITIQUE
À l’occasion, Telenav peut mettre à jour la présente politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels, et nous vous recommandons de la consulter périodiquement pour être informé des derniers changements. Si Telenav devait fusionner avec une autre société ou être acquise par une autre société, la présente politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels pourrait être modifiée.
AUTRES CONVENTIONS
Telenav peut conclure avec des clients des conventions écrites relatives à des produits ou à des services qui renferment des dispositions particulières en matière de confidentialité, de sécurité ou de traitement de l’information. Si la présente politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels est incompatible avec une disposition de ces modalités et conventions (aussi bien aux États-Unis qu’ailleurs), ces modalités et conventions auront préséance en ce qui a trait à l’incompatibilité. Dans tous les autres cas, les modalités de la présente politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels s’appliqueront.
MISE À JOUR DE RENSEIGNEMENTS / RÉVOCATION DE CHOIX / SUGGESTIONS ET COORDONNÉES
Si vous souhaitez accéder à des renseignements personnels que vous avez fournis à Telenav dans le cadre de votre utilisation de l’application Scout GPS Link, les mettre à jour ou les corriger ou fermer votre compte Scout GPS Link et supprimer les renseignements qui y sont associés (sous réserve de toute obligation que nous pourrions avoir en vertu de la loi de conserver ces renseignements) ou si vous avez des suggestions en vue d’améliorer la présente politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels, veuillez envoyer un courriel à support@telenav.com. Nous ferons raisonnablement de notre mieux, sur le plan commercial, pour répondre à vos préoccupations.
Dernière mise à jour de la politique en matière de protection des renseignements personnels de Telenav : 28 juillet 2017.
