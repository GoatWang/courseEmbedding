    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

First Midwest Bancorp, Inc is headquartered in Itasca, Illinois, just west of O'Hare Airport. The company's predecessor traces back to Joliet, Illinois. From there the company has grown to serve many Chicago suburbs including northwest Indiana, downstate Illinois, and the Quad Cities area including Iowa.
First Midwest Bank provides retail and business banking in 97 branches. In 2006, First Midwest acquired Bank Calumet for $307 million in cash, expanding its presence in the northwest Indiana area.[4]
On October 23, 2009, First Midwest Bank acquired certain deposits and loans of Westmont-based First DuPage Bank in a transaction facilitated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. First Midwest Bank agreed to assume all of the deposits - $230 million, and agreed to purchase approximately $260 million in assets at a discount of $32 million. First Midwest Bank entered into a loss-share transaction with the FDIC providing First Midwest Bank with protection from the FDIC for loan losses.[5]
On April 23, 2010, First Midwest Bank acquired Peotone Bank, taking on $130 million in assets and $127 million in deposits in a transaction facilitated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.[6][7]
On August 13, 2010, First Midwest acquired Palos Bank and Trust Company in a transaction facilitated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.[8] Palos Bank and Trust Company had approximately $493.4 million in total assets and $467.8 million in total deposits, as of June 30, 2010. First Midwest Bank will pay the FDIC a premium of 1.0 percent to assume all of the deposits of Palos Bank and Trust Company. In addition to assuming all of the deposits of the failed bank, First Midwest Bank agreed to purchase essentially all of the assets. The FDIC and First Midwest Bank entered into a loss-share transaction on $343.8 million of Palos Bank and Trust Company's assets.[9]
First Midwest Bank assumed Waukegan Savings Bank's $77 million in deposits and $89 million in assets following its closure by the FDIC. The two Waukegan branches will open as First Midwest locations.[10]
The company acquired naming rights to the First Midwest Bank Amphitheatre in Tinley Park, Illinois.[11]

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

 ITASCA, Ill., March 06, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- First Midwest Bancorp, Inc. ("First Midwest") (NASDAQ:FMBI) today announced that it has acquired Premier Asset Management LLC ("Premier"), a registered investment advisor based in Chicago, Illinois. "We are thrilled to welcome Premier and its clients to the First Midwest team," said Robert P. Diedrich, Executive Vice President and Director of Wealth Management of First Midwest Bank.  "Premier's combination of expertise and service commitment sets them apart, bringing additional breadth to First Midwest. Together, we strengthen our shared promise to successfully meet the financial and service needs of our higher net worth clients through a full range of private banking and wealth management offerings."  Joseph T. Seminetta, President of Premier, added, "We are very excited to partner with First Midwest as we look forward to adding momentum to an already leading market presence. The ability to provide our clients a broader range of products as well as access to First Midwest's robust network of services creates value for all involved." Premier was founded in 2001 to provide customized investment advisory services to its clients.  Joe and Denise Seminetta, who have a combined 50 years of experience in the investment advisory industry, will continue to lead Premier and their team as a separate subsidiary within the First Midwest umbrella of financial and wealth management services. At February 28, 2017, Premier had approximately $550 million of assets under management.  About First Midwest First Midwest is a relationship-focused financial institution and one of the largest independent publicly-traded bank holding companies based on assets headquartered in the Midwest, with approximately $14 billion in assets and $9.5 billion in wealth assets under management.  First Midwest's principal subsidiary, First Midwest Bank, and other affiliates provide a full range of commercial, equipment leasing, retail, wealth management, trust and private banking products and services through over 130 locations in metropolitan Chicago, northwest Indiana, central and western Illinois, and eastern Iowa.  First Midwest's common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbol FMBI.  First Midwest's website is  www.firstmidwest.com .
