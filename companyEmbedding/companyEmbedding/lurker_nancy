Welcome to the Q3 2017 pSivida Corp. Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Doug Sherk. Please go ahead.
Douglas Sherk
Thank you, Blair and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to review pSivida's fiscal 2017 third quarter results which ended March 31, 2017, as well as recent corporate developments. 
Making prepared remarks on today's call are Nancy Lurker, pSivida's President and Chief Executive Officer; Deb Jorn, Executive Vice President on Corporate and Commercial Development; Len Ross -- and -- excuse me and Len Ross, Vice President, Finance. In addition, Dr. Dario Paggiarino, Vice President and Chief Medical Officer, is with us this afternoon and will be available during the Q&A session.
Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that all statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements and we cannot guarantee that the results and other expectations expressed, anticipated or implied will be realized. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected in the forward-looking statements. For a more detailed discussion of risk factors that could impact our future results and financial condition, we refer you to pSivida's filings with the SEC, including its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016. The company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement in order to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after this conference call. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to pSivida's President and Chief Executive Officer, Nancy Lurker.
Douglas Sherk
Thank you, Doug and good afternoon, everyone; and for those of you listening from Australia, good morning. I appreciate everyone taking the time to join us to review our 2017 fiscal third quarter results and corporate update. I want to begin today's call by emphasizing that throughout our organization there is a high level of enthusiasm. This is due to the substantial achievements we've made over the past few quarters on the regulatory, clinical and collaborative fronts. I continue to be impressed with our Durasert technology and our efforts these past few months have created several near-term milestones, especially as we approach the end of our fiscal year in June. As evidenced by our progress, the reprioritization of pSivida's development program, one from higher risk, longer term in its focus to one that is now more moderate risk and nearer term, is expanding the pipeline and yielding positive results. We have increased the number of shots on goal. 
Let me review the status for each of our programs and the substantial developments you can look for in the coming months. I will then ask Deb Jorn, our Executive Vice President of Corporate Development, to provide some details on our recent market research and collaboration agreements. 
I'll begin with Durasert 3-year for posterior segment uveitis and then move on to the other programs. Our most advanced clinical program is our Durasert 3-year treatment for posterior segment uveitis. Posterior segment uveitis impacts approximately 80,000 to 100,000 patients in the United States and another 80,000 to 100,000 patients in Europe, who have few options to treat this chronic inflammatory disease, the third leading cause of blindness in the developed world. 

The FDA required 2 Phase III studies and if you recall, the first Phase III study met its primary efficacy p-value of less than 0.001 and yielded safety data that's consistent with the known effect of ocular corticosteroid use. While we remain blinded to the study, we remain optimistic because of the first trial design and robustness of the data, that the second Phase III study readout will also be positive. 
The last patient follow-up occurred in early April and Rod Riedel, our Vice President of Regulatory Affairs, has been out in the field visiting each of the sites as we keep to our time line and expect to report the second Phase III study readout by the end of June. 
In February we also met with EU regulators and the discussions are progressing well and our current expectation is that the European Market Authorisation Application or MAA, will be submitted by the end of next month. Concurrently, we’re having advanced discussions with several potential organizations and we plan to announce an outlicense partner for Durasert in the EU sometime no later this summer. In the U.S., we expect to file the NDA during Q4 2017 and our plan here is to go to market ourselves with a limited number of contract sales reps and scale up slowly over time. 
However, since this is an orphan disease, I don't expect us needing more than 15 to 20 contract sales representatives to cover the uveitis specialists. The focused, small field force, coupled with a favorable gross margin, should contribute to our bottom line performance and shareholder return in a shorter time period than the typical pharmaceutical launch. 
During the last few weeks, we were also notified that abstracts featuring our Durasert technology were accepted at leading medical conferences. These acceptances clearly demonstrate the depth of our science and high level of interest from the ophthalmic community. 
The first one is next week at the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology or ARVO, annual meeting in Baltimore on May 8, 2017. The data will be presented in a podium presentation by Dr. Glenn Jay Jaffe, Robert Machemer Professor of Ophthalmology at Duke University School of Medicine in Durham, North Carolina. 
The second presentation will be at the American Society of Retina Specialists or ASRS, annual meeting, being in Boston in late August. The data will be presented by Dr. David Callanan, M.D., a leading ophthalmologist with Texas Retina Associates. Having our data presented at these conferences by 2 leading authorities on uveitis is impressive and important as we prepare to submit and launch Durasert in the EU and U.S. markets. As I mentioned earlier, Deb Jorn will provide information on our market research and collaboration agreements. 
Moving beyond the eye is our Durasert implant for severe osteoarthritis of the knee. As we have reported, the Hospital for Special Surgery or HSS, in New York and pSivida announced the opening of an IND in support of an investigator-sponsored clinical study of Durasert to treat severe OA of the knee. The Durasert implant is designed to provide long-term pain relief for severe knee OA. This can potentially benefit a percentage of the patients that need to delay a total knee replacement, especially for those who need to improve their health or lose weight prior to knee surgery. 
I'm pleased to announce the sixth and final patient in the Phase I knee OA study was implanted in early April. We expect HSS to report the initial 24-week data by the fourth quarter of calendar 2017 and we’re currently in discussions with HSS about the next steps for this exciting program.
Now turning to our other technology product development opportunities. Our next-generation, shorter-duration product is something we envision for the treatment of posterior segment uveitis and for use in collaborations with other drug manufacturers with their small molecules. 

As I've stated before, having the ability to deliver a 3 to 6-month shorter-duration product has significant value to patients as they just -- excuse me, to physicians, as they treat their patients. In addition to our 3-year product, this project remains on track. Of note, our shorter duration for uveitis as well as our collaboration outreach efforts weren't even being contemplated a year ago, so the company's culture and technology road map has changed and our goal is to better leverage the investments made over the previous years. 
Turning to our TKI program for wet AMD, the evaluation of additional TKIs are underway and we've identified multiple suitable TKI candidates for further formulation work. We've determined that pending the evaluation of TKI candidates, we intend to advance this program only through a collaboration partner. 
Turning to Tethadur, given that we do have limited resources and we’re emphasizing our development efforts on our proven Durasert technology, we have deemphasized our focus on Tethadur. We’re continuing to examine areas where we can leverage our Tethadur program, but any efforts would be through a collaboration agreement. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Deb Jorn for a review of our current market research and an update on our collaboration efforts. Deb?
Debora Jorn
Thank you, Nancy. Good afternoon, everyone. It is certainly an exciting time for pSivida as we kick off launch planning for our new investigational Durasert 3-year product for the treatment of noninfectious posterior uveitis. As part of the process, we recently completed market research with retina and uveitis specialists to assess their reaction to the product profile and importantly, gauge their level of interest in using the product. The profile tested was based on the efficacy and safety results at 6 and 12 months from the first Phase III study. The feedback from specialists was overwhelmingly positive. The level of interest in using the product was assessed on a scale of with 1 to 10, with 10 -- excuse me, with 1 being low and 10 being high. The level of intent among specialists ranged from an 8 to a 10. This strong level of interest in using the product was driven by our first Phase III study results, demonstrating a significant and durable reduction in the recurrence rates of uveitis, improvements in best corrected visual acuity or so-called BCVA and a favorable tolerability profile at 12 months. 
Specialists viewed the Durasert 3-year insert as an important addition to their current treatment options, given its ability to provide consistent long-term control of chronic posterior uveitis versus currently available treatment options. Less recurrences or flares was perceived as an important -- was perceived as important for preserving vision over the long term. We look forward to providing physicians with this new treatment option to help improve the lives of patients suffering from the debilitating effects of this potentially blinding disease. 
Now let me turn and spend a few moments updating you on our business development initiatives. Since joining pSivida 6 months ago, my major focus has been to significantly increase the number of collaborations with leading pharmaceutical companies, leveraging our proven and proprietary Durasert technology platform. We have already signed one feasibility study agreement well ahead of schedule and we’re in active discussions with other pharmaceutical companies to establish additional collaboration agreements. In addition, we have been focused on securing an EU outlicense partner for the 3-year Durasert uveitis product. We’re well into the process with several potential partners and we expect to finalize a partnership later this summer. 
With that, thank you and I will turn it over to Len.

Leonard Ross
Thank you, Deb and good afternoon, everyone. I will briefly review our fiscal third quarter results we reported following today's close. Revenue for the third fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2017 was $590,000 compared to $324,000 for the prior year quarter. Third quarter operating expenses were $5.8 million compared to $5.4 million a year ago. The net loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 was $5.1 million or $0.15 per share compared to a net loss of $5 million or $0.15 per share for the prior year quarter. During the third quarter, net cash used in operations totaled approximately $4.6 million and we anticipate net operating cash usage of approximately $5 million in each of the next few quarters. 
During the fiscal 2017 third quarter, we issued approximately 1.4 million shares of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $2.5 million, through the utilization of our existing at-the-market or ATM program. At March 31, 2017, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $15.4 million. 
Subsequent to the balance sheet date, we have continued to strengthen our balance sheet through further utilization of the ATM program and have issued approximately 3.6 million additional shares of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $6.3 million. At April 30, our cash balance was approximately $19.9 million. 
Given the 15% annual limitation, as defined, on the issuance of shares pursuant to the listing rules of the Australian Securities Exchange or ASX, without stockholder approval, we expect to conclude the current utilization of the ATM program in the coming days. 
I'll turn the call now back over to Nancy for her closing comments.
Nancy Lurker
Thank you, Len. Before opening call up to questions, I'd like to follow up on Len's comments regarding the use of our ATM. In order to execute the strategy we've laid out for you which is to grow the top and bottom line and thereby increase shareholder returns, we have to invest in the programs we’re implementing and that requires additional resources. At the same time, our Australian stock exchange listing means that we’re limited in terms of equity rate up to 15% of our shares outstanding before getting shareholder approval. Our board evaluated a variety of financing strategies and determined that the most efficient and minimally dilutive one, given the boundaries that we have to operate within, was the ATM. The results from the effort illustrate it was the right decision and was well executed. 
At the same time, we’re filing a proxy today for a special meeting of shareholders to fulfill an Australian stock exchange requirement to get shareholder approval to allow us to sell up to an additional 15% of our shares. Approval would enable us to maximize our options as we seek the resources required to execute our strategies in 2018. 
Our entire team is focused on executing several near-term objectives, including reporting the top line results from the second pivotal Phase III study in June; submitting our filing with the EU regulators in June; finalizing an EU outlicense partnership for our 3-year uveitis product during the summer months; leveraging the clinical study data being presented at leading medical conferences to reinforce the strength of our science and (technical difficulty); continuing our collaborations with biopharmaceutical companies as well as entering into others; filing our NDA in the U.S. during the fourth quarter of calendar 2017. 
This is perhaps the most exciting period in the history of the company. It's important that we maintain this positive momentum and it's important that we explore available strategies to meet the future capital resources needs required to achieve the company's growth objectives during 2018 and beyond, as well as maximize shareholder value. In summary, we have a number of key milestones over the next few months and I look forward to providing updates as we continue to make solid progress. 

Operator, we're now ready to take questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Suraj Kalia from Northland Securities.
Suraj Kalia
Nancy, can you hear me all right?
Nancy Lurker
Absolutely.
Suraj Kalia
Perfect. Okay. So, Nancy, forgive me, I've been hopping between 4 calls. In case some of this has already -- you guys have given some additional color, my apologies. The biopharma partner you'll sign in the quarter -- any -- did you all give any details on whether it's -- it was in osteoarthritis; it was something else; what the terms of the deal was; duration of the deal?
Nancy Lurker
No. We can't. We have not disclosed anything. We did file an 8-K with minimal information.
Suraj Kalia
Got it. And I presume you guys are precluded, confidentiality reasons, not to talk about it.
Nancy Lurker
Oh, yes.
Suraj Kalia
Whether it's -- which therapeutic segment and whatnot?
Nancy Lurker
Absolutely. So, if we’re successful, I would anticipate that down the road we can certainly disclose more.
Suraj Kalia
Nancy, there is, as you very well know -- you and I have talked about this multiple times on osteoarthritis -- you guys are stealthily working on something that has eluded a lot of other companies. I know the data for the Phase I HSS study is going to be towards the latter part of the year. Any directional -- any color you can give on how that's shaping up on the 6 patients? I know there were pain scores and whatnot that -- what should we expect by the end of the year and what should we look (inaudible) Phase II?
Nancy Lurker
Yes. Let me just say this. It is an open-label study. However, right now, we anticipate releasing results after the end of the 24-month period, the 6 months of efficacy. And that's a combination of efficacy, pain as well as signs and symptoms of movement. However, we will evaluate. If it merits it we will only do that in collaboration with HSS, if we should decide to discuss any of the results a little earlier. I can't promise that, because it is open-label. But obviously we’re in close contact with our collaboration partners and we're very pleased with the direction of the collaboration.
Suraj Kalia
And since it's open-label, admittedly, some of the patients have been recent and we don't know how they're performing. I can appreciate that. Have you been approached by any strategic to co-fund, if I can create that word co-fund, this trial and/or work together on this product at this stage?
Nancy Lurker
Yes. You're asking very good questions, Suraj. Obviously, I can't disclose anything. But let me just say this, that we’re certainly evaluating our next steps with this. Our goal is to leverage this technology platform and it's really a platform technology, because this can be used in multiple joints in the body and potentially down the road use other small molecules beyond just dexamethasone which is currently in the implant right now. So we will be working closely with our partner, HSS and looking at the options to maximize the value to both us and HSS. At this time I can't disclose anything more, but suffice it to say we’re actively engaged and actively looking at how to -- what the next steps are.
Suraj Kalia
And finally, Nancy and I'll hop back in queue, the third party CRO strategy -- still thinking about 20, 30 people would suffice for Durasert uveitis?
Nancy Lurker
Yes. So first, I think you mean CSO, contract sales organization.
Suraj Kalia
Oh, CSO, sorry.
Nancy Lurker
I'm going to -- that's okay. I'm going to turn that question over to Deb Jorn.
Suraj Kalia
That's what happens when you're toggling between 3 different calls, so my apologies.
Nancy Lurker
That's all right. Go ahead, Deb.
Debora Jorn
Hi, Suraj. Well, as you know, the number of prescribers, because this is an orphan disease, is very limited. So therefore we can go to market with a very small sales force, utilizing a CSO to cut costs. And also, we will have very favorable gross margins and that should contribute to our bottom line and lead to substantial return to our shareholders in a reasonable period of time, we believe, following launch.

Nancy Lurker
Yes. And just to clarify, it's 15 to 20…
Debora Jorn
20.
Nancy Lurker
Right. Yes.
Debora Jorn
15 to 20 representatives.
Suraj Kalia
They should be good enough. Okay. Fair enough.
Operator
The next question comes from the line of Matt Kaplan from Ladenburg Thalmann.
Matthew Kaplan
One of the new things you mentioned in terms of your prepared remarks was talking about an ex-U.S. partnership expected this summer. Can you give us some details in terms of how to think about that -- what the structure would be and how that would work?
Nancy Lurker
Okay. I'm going to also turn that over to Deb. Obviously, we can't disclose a lot of details on that.
Matthew Kaplan
You bet.
Nancy Lurker
But go ahead, Deb.
Deb Jorn
Well, it would be an outlicense where the partner would be responsible for the sales and marketing and bringing the product forward to the marketplace, including securing reimbursement in all the countries. This will be a centralized procedure, so there will be a number of countries we'll be looking to have that partner immediately move forward to launch it.
Matthew Kaplan
So should we expect kind of upfront payment, royalties, milestone payments, that kind of thing?
Nancy Lurker
Yes. I would -- you should plan on the typical deal. Obviously, just remember it is uveitis which is a orphan disease. So given that and the fact that it is relatively small revenue-wise, as I've stressed, profitability should be good because, as I've mentioned, our gross margins are good on this, our COGS are very low and we don't expect to have a big, robust field force. Nevertheless, because it is a relatively small category, you're not going to see large upfronts.
Matthew Kaplan
Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. And also in your remarks, you were talking about your (technical difficulty) the analysis and survey that you've completed. Can you give us a little bit more color on that as well, in terms of how -- and how will doctors incorporate this into their practice and when would they use it in terms of what line of therapy, are they thinking about?
Nancy Lurker
Okay. During the discussions, we specifically asked physicians where this would fit into their treatment paradigm. And certainly what we've heard was, a lot of patients would be potentially switched from products such as OZURDEX. OZURDEX has a certain duration, be it 2 to 4 months, in terms of controlling the condition. So this was seen as for that chronic patient a maybe more appropriate, longer-term control of a chronic condition. And also with Retisert, primarily because Retisert requires surgical implantation whereas this product is an intravitreal injection and also has a much lower concentration of fluocinolone acetonide, the active corticosteroid and given the tolerability profile shown in our 12-month data from the Phase III. So to answer your question, I think they believe that this is a incredible option for patients with chronic recurring rather than the multiple injections that currently has to happen and/or use of systemic therapy.
Debora Jorn
Yes and let me just add to that, Matt which is that, just recall that for uveitis the only real treatment option that's available right now are corticosteroids. HUMIRA is approved for systemic use for uveitis, but clearly due to the cost and of course you do have a -- you've got many tolerability considerations to take into effect. That is not something that we would expect nor doctors indicate would be used in any way first or even second line, but more primarily as a last resort. So again, corticosteroids are their only option in treating uveitis. So obviously and it certainly showed up in the research, that we would expect to be used fairly soon in the treatment of these patients.
Nancy Lurker
Since many of them have already been on -- the chronic patients have been on therapy for some time with multiple injections, the thought was that the doctor would likely move those patients -- the appropriate patients right away to this longer-duration product.

Matthew Kaplan
Great, great. That's helpful, thanks. And then I guess one last question on the implant program that you have, specifically, in the knee osteoarthritis. You mentioned you're also thinking about pursuing other products besides steroids. Can you give us a sense in terms of what type of products to add to that delivery system?
Nancy Lurker
Yes. So, let me say this. I want to be -- the -- just add a caveat which is, that is strictly in the planning stage. So that's not something that we anticipate doing right away. Our main goal right now is to start to plan for Phase II for our knee osteoarthritis program which currently has a terrific steroid in it, dexamethasone. But beyond that, you could envision nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories in the implant; small molecule antibiotics; others might be antifibrinolytics. Just some examples. We have not explored all the other options, nor have we prioritized them, but I'm simply putting out there that this can go many different directions as we look at using this implant in treating the entire orthopedic patient community.
Operator
The next question comes from the line of Yi Chen from H.C. Wainwright.
Yi Chen
Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Nancy, my first question is, assuming the data coming out from the second pivotal Phase III trial is positive, do you expect anything else -- any other hurdle before submitting the NDA?
Nancy Lurker
I'm sorry. Ask the question one more time.
Yi Chen
Assuming you have positive data coming from the second pivotal Phase III study in June, do you expect any other hurdles from the FDA before submitting the NDA?
Nancy Lurker
Well, first of all, let me just say this. You can never predict for sure and so I'm not -- I -- we obviously plan to have a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA and certainly we will learn more there. I will just say that when you look -- if -- when you look at our first Phase III study and again, we do not know the results of our second Phase III study, but should our second Phase III study be as positive as our first Phase III study, that's pretty powerful data to go into the FDA with. And I'm just going to leave it at that because it's difficult to predict these things.
Yi Chen
Okay. Second question. I know you will start preclinical studies for the shorter-acting Durasert. So, when the shorter-acting version of Durasert enters clinic, I guess it is a bio-erodible version versus the non-erodible version for the long-acting Durasert, correct? So, will there be any difference in terms of clinical trial design and endpoints?
Nancy Lurker
Yes. So, let me just say this. We’re right now in the preclinical stage and the approach to how we bring this to market is still under evaluation. So, obviously, our goal is to get it to market as soon as possible and there's any number of ways we can do that. So we're evaluating our option set now.
Yi Chen
Okay. My final question -- so, after you finish the Phase III trial, the ongoing Phase III trial and when you move forward with other projects, what are the likely operating expenses or cash burns -- quarterly cash burn that we can expect for the rest of the year?
Nancy Lurker
Okay. So if you're saying for the rest of 2017?
Yi Chen
Or 2018, if you have -- you can provide some comments, that would be (inaudible).
Nancy Lurker
We haven't given any forward guidance into that. We haven't given any forward guidance. Let me give you thematically where we're going with this. Obviously, we're keeping a tight control on expenses. We have our ongoing Phase III study costs. So, we certainly do not expect expenses to go down. I can say that. And what we do expect is modest -- potentially modest slow increases quarter-over quarter as we start to slowly begin to plan for and then start to build out the commercial infrastructure. Which, again, I want to reiterate, we do not expect to have by any means a large commercial infrastructure here. You do not need it which is another reason why we're going to use a contract sales organization. So we're talking a couple marketers. You've got some -- obviously, we've got a couple of people from managed care. You're going to need a couple people on the medical affairs side. But very, very small footprint. But we're -- I'm not giving forward guidance at this time. Okay. Sorry. Len, why don't you just add one comment?

Leonard Ross
Yes. I think in my earlier comments I indicated that at least for the next few quarters we expected operating cash use to be about 5 million a quarter and that's consistent generally with what it has been and reflects obviously the ongoing cost of the Phase III clinical development program which still has a ways to go before it's totally complete.
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. The next question comes from the line of Shekhar Basu from Basu Capital.
Shekhar Basu
Thank you for taking my call. I appreciate it. I just wondered, the existing product from Alcon -- how much in revenues is that doing? Can you just remind us please?
Debora Jorn
Do you mean Allergan, the OZURDEX?
Shekhar Basu
Sorry, Allergan, yes.
Debora Jorn
Yes. It's about $420 million, I believe.
Nancy Lurker
Well, no, it's projected. It's projected for this year. It did around $263 million in 2016 worldwide.
Debora Jorn
Right.
Shekhar Basu
Okay. And my second question was that your product device is inserted for a period of 3 years and I just wondered, in terms of the adverse events and any inflammation or IOP elevation that one can get in the event that there's adverse event, if the patient -- what is -- well, how does the physician feel about managing that, because they can't really take the insert out, can they?
Dario Paggiarino
Yes, I will answer. That is correct. You don't take the insert out. Now, this is obviously an insert that is delivering fluocinolone and in -- although it's delivering fluocinolone a very low rate and the effects -- we see some effect that are typical of steroids. So, effect on IOP; cataract. But without going to the details about the specific incident, we feel very comfortable about the fact that these are manageable, they are expected and they -- again, consistent with the pharmacological effect of steroids in the eye. But overall I think the feedback from the investigators is positive and I think the data will clearly define the safety profile of this insert.
Nancy Lurker
Yes. That was Dr. Dario Paggiarino, our Chief Medical Officer. Dario, why don't you just comment on the pivotal Phase III 001 data around IOP elevation which was very minimal?
Dario Paggiarino
It's very minimal. So in terms of the -- if we look at the data, now we have 12-month data, so if we look at the IOP elevation at 12 months it's very modest. We're talking about 2 or 3 millimeters compared to the sham which also has very modest. So on average we see very little increase compared to sham. We also -- importantly, we see a modest elevation that is stable over time. And again, as we collect more data, I think it's very important to establish that safety profile.
Nancy Lurker
Okay. And one last question, if I may. On the CSO decision, I don't know how many CSOs actually are able and capable of promoting a very small product to a very small audience. Typically, CSOs are able to do a second or third detail, but not a first detail typically. So I'm just wondering, has the ophthalmic category -- are they really able to "push it" appropriately?
Nancy Lurker
Yes. Well, you asked the right person, because I was the CEO of PDI which was the second-largest CSO in the United States for 7 years until we sold it to Publicis. So I'm very, very familiar with CSOs. And let me assure you, since I know the category so well, that we’re very confident. We know, in fact, indeed, that CSOs absolutely manage small field forces like this. It's not like it used to be in the heydays. If you go back when I first started at PDI, we would hire 300 to 500-person teams and over the years as -- because of what's gone on in the size of -- the shift of pharma into these small specialty disease areas, the average size of teams has gone all the way down to 50 and we often launch teams for people even with 3 reps. That was not atypical at all. So it's very, very doable. And the other key point I just want to make is, remember that one of the errors that people seem -- most people don't understand about CSOs is that they don't -- these reps that they hire, they hire directly for your needs. So it's not their rep. It is their reps, but they're hired and dedicated to a particular product. So in our case, we would lay out for them the profile of the rep that we want them to go out and hire for us. And then they're very, very good at knowing all the representatives across the United States in every therapeutic category and then accessing that -- those databases that they have and recruiting those reps specific to whatever therapeutic area you want them to do. It doesn't matter if it's ophthalmology, hospital, rare disease -- you name it, they can do it. So we're quite confident on that front, that this is eminently doable.

And in fact at my previous clients, we hired PDI. We had a small orphan drug product and actually I utilized Nancy's company, PDI and we built out a team of 5 individuals.
Operator
There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Mr. Sherk for closing remarks.
Douglas Sherk
Thank you, Blair. Before we end the call, I would like to note that in connection with the special meeting of stockholders referenced by Nancy earlier in the call today, the company will be filing a definitive proxy statement concerning the special meeting with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Before making any decision on how to vote at the special meeting, the company's stockholders are urged to read the definitive proxy statement and any other relevant documents filed with the SEC when they become available, because they will contain important information. 
The company's stockholders can obtain free copies of the definitive proxy statement and other documents when they become available by contacting the Company Secretary in care of pSivida Corp., 480 Pleasant Street, Watertown, Massachusetts 02472. In addition, documents filed with the SEC will be available at no charge on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. 
The company and its executive officers and directors may, under SEC rules, be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies from stockholders of the company in connection with the special meeting. Certain information about such individuals, such as their ownership of shares of company common stock and their interest in the solicitation with respect to special meeting will be more specifically set forth in the definitive proxy statement concerning the special meeting that will be filed with the SEC which will be available, again, free of charge on the SEC and the company as I previously noted. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Nancy for closing comments.
Nancy Lurker
Thank you very much for your time. We appreciate it and I look forward to keeping you further updated as we achieve our many milestones that are coming forward. Thank you again.

WATERTOWN, Mass., Sept.  15, 2016  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- pSivida Corp. (NASDAQ:PSDV) (ASX:PVA), a leader in the development of sustained release drug delivery products primarily for eye diseases, announced that its Board of Directors has appointed Nancy Lurker as its President and Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors. Ms. Lurker, a seasoned healthcare executive, brings strong leadership and extensive experience in maximizing the potential of new therapies and successfully implementing innovative U.S. and global drug launches. Paul Ashton, PhD, who has been pSivida's President and Chief 
Executive Officer for many years, has resigned to pursue other interests.
"We are delighted to welcome Nancy Lurker to pSivida. As we move toward the submission of U.S. and E.U. marketing approval applications for Medidur™, this is an ideal time to bring on the skill set and experience Nancy possesses. Nancy's significant experience in building high performing teams, strategic leadership and extensive product commercialization will help us move pSivida to its next stage of development and success. We are grateful to Paul Ashton for his many years of outstanding contribution to pSivida and wish him well in his future endeavors," said David J.

From 2003 to 2006, she served as President and Chief Executive Officer of ImpactRx, Inc., a privately held healthcare information company, now part of IMS Health Holdings, Inc., where she substantially grew revenues and profitability.

cardiovascular, central nervous system, respiratory and women's health drugs, overseeing the worldwide launch of Detrol® and Detrol® LA and repositioning Ambien® for revenue growth.

Ms. Lurker previously served as a member of the Boards of Directors of Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals, plc (NYSE: MNK) and 
Auxilium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: ENDP). Ms. Lurker received a B.S. in Biology from Seattle Pacific University and an M.B.A. from the University of Evansville. About pSivida Corp. pSivida Corp.

Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the pSivida Fiscal Second Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would like now to turn the conference over to Doug Sherk. You may begin.
Doug Sherk
Thank you, operator and good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us today to review pSivida’s fiscal 2017 second quarter and first half results, which ended on December 31, 2016 and as well as recent corporate developments. Making prepared remarks on today’s call are Nancy Lurker, pSivida’s President and Chief Executive Officer and Len Ross, Vice President of Finance. In addition, Dr. Dario Paggiarino, Vice President and Chief Medical Officer, is with us this afternoon and all three are available for questions during the Q&A session.
Before we begin, I’d like to remind you that all the statements other than statements of historical facts are forward-looking statements and we cannot guarantee that the results and other expectations expressed, anticipated or implied will be realized. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected in the forward-looking statements. For a more detailed discussion of risk factors that can impact our future results and financial condition, we refer you to pSivida’s filings with the SEC, including its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016. The company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement in order to reflect recent events or circumstances that may arise after this conference call.
Now I’d like to turn the call over to pSivida’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Nancy Lurker.
Nancy Lurker
Thank you, Doug and good afternoon everyone. I appreciate everyone taking the time to join us this afternoon. This was my first full quarter with pSivida, and with each passing month, I become more impressed with the team and the opportunities afforded by our proven and well-validated science. At the same time, I continue to believe that our technology is an undervalued asset despite having developed 3 of only 4 FDA-approved, sustained release treatments for back of the eye diseases. We are working very hard to change this situation and have made solid progress since we last talked in early November.
Over the next several quarters, we have three overarching objectives for our company. First, we expect to complete European Union and U.S. FDA registration filings during 2017 for our Durasert 3-year uveitis product. Second, we expect to continue the recent progress of several programs using our unique Durasert sustained release technology. And third, we are striving to add at least one additional collaboration partnership with a drug manufacturer utilizing Durasert. Achieving these objectives in a cost-efficient manner is paramount to our team. One of my first acts as CEO was to pre-prioritize pSivida’s development program profile from one that was higher risk, longer term in its focus to one that is now moderate risk and achieves results near term.
We have several significant data and regulatory milestones this year and I believe achieving these milestones should benefit our shareholders. Our Durasert 3-year treatment for posterior segment uveitis is our most advanced clinical program. Posterior segment uveitis impacts approximately 80,000 to 100,000 patients in the United States and another 80,000 to 100,000 patients in Europe. We have few options to treat this chronic inflammatory disease, which is the third leading cause of blindness. The Durasert uveitis second Phase 3 study met its enrollment target and the timing for the readout is planned by the end of second quarter. If you recall, the FDA required two Phase 3 studies for filing, and the first Phase 3 study met its primary efficacy p-value of less than 0.001 and yielded safety data that is consistent with the known effect of ocular corticosteroid use.

We are very pleased with the primary efficacy and safety results at 6 months and the safety and durable efficacy results at 12 months. We remain optimistic the second Phase 3 study readout will be positive due to the robustness of the first Phase 3 trial data and the fact that trial designs are similar. As we discussed during the fiscal first quarter conference call, the European regulators required us to submit a pediatric protocol prior to the EU submission. We submitted the protocol. We received their comments and we expect to have final follow-up discussions during the next coming weeks. The end result is that we continue to expect to file the EU application during the second quarter of calendar 2017. In the U.S., we expect to file the NDA during the second half of calendar 2017.
We have a number of Durasert technology product development opportunities, including our next generation Durasert bio-erodible, shorter duration treatment for posterior segment uveitis and for using collaborations with other drug manufacturers with their small molecules. We recently conducted market research for both our 3-year Durasert for uveitis and 6-month bio-erodible for uveitis. Physicians were very positive about Durasert’s proven ability to deliver a consistent daily micro-dose of a corticosteroid. The consistent daily micro-dose is believed to be one of the reasons behind the efficacy results we are seeing from the clinical studies. In addition, the physicians were impressed with the product’s ability to prevent recurrent flares that often lead to blindness.
Further, our market research also covered physicians’ level of interest in the 6-month bio-erodible for uveitis. That feedback was also very positive for the need for such a shorter acting product. As a result, this research has enhanced our confidence and the market potential for Durasert 3-year uveitis once we receive approval. And in addition, it has also reinforced our prioritization of the 6-month Durasert bio-erodible for uveitis programs and we are conducting formulation testing now. Our objective is to begin preclinical safety and PK studies of this product in the second quarter of calendar 2017. We are also initiating efforts to form collaborations with other drug manufacturers for combining their small molecule drugs with this shorter duration form of Durasert to address patient needs in other indications.
Another clinical program underway is the Durasert implant for severe osteoarthritis of the knee. As we have reported, the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York and pSivida announced the opening of an investigator-sponsored IND of Durasert to treat severe OA of the knee. The Durasert implant is designed to provide long-term pain relief for severe knee OA, which if affected could potentially result in the delay of knee replacement surgery. To-date, 5 patients have received the implant and the Hospital for Special Surgery expects to have the final patient implanted during the next month. While a safety and tolerability study changed from baseline in weekly mean of pain intensity scored at rest during activity and at night will be assessed weekly through 24 weeks. We are currently in discussion with HSS about the next steps for this program.
Turning to our TKI program for wet AMD, the evaluation of additional TKIs are underway and we have identified multiple suitable TKI candidates for further formulation work. We have determined that pending the evaluation of TKI candidates, we intend to advance this program only through the development of a corporate partnership. Finally, there is our Tethadur preclinical program that applies proprietary technology to achieve the sustained release of large molecule, such as biologics, through a silica-based technology. Preclinical activities on this program are continuing and we are implementing a strategy to pursue partnerships to advance the program’s development.

In addition to our ongoing programs, we have also taken steps during the past few weeks to expedite potential collaborations based on our proven Durasert technology with other drug candidates. Deb Jorn, who has joined pSivida in November, is heading up this effort, and she and the team are focused on establishing additional new collaborations and EU outlicensing partnership and preparing for the U.S. launch of our Durasert 3-year uveitis program. Once again, our objective is to enter into at least one new additional collaboration agreement prior to the end of the current calendar year.
Before I turn the call over to Len, let me summarize why we are excited. First, on the regulatory front, we plan on submitting the EU marketing approval application for our Durasert 3-year treatment for posterior segment uveitis in the second quarter of the current calendar year. And in the U.S., we continue to expect to submit the NDA in the second half of the calendar year. Second, we will be announcing the results of our second Phase 3 clinical trials in posterior segment uveitis by the end of the first half of calendar 2017. Again, we feel very good about the prospects for a positive outcome of the study due to the positive results of the first Phase 3 study. Third, we are also looking forward to the implantation of the 6 patient for OA at HSS, the data evaluation and then working with HSS to determine the next steps. And lastly, Deb and her team continue to foster relationships with potential collaboration and outlicense partners. Our goal is to enter into at least one additional collaboration agreement with drug developers for our Durasert technology and an EU out-license for our 3-year uveitis product. We are also making very solid progress on both those fronts.
I will now turn the call over to Len Ross for a brief review of our first quarter financials. Len?
Len Ross
Thank you, Nancy and good afternoon everyone. I will briefly review our fiscal second quarter and first half results that we reported following today’s close. Revenue for the second fiscal quarter ended December 2016 was $6 million compared to $526,000 for the prior year quarter. The year-over-year increase was primarily attributable to the recognition of deferred collaborative research and development revenue totaling $5.6 million, resulting from the terminated collaboration agreement with Pfizer disclosed in late December. Second quarter operating expenses were $6.1 million compared to $5.8 million a year earlier. The general and administrative expenses were higher in this year’s quarter compared to the prior year, primarily due to severance related costs. Our research and development costs were lower in this year’s second quarter, primarily due to the higher expense accruals associated with the Durasert Phase 3 clinical trials in the year ago quarter. The net loss for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 was $67,000 or a breakeven on a per share basis compared to a net loss of $5.2 million or $0.18 per share for the prior year quarter.
At December 31, 2016, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $17.5 million. During the second quarter, we used approximately $5 million for operations and we anticipate a somewhat higher rate of cash usage from operations in the third fiscal quarter due to the timing of annual insurance policy renewals and clinical milestone payments. As we have noted on previous calls, the timing and amounts of our CRO clinical milestone payments have continuously fluctuated from quarter-to-quarter. The Board and management are consistently evaluating strategies to provide the company with the resources required to achieve our objectives and are keenly focused on those strategies that would minimize shareholder dilution.

I will now turn the call back over to Nancy for her closing comments.
Nancy Lurker
Thank you, Len. Our focus on moderate risk near-term potential product development programs should yield promising results. The feedback we received from our recently conducted market research validates that our Durasert 3-year uveitis product meets an unmet need in the marketplace as well as the initial physician interest in the 6-month program for uveitis. In summary, we have a number of solid catalysts this year. And I look forward to providing updates as we continue to make progress.
Operator, we are ready now to take questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Matt Kaplan from Ladenburg Thalmann. Your line is now open.
Matt Kaplan
Hi guys, can you hear me?
Nancy Lurker
We can hear you. Hi Matt.
Matt Kaplan
Hi Nancy. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess starting off just focusing on the European filing for the 3-year Durasert, can you give us a sense in terms of where you are in finalizing the pediatric study protocol with European regulatory authorities?
Nancy Lurker
Yes. We are very close and we are actually quite pleased with the progress that we have made. They have been very responsive. And as a result, as I have said, we remain very confident that we will be able to close it out and file in the second quarter of fiscal – of calendar year 2017.
Matt Kaplan
Okay, very good. And then drilling down a little bit with respect to your plans in Europe, where are you in your European partnering discussions as you get closer to filing, when can we expect a potential partnership?
Nancy Lurker
Well, let me just say this that we have been – first of all, Deb Jorn, who is our Executive Vice President of Corporate Development has done a fantastic job leading that effort and we have been in contact with tens of multiples of companies around the potential out-license. And we are on track. Obviously, I am not going to go into specifics in terms of timing, but we have a very thorough process for that auction. And so far, we have had good responses. So I would expect that certainly before the second half of the year is out that we may be able to answer that question. If not, in the third quarter would be the goal, by the third quarter of calendar 2017. As you know, though Matt, I just want to caution that obviously as you get into due diligence and then final negotiation, sometime things can take a little longer than anticipated.
Matt Kaplan
Fair enough. I guess, do you expect to have multiple kind of regional or country specific partnerships or would it be one kind of for the entire region in the Europe?
Nancy Lurker
Yes. You know what, I am not going to predict at this time. Let me just say again, it could be either one of those. And we will see what the level of interest is. Obviously, as you are going – someone who has got global reach, they are a much, much larger company, if you are going to a more regional approach, then you are going to be dealing with obviously more mid-size to smaller players.
Matt Kaplan
Great. And then with your osteoarthritis of the knee program, congrats on the progress there. Can you give us a sense in terms of how the first five patients that you have treated so far, how did they look and what are the results there?
Nancy Lurker
I am going to actually turn that over to Dr. Paggiarino who is our Chief Medical Officer to discuss the HSS program.
Dario Paggiarino
Yes. Matt, so first of all, this was as you recall a safety study primarily in a small number of patients. So the first objective was to evaluate safety, but also to have the opportunity to have a preliminary assessment of the effect on pain and function. And overall, to-date, the data seem to suggest that the treatment is well tolerated and there may be some indications of – that these patients are doing well. So we look forward for the six patients we enrolled in the study.

Matt Kaplan
And how should we – how should we think about in terms of the presentation or announcement of the data once the six-patient is valuable, will that be in a press release or we will have to wait to it till it’s presented at a medical meeting or how will that work?
Nancy Lurker
Yes. First of all, we are in a collaboration with HSS, so we will have to work with them on that. And right now, we are looking at it will be summer time before anything gets released just because of the timing of the enrollment of the patients. And I am not going to speculate at this time how we would release those data.
Matt Kaplan
And when you said in your prepared remarks, you are kind of looking at the next steps for the program, what are you contemplating in terms of next steps at this point?
Nancy Lurker
Yes. So the next steps with HSS is going to be finalizing how we are going to work together going forward. So any number of types of arrangements are currently being considered with HSS.
Matt Kaplan
Okay. And that includes doing a larger type of Phase 2 study or...?
Nancy Lurker
Yes. So first of all, there is a big math – there is the basic structure of the agreement and then there is the clinical plan going forward. So both of those items need to be – need to still be worked on. We were in the process of both of those discussions now.
Matt Kaplan
Okay, very good, that’s helpful. Well, thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the progress across the board.
Nancy Lurker
Okay. Thank you, Matt.
Operator
Thank you. And your next question comes from Suraj Kalia from Northland Securities. Your line is now open.
Suraj Kalia
Good afternoon folks. Thank you for taking my question. So Nancy, let me start out with the Durasert bio-erodible, a couple of sub-questions within this question, why six months, is it just because uveitis occurs or at least most of the recurrence occurs within the first six months to nine months, is that why you are all choosing a six-month, is it because of the technology or is it simply because as a way to reduce IOP and glaucoma numbers in the bio-erodible implant?
Nancy Lurker
Yes. So those are all very good questions. And again, I am going to answer some of them. I am going to turn some of it over to the Dario again. But let me just say this, in general, with our technology, we can time the release depending on the molecule that’s in there from one month by month all the way out to 36 months. So it’s not a matter of that’s what the technology will allow, because we could – literally with our corticosteroid, we could time it for eight months, we could time it for 12 months. It doesn’t matter. We have that level of sophistication around how much we release over what time period. The reason we have gone for six months is because consistently, when we have gone out and done market research and there has been prior market research that’s been done at pSivida as well as this most recent market research that we did as well as when we are in discussions with potential collaboration partners with their small molecules, consistently what comes out is that six months is an ideal window where physicians want to be able to say, alright, most – as you know, most drugs for back of the eye disease are administered with monthly injections, that’s typical. So you are not typically going to get payer response or the value that you need unless you can get beyond three months with patients, because if you end up with just two months to three months, we got to come back in, it’s not that much of an improvement over a monthly injection. And so then the second thing is, is they don’t want to go beyond six months, because it takes too long before they see the patient again, you run the risk of saying – and regardless, either with our 3 years, they would still expect they are going to see the patients back in the office on a semiregular basis. So, 6 months seems to be that nice window when it is long enough that you are getting a real advantage over monthly injections, but not so long as well that they run the risk of losing the patient to oversize. So I am going to turn it over to Dr. Paggiarino if he wants to add anything to that.

Dario Paggiarino
No, I think I don’t really have much to add. I think it gives the flexibility of treating physicians to those patients with the flexible schedule.
Suraj Kalia
But Nancy, would I be too far off in saying that maybe unintended or an unintended effect of this could be reducing high IOP and/or glaucoma incidents in these patients who are treated with the bio-erodible implant, could that be a direct correlation?
Dario Paggiarino
It’s hard to speculate on data. We will – I think the clinical data will have to speak to that. Now, the advantage of – so I don’t want to speculate on the effect on eye specifically certainly the advantage of the bio-erodible by itself is that the components of the inserts are absorbed. So they may allow maybe dosing, but in terms of side effect profile of a bio-erodible [indiscernible] I think it’s too early to hit through that.
Nancy Lurker
Yes. But let me just add, Suraj as well, that clearly with the Durasert technology in general, we have made enormous progress since Retisert was put on the market. And so our intraocular serum levels of corticosteroid are much, much lower than when you get to with the bolus injection that occur monthly, even some of the competitor who is out there, when they are injecting, you get a much higher spike in corticosteroid and there is a good correlation, though it’s not been proven positive. It’s certainly there is a correlation between that and IOP.
Suraj Kalia
Got it. And how much do you all intend to spend on this program?
Nancy Lurker
We are not going to disclose that. But let me just say this right now that relative to other clinical programs, it’s modest in cost and we are going to be highly conscious to do it in the most cost efficient manner. You can imagine because we will be looking at this as potentially a supplemental new NDA to our current NDA that the cost could be lower than a new NDA.
Suraj Kalia
Got it. In terms of the pediatric indication in Europe Nancy, help me understand or at least remind me, why pediatric, why now, why go down this – I mean is uveitis a big issue in pediatrics and forgive me if I am just end of the day, I am sort of brain-dead and maybe it is but...?
Nancy Lurker
You have been on too many calls, Suraj.
Suraj Kalia
Yes, its earnings seasons, so forgive me.
Nancy Lurker
Look, it’s not a problem at all. We are required to. We submitted a waiver. I believe we disclosed this early. We submitted a waiver. That waiver was denied. So the European regulatory authorities are basically, as a condition of filing requiring us to have an approved pediatric protocol. It is extremely rare in children to see this condition and that is why we requested a waiver. However, the regulatory authorities believe since the conditions still exist, they would like to see that we conduct this study. And again, I want to reiterate the study, we do not – will not need to be started until after we get the drug approved.
Suraj Kalia
Got it. And finally Nancy, maybe I missed this, any update on your CSO strategy, that would be great? Folks, thank you for taking my questions.
Nancy Lurker
No update at this time. It’s still too early. We would expect to start that post-filing in the U.S.
Suraj Kalia
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Vernon Bernardino from FBR & Company. Your line is now open.
Vernon Bernardino
Hi Nancy. Thanks for taking my question. Most of them were related to the certain implants in severe osteoarthritis, but just going back as far as the study is concerned, how do you decide, for example, you have dosed five patients, how do you decide how and when to proceed to the next patient in this case the six patients?
Nancy Lurker
That’s strictly related to the patient enrollment criteria. And again, this is an investigator sponsored study, so we are not involved in that. And that is strictly related to making sure that the patients meet the enrollment criteria.

Vernon Bernardino
And can you remind us, in particular what that is, such that it’s met and then they proceed onto the next patient?
Nancy Lurker
Yes, again, I will have Dr. Paggiarino answer these questions.
Dario Paggiarino
So the plan was to enroll six patients and the – with the objective of waiting essentially safety and efficacy, preliminary efficacy. And so the criteria of these are patients who are candidates for knee replacement and they will obviously benefit from the improvement companion function. And so the targeted number was six patients and on the basis that, that would allow again a preliminary assessment, but also the ability to work with the insert and really refine the insertion technology, so to speak from the surgeon.
Vernon Bernardino
Okay. And it’s an exciting opportunity obviously, but can you confirm that one other things you might disclose is a data on delay of knee replacement surgery or no?
Nancy Lurker
No, that’s not one of the in criteria.
Dario Paggiarino
These are candidates, yes.
Nancy Lurker
Right. These are candidates. And remember, we expect to disclose the results after the end of six months and that is the end points are pain measured on WOMAC score, which is a very well validated pain score, as well as overall knee movement and articulation. It’s not – at this early stage Phase 1 it’s not delay of TKR, though we would expect it potentially as we move into Phase 2 that could be one of the endpoints.
Vernon Bernardino
Okay. So we won’t see any data as far as on TKR?
Nancy Lurker
No.
Vernon Bernardino
Okay, alright. Just want to confirm that. That’s all the questions I have. Thank you.
Nancy Lurker
You’re very welcome.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Guy Dietrich from Dietrich Capital Partners. Your line is now open.
Nancy Lurker
Hi Guy.
Guy Dietrich
Hi, Nancy. How are you today?
Nancy Lurker
Good.
Guy Dietrich
I have got a two-part question. Given the FDA has indicated they are potentially embarking on a much more streamlined approval process, I am wondering if I can get a little more transparency on your thinking on this subject and how it could favorably impact pSivida? And then secondly, given the strength of your first Phase 3 trial for posterior uveitis, which really had superb results, despite these really compelling results, the FDA requested a second Phase 3 trial, which may not be concluded until mid-year. So I wonder given the dynamics in place right now and I realize it’s sort of a moving target, have you considered sort of a more rapid and perhaps filing an NDA just based on the strength of your first Phase 3 trials while continuing the second one?
Nancy Lurker
Yes. So, actually good question, Guy, and we did consider that. And in fact, we did go back and show the FDA our first Phase 3 trial results, because they were so robust and the FDA still wants us to finish and file along with the second study. So we did attempt to do that. I will also say that we continue to look at other ways that we could approach this to expedite things. We have retained outside consultant who has got a lot of expertise in this as well as obviously continue to rely on our internal regulatory expertise. And it continues to fall in line that right now, we need to continue to file both studies and we are filing them as quick as possible after we get the results in. As to whether or not we would anticipate anything to speed up, I think again what we have heard from, again, both our internal regulatory as well as external is that you need to get the FDA – new FDA commissioner in place. It’s going to probably take just a little bit of time. So I would expect that if anything, it probably wouldn’t impact us on the current regulatory filings, perhaps it could impact when we file – potentially file for our 6-month bio-erodible.

Guy Dietrich
Okay, thank you.
Nancy Lurker
Thank you, Guy.
Operator
I am showing no further questions at this moment. I’d like to turn the call back to management for any further remarks.
