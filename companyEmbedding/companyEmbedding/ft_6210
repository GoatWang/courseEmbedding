Product Description
WERNER 10 ft. Fiberglass St
				    	
					
Amazon.com
Designed for heavy-duty industrial use, Werner 6200 Series Fiberglass Stepladders are duty rated at 300 pounds. They are ideal for commercial jobsites and maintenance professionals, as well as for residential users. Constructed of fiberglass rails, aluminum steps, aluminum step braces, and plastic EDGE bracing, these ladders are designed for the jobsite, and their functionality will help increase productivity. Each 6200 Series Fiberglass Stepladder features a HolsterTop that includes holes and a parts tray for holding commonly used tools. So whether you use your ladder every day or every week, you can depend on the 6200 Series Fiberglass Stepladder to provide a sturdy and safe work surface.                6200 Series Fiberglass StepladdersAt a Glance:  300-pound capacity HolsterTop includes Lock-In Accessory feature Slip-resistant steps Molded brace and foot pad combination provides enhanced strength Fiberglass rails are non-conductive                    Traction-Tred steps are slip resistant. View larger.           HolsterTop holds commonly used tools and is ToolLasso and JobBucket ready. View larger.   EDGE molded brace and foot pad combination provides enhanced bracing strength. View larger.    Type IA StepladdersAll Werner 6200 Fiberglass Stepladders have a Type IA duty rating, which means the load capacity is 300 pounds (combined weight of user and materials). Additionally, all 6200 Series stepladders feature slip-resistant Traction-Tred steps that are double riveted and braced for a safe climb and descent. Each 6200 Series stepladder features slip-resistant, non-marring feet. Also, a full set of rear horizontals (including two that are knee braced) are spaced one per step. HolsterTop is ToolLasso ReadyEach 6200 Series stepladder features a plastic HolsterTop that will safely hold a gallon or quart of paint, cordless drill, fasteners, or hand tools. The HolsterTop is designed for Lock-In accessories like the ToolLasso and JobBucket. These types of accessories allow you to safely hang tools or hold work materials to increase your work surface and decrease the number of times you're up and down the ladder, which increases productivity. EDGE Braces, Backup Plates, and Heavy-Duty Rivets for Durability6200 Series Fiberglass Stepladders feature EDGE (Energy Diffusing Geometry) braces at their bases. These molded braces provide enhanced strength and increased protection against damage during use and transport. Shoulder bolts and nuts connect each ladder top to the rear rail, and the hardware is reinforced with metal back-up plates. Four rivets attach the top to each front rail, and all rivets on the 6200 Series stepladders are backed up by metal plates or washers to protect the fiberglass. Safe for Use around ElectricityBecause Werner 6200 Series stepladders are made with fiberglass rails, the rails are electrically non-conductive and are safer to use around electricity than aluminum ladders. These reliable stepladders will ensure safe and secure footing on your next job. About Werner: The Pros' ChoiceWerner, the most trusted name in ladders, is preferred by pros more than any other brand. For over 60 years, pros have looked to Werner to supply their climbing equipment needs. Werner manufactures a full line of safe, professional-grade products for any job, and it builds its ladders to withstand even the most challenging tasks--that's why Werner ladders are found on more jobsites than any other brand.

It's easy enough for me to move around with no difficulty at all.I also read that it arrived without a box and was scratched. It's true, it arrived without a box and probably had a few scratches...

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsExcellent LadderByDuffer.VINE VOICEon March 27, 2015Size Name: 8 Feet|Verified PurchaseThe ladder  is top notch. It was not packaged nor did I expect it to be. Clear plastic wrapping surrounded the bottom of the legs to keep them from opening during shipping. The ladder is in excellent condition. The ladder is not a lightweight but even though I am an old geezer I have no problem moving this ladder around. It is very sturdy and solidly built. It has all kinds of features including a paint can hook, screwdriver slot, other tool slots and a number of other conveniences. This is a top notch ladder and one of the best, if not the best, I have ever owned. Very highly recommended.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse4.0 out of 5 stars8 ft step ladderBybilliegon June 18, 2017Size Name: 8 Feet|Verified PurchaseI have needed a tall step ladder for some time now.  After considering various lengths I settled on 8 feet.The ladder arrived within the dates provided and in great condition.Good company to do business with.  Good Ladder manufacturing company.  I have long owned a 24 ft extension ladder from Wermer.  My only disappointment is that the 24 ft ladder that I own was manufactured in the USA.  I assumed that this ladder was also made in the USA.  It is not.Thus, the reason I give this 4 stars. Shame on me for not looking closer!Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsfar I'm very happy with this purchaseByM. Wyatton June 23, 2016Size Name: 8 Feet|Verified PurchaseSo, far I'm very happy with this purchase. I am not very tall, and my balance isn't great so wanted a ladder that I could safely get up high enough to change outdoor lightbulbs and not have to wait for someone to help me. It is not too heavy at all, a little awkward going round a tight turn on a staircase but obviously because it is 8' tall. I feel very comfortable on the ladder so this is great!Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsSolid LadderByBillyBoyon March 7, 2015Size Name: 10 Feet|Verified PurchaseWilson Trucking, an international carrier delivered it to my door 4-days after ordering...unboxed, scuffed a little, masking taped on the legs. It replaced a wooden 10-ft heavier ladder. After use, the most noticeable quality is its large stance and stability. This is a quality ladder and I like it.I stood on the next-to-last step cleaning a ceiling fan and was balanced comfortably. At 39 lbs. and for this 68 year old, it is light weight. Also, I own a Werner 24-foot extension ladder with Werner ladder stabilizer. Werner ladders are reliable for a lifetime.Read more0Comment|

The Werner fiberglass stepladder is the finest quality ladder I have ever seen or used. The construction is incredibly strong everywhere. When the ladder is folded in position, it is very secure and will not move. I feel very secure working off of my new ladder. I would highly recommend this ladder made by Werner to everyone. I am certain that all the different size ladders made by Warner are of equal fine quality.Read more11 comment|

Can you send me a link where I can find the replacement type to order ?         Asked by: Anonymous             Please visit our website at www.buywerneronline.com to order your desired replacement parts online.

In order to determine the model of spreaders you need you will need your model number and MK/MARK number available off of your ladder. For further assistance please contact customer service toll free number is 888-523-3370 Monday through Friday 8 AM till 5 PM EST.            Answered by: Werner Customer Care Date published: 2016-08-25                We need replacement stickers for the ladders we own. Can we get them through you?                     We have a 10' Fiberglass Single side Step Ladder that no longer has legible stickers detailing the ladder information. Are we able to get replacement sticker for them through you?         Asked by: Anonymous             Werner Co. does offer replacement safety label kits and duty rating label kits. These kits may be special ordered through your local distributors. Please provide the distributor with your model number and they can special order the correct kits for your unit.

Answered by: Werner Customer Care Date published: 2015-02-23                whether 6210 10 ft IA fiberglass step ladders are non conductive of electricity                     in our substation project right now we are using whether 6210 10 ft IA fiberglass step ladders but as per safety officer these ladders are not suitable for the substation please clarify.         Asked by: Anonymous             The 6210 ladder does have non conductive fiberglass rails that make the ladder safe to use around electricity.            Answered by: Werner Customer Care Date published: 2016-03-30                Can the ladder be left outside?                     I don't have an indoor space for a 10' ladder so I hang it on the fence on the side of my house. It is in the direct sunlight most of the day. The ladder is fiberglass and the color seems to be getting lighter. Does constant exposure to the sun degrade the strength of the ladder?         Asked by: Anonymous             Exposure to the sunlight and weathering can affect resin coating on a fiberglass ladder. A ladder left in these conditions can experience a Surface Weathering or Fiber Bloom. In this situation it is recommended to recoat the ladder. Please visit the Literature section of our website to find the Fiberglass Technical Manual for further information and treatment for a fiberglass ladder.            Answered by: Werner Customer Care Date published: 2017-06-22                Can we make an educated guess?                     Another ladder with missing decals. It's a 10' orange step ladder that needs a new top. The old top is aluminum no holes, just a &quot;not a step&quot; warning in the metal. The top is torn and needs to be replaced for safety reasons. Can anyone offer a suggestion as to what top would fit? Thanks Wm. Bowles.. I was told the phone number for this site is no longer in service.         Asked by: Anonymous             Please contact our Customer Care Department when convenient at 888-523-3370 Monday through Friday 8 AM till 5 PM EST for further details on your issue and/or question.            Answered by: Werner Customer Care Date published: 2015-10-01                What does it mean &quot;max standing height&quot;?           Asked by: Anonymous             The Maximum Standing Height is defined as the maximum height which a user can safely stand when using the ladder in proper set up position.            Answered by: Werner Customer Care Date published: 2015-03-19                Can the back stabilizers be replaced?           Asked by: Anonymous             Unfortunately these parts are not able to be replaced on this ladder.            Answered by: Werner Customer Care Date published: 2016-09-29                can I buy a replacement top piece for a 6208 ladder           Asked by: Anonymous             Yes the top of the 6208 ladder is replaceable. In order to determine which top will fit your model of ladder, we would also need the mark number (MK) on the ladder. This number can be found on the duty rating on the side rail of the ladder. If your MK is 12,13,14,15,16, or 17, you would need to order the 38-31. If your MK is 18 you would nee 38-32. If the MK on your ladder is not one of the MK's I have listed above, then we do not have a top for your model of ladder.            Answered by: Werner Customer Care Date published: 2015-07-17                Replacement Labels                     Hi,

I work in an educational environment and have a ladder like the one shown. I noticed the labels are worn off on my ladder. I like my department (IT Dept.) compliant with OSHA. Does Werner distribute replacement labels? If so, how would I obtain these? Thank you for any help you can give. 

Sincerely, 
Philip Long 
IT Director         Asked by: Anonymous             Werner Co. does offer replacement safety label kits, and duty rating label kits. These kits may be special ordered through your local distributors. Please provide the distributor with your model number and they can special order the correct kits for your unit.            Answered by: Werner Customer Care Date published: 2016-10-05                What is the warrantee on this ladder?                     What is the time and coverage if it has a warrantee at all , as I can find no reference to one anywhere?         Asked by: Anonymous             Werner Co. does not offer a written or implied warranty on its products. We do stand behind the quality and workmanship of our models. Issues of this nature would usually become evident within the first 6 to 12 months of ownership.

Different types of ladders are designed to keep you safe and productive when 
climbing or standing. Using the wrong style of ladder or simply ignoring the 
limitations of climbing equipment can result in a fall or serious injury.
                








                Height is referring to the actual ladder height. Extension ladders should be 7 to 10 feet longer than the highest support or contact point, which may be the wall or roof line. The highest standing level is four rungs down from the top. The highest permitted standing level on a stepladder is two steps down from the top.
                
Reach height is the maximum reach assuming a 5’6” person with a vertical 12” reach.
            




    
    Ladders are designed to safely hold up to a specific amount of weight. The Werner Performance System defines five different capacities using a color and star rating system. 
	The Duty Rating is defined as the maximum safe load capacity of the ladder. A person’s fully clothed weight plus the weight of any tools and 
	materials that are carried onto the ladder must be less than the load capacity. 
	



    
Werner offers ladder made from fiberglass and aluminum. Each material has characteristics which 
make it best for certain applications, or one material may simply fit the personal preferences 
of the user. For example, if working around electricity users should select fiberglass products 
due to their non-conductive side rails.
