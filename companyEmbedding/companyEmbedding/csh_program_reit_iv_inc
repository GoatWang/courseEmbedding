PHOENIX, March 28, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- The Board of Directors (the "Board") of Cole Credit Property Trust IV, Inc. ("CCPT IV" or the "Company"), a publicly registered non-listed real estate investment trust ("REIT") focused on investing in high-quality, income-producing necessity retail properties, net leased to creditworthy tenants under long-term leases, today announced an estimated per share net asset value ("NAV") of the Company's common stock of $10.08 as of December 31, 2016. This represents an increase over the previous per share NAV determined by the Board of $9.92 as of September 30, 2016, which was the second valuation that the Company had conducted.


"CCPT IV's net leased single-tenant assets and anchored shopping centers continue to perform well given the necessity-based nature of our tenants," said Thomas W. Roberts, Chief Executive Officer and President of CCPT IV. "Based on the portfolio's strong diversification, along with its overall credit quality and tenant roster, we believe that CCPT IV continues to be well-positioned in today's real estate market to maximize its value on behalf of our stockholders." 
Estimated Per Share NAVThe Company engaged Duff & Phelps, LLC ("Duff & Phelps"), an independent global advisory and corporate finance consulting firm that specializes in providing real estate valuation services, to assist the Board with determining an estimated per share NAV and a valuation range of CCPT IV. Using the NAV Methodology, Duff & Phelps arrived at a valuation range of $9.57 to $10.65 per share. The estimated per share NAV of $10.08, which is the approximate mid-point of the valuation range from Duff & Phelps, was determined and approved by the Board based on the recommendation of its valuation committee, which is comprised solely of independent directors, including the independent Chairman of the Board. The Board is ultimately and solely responsible for the establishment of the estimated per share NAV.
The estimated per share NAV was based upon the estimated market value of the Company's assets, less the estimated market value of the Company's liabilities, divided by the total shares outstanding, and was performed in accordance with the valuation guidelines established by the Investment Program Association Practice Guideline 2013-01, Valuations of Publicly Registered Non-Listed REITs. The estimated per share NAV does not reflect any "portfolio premium," nor does it reflect an enterprise value for the Company. The Board intends to determine an updated estimated per share NAV on at least an annual basis. 
To date, CCPT IV has paid 59 consecutive monthly distributions to its stockholders, with a current distribution rate equal to an annualized amount of $0.625 per share. The distribution amount per share declared by the Board is not affected by the determination of the NAV.
About Cole Credit Property Trust IV, Inc.CCPT IV is a public, non-listed REIT formed in 2012 that invests in income-producing retail commercial real estate primarily leased to creditworthy tenants under long-term, net leases. CCPT IV seeks to provide access to high-quality retail real estate assets, providing the potential for current income, reduced portfolio volatility and capital appreciation for its stockholders.

These statements include, but are not limited to, statements related to the Company's expectations regarding the performance of its business and the methodology and assumptions used in determining the most recent estimated per share NAV of the Company's common stock, and the Company's ability to maximize the value of the Company's portfolio. Duff & Phelps relied on forward-looking information, some of which was provided by or on behalf of the Company, in preparing its valuation materials. Therefore, neither such statements nor Duff & Phelps' valuation materials are intended to, nor shall they, serve as a guarantee of the Company's performance in future periods. You can identify these forward-looking statements by the use of words such as "outlook," "believes," "expects," "potential," "continues," "may," "will," "should," "seeks," "approximately," "projects," "predicts," "intends," "plans," "estimates," "anticipates" or the negative version of these words or other comparable words. Such forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described under the section entitled "Risk Factors" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). These factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included in this release and in the Company's filings with the SEC. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Actual events occurring after the Company's determination of an estimated per share NAV may cause the value of, and returns on, the Company's investments to be less than those used for purposes of determining the Company's estimated per share NAV.
