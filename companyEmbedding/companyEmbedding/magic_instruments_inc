Only Magic Instruments enables you to start learning guitar by playing and practicing your favorite songs on Day 1—without the finger numbing drills and limited song selections of other methods. With every song, you’ll progressively master strumming styles and chords without even realizing how quickly you’re advancing. When ready, players can switch from one finger chords in Magic Mode to Traditional mode to use conventional guitar chords and fingerings. From day one, the MI Guitar lets you make music, and, soon after, it’ll make you a musician.
$18 will be added for shipping for US mailing addresses.

                        "The fun part of guitar isn’t doing it the hard way. It’s playing for yourself and others. By simplifying fret board with buttons, you can concentrate on adding some flare to how you strum, and singing along."

iPad Pro 10.5 review: Meet the best iPad Apple has ever made


















Not everyone is blessed with musical talent. But that’s OK, because technology can make up for what we lack. I just tried out a digital guitar that made me feel like a virtuoso despite having no skills whatsoever.

You’ve probably played Guitar Hero or Rock Band before, and using the new rhythm guitar from Magic Instruments is a similar type of experience, though it feels less like a game and more like a real jam session. This guitar won’t teach you how to position your fingers on the fretboard, because those complicated finger gymnastics have been replaced by buttons. To play a chord, you press a button and start strumming.

A karaoke-style app guides you through a song by putting numbers over words so you know which button to press and when. The app will have tens of thousands of songs at launch and cost $5.99 a month to access all of them, or you can pay 99 cents per song.

Magic Instruments
The Magic Instruments guitar requires no knowledge of sheet music, so it’s not designed for people who want to learn how to play the old-fashioned way. But not everyone has the time to commit to beginner guitar lessons, and even if they do, picking up an instrument as an adult is incredibly difficult. That’s why Magic Instruments cofounder and CEO Brian Fan created the digital guitar. Despite having years of musical experience as a pianist, Fan found that teaching himself to play the guitar was an exercise in futility, especially with a new baby to take care of. Using his music expertise and tech background, Fan dreamed up an easy-to-use interface and tapped industrial design team Ammunition Group to create the finished product.

The Magic Instruments guitar’s button-based fretboard isn’t at all similar to a real fretboard, but the sounds it makes are just like an electric guitar. You can strum chords or finger pick notes, and apply digital effects like reverb and chorus. It has a standard output jack, a headphone jack, and a MIDI out so you can use it with your Mac to record songs in GarageBand.

I also loved the look and feel of the guitar. It’s lightweight at 5 pounds and stylish to boot, with a matte white or matte black finish.

Magic Instruments just launched a 30-day Indiegogo campaign to raise $50,000 and is prepping to ship the first wave of orders early next year. The preorder price is $299, and the guitar will retail for $399.

About Magic Instruments, Inc.






At Magic Instruments, (YC W16, Highway1 F15) we are a world class, all-star and a small close-knit team of engineers and product designers. Our mission is to create a world that inspires human connection through music playing. We give people all the joy of playing music without learning traditional methods.
We’re developing a new class of music instruments and the ecosystem around them, starting with our first product, a new type of guitar that anyone can play using an intuitive UI on the fretboard and a mobile app to play your favorite songs, instantly.
Magic happens with a single touch.
Like a traditional model, this guitar features strings for fingerpicking and strumming. But on the fretboard it has buttons that play entire chords with a single touch. Pair it with our companion mobile app so you can play songs virtually instantly, rather than having to master awkward finger positions.
Designed to allow anyone to instantly play music.
Magic Instruments enables anyone - including people with no musical background - to play musical instruments. We add software musical intelligence into music hardware to give people musical superpowers.
Music shouldn't be hard.
With so many options to choose from, the hardest part of recreating your favorite music is picking which song to play first. Our companion mobile app enables you to find lyrics and chords instantly, which can be followed via an intuitive karaoke-style display.
Your ears won't believe what your hands can do.
Make your own music.
You’ll be surprised how easily you will start to express yourself musically. Whether you’re writing a song or just jamming away, your last 30 minutes will always be recorded. So it’s easy to play back a tune or share something special with friends and family online.
Easy play back and share your creation.

We are located in the sunny and vibrant Mission district in San Francisco and just one block away from BART, come join us!

Regulating drone airspace using ‘smart markets’











 


90% of people who try to learn guitar quit in the first year. So when Brian Fan wanted to start strumming out lullabies for his baby daughter, he reinvented the instrument itself. Suddenly, a single finger on a button could replace four on different strings, and anyone could learn to play popular songs in a few minutes.
Meet the Magic Instruments Rhythm guitar. It might look like a toy video game controller from Guitar Hero, but it can play real music through its built-in speaker. And with the accompanying app, you’ll get instructions for how play tons of popular songs by big name artists from The Beatles to Bob Marley.
The Magic Instruments guitar goes on pre-sale today on Indiegogo starting at $299, and will start shipping in Q1 2017

“The guitar is a 100 year old user interface based on the physics of vibrating strings” Fan tells me. Technology has made everything else easier, so why not the six-string? That premise earned Magic Instruments a spot in the latest Y Combinator accelerator class.
The way it works is that when you select a song or key, each chord in the scale is laid out in order on the fret board’s buttons. That let’s you change to a blue scale or any other style without having to figure out new finger placements.
Rather than a plastic toggle switch like Guitar Hero, the Rhythm Guitar has fake strings with velocity sensitivity to strum or finger-pick. They give the tactile feel of a real guitar, and can take a hard shredding, but never need to be tuned. There’s even reverb and tone knobs to customize your sound.
It still takes some practice to sight-read the Magic Instruments’ specialized sheet music. At least you won’t lose your place since the guitar’s app detects the notes you play and auto-advances the tablature. Through its standard guitar amp, MIDI, and headphone jack outputs, you can play  loud and proud or quietly for yourself.
You can also freestyle, playing whatever you want. Rock ban Muse’s lead singer Matt Bellamy is an investor, and he told me he uses it to write songs since it’s so easy to recreate what’s in his head without fumbling to find where to put his fingers. The guitar automatically records your last 30 minutes of playing so if you discover the perfect riff, you won’t forget it.

But what’s special is how the device lets beginners refocus on self-expression and playing songs instead of the nitty-gritty finger placements traditional guitars require.
The fun part of guitar isn’t doing it the hard way. It’s playing for yourself and others. By simplifying fret board with buttons, you can concentrate on adding some flare to how you strum, and singing along.
I’ve played guitar casually for a few years, but learning new songs and new chords takes forever. Yet I was playing a complicated song like “House Of The Rising Sun” almost instantly thanks to Magic Instruments.
The company could work on getting some more authentic, sonically pleasing guitar tones into the instrument. And striking more deals for a wider range of songs would court a wider audience.
“Real” guitarists will surely make fun of this gadget. Despite all it’s digital tricks, it doesn’t have the flexibility or feel of wielding a traditional guitar. But if you’re just looking for something to create music with at home or play around a campfire, Magic Instruments makes it easy.
