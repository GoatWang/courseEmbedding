Vineyard Notes
Elephant Mountain, Katherine Leone, King Fuji, Red Heaven,
Northridge and Clifton


Production Notes
The grapes were gently destemmed and
allowed to cold soak in the tank prior to inoculation with yeast strains selected
to emphasize terroir and varietal character. Once fermentation began (in
stainless steel tanks) the grapes were pumped over twice daily to aid in the
extraction of color and tannin. After about seven days, the free run wine was
drained away from the grapes and sent to barrel for malolactic fermentation.


Wine Maker Notes:
‚ÄúStylistically, we are looking for dark, rich and ripe flavors for this blend. We source fruit from vineyards throughout the Columbia Valley with bold and concentrated characteristics, creating the desirable style of our Rock Island Red.‚Äù ‚Äì Jeremy Santo, Winemaker¬†
Tasting Notes:
Aroma: Dark cherry and rich plum with hints of lavender, dried herbs, anise and cocoa.
Flavor: A generous juicy entry, with a jammy mid-palate and a pleasurable silky finish.
48% Cabernet Sauvignon, 33% Syrah, 15% Merlot, 4% Primitivo

Vineyard Notes

AVA: Wahluke Slope


Production Notes
The grapes were gently destemmed and allowed to cold soak in the tank prior to inoculation with yeast strains selected to emphasize terroir and varietal character.  Once fermentation began (in stainless steel), the grapes were pumped over twice daily to aid in the extraction of color and tannin.  After about seven days, the free run wine was drained away from the grapes and sent to barrel for malolactic fermentation.


Winemaker Notes
‚ÄúThe Wahluke Slope is one of the warmest growing regions in Washington State. As a result, red wine grapes from this area are ripe, rich and concentrated. You will taste dark fruit and a balanced depth in our wines from the Wahluke Slope.‚Äù ‚ÄìJeremy Santo, Winemaker
Tasting Notes
Aroma: Notes of red cherry, ripe raspberry, dried herbs and a touch of black pepper.
Flavor: A broad soft entry with a cushy midpalate and a round and full finish.

Product Description
The Washington State favorite returns for the 2014 vintage, and we think it‚Äôs even better than the spectacular 2013. It begins with aromas of dark cherry and rich plum with hints of lavender, dried herbs, anise and cocoa. The palate features an intense, generous and juicy entry, with a jammy mid-palate and a pleasurable, lengthy and balanced finish. Ryan Patrick makes several red blends and this one is our biggest seller of their products. We are the only ones on the internet offering the 2014 Rock Island, just released and in our warehouse for you!!
¬†
The 2013 Rock Island Red was perhaps Wine Time‚Äôs biggest selling red blend of 2015/16 ‚Äì $20.99!!
