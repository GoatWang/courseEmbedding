Helen A. Ix Is Married
Published: August 25, 1985









                    St. Mary Roman Catholic Church in Greenwich, Conn., was the setting yesterday for the wedding of Helen Adele Ix, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Edward Ix of Greenwich, to Daniel Manning FitzPatrick, a son of Mr. and Mrs. James Anthony FitzPatrick of Plattsburgh, N.Y. The Rev. Mark Connolly, assisted by the Rev. Martin Hitchcock, performed the ceremony.        

                    Alesia Ix was maid of honor for her sister.        

                    James Anthony FitzPatrick was best man for his brother.        

                    Mrs. FitzPatrick, a graduate of the Greenwich Academy and Vanderbilt University, was presented at the New York Debutante Cotillion and Christmas Ball in 1978. She is an account executive with Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborne. Her father is chairman of Cadbury Schweppes Inc. in Stamford, Conn.        

                    The bridegroom, an associate in the New York law firm of Davis Polk & Wardwell, graduated from Dartmouth College and the Vanderbilt School of Law. His father, a senior partner in the Plattsburgh law firm of FitzPatrick, Trombley, Owens & Lahtinen, is a former New York state assemblyman and chairman of the New York State Power Authority.

Daniel Manning (May 16, 1831 – December 24, 1887) was an American businessman, journalist, and politician most notable for having served as the 37th United States Secretary of the Treasury.[1]
Biography[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (April 2014)






Former residence of Daniel Manning in Washington, D.C.






Manning depicted on a Series 1886 silver certificate.


Manning was born May 16, 1831 in Albany, New York. He was educated in the public schools and then entered the world of commerce. At the age of 11, Manning went to work for the Albany Atlas, which consolidated with the Argus in 1856. Manning became editor in 1865 and owner in 1873.[2]




Mary Margaretta Fryer Manning, circa 1903


In November 1884, Manning married Mary Margaretta Fryer (1844-1928), daughter of William John Fryer and Margaret Livingston (Crofts) Fryer.
Manning's political career was very successful as well. He became chairman of the New York Democratic committee in 1881.[3] He resigned in 1885,[4] having been appointed Secretary of the Treasury by President Grover Cleveland in March.[5] Manning resigned on March 31, 1887; the cause was due to ill health.[6]
Death and legacy[edit]




The Daniel Manning memorial at the Cathedral of All Saints (Albany, New York).


He died in Albany home in 1887, from Brights disease, and was buried in Albany Rural Cemetery there.[7]
An engraved portrait of Manning appears on U.S. paper money, on the series 1886 20.00 silver certificates.[8] Some of these notes are referred to as "diamondbacks" due to their unusual reverse design and they are scarce.
There is a memorial to Manning in the Cathedral of All Saints (Albany, New York).
