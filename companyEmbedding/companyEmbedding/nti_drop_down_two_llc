CST Brands & CrossAmerica Announce Dropdown Transactions and 
      Acquisition of One Stop Stores





Dropdown to CrossAmerica of 29 “New to Industry” stores and 12.5 
        percent interest in CST’s U.S. wholesale fuel supply business


CrossAmerica agrees to acquire One Stop network of stores in 
        West Virginia


Transactions to close in the third quarter of 2015







June 15, 2015 08:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



SAN ANTONIO & ALLENTOWN, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--CST Brands, Inc. (NYSE:CST) (“CST Brands”) and CrossAmerica Partners LP 
      (NYSE:CAPL) (“CrossAmerica” or “The Partnership”) announced today two 
      dropdown transactions totaling approximately $261.5 million between CST 
      Brands and CrossAmerica. The transactions are expected to close in the 
      third quarter of 2015.
    


      In addition, CrossAmerica has entered into a definitive agreement to 
      acquire the One Stop convenience store network, based in Charleston, 
      West Virginia, that is also expected to close in the third quarter of 
      2015.
    

      “This is the second dropdown transaction between CST and CrossAmerica 
      and the first to include our New to Industry stores,” said Kim Lubel, 
      Chairman and CEO of CST Brands. “In the nine short months since we 
      acquired the general partner of CrossAmerica, the Partnership has 
      executed over one half billion dollars of acquisitions and dropdowns.”
    

Dropdown of “New To Industry” Stores and Fuel Supply


      CST Brands has agreed to sell to CrossAmerica the real property 
      associated with 29 recently constructed “New to Industry” (“NTI”) stores 
      for an aggregate consideration of approximately $135.5 million. The NTI 
      stores are larger formatted stores that accommodate broader merchandise 
      categories and food offerings and have more fuel dispensers than CST 
      Brands’ legacy stores. CrossAmerica will lease the acquired real 
      property to CST Brands at a “triple net” lease rate of 7.5% for a ten 
      year initial term, which will renew automatically at predetermined lease 
      rate increases.
    

      CrossAmerica has also agreed to acquire an additional 12.5% limited 
      partner interests in CST Fuel Supply LP (CST’s U.S. wholesale fuel 
      supply business) for total consideration of approximately $126.0 
      million. CST Fuel Supply LP (and its subsidiaries) provides fuel to 
      substantially all of CST’s U.S. company operated convenience stores and 
      largely maintains the fuel supply agreements between CST and its fuel 
      suppliers. CST Fuel Supply LP distributed approximately 1.9 billion 
      gallons of fuel in 2014, and is expected to earn a net profit margin of 
      approximately 5 cents per gallon of wholesale motor fuel distributed.
    

      The aggregate consideration of approximately $261.5 million will consist 
      of $142.0 million in cash and approximately $119.5 million or 3.6 
      million newly issued common units representing limited partner interests 
      in CrossAmerica.
    

      The independent executive committee of the board of directors of CST 
      Brands and the independent conflicts committee of the board of directors 
      of the general partner of CrossAmerica have, as applicable, approved the 
      terms of the dropdowns of the 29 NTI stores and 12.5% interest in CST 
      Fuel Supply from CST Brands to CrossAmerica.
    

      The conflicts committee of the board of directors of the general partner 
      was advised by Evercore Partners as its independent financial advisor 
      and Richards, Layton & Finger as its independent legal counsel. Paul 
      Hastings acted as legal counsel to CST Brands.
    

Acquisition of One Stop Network of Stores


      CrossAmerica has agreed to purchase the 41 company-operated One Stop 
      convenience store network (“One Stop”) based in Charleston, West 
      Virginia, along with 4 commission agent sites, 9 dealer fuel supply 
      agreements and one freestanding franchised quick service restaurant.
    

      Of the 45 company-operated and commission agent sites, 30 are owned fee 
      simple locations. Five of the company-operated locations have quick 
      service restaurants. For the twelve month period ended December 31, 
      2014, the aggregate 54 sites sold approximately 36 million gallons of 
      motor fuel primarily under the Marathon and Exxon fuel brands, and had 
      approximately $40.5 million in inside sales.
    

      "We are delighted to acquire the One Stop portfolio,” said CEO Joe 
      Topper. "Michael Graney, President of One Stop, has built a regional 
      powerhouse organization with a strong basis for future growth. This 
      acquisition further solidifies Cross America’s commitment to West 
      Virginia and Virginia," Joe added.
    

      "We are excited to join the CrossAmerica Team and look forward to a 
      bright future for our valued and loyal employees and customers and the 
      communities we serve," said Michael Graney, President of One Stop.
    

      The NTI and fuel drop downs and the One Stop convenience store network 
      acquisition are subject to customary conditions to closing, including 
      financing, and are expected to close in the third quarter of 2015.

CST Brands Plans Second Dropdown to CrossAmerica
Forty new-to-industry stores will be transitioned this summer.

May 8, 2015, 04:36 pm
By Brian Berk, Convenience Store News 


 



SAN ANTONIO  — CST Brands Inc. will drop down approximately 40 new-to-industry (NTI) stores to CrossAmerica Partners LP this summer, CST Chairman and CEO Kim Lubel ​confirmed Friday during a joint 2015 first-quarter earnings call for both companies. These dropdowns will be stores that have been built since CST was spun off from former parent company Valero Energy Corp. in May 2013. 
A price associated with the deal has not yet been determined, according to Lubel. Along with passing ownership of the real estate of these stores to CrossAmerica, CST will hand over the wholesale fuel supply contracts. However, the parent of Corner Store convenience stores will continue to operate these stores.
CST purchased 100 percent of the membership interests of the general partner and 100 percent of the outstanding incentive distribution rights of Allentown, Pa.-based CrossAmerica, a master limited partnership (MLP), effective Oct 1.
This summer's transaction will mark the second dropdown CST has made to CrossAmerica this year. In January, it closed on the sale of a 5-percent limited partner equity interest in CST Fuel Supply to CrossAmerica in exchange for common units representing an approximate 6.1-percent limited partner interest in CrossAmerica.
STRATEGY FOR CONTINUED GROWTH
As it drops down stores, CST will continue to build NTI stores and seek acquisitions. The company plans to build 35 to 40 new Corner Store locations in the United States in 2015, along with 10 to 12 Dépanneur Du Coin convenience stores in Canada.
On the merger and acquisition front, Lubel said the market remains “fragmented.” There are more potential sellers and acquirers than in the past, but plenty of opportunities still exist.
“We think we are a very attractive buyer,” she said. “We know how to run core stores and have done so for decades.”

CST is looking for acquisitions in areas of strong economic conditions, and a solid network in terms of stores. One potential region CST is looking at for growth is the upper Midwest, Lubel revealed, adding that CrossAmerica’s purchase of Erickson Oil Products Inc., which included 64 c-stores, has been very successful thus far.
CST EARNINGS RISE
CST saw overall net earnings rise by $3 million for its latest quarter ended March 31, to $14 million.
“Led by a strong U.S. fuel margin along with continued growth in same-store merchandise sales, both in the U.S. and Canada, we delivered solid results for the first quarter of 2015,” said Lubel. “The momentum in inside-store traffic has positioned us well for the upcoming summer driving season.”
Looking at U.S. retail operations more in-depth, total operating income rose $18 million year over year to $42 million. Fuel margins increased 4 cents per gallon year over year to 14 cents per gallon, which Lubel noted was especially impressive considering the first quarter is seasonally weaker in this category.
Merchandise gross profits rose $5 million to $97 million, with same-store sales increasing 3 percent — the fourth consecutive quarter in terms of growth in this area.
On a core per-store basis, CST’s U.S. retail division sold 4,966 gallons of fuel per site per day. In terms of dollars, motor fuel sales were $10,967 per site per day. Inside the store, merchandise sales per site per day came in at $3,488, an increase of $267 per site per day.
NTI stores led the way in in-store merchandise sales. CST also cited fountain drinks as an area of excellent growth, which often leads to purchases of other high-margin in-store merchandise items. CST believes this growth can continue as it recently installed 160 Coca-Cola Freestyle fountain machines in the Southwest.
As for its current fiscal second quarter, CST provided initial guidance that U.S. gallons sold per store per day will be in the range of 5,100-5,200. Merchandise sales per store per day are expected to be in the $3,950-$4,050 range, with merchandise gross margins ranging between 29.5 percent and 30.5 percent.
The San Antonio-based retailer operated 1,035 c-stores as of March 31.
CROSSAMERICA INCREASES PROFITS
Allentown, Pa.-based CrossAmerica’s companywide earnings totaled $35 million in its most recent quarter ended March 31, compared to $16.7 million during the same quarter in 2014.
Its retail division, primarily consisting of its Erickson Oil and Petroleum Marketers Inc. acquisitions, sold 46.1 million gallons of fuel at a gross margin of 10.2 cents per gallon, vs. 15.3 million gallons at a 2.1-cent margin in the first quarter of 2014.
CrossAmerica’s in-store merchandise gross margins totaled $7.8 million in its most recent quarter. The MLP did not have these retail operations in the first quarter of 2014.

Mergers & Acquisitions News
Dropdowns Pick Up at CST, CrossAmericaTransferring ownership of 29 new-to-industry c-stores, additional fuel supply interests









June 15, 2015
SAN ANTONIO & ALLENTOWN, Pa. --
CST Brands Inc. and
CrossAmerica Partners LP have announced two dropdown transactions--one of convenience stores, one for fuel supply--totaling approximately $261.5 million.As reported in a 21st Century Smoke/CSP Daily News Flash, CST Brands has agreed to sell to CrossAmerica the real property associated with 29 recently constructed new-to-industry (NTI) convenience stores for an aggregate consideration of approximately $135.5 million.“This is the second dropdown transaction between CST and CrossAmerica and the first to include our [NTI] stores,” said Kim Lubel, chairman and CEO of CST Brands. “In the nine short months since we acquired the general partner of CrossAmerica, the partnership has executed over one-half billion dollars of acquisitions and dropdowns.”The NTI stores are larger formatted stores that accommodate broader merchandise categories and food offerings and have more fuel dispensers than CST Brands’ legacy stores. CrossAmerica will lease the acquired real property to CST Brands at a “triple net” lease rate of 7.5% for a 10-year initial term, which will renew automatically at predetermined lease rate increases.CrossAmerica has also agreed to acquire an additional 12.5% limited-partner interests in CST Fuel Supply LP (CST’s U.S. wholesale fuel supply business) for total consideration of approximately $126 million. CST Fuel Supply LP (and its subsidiaries) provides fuel to substantially all of CST’s U.S. company-operated convenience stores and largely maintains the fuel supply agreements between CST and its fuel suppliers.CST Fuel Supply distributed approximately 1.9 billion gallons of fuel in 2014, and the companies expect it to earn a net profit margin of approximately five cents per gallon of wholesale motor fuel distributed.The aggregate consideration of approximately $261.5 million will consist of $142 million in cash and approximately $119.5 million or 3.6 million newly issued common units representing limited partner interests in CrossAmerica.The independent executive committee of the board of directors of CST Brands and the independent conflicts committee of the board of directors of the general partner of CrossAmerica have, as applicable, approved the terms of the dropdowns of the 29 NTI stores and 12.5% interest in CST Fuel Supply from CST Brands to CrossAmerica.The conflicts committee of the board of directors of the general partner was advised by Evercore Partners as its independent financial advisor and Richards, Layton & Finger as its independent legal counsel. Paul Hastings acted as legal counsel to CST Brands.Meanwhile, CrossAmerica Partners LP has entered into a definitive
agreement to acquire the One Stop convenience-store network based in Charleston, W.Va.The NTI and fuel dropdowns and One Stop acquisition are subject to customary conditions to closing, including financing, and the companies expect them to close in third-quarter 2015.CST Brands is one of the largest independent retailers of motor fuels and convenience merchandise in North America. Based in San Antonio, it has approximately 1,900 locations throughout the southwestern United States, New York and eastern Canada. In the United States, CST Corner Stores sell fuel and signature products such as Fresh Choices baked and packaged goods, U Force energy and sport drinks, Cibolo Mountain coffee, FC Soda and Flavors2Go fountain drinks. In Canada, CST is the exclusive provider of Ultramar fuel and its Dépanneur du Coin and Corner Stores sell signature Transit Café coffee and pastries. CST also owns the general partner of CrossAmerica Partners.Allentown, Pa.-based CrossAmerica Partners is a leading wholesale distributor of motor fuels and owner and lessee of real estate used in the retail distribution of motor fuels. Formed in 2012, CrossAmerica Partners distributes fuel to more than 1,100 locations and owns or leases more than 750 sites in 21 states: Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Ohio, Florida, New York, Massachusetts, Kentucky, New Hampshire, Maine, Tennessee, Maryland, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, West Virginia, Virginia, Texas, Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin and South Dakota. CrossAmerica also distributes fuel in Georgia and North Carolina.It has long-term established relationships with several major oil brands, including ExxonMobil, BP, Shell, Chevron, Sunoco, Valero, Gulf and CITGO.

NTI Backup Now EZ Frequently Asked Questions



 


What is the difference between the OEM version of Backup Now EZ and the Retail version of Backup Now EZ: 
The difference between the OEM version of Backup Now EZ and the Retail version of Backup EZ is that with the OEM version you can only backup to the Toshiba External Drive as in the retail version you can backup to any external drives, CD/DVD, or network hard drives.
I performed a 'complete system backup' recently. I noticed a message this morning that said that I had never backed up my registry. How do I make sure my registry gets backed up? 
That message is from a different application telling you it has not backed up your registry. The Complete System Backup backs up everything on all the partitions on you first physical hard drive. This includes your Windows registry. Since applications do not know what other applications have done, the program that is giving you that message is telling you that it also wants to backup your registry.
My destination drive is filling up very fast, as the folder of the 'Images' and ‘My Files’ generated from the backups are very large. Is there a way to identify and delete old backups? If so, can this be done automatically? 
Backup Now EZ runs an initial full backup for the baseline backup and then runs incremental backups. Because of this if you delete any backup files; you need to delete them all. When you do that, the next time the backup runs it will create a new full baseline backup followed by more incremental backups. If you have enough space, you can rename the backup folder, run the backup to create the new baseline backup and then delete the old, renamed backup folder.
Is it necessary to make a new bootable disc each time I run a complete system backup? 
While the message to create a bootable disc appears at the end of every run of the Complete System Backup, there is no difference in the discs created, once you have made one, you do not need to make another.
I have 6 HD in my computer. C:, E:, F:, G:, H:, I:. How do I change the system drive in the backup program? It is not getting my C drive but it is getting the H drive. How can I change the drive what my system is in? 
The Complete System Backup in Backup Now EZ backs up the first physical drive. If your drives are SATA, that would be the drive connected to your lowest SATA port. If your drives are IDE that would be the Primary Master IDE drive. Backup Now EZ only works for IDE and SATA drives in the Complete System Backup.
I have a specific folder on the C drive that I would like to backup, but the software doesn’t backup that folder at all. It backs up rest of the files and folders. Why? 
The File and Folder Backup job from Backup Now EZ backs up all files on your C drive based on a filter. The filter selects photos, videos, audio files, Word documents, Excel files, PDF files, PowerPoint files, IE and Firefox favorites and email from Outlook, Outlook Express and Windows Mail. If you want it to back up any other files, you need to modify the source and select the file or folder in the Advanced tab. Then it will backup that file or folder.
When I first ran a backup, 'Status Details' indicated 'backups did not run' and 'completed with errors' appeared under the 'backup schedule' icon under File and Folder Backup and Complete System Backup. 
Try running CHKDSK to look for and attempt repair of bad sectors and file system errors; you can do this by opening My Computer and right clicking on C drive and select Properties. In the properties window, click on the Tools tab, in the Tools tab click on the check now button in the Error Checking section. In the window that opens select both options and the click on OK. You computer will need to reboot to run CHKDSK. Also, from your antivirus software, delete everything from the quarantine. And if you have a Vista or Windows 7, try turning off the User Account Control (UAC) and see if you still have this issue. You can turn off the UAC by opening the Windows Control Panel and going into the User Accounts function. If you are in the Control Panel Home view, you will need to click on User Accounts twice. In User Accounts, click on the link that says “turn User Account Control on or off”. Then uncheck the checkbox where it says “Use User Account Control (UAC) to help protect your computer” and click on the OK button. Then restart your computer.
How do I restore a single file from an image backup? 
If you did a complete system backup, you cannot pick and choose what you want to restore. With complete system backup you need to restore everything.
All of my backup files on my external hard drive are .NBF file extension, how do I restore? 
In the My Files folder on your destination drive, you should have a File and Fodler.CAL file and your File and Folder*.NBF files. The CAL file is used to track which files are in which NBF files. To restore this, you can click on the Restore button in the mail screen for Backup Now EZ or you can open the action menu and click on restore from the main screen for Backup Now EZ. Then your backup will be automatically selected and you will be able to select your restore points. Then you will be able to select the files you want to restore and restore them. The Complete system backup can only be restored by booting from a bootable CD or DVD made in Backup Now EZ by running the Create Bootable Disc tool in the Tools menu in Backup Now EZ.
Main NTI Backup Now EZ screen shows 'Status Details: this computer is fully protected' and scheduled backups are running. How do I test the Complete System Backup to make sure it will work in case of system failure? Clicking 'restore' button on the main screen it only seems to give me the option to restore files and folders not the complete system. 
To test the Complete System Backup, you need to boot into the Complete System Backup restore system. This can be done by booting from the bootable DVD from the Tools menu in Backup Now EZ. To tsets it, you do not want to restore to your current primary drive. You need to replace it. If your drive is an IDE drive, you will need to install a different drive as the Primary Master IDE drive. If your drive is a SATA drive, you will need to connect it to the lowest SATA port on your mother board. If you system is a lap top. You just need to remove your current drive and replace it with a different drive. After the drive is replaced, you can boot into the bootable disc made from Backup Now EZ. Your backup will be automatically found and selected. Then you can select your restore point and restore to the new drive.
After installing the software, which came installed on the Toshiba USB drive I do not see any external device on the welcome screen when I try to open the modify button. My Toshiba USB drive is shown in windows as well as in device manager. 
With your Toshiba drive connected go to Device Manager. In Device Manager, go to the Universal Serial Bus Controllers. Under the Universal Bus Controllers select the USB Mass Storage Device and open its properties window. In the properties windows, select the Details tab. In the Details tab select Hardware IDs in the drop down list. The entries there should start with USB\VID_0480. If it does not, there is something wrong with your drive and you should contact Toshiba Storage Device Technical Support at www.toshibastorage.com. If the entries do start with USB\VID_0480, then try un-installing and re-installing Backup Now EZ for it may be corrupted.
How to view File and Folder backup files? 
To view the contents of your file and folder backup, you just need to click on the restore button on the bottom of the main screen for Backup Now EZ. This will open the file and folder restore. The file and folder restore should automatically find your File and Folder.CAL file and display your most recent restore point. If the restore point it finds is not for the system, you can click on the browse button (folder icon) to browse to your File and Folder.CAL file. If you want to look at an earlier restore point, you can change the restore point by clicking on the restore point drop down list and selecting your desired restore point. If you want to view the contents of your file and folder backup on a system that does not have Backup Now EZ installed, you can go into your Toshiba drive, open the Restore folder and run the RestoreStarter application. This will start the standalone restore application.
Can I do a full backup of two separate computers using this program? If so, how? 
You should be able to do backup multiple computers to the same destination. By default the complete system backup and file and folder backup will have the name of the computer in parenthesis so when restoring you will know which computer to restore what to.
What is the difference between Complete System Backup and File & Folder backup? 
The difference between complete system back up and file and folder backup is that file and folder backup backs up your files and folders only. File and folder backup will not backup any program files. Complete system backup will do an image backup of your entire drive.
