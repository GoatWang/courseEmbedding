SFD® Technology







SFD® Output Data
NXT’s survey aircraft carries numerous individual SFD® sensor elements, each of which generates its own unique output signal, captured as a digital time series.  The signal is akin to a waveform, with the horizontal axis measuring flight time, in seconds, and the vertical axis a voltage output (V).  Time readings correspond to a unique GPS based surface location and are plotted in the form of a flight line over the survey area. NXT’s data interpretation staff analyze deviations (such as signal relaxations and spikes) and other characteristics within the SFD® signal outputs from the multiple sensors, and from this process will identify “anomalous” areas within the survey grid.
SFD® data is acquired at 2,000 samples/second. The signal itself is intended to be an analog representation of the data collected during the flight but is represented as a non-linear, discrete-time signal of each sensor’s output voltage. Signal analysis (frequency, amplitude and character/pattern changes) and interpretation for each sensor is performed to identify prospective areas, without the aid of any a priori knowledge of the underlying geotechnical and engineering data along the SFD® flight path. The anomalies are also compared with NXT’s database of SFD® signals that have been obtained over various geological features worldwide, which serve as templates for interpretation. SFD® anomalies are then ranked and categorized according to their assessed prospectivity.  Anomalous areas which are identified during the SFD® interpretation process are assigned a relative ranking, indicative of their assessed trap and reservoir potential.
Some sample SFD® signals are shown below.

 
Interpretation of SFD® signals involves a pattern recognition process.  Based on extensive experience, recognizable SFD® signal patterns (example above) have been empirically correlated to a variety of subsurface geologic conditions which are indicative of areas that are favorable for the formation of fluid traps. 
The end product of the survey is a formal technical presentation by NXT of the SFD® Recommendations Report, which is a comprehensive summary of the results of the SFD® survey, including the following key deliverables:

1. Individual sensor response curves which have been fully annotated;
2. SFD® anomaly areas, which represent the combined interpretation of multiple sensors and flight lines;
3. NXT’s technical ranking of the SFD® anomalies based on their trap / structural components and reservoir potential; and 
4. An integrated prospect map of the entire survey area, illustrating the ranked anomalies.
 
Because the SFD® interpretation process is largely qualitative, NXT has developed a ranking system to evaluate each identified anomaly “lead”. The overall ranking is then reflected as two components – a trap ranking and a reservoir quality ranking. Each recommended SFD® lead area is assigned a number to denote trap quality and a letter to denote fluid presence indicators. A sample ranking system is illustrated below:



 
Trap Indicators
 
Reservoir Indicators


1
Fair trap potential
C
No reservoir potential Indicated


1+
Good trap potential
C+
Poor reservoir potential


2
Very good trap potential
B-
Minor reservoir potential


2+
Excellent trap potential
B
Moderate reservoir potential


 
 
B+
Good reservoir potential


 
 
A
Very good reservoir potential


 
 
A+
Excellent reservoir potential




 
 
Provided that the survey has been performed in a regular grid pattern (NXT normally recommends a 5 km by 5 km line spacing) or a quasi-grid pattern (i.e. 5 km by 7.5 km), the results are often represented in the form of a prospectivity map.
 
In order to map the assessed prospectivity of an area, the qualitative SFD® ranking must be further quantified. In cases where a grid pattern is flown, using a scoring system, NXT will create a prospectivity grid with hot colors indicating the higher quality lead areas versus cold colors showing lower assessed prospectivity areas.  This map provides a contoured summary of the SFD® recommended lead areas and shows the estimated spatial extent and quality of the SFD® identified prospects

This fed Liszicasz’ passion in the creation of 52 inventions, including electronic control systems, early warning systems, medical lasers, new pyroelectric materials, and various geophysical instruments, etc. In 1986, Liszicasz established his R&D Company and offered consulting services and developing special devices for various industry applications. His company also evaluated and made recommendations on various technical patents and new technologies for the Science Council of British Columbia, Canada.
Liszicasz, the inventor, was developing a new high efficiency transducer material that would convert body heat into to electricity, so that pacemaker batteries would not have to be replaced every 4 months. The material under specific conditions exhibited new quantum mechanical and electrical conduction behaviors, never seen before. Studying the phenomenon further, Liszicasz realized that it was the key to creating a new detection mechanism that would use gravity as a proxy to explore and utilize the physical relationship between gravity gradients and subsurface stress leading to the development of the Stress Field Detection (“SFD”) technology.
In 1996 Liszicasz founded what would become NXT Energy Solutions Inc. (“NXT”) and seven years later he became NXT’s President. Stress Field Detection was commercialized in Canada in 2007 under the profitable stewardship of Liszicasz. Today Stress Field Detection surveys are being conducted for NOC’s and E&P companies driving efficiencies into their exploration process by focusing their G&G programs and capital on areas conducive to trapped fluid potential within sedimentary basins worldwide.
In addition to his scientific activities and strategic development Liszicasz leads a team of Ph.D.’s of mathematics, Physics, Electrical Engineers, and Geoscience who continue the evolution of the SFD® technology.
Liszicasz has served as a member of the NXT Board of Directors since 1997.

Todd Chuckry
Director of Operations
Todd joined NXT in September of 2016 upon serving as the CEO of Spectraseis Inc. up until the company’s sale in October of 2015. Prior to his work with Spectraseis, Todd was President and CEO of Request Seismic Surveys as well as BlueGrouse Seismic Solutions. Todd founded Request as a land seismic services company in 1989. By 1994 Request was one of the largest multi-client data providers, which acquired approximately 1,000 km of 2-D data each year. Todd took Request public in 1997; Request was recognized as the largest seismic data owner in Canada, generating annual sales of $100 million. In 2000 Request was reorganized into an income Trust. With the preceding success of Request, Todd founded BlueGrouse Seismic Solutions in 2003 and grew the company as a data owner. BlueGrouse accumulated $42 million in sales in its final year and was ultimately sold to a competitor in 2007.  Within the community, Todd is a past member of the Alberta Children’s Hospital fund raising board and was past Vice Chairman of SVP Calgary. In 1999 Todd was recognized as one of Canada’s top “40 under 40”.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/22/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.

Consulting for Green Building & Energy Solutions in California by Rick's Energy Solutions












































































Office: 707.578.5380 Mobile: 707.529.2570Rick@rc-networks.com

























Green Energy Building Consultations & Energy SolutionsAs of 7/21/2017
Our new address will be
1421 Guerneville Rd. Suite 106
Santa Rosa, CA 95403

At Rick’s Energy Solutions, we are among the nation’s top green building consultants, and a leading name in energy conservation. Based in Santa Rosa, California, we service the city and surrounding areas, focusing heavily on homeowners, architects and home designers. If you are in need of a home energy audit or if you own a company in Northern California, looking for consulting and energy solutions, we are here to meet your needs.
 
About Our Services
 
Rick’s Energy Solutions consists of multi-skilled experts who have 40 years of experience in the construction industry. We are certified energy plan examiners, certified energy analysts, certified green building professionals, certified GreenPoint raters, certified home energy rating system raters (HERS raters) and certified CALGreen special inspectors. We can even help with the preparation and submission of required documentation for California Title 24 energy conservation and Green Building submissions. We are passionate about green energy solutions and we know the business inside and out.
 
At Rick’s Energy Solutions, we assist homeowners in making their living spaces more energy efficient and eco-friendly. It all begins by understanding the home as a comprehensive system and understanding how well your household performs through a home energy audit. This involves evaluating your home for its green building environmental impacts and its carbon footprint. Most houses do not operate to their fullest energy potential, even if the houses are newly constructed. Many homes leak air conditioning during the summer and heat during the winter due to faulty vent installation, windows with poor retention and myriad other reasons.
 
Finding Issues and Improving Efficiency
 
A lot of lighting and appliances utilize more energy than needed to function. This is incredibly wasteful, but very difficult to detect. Many air ducts leak, which wastes heated and cooled air. In addition, many water fixtures are wasteful, using more water than necessary for typical applications. These are all aspects our HERS raters look for in your home, during our audit. We identify hidden issues and offer solutions to help your home consume less energy and resources without requiring you to make any lifestyle changes. These solutions include duct redesign, air sealing, lighting and appliance upgrades, window upgrade, faucet and water fixture replacement and more. All energy problems in your home can be met by our efficient energy solutions.
 
Our services are very important when it comes to architects, designers and contractors. These people are responsible for the construction of future homes and commercial buildings and renovations of existing structures. When we work with them in helping to shape their next projects, you can rest assured that we are setting a new energy-smart status quo for buildings to come.
 
One Team Providing Smart Energy Solutions
 
It is very much a team effort. When working with architects, it is our job to prepare the documentation required for obtaining the Energy Star rating on new homes. The architects are the ones who bring the eco-friendly visions to life. We also prepare the documentation required to submit to the IRS for tax rebates for energy conservation measures. At Rick’s Energy Solutions, we make sure that designers, contractors and architects are up to par with the best knowledge, techniques and technologies when it comes to energy efficiency. It is our way of nipping energy problems in the bud. We consult on such projects as home additions, remodeling jobs and the construction of entirely new homes and commercial buildings to ensure the highest quality of environmental friendliness.
 
When it comes to energy solutions in Santa Rosa California and the surrounding areas, including Sonoma, Mendocino, Lake, Marin and Napa counties, Rick’s Energy Solutions is the most efficient and affordable option. We have more than 40 years of experience in the construction industry, with 25 of those years working in building inspection and plans examination. Our team is equipped to handle any project from all angles imaginable. We have our finger on the pulse of what is needed in terms of the most up-to-date energy-efficient conservation techniques and know the logistics that are involved with making everything come together effectively.
 
We also work closely with architects, contractors and homeowners. We could not do what we do without their skills and cooperation. There is no other green building consultant or energy conservation construction company that has all of their bases covered the way we do. The best defense is a good offense.
 
Get Started on Becoming More Energy Efficient Today
 
Rick’s Energy Solutions is privileged to be doing such important work that affects both our futures and yours alike. If you are a homeowner, a home designer, an architect or a contractor, we would love nothing more than to give you an evaluation of your home or planned project. Our consultation service can help you identify improvements that can be made at your home to help protect the environment and even shape the future of how buildings are constructed.
 
We offer both home and commercial energy audits, and are certified by the California Association of Building Energy Consultants (CABEC), Build It Green, Efficiency First, the International Code Council (ICC) and CalCERTs. We could not be prouder of our company’s past successes, and we are laser focused on the horizon of energy conservation.
 
As energy conservation and green building consultants, we’re standing by to assist homeowners, contractors and designers alike in identifying home energy solutions, preparing and submitting California Title 24 energy conservation and Green Building compliance documents, recommending small changes to improve efficiency and much more. Contact us today by calling 707-578-5380 and lets work to create a better, more energy-efficient tomorrow!

Green Home Energy Plans & AnalysisThe following is a list of the tests that we conduct when doing a Green Home Energy Analysis.
1. Combustion Safety and Heating Related Tests.
These tests and inspections are conducted in the heating and cooling equipment area of your house.

Carbon Monoxide Tests
We look for excess carbon monoxide in the flue gases of your heating appliances and in the air of your house.
Drafting Tests
An evaluation of the risk that the combustion gases in building’s flue(s) will be pulled back into your house by a source of negative pressure
Combustion Efficiency Test
A measurement of the efficiency of your heating system. A higher number means that more of the energy goes into your house.
Flue Inspection
An examination of your combustion equipment flue pipes for blockages or other hazardous conditions.
HVAC Equipment Inspection 
A visual inspection examines the overall condition of your heating, ventilation and air conditioning equipment.
Duct Air Flow Estimate
This test estimates the amount of air moving through your duct system. Too little air movement in your ducts will affect the comfort and efficiency of your heating and/or cooling system.

2. Health and Durability Inspections.

Moisture Sources and Damage
As part of a walk through of the house, your inspector looks for areas where there is evidence of high humidity or moisture damage.
Indoor Air Pollution Sources
Also as part of a walk through of the house, your inspector looks for areas where there is evidence of potential sources of indoor air pollution.
House Durability Inspection
The inspector looks for areas where there is evidence of maintenance problems affecting the durability of your house.
Insulation and Envelope Inspection
An examination and measurement of the insulation levels in various areas of your building’s “shell.”
Roof and Attic Inspection
The inspector examines the roof and attic for evidence of maintenance problems.
Exhaust Fan Duct Condition
Finally, as part of a walk-through of the house, your inspector examines the condition of your exhaust fan ductwork for length and condition. Too long of a duct run can cause moisture problems, and leaky exhaust ducts can put damaging amounts of moisture into your house.

3. Whole House Performance Tests.

Exhaust Fan Flow
This test measures the ability of your exhaust fan systems to remove air from your house. Not enough airflow means the fan is making noise but not moving air.
Blower Door Test
A comprehensive test measures the leakiness of your house. The building is pressurized and de-pressurized and a measurement of air leakage is performed.
Duct Leakage
A similar test that measures the leakiness of your duct system.
Pressure Mapping
This test helps to determine the unintentional air flows that occur when the heating and cooling fan is on. A second test looks at the unintentional connectedness of various spaces such as attics, basements and garages to your house.

4. Energy Analysis.

Historical Electrical Consumption
Analysis of one year’s worth of historical electric bills. Identify possible savings through photovoltaic. Verify rate schedule is optimized.
Historical Gas Consumption 
Determine viability of renewable heat sources such as solar thermal, solar pool heating, flash hot water systems, etc.
Lighting
Lighting bulbs and fixtures can be replaced with more efficient bulbs and fixtures that last longer and pay for themselves.
Appliances
Energy Star appliances save money and provide high performance. Appliances are identified as potentially benefiting from an upgrade to an Energy Star Appliance.
Pool / Hot Tub / Pond / Well Pump Analysis
Check pumps for sizing and efficiency. Look for ways to time pumping to reduce costs.

Our story




Gu-ru / ‘goroō /
Noun:
1. A mentor, a teacher, one who helps you move forward.
2. A source of inspiration and good energy.


GURU
A Story of Organic Growth
Ever since the early days, GURU has always been driven by this idea of crafting the best natural energy drink out there. Founded in Montreal during the summer of 1999 by four college friends, the company marketed the world's first all-natural energy drink.
More than 15 years later, this vision is not only fulfilled but is also thriving and expanding worldwide. GURU has become the #1 Organic Energy Drink in Canada and the US in the Health Channel thanks to a strong network of distribution partnerships and a passionate sales team. 
With research & development at the forefront of our expansion, GURU now tackles a new market and adventure with the recent introduction of our Energy Waters. This new line of product arrives just in time to satisfy a growing demand for organic sugar and calorie-free energy beverages.
In short, GURU has and will always believe that energy should not come at the expense of health. That is what has brought our company a steady and organic growth.
Our Philosophy
Through its corporate philosophy and its beverages, GURU gives good energy for people to make great things, reminding that, with the right dose of will, inspiration and energy, achieving great results is within everyone's reach. 
People today define themselves less by what they have and more by what they do and contribute to the world. Resourcefulness, imagination, inventiveness is today’s new currency. Whether using technology, natural ingredients or just plain common sense, people who Make it Good are the ones who seek to make everything better. We call them Makers.
They are pioneers that never settle. Makers, not followers. Crafters not manufacturers. Some may call them obsessed, exceptional or extraordinary people. But these are men and women who are true innovators, thought leaders and doers in their respective communities. They make the impossible possible.

Luc Martin-Privat
Our Brew Master
Meet Luc our Brew Master. He is the brains behind GURU.  In fact, while he could have become your friendly neighborhood pharmacist, Luc had other dreams…
From the functional herbs he started playing with in his dad’s lab to his PhD in Pharmacology, Luc has mastered the art of blending botanicals, an art he is now applying to our beloved GURU.
Always on the lookout for smart organics from around the world, Luc is looking into the GURU recipe “Organically” to make it perfect everytime! And when he is not looking at new ways to craft our GURU, Luc is dreaming about new products!
