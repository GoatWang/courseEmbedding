Why the Spur?

								The receiver spur was invented to remove a specific firearm characteristic that can classify the firearm as an assault weapon.  While there are several characteristics that can classify 
								a firearm as an assault weapon the receiver spur focuses on one key characteristic, as detailed below.  								
							

								Click here to view the NYSAFE features presentation to see any images or descriptions to aid in diagnosing your firearm.
							









What is The Spur?

								The spur is a Nylon 6/6 injection molded component that can be used to replace a protruding pistol grip on an AR-15 rifle.  This durable piece will not absorb solvents or oils commonly found around firearms increasing the durability of the spur.  
								This component is custom molded by S & B Products Inc., a company built with the sportsman in mind.  S & B has leveraged the knowledge of a law enforcement officer with over 30 years of experience to create a product that will allow 
								sportsmen with a specific firearm to try to conform to the guidelines set forth by the SAFE Act.

Understanding the SAFE Act

						The NYSAFE Act has impacted the landscape of firearm ownership, this act in particular has greatly impacted the owners of AR rifles in NYS and more specifically those looking to own an AR in the State of New York.  Below are the criteria by which a firearm falls under the SAFE Act, if the sole criteria governing your firearm is the one below the stars then the Receiver Spur is a viable solution.
					






"Does the firearm have a folding or telescoping stock?"








"Does the firearm have a protruding pistol grip?"




"Does the firearm have a thumbhole stock?"




"Does the firearm have a second handgrip or a protruding pistol grip that can be utilized by the non-shooting hand?"






"Does the firearm have a bayonet mount?"




"Does the firearm have a flash surpressor?"




"Does the firearm have a muzzle break?"




"Does the firearm have a grenade launcher?"






"Does the firearm have a threaded barrel to accommodate flash surpression or muzzle breaks?"
































































You've got questions, we've got answers

						Below are some of the most commonly asked questions associated with the receiver spur and where it stands with respect to the NYS Safe Act.
					







Does the receiver spur need to be permanently attached to an AR-15 rifle?





								No, the receiver spur is a permanently modified part that cannot be turned into a pistol grip.  The NYSAFE Act states that modifications to remove certain features is permissible.
							





Will the spur fit the AR-10?





								Yes, The Spur does fit the AR-10 and functions properly. However, aesthetically there is a small gap at the back of The Spur where it meets the gun.
							





Will it help with the SAFE Act?





								We have not received anything in writing from NYS. We are currently pressing the State for an official written determination. We are confident the AR15 Receiver Spur does not run afoul of the law. Our attorney assures us we have not misrepresented our product or what it accomplishes. The NY Safe Act permits modifications to remove design characteristics that define a rifle as an assault weapon.
							





Has NYS ruled on the spur yet?





								Short answer is NO, nothing in writing from NYS yet. Every "lawful authority" State and Local we have conferred with has assured us the AR-15 Receiver Spur DOES NOT run afoul of the law. We are going to continue to press the State for a written determination. I spent 30 years in law enforcement and I am confident this modification relieves the rifle from the assault weapon definition if the pistol grip is the sole characteristic.

Easy Up Swim Handles were created to provide an easy way of getting in and out of the water from a boat's swim platform without having to crawl on one's hands and knees. The handles are made of polished stainless steel and are attached to a boats platform by way of easily installed receptacles that hold and lock the handles in place. This not only makes getting in and out of the water easy it also makes it a lot safer for young and old alike.

There are two styles to choose from depending on the size of your swim
platform. The "U" style for larger platforms and the "P" style for smaller
platform. Don't have a platform or need a larger one? Contact Swim

Easy Up Swim Handles will be a beautiful and practical addition to your swim

them in minimal space.
We hope you will consider purchasing a set of Easy Up Swim Handles for your
boat. We know you will enjoy them and increase your boating pleasure.

Mistyfuse® Ultraviolet
In accelerated aging studies, exposure to UV rays have been shown to cause fusibles to tan (darken). Especially on light colors, sheers or light weight fabrics, and surface use, tanning may read as a color shift or dark spots. Mistyfuse Ultraviolet is specially formulated with an effective retardant to protect against the tanning effect of UV rays — without sacrificing any of the inherent Mistyfuse qualities you expect and trust. Mistyfuse Ultraviolet is white and fuses clear.

There are eight (8) Transdoodle Junior (8.5"x11") sheets in a package—in the colors that quilters need - 4 white, 2 yellow, 2 blue. Transdoodle is made to be long lasting — use each sheet over and over and over again and just when you think you've used it up....use it again!

Goddess Sheet
The nonstick thermal sheet that reminds you which side is up. 
The Goddess Sheet is sure to become your indispensable fusing tool. The Goddess Sheet combines a slick Teflon® coated sheer fiberglass — for a long-lasting, nonstick transparent sheet that puts a helpful glossy sheen on fused surfaces — with the Goddess Curve™. Inspired by the goddesses of antiquity … who knew a thing or two about curves … the Goddess Curve™ is your reliable guide to accident-free fusing. The Goddess Curve is there to help you dedicate one side of the sheet to your iron only and the other side to contact with fusible. The glossy sheen is there to make it obvious which side of your fabric has the Mistyfuse on it (since with Mistyfuse it can be hard to tell!) Designed to be used with fusible, the Goddess Sheet is also suitable for all types of crafts.

The Fascinating Marketing Power of Fear


A new study reveals that fear can lead consumers to love your brand.






 By Ilan Mochari


Ilan Mochari's debut novel, Zinsky the Obscure (Fomite Press, 2013), earned rave reviews from Publishers Weekly, Kirkus Reviews, and Booklist. Boston's NPR station named it one of 10 "Good Reads for the Summer." He is a senior writer for Inc. magazine.

Want customer loyalty? Be there when they're scared and alone. That's the primary finding of a recent study from the University of British Columbia's Sauder School of Business. 
In the study, published in the Journal of Consumer Research, UBC's Lea Dunn and JoAndrea Hoegg demonstrated that consumers experiencing fear while watching a film feel a greater affiliation with a present brand than those who watch films evoking happiness, sadness or excitement.
Why does this finding matter? For one thing, it runs counter to general industry marketing. Typically, there are fewer product placements in horror films compared to other genres.
For another, it's a branding wake-up call to marketers in all categories--not just those whose products (like Coke) can be around when a movie is playing. "Marketers are afraid of fear. Their worries about negative associations outweigh their desire to tap into the massive market commanded by fear-based entertainment such as horror films or video games," notes Dunn in ScienceDaily. 
"But our study shows advertisers should consider offering up their brands as something to cling to in the dark when the knives come out and the blood starts to splatter."
I recently talked with Dunn about the surprising and interesting findings. Here's our conversation. 
Though your study focused on movies, do you believe it would hold up in other scary, solitary settings? For example, might a driver, alone during a long scary rainy drive at night, become attached to her vehicle, her brand of tires, her windshield wipers?
What we (JoAndrea Hoegg and I) show in the paper is that the presence of the brand is enough to help people cope with the feeling of fear.
The next logical step is that fear outside of a controlled setting like a movie experience should have the same effect. Unlike your examples, our studies focused on brands that couldn't be instrumental in helping the consumers deal with the fearful situation. We wanted to see if brands that were simply present in the environment (i.e., food during a movie experience) might allow for consumers to cope with fear and enhance emotional attachment.
The theory in the paper is that when we are afraid, we want to share that experience with others and when others are not present, we can successfully share that experience with an available brand. So, I would, like you, speculate that if the lights were out and I was afraid, the fact that the brand of flashlight was there with me during the experience might be enough for me to feel more emotionally attached even after the lights came back on. However, I cannot speak directly to this point given the nature of our studies.
How are your findings applicable, say, to non-consumer products companies?
In general, a fear element is not going to fit for all brands, because, of course, for many brands it would not make sense to scare consumers.
But a broader point is that consumers can form relationships with brands in similar ways to how they form relationships with humans.
Running with this concept, a takeaway point could be that a brand is more than just the product it is attached to. One of our studies found that consumers didn't need to touch or physically consume the product to show higher emotional brand attachment after a fear experience. Instead, the brands could simply be present and consumers would still show higher attachment.
This study shows that there is potential for a brand--be it simply a logo--regardless of whether it is a consumer product or a non-consumer product to fulfill consumers' needs.
Thus, if brands could find a way to get their logo into a consumer's hands (e.g., promotional items) or on their radars (e.g., new media forms such as advergames or social media options) then they might be able to see enhanced emotional attachment through fear.

Another Reason to Get ‘Attached’ to TES®
June 4, 2014
by Troy Holaday


TES now includes support for attaching evaluation documents. Yes, if you have been waiting for the ability to attach syllabi and other supporting materials to evaluation tasks, your day has come!
The process is pretty straightforward. When you create an evaluation task in TES you will see a section labeled “Support Files,” along with some on-screen controls for selecting files to be attached. Files must be PDFs less than 4mb in size.

Attached files will only be visible to you and others who are assigned to the task. Because many syllabi are proprietary and/or specific to section-level instances of a course, they will not be shown in general searches.
Files will be retained for a reasonable length of time, but not indefinitely. They will certainly remain as long as the task is open and for at least six months afterward. Eventually, these supporting docs will be pruned to recover storage space.
