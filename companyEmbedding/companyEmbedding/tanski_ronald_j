Ronald J. Tanski Elected Chief Executive Officer Of National Fuel Gas Company.






Business Wire




Mar 7, 2013 4:05 PM EST













 




























































  Today, following the Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the Board of Directors of National Fuel Gas Company (“National Fuel” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NFG), elected Ronald J. Tanski as Chief Executive Officer. David F. Smith was elected to the position of Executive Chairman of the Board.   Ronald J. Tanski elected Chief Executive Officer of National Fuel Gas Company.   “National Fuel is in an excellent place with a strategic vision for disciplined development of its assets and significant opportunities for long term growth,” said David F. Smith, National Fuel’s Executive Chairman of the Board. “The election of Ron as Chief Executive Officer represents continued and deliberate succession planning. Over the years Ron has held a leadership position in every one of our business segments. More recently, in his role as Chief Operating Officer, Ron has been successfully running the day-to-day operations of the Company since 2010. This new role for Ron is a well-deserved milestone. As we look to the future, the Board and I believe that our management team, under Ron’s leadership, will continue to drive the Company’s positive momentum.”  Tanski joined National Fuel in 1979 and has served in a variety of positions in both the regulated and non-regulated businesses. In June 2010, he was named President and Chief Operating Officer of National Fuel Gas Company, and he will continue to serve as President. From 2004 to 2010, Tanski was Treasurer and Principal Financial Officer of the Company. From 2008 to 2010, he also served as President of National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation and prior to that he served as President of National Fuel Gas Distribution Corporation. His experience also includes management tenures at Seneca Resources Corporation, in Houston, Texas; Empire Exploration, Inc., the Company’s Appalachian exploration and production subsidiary whose operations were merged with Seneca Resources in 1994; and Horizon Energy Development, Inc., National Fuel’s energy-project development subsidiary which was sold in 2010.

Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey

"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."
