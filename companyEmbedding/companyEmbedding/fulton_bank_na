Meet Fulton





Fulton Financial Corporation ("Fulton") is an equal opportunity employer and is committed to providing equal employment opportunity for all qualified persons. Fulton will recruit, hire, train and promote persons in all job titles, and ensure that all other personnel actions are administered, without regard to race, color, religion, creed, sexual orientation, national origin, citizenship, gender, gender identity, age, disability, genetic information, marital status, covered veteran status, or any other legally protected status. We work to maintain an environment free from discrimination and harassment. Employees and applicants are not, or will not be, subjected to harassment, intimidation, threats, coercion or discrimination because they have engaged in or may engage in any of the following activities:

(1) Filing a complaint;      
(2) Assisting or participating in an investigation, compliance evaluation, hearing, or any other activity related to the administration of the affirmative action provisions of section 503*, VEVRAA** or any other Federal, state or local law requiring equal opportunity for protected veterans and individuals with disabilities;
	  
      
(3) Opposing any act or practice made unlawful by section 503 or VEVRAA, or Section 503 or VEVRAA implementing regulations or any other Federal, state or local law requiring equal opportunity for protected veterans and individuals with disabilities;
(4) Exercising any other right protected by section 503, VEVRAA, or section 503 or VEVRAA implementing regulations.

We will impose only valid job requirements in all employment and transfer decisions and in all personnel actions, including hiring, compensation, benefits, terminations, training and social recreational programs.
Reasonable accommodation is provided to known disabled individuals and disabled veterans, and/or those who are willing to identify themselves as disabled and specify their needs, unless any such accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of its business or would pose a direct threat to the health or safety of the individual or others in the workplace.
Each year, Fulton analyzes all areas of employment to assure faithful adherence to the principles of equal opportunity. Through Fulton's Affirmative Action plans, it works to achieve an equitable balance from the available work force in all groups that make up the total organization. 
Fulton's  mission statement is to increase shareholder value and enrich the communities we serve by creating financial success together with our customers and career success together with our employees. We will conduct all of our business with honesty and integrity, effectively manage risk and be in full compliance with all legal and regulatory requirements. Our values and policies support this mission. 
 As Chairman, CEO and President of Fulton Financial Corporation, E. Philip Wenger, affirms the above Equal Employment Opportunity Policy and the Company's Affirmative Action Plan reflect the Company's commitment to foster a diverse and inclusive workplace.
 PAY TRANSPARENCY NONDISCRIMINATION PROVISION The contractor will not discharge or in any other manner discriminate against employees or applicants because they have inquired about, discussed, or disclosed their own pay or the pay of another employee or applicant. However, employees who have access to the compensation information of other employees or applicants as a part of their essential job functions cannot disclose the pay of other employees or applicants to individuals who do not otherwise have access to compensation information, unless the disclosure is (a) in response to a formal complaint or charge, (b) in furtherance of an investigation, proceeding, hearing, or action, including an investigation conducted by the employer, or (c) consistent with the contractor's legal duty to furnish information. 41 CFR 60-1.35(c)

*Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Act  - Requires Federal contractors to take affirmative action to employ and advance in employment specified categories of veterans.
** The Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Section 503 - Prohibits discrimination and requires Federal contractors to take affirmative action   to hire, retrain and promote qualified individuals with disabilities.
