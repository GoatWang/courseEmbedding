Overview

Company Profile
Heat Biologics is a clinical-stage company focused on developing its novel off-the-shelf ImPACT therapeutic vaccines to combat a wide range of cancers and infectious diseases. ImPACT Therapy exploits the natural ability of antigens to activate the immune system by utilizing live, irradiated, off-the-shelf, genetically modified cells injected into a patient designed to elicit a powerful immune response against the disease target. Heat’s ImPACT Therapy is based upon heat shock protein gp-96, a chaperone protein found in all human cells and normally tethered to our cells with a leash called the KDEL sequence. ImPACT Therapy removes this KDEL leash, thus transforming allogeneic living cells into powerful miniature osmotic pumps that continually secrete gp96 and their chaperoned antigens to activate the immune system against the full spectrum of antigens expressed by a patient’s disease. Heat is currently conducting multiple clinical trials in two indications with its ImPACT therapy based products, HS-410 to treat Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC) and HS-110 to treat Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).

ComPACT








ComPACT
ComPACT Therapy – Our Next Generation Platform Technology  
Heat Biologics' Combination Pan-Antigen Cytotoxic Therapy ("ComPACT" Therapy) enables us to combine a pan-antigen T cell-activating vaccine and a T cell co-stimulator in a single product, offering the potential benefits of combination immunotherapy without the need for multiple independent biologic products.  Using ComPACT, we have engineered new product candidates that incorporate various ligand fusion proteins targeting co-stimulatory receptors (OX40, ICOS, 4-1BB) into the gp96-Ig expression vector, resulting in a single product candidate that includes both a pan-antigen T cell-priming vaccine and a T cell co-stimulator. 
Most recently, we have reported preclinical data demonstrating that ComPACT secreting OX40L generated the most potent immune response among other ComPACT co-stimulator variations including TL1A, 4-1BBL and ICOSL, as well as compared to systemic delivery of OX40 agonist antibody and vaccine alone.

Impact[edit]
ImPACT is a proposed cancer vaccine based on live, genetically-modified, irradiated human cells which secrete a broad spectrum of cancer-associated antigens as well as an immune adjuvant called gp96. Potential advantages of this product are use as an 'allogeneic', that is, 'off-the-shelf' immunotherapy, and its appplicability to a wide range of cancers. It is in phase II trials.
ImPACT originated in the late 1990s in work done at the University of Miami which showed that gp96, a heat shock protein resident in the endoplasmic reticulum could be made immunogenic if part of gp96 was replaced with the Fc portion of an IgG1 antibody to engineer a secretory form of gp96. In vivo gp96-Ig generated a strong CD8+ T cell response[1]
ComPACT[edit]
ComPACT is a combination of a pan-antigen T cell priming vaccine and a T cell co-stimulator.[2]
Other potential products[edit]
HS-410[edit]
HS-410, also called vesigenurtacel-L, is currently in Phase II in Non-Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC), in combination with BCG.[3] In Feb 2016 patient enrollment was paused (for lack of BCG).[4]
HS-110[edit]
HS 110, called viagenpumatucel-L, is in Phase II in NSCLC, in combination with cyclophosphamide. Another Phase I study is combining HS 110 with nivolumab and other checkpoint inhibitors.
Heat Biologics stock[edit]
Heat Biologics stock is traded on Nasdaq under the code HTBX. The company did its IPO on Nasdaq in mid-2013, with its stock commencing trading on 24 July 2013.[5]
Main people[edit]
Heat Biologics' Chairman and CEO is Jeffrey Wolf, a serial Life Sciences entrepreneur who founded the company in 2008. Its Chief Scientific Officer, Dr Taylor Schreiber, is a co-inventor of the ImPACT platform.
Location[edit]
Heat Biologics is headquartered in Durham, NC. Its office at 801 Capitola Drive is located near the I-40 about three miles to the southwest of Research Triangle Park and eight miles to the west of Raleigh–Durham International Airport.

Impact[edit]
ImPACT is a proposed cancer vaccine based on live, genetically-modified, irradiated human cells which secrete a broad spectrum of cancer-associated antigens as well as an immune adjuvant called gp96. Potential advantages of this product are use as an 'allogeneic', that is, 'off-the-shelf' immunotherapy, and its appplicability to a wide range of cancers. It is in phase II trials.
ImPACT originated in the late 1990s in work done at the University of Miami which showed that gp96, a heat shock protein resident in the endoplasmic reticulum could be made immunogenic if part of gp96 was replaced with the Fc portion of an IgG1 antibody to engineer a secretory form of gp96. In vivo gp96-Ig generated a strong CD8+ T cell response[1]
ComPACT[edit]
ComPACT is a combination of a pan-antigen T cell priming vaccine and a T cell co-stimulator.[2]
Other potential products[edit]
HS-410[edit]
HS-410, also called vesigenurtacel-L, is currently in Phase II in Non-Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC), in combination with BCG.[3] In Feb 2016 patient enrollment was paused (for lack of BCG).[4]
HS-110[edit]
HS 110, called viagenpumatucel-L, is in Phase II in NSCLC, in combination with cyclophosphamide. Another Phase I study is combining HS 110 with nivolumab and other checkpoint inhibitors.
Heat Biologics stock[edit]
Heat Biologics stock is traded on Nasdaq under the code HTBX. The company did its IPO on Nasdaq in mid-2013, with its stock commencing trading on 24 July 2013.[5]
Main people[edit]
Heat Biologics' Chairman and CEO is Jeffrey Wolf, a serial Life Sciences entrepreneur who founded the company in 2008. Its Chief Scientific Officer, Dr Taylor Schreiber, is a co-inventor of the ImPACT platform.
Location[edit]
Heat Biologics is headquartered in Durham, NC. Its office at 801 Capitola Drive is located near the I-40 about three miles to the southwest of Research Triangle Park and eight miles to the west of Raleigh–Durham International Airport.
