                        Support your researchers—and manage their data for posterity                    











Higher Education
How do you support an active research community generating data at massive scale while also archiving and curating billions of digital files, petabytes in size, for posterity? With a solution designed to adapt to the needs of research and archival departments, while providing advanced cataloging and curating analytics. Qumulo Core gives higher education leadership the power to manage and store billions of digital assets with real-time visibility and control built directly into the file system.









Easily manage millions or billions of digital assets
Research programs. Student data and records. Library archival content. The ability to store, manage, and curate ever-expanding growing libraries of media and other educational content is critical to the mission of higher education. Qumulo Core’s integrated file system analytics provide an accurate real-time data footprint, even at incredible scale. With metadata built directly into the Qumulo Scalable File System (QSFS) as an intrinsic element, storage administrators have unprecedented visibility into their data and storage, and can easily tell which users or workloads are impacting performance and capacity.





Fine-tuned for the Widest Range of Workloads and File Sizes
Transactional or sequential access patterns. Small or large file sizes. Qumulo Core supports them all—within a single file system. Qumulo Core delivers industry-leading scalability—from 4 to over 1,000 nodes in a single cluster and 100 terabytes to over 360 petabytes in a single file system.





Active Archiving for Long-term Content Storage
Qumulo Core architecture was designed to handle data growth and the unique needs of individual academic groups while providing uncompromising protection and availability to ensure always-available access to all data on-campus and elsewhere.
That’s why Qumulo gives storage administrators the ability to scale infrastructure on-demand, growing their working, archival storage, and scratch environments—no matter how fast or how often needs change. Qumulo Core is software that runs on premise or in the cloud—to support active archiving for the life of the content—without the barriers of proprietary hardware or software.






Architecture



The Qumulo Core architecture was designed to enable the next frontier of Higher Education archival and scientific data storage available to research projects, faculty, students, and the public.





















                               Our research organization falls between the cracks for most storage vendors, with giant imaging sets and millions of tiny genetic sequencing scraps. Finding a system that reasonably handled all our complex workflows was difficult, and in the end only Qumulo was the right fit.                               



- Bill Kupiec,  IT Manager, Department of Embryology,  Carnegie Institution of Science













                               For a critical digital media archive, Qumulo is the safest place I can think to put it short of directly in a backup vault. Soon we won’t need anything else but backup, high-speed virtual storage, and Qumulo.                               



- Joel Hsia,  Assistant Head for Systems Development,  Marriott Library













                               It’s impossible to make smart decisions about data when your storage is a figurative black box. Qumulo lets me tell in an instant how the data is used, who touches it and how often, so storage is no longer a technical issue but a management decision.                               



- Nick Rathke,  Assistant Director, Information Technology,  Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute

                               With critical high-profile projects, you want to know exactly what you’re going to be leaning on for successful delivery. When the La La Land project came around it was make or break, and we were never down for a moment. Qumulo is our rock, allowing us to focus on the visual effects with absolute confidence the data is safe.                               



- Tim LeDoux,  Founder/VFX Supervisor,  Crafty Apes













                               We chose Qumulo for the company's strong reputation, the flexibility and performance of the storage system, and their superb customer service.                               



- Clark Gaylord,  Chief information officer,  Virginia Tech Transportation Institute (VTTI)













                               Our research organization falls between the cracks for most storage vendors, with giant imaging sets and millions of tiny genetic sequencing scraps. Finding a system that reasonably handled all our complex workflows was difficult, and in the end only Qumulo was the right fit.                               



- Bill Kupiec,  IT Manager, Department of Embryology,  Carnegie Institution of Science













                               For a critical digital media archive, Qumulo is the safest place I can think to put it short of directly in a backup vault. Soon we won’t need anything else but backup, high-speed virtual storage, and Qumulo.                               



- Joel Hsia,  Assistant Head for Systems Development,  Marriott Library













                               Managing data with Qumulo is so simple it’s hard to describe the impact. It’s given us tremendous ROI in terms of time saved and problems eliminated, and having that reliable storage we can finally trust makes us eager to use it more broadly throughout the company.                               



- John Beck,  IT Manager,  Hyundai Mobis













                               We needed the storage equivalent of a reliable Swiss army knife, and unfortunately our old system – Isilon – just wasn’t cutting it anymore.                               



- Raoul Edwards,  Dir, Network Systems Engineering & Field Ops,  MSG Networks













                               From the moment we installed it, the Qumulo cluster has been rock solid. I spend zero time managing the system, and that’s my metric for good storage: I don’t ever want to see it. I just set up my notifications and monitoring, every now and then do a quick health check, and that’s it. The Qumulo storage just works.                               



- Jason Navarro,  IT manager,  Eight Solutions













                               People’s behavior is influenced by direct, immediate feedback on the impact their work is having on the system. And it can’t just be at a macro level. With Qumulo, our employees can see real-time graphs that update as they work − providing that granular visibility is surprisingly effective.                               



- Robert Jordan,  Head of Systems, Systems Engineering & IT,  Atomic Fiction













                               We are very excited about Qumulo’s products, team, and strategic direction. With total visibility of our data, real-time analytics and a robust API, we are excited about the possibility of highly sophisticated storage management.                               



- Mike Brodersen,  Chief Strategy Officer,  FotoKem













                               We were impressed with Qumulo’s flash-first hybrid design for performance and the real-time analytics that enable us to understand our data footprint and performance by user, application, and project across a single large shared storage resource.                               



- Ion Moraru,  Associate Professor of Cell Biology and Director of the High Performance Computing Facility,  UConn Health













                               Qumulo’s data-aware scale-out storage aligns perfectly with our mission of collecting massive amounts of data from hundreds of countries around the world to gain new insights into patterns of human disease. We chose Qumulo for its unique combination of real-time analytics, massive scalability, and ease of use.                               



- James Bullard,  Director of IT Services,  Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at University of Washington













                               Cheap and cheerful storage doesn’t cut it when it comes to our need for high performance, large shared capacity, and multiple parallel I/O paths. We need really high performance I/O to process datasets that are much too large to fit into memory. Plus, having real-time visibility into our data is the icing on the cake.

                                



- Nick Rathke,  Assistant Director, Information Technology,  Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute













                               Knowing - who, what, where and how your data is being accessed or interrogated has been something most vendors focus on after the fact and is usually a post process that can take hours and impact production. With Qumulo Core, we now have the ability to correlate storage activity with our pipeline and make changes in real-time.                               



- Saker Klippsten,  CTO,  Zoic Studios













                               We are really excited about the next generation scale-out NAS technology that Qumulo has created. Having real-time visibility into data and storage at scale is game changing.                               



- Nathan Larsen,  Director of IT,  Sinclair Oil













                               It almost makes me suspicious how easy this is to use.  There’s just one panel to check, a click of a button or two, typing in a name, and that’s it. I was very impressed with that.  Very impressed.                               



- Thai Do,  Director of Technology,  Blind Visual Propaganda













                               What has us really excited about Qumulo Core is that now we can quickly determine what to save and what can be archived. That gives us a level of visibility into our data and storage that we just didn’t have before.                               



- Grant Turner,  IT Manager,  Sportvision













                               Knowing what is going on inside the storage system in real-time - what client is doing what to the system, the capacity explorer to understand my data footprint, and knowing who and what is consuming performance. You guys have hit it out of the park with the integrated real-time analytics.                               



- Ronald Knol,  Senior Technology Consultant,  Telus Studios













                               The analytics deliver fantastic business value for us.  It allows us to be proactive, generating reports that show when data thresholds are being hit so we can move files around, alleviate burdens on specific nodes, and prevent slowdowns before they even occur.                               



- Sam Frankiel,  IT Director,  Ant Farm













                               I’ve got a lot of things in my IT infrastructure that keep me up at night, but Qumulo Core is not one of them.                               



- Geoff Froh,  Deputy Director and Chief Technology Officer,  Densho

                        Data will drive your next breakthroughs                    











Life Sciences & Medical Research
The need for efficient, high-performance processing of file-based data is at the heart of innovation and discovery in life sciences. Qumulo Core was designed to enable the next frontier of scientific breakthroughs, from gene sequencing to genetic analyzers, drug discovery, and beyond. Qumulo gives leaders of data-intensive life science enterprises the power to manage and store billions of digital assets with real-time visibility and control built directly into the file system.









Easily manage millions or billions of digital assets
From specialized life science workflows like genomic sequencing and analyzing, drug discovery, microscopy, 3D imaging, blood analysis, proteomic and biomedical research, to forecasting and modeling, everyone’s facing an unyielding explosion of data. 
Qumulo Core’s integrated file system analytics provide accurate real-time data footprint answers, even at incredible scale. With metadata built directly into the Qumulo Scalable File System (QSFS) as an intrinsic element, storage administrators have unprecedented visibility into their data and storage, and can easily tell which users or workloads are impacting performance and capacity.





Fine-tuned for the Widest Range of Workloads and File Sizes
Transactional or sequential access patterns. Small or large file sizes. Qumulo Core supports them all—within a single file system. Qumulo Core delivers industry-leading scalability—from 4 to over 1,000 nodes in a single cluster and 100 terabytes to over 360 petabytes in a single file system.





Active Archiving for Long-term Content Storage
Science doesn’t slow down when technology does. That’s why Qumulo gives storage administrators the ability to scale infrastructure on-demand, growing their working, archival storage, and scratch environments—no matter how fast or how often the project’s needs change. Qumulo Core is software that runs on premise or in the cloud—to support active archiving for the life of the content—without the barriers of proprietary hardware or software.






Architecture



The Qumulo Core architecture was designed to enable the next frontier of Life Science breakthroughs, from gene sequencing, genetic analyzers, drug discovery, and large scale storage.





















                               Our research organization falls between the cracks for most storage vendors, with giant imaging sets and millions of tiny genetic sequencing scraps. Finding a system that reasonably handled all our complex workflows was difficult, and in the end only Qumulo was the right fit.                               



- Bill Kupiec,  IT Manager, Department of Embryology,  Carnegie Institution of Science













                               We were impressed with Qumulo’s flash-first hybrid design for performance and the real-time analytics that enable us to understand our data footprint and performance by user, application, and project across a single large shared storage resource.                               



- Ion Moraru,  Associate Professor of Cell Biology and Director of the High Performance Computing Facility,  UConn Health













                               Qumulo’s data-aware scale-out storage aligns perfectly with our mission of collecting massive amounts of data from hundreds of countries around the world to gain new insights into patterns of human disease. We chose Qumulo for its unique combination of real-time analytics, massive scalability, and ease of use.                               



- James Bullard,  Director of IT Services,  Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at University of Washington













                               Cheap and cheerful storage doesn’t cut it when it comes to our need for high performance, large shared capacity, and multiple parallel I/O paths. We need really high performance I/O to process datasets that are much too large to fit into memory. Plus, having real-time visibility into our data is the icing on the cake.

                                



- Nick Rathke,  Assistant Director, Information Technology,  Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute

                        Modern scale-out storage for the digital media factory                    











Media & Entertainment
Qumulo Core is fast becoming a key production element of some of Hollywood’s most exciting projects—playing a critical role in storing and managing libraries of content that grow as quickly as creative minds work.









Easily manage millions or billions of digital assets
Qumulo Core’s integrated file system analytics provide accurate, real-time data footprint answers, even at incredible scale. With metadata built directly into the Qumulo Scalable File System (QSFS) as an intrinsic element, storage administrators have unprecedented visibility into their data and storage, and can easily tell which users or workloads are impacting performance and capacity. Qumulo Core’s architecture was designed to help accelerate  data-intensive workloads, including VR, VFX, 4K, animation rendering and broadcast.





Fine-tuned for the Widest Range of Workloads and File Sizes
Transactional or sequential access patterns. Small or large file sizes. Qumulo Core supports them all—within a single file system. Qumulo Core delivers industry-leading scalability—from 4 to over 1,000 nodes in a single cluster and 100 terabytes to over 360 petabytes in a single file system.





Active Archiving for Long-term Media Content Storage
Ideas run on their own schedule. That’s why Qumulo gives storage administrators the ability to scale infrastructure on-demand, growing their working, archival storage, and scratch environments—no matter how fast or how often the project’s needs change. 
Qumulo Core is software that runs on premise or in the cloud—to support active archiving for the life of the content—without the barriers of proprietary hardware or software.






Architecture



Qumulo Core’s architecture was designed to help accelerate  data-intensive workloads, including VR, VFX, 4K, animation rendering and broadcast.





















                               With critical high-profile projects, you want to know exactly what you’re going to be leaning on for successful delivery. When the La La Land project came around it was make or break, and we were never down for a moment. Qumulo is our rock, allowing us to focus on the visual effects with absolute confidence the data is safe.                               



- Tim LeDoux,  Founder/VFX Supervisor,  Crafty Apes













                               We needed the storage equivalent of a reliable Swiss army knife, and unfortunately our old system – Isilon – just wasn’t cutting it anymore.                               



- Raoul Edwards,  Dir, Network Systems Engineering & Field Ops,  MSG Networks













                               From the moment we installed it, the Qumulo cluster has been rock solid. I spend zero time managing the system, and that’s my metric for good storage: I don’t ever want to see it. I just set up my notifications and monitoring, every now and then do a quick health check, and that’s it. The Qumulo storage just works.                               



- Jason Navarro,  IT manager,  Eight Solutions













                               People’s behavior is influenced by direct, immediate feedback on the impact their work is having on the system. And it can’t just be at a macro level. With Qumulo, our employees can see real-time graphs that update as they work − providing that granular visibility is surprisingly effective.                               



- Robert Jordan,  Head of Systems, Systems Engineering & IT,  Atomic Fiction













                               We are very excited about Qumulo’s products, team, and strategic direction. With total visibility of our data, real-time analytics and a robust API, we are excited about the possibility of highly sophisticated storage management.                               



- Mike Brodersen,  Chief Strategy Officer,  FotoKem













                               Knowing - who, what, where and how your data is being accessed or interrogated has been something most vendors focus on after the fact and is usually a post process that can take hours and impact production. With Qumulo Core, we now have the ability to correlate storage activity with our pipeline and make changes in real-time.                               



- Saker Klippsten,  CTO,  Zoic Studios













                               It almost makes me suspicious how easy this is to use.  There’s just one panel to check, a click of a button or two, typing in a name, and that’s it. I was very impressed with that.  Very impressed.                               



- Thai Do,  Director of Technology,  Blind Visual Propaganda













                               What has us really excited about Qumulo Core is that now we can quickly determine what to save and what can be archived. That gives us a level of visibility into our data and storage that we just didn’t have before.                               



- Grant Turner,  IT Manager,  Sportvision













                               Knowing what is going on inside the storage system in real-time - what client is doing what to the system, the capacity explorer to understand my data footprint, and knowing who and what is consuming performance.

                        Support your researchers—and manage their data for posterity                    











Higher Education
How do you support an active research community generating data at massive scale while also archiving and curating billions of digital files, petabytes in size, for posterity? With a solution designed to adapt to the needs of research and archival departments, while providing advanced cataloging and curating analytics. Qumulo Core gives higher education leadership the power to manage and store billions of digital assets with real-time visibility and control built directly into the file system.









Easily manage millions or billions of digital assets
Research programs. Student data and records. Library archival content. The ability to store, manage, and curate ever-expanding growing libraries of media and other educational content is critical to the mission of higher education. Qumulo Core’s integrated file system analytics provide an accurate real-time data footprint, even at incredible scale. With metadata built directly into the Qumulo Scalable File System (QSFS) as an intrinsic element, storage administrators have unprecedented visibility into their data and storage, and can easily tell which users or workloads are impacting performance and capacity.





Fine-tuned for the Widest Range of Workloads and File Sizes
Transactional or sequential access patterns. Small or large file sizes. Qumulo Core supports them all—within a single file system. Qumulo Core delivers industry-leading scalability—from 4 to over 1,000 nodes in a single cluster and 100 terabytes to over 360 petabytes in a single file system.





Active Archiving for Long-term Content Storage
Qumulo Core architecture was designed to handle data growth and the unique needs of individual academic groups while providing uncompromising protection and availability to ensure always-available access to all data on-campus and elsewhere.
That’s why Qumulo gives storage administrators the ability to scale infrastructure on-demand, growing their working, archival storage, and scratch environments—no matter how fast or how often needs change. Qumulo Core is software that runs on premise or in the cloud—to support active archiving for the life of the content—without the barriers of proprietary hardware or software.






Architecture



The Qumulo Core architecture was designed to enable the next frontier of Higher Education archival and scientific data storage available to research projects, faculty, students, and the public.





















                               Our research organization falls between the cracks for most storage vendors, with giant imaging sets and millions of tiny genetic sequencing scraps. Finding a system that reasonably handled all our complex workflows was difficult, and in the end only Qumulo was the right fit.                               



- Bill Kupiec,  IT Manager, Department of Embryology,  Carnegie Institution of Science













                               For a critical digital media archive, Qumulo is the safest place I can think to put it short of directly in a backup vault. Soon we won’t need anything else but backup, high-speed virtual storage, and Qumulo.                               



- Joel Hsia,  Assistant Head for Systems Development,  Marriott Library













                               It’s impossible to make smart decisions about data when your storage is a figurative black box. Qumulo lets me tell in an instant how the data is used, who touches it and how often, so storage is no longer a technical issue but a management decision.                               



- Nick Rathke,  Assistant Director, Information Technology,  Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute

Systems category
Startup Qumulo Inc. combines data-aware scale-out NAS with built-in analytics for traditional file systems and object storage. Designed for petabyte-scale deployments, Qumulo Core storage is designed to intelligently manage billons of data objects. Engineered by inventors of the Isilon scale-out NAS (now owned by EMC), Qumulo Core is a software-only installation that runs atop a Linux-based hybrid flash storage system on pre-validated commodity hardware, dedicated servers or virtual machines.








The Qumulo Scalable File System curates, manages and stores data. The Core database system files are served from flash storage. Core's analytics are embedded within data and storage, enabling users to identify data that is most valuable, see where it is stored and how it is being accessed, as well orchestrate for archiving, backing up or deleting files.
"Scale-out NAS meets data management, analytics and storage resource management. Very innovative," is how one judge described Qumulo Core.
Another judge praised Qumulo Core for its "great value and innovative data utilization aware that scales to (support) billions" of objects.
A Qumulo Core cluster scales from four nodes to more than 1,000 nodes, creating a single file system and single global namespace. Each node runs Qumulo Core and participates in the cluster as a fully symmetric peer, managing read and write requests and coordinating transactions with other nodes. Nodes get added non-disruptively for linear scaling of storage capacity and storage performance.






Each Qumulo node is a modular building block that comprises processing power, memory, networking, flash and spinning disk with two 10 Gigabit Ethernet ports. Core supports NFS and SMB file storage and features a programmable REST-based object management API.

Qumulo's software-as-a-service delivery model is sold as an annual subscription. Entry pricing for a four-node 100 TB raw capacity Qumulo QC24 hybrid storage cluster begins at $50,000.

Interesting. It is something I will probably never run across. Most companies I have worked for are nowhere near that volume of data..It would be many years before they came close to 1 petabyte. My current company has an i-Series with or historical data going back to 1999 and we are only at 41% capacity of our 2TB of disk.

Hi ToddN2000: The use of scale-out storage is on the rise. I think Qumulo's built-in data analytics is a key differentiator, esp. in the era of big data.

I'd be curious as to what percent of today's  businesses would be considered big data. Sounds like it may be the right direction if the trend continues that way. This might just be a small portion of the market so they can adjust things as they grow as it does not effect the mainstream. It's kind of scary that I have twice the storage capacity for my PC as my company.

I think big data is still thought of mainly as complex data sets that require fast a high degree of analytics. If you aren't running Hadoop clusters, a large SQL farm or OLTP systems, you may not have encountered big data (and scale-out storage) yet. Interesting... what kind of storage area you running?

Nothing like you mentioned. Just the standard default configuration for a IBM i-Series.

Challenge Us With Your Unique Problems
Organizations in virtually any industry can leverage Qumulo’s modern scale-out storage for data intensive workloads.
Contact us to discuss your specific requirements.























                               With critical high-profile projects, you want to know exactly what you’re going to be leaning on for successful delivery. When the La La Land project came around it was make or break, and we were never down for a moment. Qumulo is our rock, allowing us to focus on the visual effects with absolute confidence the data is safe.                               



- Tim LeDoux,  Founder/VFX Supervisor,  Crafty Apes













                               We chose Qumulo for the company's strong reputation, the flexibility and performance of the storage system, and their superb customer service.                               



- Clark Gaylord,  Chief information officer,  Virginia Tech Transportation Institute (VTTI)













                               Our research organization falls between the cracks for most storage vendors, with giant imaging sets and millions of tiny genetic sequencing scraps. Finding a system that reasonably handled all our complex workflows was difficult, and in the end only Qumulo was the right fit.                               



- Bill Kupiec,  IT Manager, Department of Embryology,  Carnegie Institution of Science













                               For a critical digital media archive, Qumulo is the safest place I can think to put it short of directly in a backup vault. Soon we won’t need anything else but backup, high-speed virtual storage, and Qumulo.                               



- Joel Hsia,  Assistant Head for Systems Development,  Marriott Library













                               Managing data with Qumulo is so simple it’s hard to describe the impact. It’s given us tremendous ROI in terms of time saved and problems eliminated, and having that reliable storage we can finally trust makes us eager to use it more broadly throughout the company.                               



- John Beck,  IT Manager,  Hyundai Mobis













                               We needed the storage equivalent of a reliable Swiss army knife, and unfortunately our old system – Isilon – just wasn’t cutting it anymore.                               



- Raoul Edwards,  Dir, Network Systems Engineering & Field Ops,  MSG Networks













                               From the moment we installed it, the Qumulo cluster has been rock solid. I spend zero time managing the system, and that’s my metric for good storage: I don’t ever want to see it. I just set up my notifications and monitoring, every now and then do a quick health check, and that’s it. The Qumulo storage just works.                               



- Jason Navarro,  IT manager,  Eight Solutions













                               People’s behavior is influenced by direct, immediate feedback on the impact their work is having on the system. And it can’t just be at a macro level. With Qumulo, our employees can see real-time graphs that update as they work − providing that granular visibility is surprisingly effective.                               



- Robert Jordan,  Head of Systems, Systems Engineering & IT,  Atomic Fiction













                               We are very excited about Qumulo’s products, team, and strategic direction. With total visibility of our data, real-time analytics and a robust API, we are excited about the possibility of highly sophisticated storage management.                               



- Mike Brodersen,  Chief Strategy Officer,  FotoKem













                               We were impressed with Qumulo’s flash-first hybrid design for performance and the real-time analytics that enable us to understand our data footprint and performance by user, application, and project across a single large shared storage resource.                               



- Ion Moraru,  Associate Professor of Cell Biology and Director of the High Performance Computing Facility,  UConn Health













                               Qumulo’s data-aware scale-out storage aligns perfectly with our mission of collecting massive amounts of data from hundreds of countries around the world to gain new insights into patterns of human disease. We chose Qumulo for its unique combination of real-time analytics, massive scalability, and ease of use.                               



- James Bullard,  Director of IT Services,  Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at University of Washington













                               Cheap and cheerful storage doesn’t cut it when it comes to our need for high performance, large shared capacity, and multiple parallel I/O paths. We need really high performance I/O to process datasets that are much too large to fit into memory. Plus, having real-time visibility into our data is the icing on the cake.

                                



- Nick Rathke,  Assistant Director, Information Technology,  Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute













                               Knowing - who, what, where and how your data is being accessed or interrogated has been something most vendors focus on after the fact and is usually a post process that can take hours and impact production. With Qumulo Core, we now have the ability to correlate storage activity with our pipeline and make changes in real-time.                               



- Saker Klippsten,  CTO,  Zoic Studios













                               We are really excited about the next generation scale-out NAS technology that Qumulo has created. Having real-time visibility into data and storage at scale is game changing.                               



- Nathan Larsen,  Director of IT,  Sinclair Oil













                               It almost makes me suspicious how easy this is to use.  There’s just one panel to check, a click of a button or two, typing in a name, and that’s it. I was very impressed with that.  Very impressed.                               



- Thai Do,  Director of Technology,  Blind Visual Propaganda













                               What has us really excited about Qumulo Core is that now we can quickly determine what to save and what can be archived. That gives us a level of visibility into our data and storage that we just didn’t have before.                               



- Grant Turner,  IT Manager,  Sportvision













                               Knowing what is going on inside the storage system in real-time - what client is doing what to the system, the capacity explorer to understand my data footprint, and knowing who and what is consuming performance. You guys have hit it out of the park with the integrated real-time analytics.                               



- Ronald Knol,  Senior Technology Consultant,  Telus Studios













                               The analytics deliver fantastic business value for us.  It allows us to be proactive, generating reports that show when data thresholds are being hit so we can move files around, alleviate burdens on specific nodes, and prevent slowdowns before they even occur.                               



- Sam Frankiel,  IT Director,  Ant Farm













                               I’ve got a lot of things in my IT infrastructure that keep me up at night, but Qumulo Core is not one of them.                               



- Geoff Froh,  Deputy Director and Chief Technology Officer,  Densho

Analyst ReportHow Six Qumulo Customers Store, Manage, and Curate Mission-Critical Data








Qumulo Core is
modern scale-out storage.
It enables leaders of data-intensive enterprises to manage and store tens of billions of digital assets with real-time visibility and control built directly into the file system. Qumulo Core blows past the design limitations of legacy NAS with solutions designed for the new era of multi-petabyte data footprints on premise and in the cloud.
Unprecedented performance, scalability and reliability.
Qumulo Core features a flash-first hybrid design for high performance at low cost. Advanced block-based data protection technology turbocharges rebuild times and allows high-efficiency use of raw capacity—perfect for mixed file size workloads and large, high-density storage clusters. When disks fail, Qumulo Core’s rebuild times are measured in minutes or hours, not days or weeks.
Real-time visibility & control
at massive scale
Qumulo Core shatters the notion that humans can’t manage file-based storage at massive scale. Qumulo Core allows storage administrators to:







See
usage, activity and throughput at any level of the unified directory structure, even with file counts in the tens of billions in the system





Control
storage allocation with tools designed for high performance at scale. Qumulo allows capacity quotas to be specified on a per-directory basis and keeps them up to date, regardless of cluster size





Create
snapshots instantly, regardless of the number of files, with no need for third-party tools

Hyundai MOBIS Relies on Qumulo’s Data-Aware Scale-Out NAS in Developing the Future of the Connected Car
Posted September 13 2016 by Chris Hoffman. Filed under Customer Stories,Customer Success,Data-Aware Scale-Out NAS.



Autonomous driving is a core R&D focus for Hyundai MOBIS that requires analyzing terabytes of real-world video data. Unfortunately, this global top-tier automotive parts supplier’s existing scale-up storage was too fragmented and expensive to efficiently handle the load. Qumulo’s data-aware scale-out NAS provided the missing performance, scalability and simplicity at a price that was too good to pass up.
Some of the benefits Hyundai MOBIS has enjoyed since deploying Qumulo’s data-aware scale-out NAS:

Provides a real-time view into global data footprint through data analytics
Scales capacity and performance with each additional node, without creating separate volumes or silos of storage
Reduces costs with as-needed expandability and budget-friendly commodity hardware

Based on the team’s success with Qumulo, Beck has significant plans for expanding the deployment over time. As the company broadens development of autonomous driving, Beck’s team will need to pull data from other global R&D centers onto the cluster, making the performance, capacity, scalability and manageability of the Qumulo storage even more important. Beck’s team also plans to store other types of data from different departments throughout the company, so Qumulo’s ability to handle small and large file sizes equally well will be another important advantage.
“As we scale the system to handle data globally, having a real time view of everything that’s happening on the cluster will be critical for staying ahead of the needs of other teams.”
—— John Beck, IT Manager, Hyundai MOBIS

What We Believe


More and more of our lives are spent producing, consuming, and analyzing digital content. Ever more of our creations, discoveries, and experiences come from, and take the form of, data.
Through the very act of living, year by year, we are relentlessly creating exponentially more data objects. And we never, ever, throw anything away.
Today’s enterprise storage systems can’t keep up with storing all this data – let alone with managing it.


To support our digital existence, the future’s storage will be software that knits low-cost commodity hardware together to provide a scalable, fast and reliable data storage system.
That system will cease to be a passive, ever-growing dumpster for digital waste. Instead, it will become an intelligent collaborator in the storage, retrieval, management and curation of trillions of data objects.
That system is Qumulo Core.











What We Do
We build products that are always on, that never lose data,
and that store and retrieve data fast.


Enterprises have long suffered from the constraints imposed by outdated ways of storing and managing data at scale. Qumulo removes these constraints, giving customers the freedom to obtain real-time answers about their data and storage at incredible scale.
We achieve this by aiming to become the company the world trusts to store, manage, and curate its data forever.


Because our customers are our magnetic field, everything that we build is driven by their challenges, and designed around their needs.
To meet the obligations of our customers we embrace the scientific method and agile methodologies. We do the hard, right thing and through innovative technology, we make storage simple for businesses.




Our Mission & Vision
 Our Mission Is To Be The Company The World TrustsTo Store, Manage, And Curate Its Data Forever.


We’re engineers, builders, craftsmen and artists. We are customer driven and we love to create. At our headquarters in Seattle we’ve assembled a team that is committed to turning enterprise scale-out NAS on its head and re-define the role of storage in the data center altogether. Through practical expertise in distributed systems infrastructure,


agile software development methodology and world-class user experience design, we work tirelessly to create a product that customers need and want. Whatever their role, each Qumulo employee combines an uncompromising data-driven mindset with an unwavering focus on serving our customers to the fullest.

                        Data will drive your next breakthroughs                    











Life Sciences & Medical Research
The need for efficient, high-performance processing of file-based data is at the heart of innovation and discovery in life sciences. Qumulo Core was designed to enable the next frontier of scientific breakthroughs, from gene sequencing to genetic analyzers, drug discovery, and beyond. Qumulo gives leaders of data-intensive life science enterprises the power to manage and store billions of digital assets with real-time visibility and control built directly into the file system.









Easily manage millions or billions of digital assets
From specialized life science workflows like genomic sequencing and analyzing, drug discovery, microscopy, 3D imaging, blood analysis, proteomic and biomedical research, to forecasting and modeling, everyone’s facing an unyielding explosion of data. 
Qumulo Core’s integrated file system analytics provide accurate real-time data footprint answers, even at incredible scale. With metadata built directly into the Qumulo Scalable File System (QSFS) as an intrinsic element, storage administrators have unprecedented visibility into their data and storage, and can easily tell which users or workloads are impacting performance and capacity.





Fine-tuned for the Widest Range of Workloads and File Sizes
Transactional or sequential access patterns. Small or large file sizes. Qumulo Core supports them all—within a single file system. Qumulo Core delivers industry-leading scalability—from 4 to over 1,000 nodes in a single cluster and 100 terabytes to over 360 petabytes in a single file system.





Active Archiving for Long-term Content Storage
Science doesn’t slow down when technology does. That’s why Qumulo gives storage administrators the ability to scale infrastructure on-demand, growing their working, archival storage, and scratch environments—no matter how fast or how often the project’s needs change. Qumulo Core is software that runs on premise or in the cloud—to support active archiving for the life of the content—without the barriers of proprietary hardware or software.

The Qumulo Core architecture was designed to enable the next frontier of Life Science breakthroughs, from gene sequencing, genetic analyzers, drug discovery, and large scale storage.





















                               Our research organization falls between the cracks for most storage vendors, with giant imaging sets and millions of tiny genetic sequencing scraps. Finding a system that reasonably handled all our complex workflows was difficult, and in the end only Qumulo was the right fit.                               



- Bill Kupiec,  IT Manager, Department of Embryology,  Carnegie Institution of Science













                               We were impressed with Qumulo’s flash-first hybrid design for performance and the real-time analytics that enable us to understand our data footprint and performance by user, application, and project across a single large shared storage resource.                               



- Ion Moraru,  Associate Professor of Cell Biology and Director of the High Performance Computing Facility,  UConn Health













                               Qumulo’s data-aware scale-out storage aligns perfectly with our mission of collecting massive amounts of data from hundreds of countries around the world to gain new insights into patterns of human disease. We chose Qumulo for its unique combination of real-time analytics, massive scalability, and ease of use.                               



- James Bullard,  Director of IT Services,  Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at University of Washington













                               Cheap and cheerful storage doesn’t cut it when it comes to our need for high performance, large shared capacity, and multiple parallel I/O paths. We need really high performance I/O to process datasets that are much too large to fit into memory. Plus, having real-time visibility into our data is the icing on the cake.

                                



- Nick Rathke,  Assistant Director, Information Technology,  Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute

                        Modern scale-out storage for the digital media factory                    











Media & Entertainment
Qumulo Core is fast becoming a key production element of some of Hollywood’s most exciting projects—playing a critical role in storing and managing libraries of content that grow as quickly as creative minds work.









Easily manage millions or billions of digital assets
Qumulo Core’s integrated file system analytics provide accurate, real-time data footprint answers, even at incredible scale. With metadata built directly into the Qumulo Scalable File System (QSFS) as an intrinsic element, storage administrators have unprecedented visibility into their data and storage, and can easily tell which users or workloads are impacting performance and capacity. Qumulo Core’s architecture was designed to help accelerate  data-intensive workloads, including VR, VFX, 4K, animation rendering and broadcast.





Fine-tuned for the Widest Range of Workloads and File Sizes
Transactional or sequential access patterns. Small or large file sizes. Qumulo Core supports them all—within a single file system. Qumulo Core delivers industry-leading scalability—from 4 to over 1,000 nodes in a single cluster and 100 terabytes to over 360 petabytes in a single file system.





Active Archiving for Long-term Media Content Storage
Ideas run on their own schedule. That’s why Qumulo gives storage administrators the ability to scale infrastructure on-demand, growing their working, archival storage, and scratch environments—no matter how fast or how often the project’s needs change. 
Qumulo Core is software that runs on premise or in the cloud—to support active archiving for the life of the content—without the barriers of proprietary hardware or software.

                               With critical high-profile projects, you want to know exactly what you’re going to be leaning on for successful delivery. When the La La Land project came around it was make or break, and we were never down for a moment. Qumulo is our rock, allowing us to focus on the visual effects with absolute confidence the data is safe.                               



- Tim LeDoux,  Founder/VFX Supervisor,  Crafty Apes













                               We needed the storage equivalent of a reliable Swiss army knife, and unfortunately our old system – Isilon – just wasn’t cutting it anymore.                               



- Raoul Edwards,  Dir, Network Systems Engineering & Field Ops,  MSG Networks













                               From the moment we installed it, the Qumulo cluster has been rock solid. I spend zero time managing the system, and that’s my metric for good storage: I don’t ever want to see it. I just set up my notifications and monitoring, every now and then do a quick health check, and that’s it. The Qumulo storage just works.                               



- Jason Navarro,  IT manager,  Eight Solutions













                               People’s behavior is influenced by direct, immediate feedback on the impact their work is having on the system. And it can’t just be at a macro level. With Qumulo, our employees can see real-time graphs that update as they work − providing that granular visibility is surprisingly effective.                               



- Robert Jordan,  Head of Systems, Systems Engineering & IT,  Atomic Fiction













                               We are very excited about Qumulo’s products, team, and strategic direction. With total visibility of our data, real-time analytics and a robust API, we are excited about the possibility of highly sophisticated storage management.                               



- Mike Brodersen,  Chief Strategy Officer,  FotoKem













                               Knowing - who, what, where and how your data is being accessed or interrogated has been something most vendors focus on after the fact and is usually a post process that can take hours and impact production. With Qumulo Core, we now have the ability to correlate storage activity with our pipeline and make changes in real-time.                               



- Saker Klippsten,  CTO,  Zoic Studios













                               It almost makes me suspicious how easy this is to use.  There’s just one panel to check, a click of a button or two, typing in a name, and that’s it. I was very impressed with that.  Very impressed.                               



- Thai Do,  Director of Technology,  Blind Visual Propaganda













                               What has us really excited about Qumulo Core is that now we can quickly determine what to save and what can be archived. That gives us a level of visibility into our data and storage that we just didn’t have before.                               



- Grant Turner,  IT Manager,  Sportvision













                               Knowing what is going on inside the storage system in real-time - what client is doing what to the system, the capacity explorer to understand my data footprint, and knowing who and what is consuming performance. You guys have hit it out of the park with the integrated real-time analytics.                               



- Ronald Knol,  Senior Technology Consultant,  Telus Studios













                               The analytics deliver fantastic business value for us.  It allows us to be proactive, generating reports that show when data thresholds are being hit so we can move files around, alleviate burdens on specific nodes, and prevent slowdowns before they even occur.                               



- Sam Frankiel,  IT Director,  Ant Farm
