Mortgage-Backed Securities

                            July 23, 2010
                       


Mortgage-backed securities (MBS) are debt obligations that represent claims to the cash flows from pools of mortgage loans, most commonly on residential property. Mortgage loans are purchased from banks, mortgage companies, and other originators and then assembled into pools by a governmental, quasi-governmental, or private entity. The entity then issues securities that represent claims on the principal and interest payments made by borrowers on the loans in the pool, a process known as securitization.
Most MBSs are issued by the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae), a U.S. government agency, or the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. Ginnie Mae, backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, guarantees that investors receive timely payments. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also provide certain guarantees and, while not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, have special authority to borrow from the U.S. Treasury. Some private institutions, such as brokerage firms, banks, and homebuilders, also securitize mortgages, known as "private-label" mortgage securities.
Mortgage-backed securities exhibit a variety of structures. The most basic types are pass-through participation certificates, which entitle the holder to a pro-rata share of all principal and interest payments made on the pool of loan assets. More complicated MBSs, known as collaterized mortgage obligations or mortgage derivatives, may be designed to protect investors from or expose investors to various types of risk. An important risk with regard to residential mortgages involves prepayments, typically because homeowners refinance when interest rates fall. Absent protection, such prepayments would return principal to investors precisely when their options for reinvesting those funds may be relatively unattractive.

RATINGS RATIONALE




The Certificates are collateralized by 74 fixed rate loans secured by 
112 properties. The ratings are based on the collateral and the 
structure of the transaction.




Moody's CMBS ratings methodology combines both commercial real estate 
and structured finance analysis. Based on commercial real estate 
analysis, Moody's determines the credit quality of each mortgage 
loan and calculates an expected loss on a loan specific basis. 
Under structured finance, the credit enhancement for each certificate 
typically depends on the expected frequency, severity, and 
timing of future losses. Moody's also considers a range of qualitative 
issues as well as the transaction's structural and legal aspects.




The credit risk of loans is determined primarily by two factors: 
1) Moody's assessment of the probability of default, which is largely 
driven by each loan's DSCR, and 2) Moody's assessment of the severity 
of loss upon a default, which is largely driven by each loan's LTV 
ratio.




The Moody's Actual DSCR of 1.70X is higher than the 2007 
conduit/fusion transaction average of 1.55X. The Moody's 
Stressed DSCR of 0.97X is slightly higher than the 2007 conduit/fusion 
transaction average of 0.92X.




The pooled Trust loan balance of $913.5 million represents 
a Moody's LTV ratio of 113.8%, which is higher 
than the 2007 conduit/fusion transaction average of 110.6%.




Moody's also considers both loan level diversity and property level diversity 
when selecting a ratings approach. With respect to loan level diversity, 
the pool's loan level Herfindahl score is 31.6 (which is higher 
than the scores calculated for most multi-borrower pools that Moody's 
has rated since 2009).




With respect to property level diversity, the pool's property 
level Herfindahl score is 32.8.




Moody's also grades properties on a scale of 1 to 5 (best to worst) and 
considers those grades when assessing the likelihood of debt payment. 
The factors considered include property age, quality of construction, 
location, market, and tenancy. The pool's weighted 
average property quality grade is 2.49, which is worse than 
indices calculated in most multi-borrower transactions since 2009.




The principal methodology used in this rating was "Approach to Rating 
U.S. and Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published in 
December 2014. Please see the Credit Policy page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




Moody's analysis employs the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model v3.00 
which derives credit enhancement levels based on an aggregation of adjusted 
loan level proceeds derived from Moody's loan level DSCR and LTV ratios. 
Major adjustments to determining proceeds include loan structure, 
property type, sponsorship, and diversity. Moody's 
analysis also uses the CMBS IO calculator ver1.1, which references 
the following inputs to calculate the proposed IO rating based on the 
published methodology: original and current bond ratings and credit 
assessments; original and current bond balances grossed up for losses 
for all bonds the IO(s) reference(s) within the transaction; and 
IO type corresponding to an IO type as defined in the published methodology.




Moody's Parameter Sensitivities: If Moody's value of the collateral 
used in determining the initial rating were decreased by 5%, 
14%, and 23%, the model-indicated rating 
for the currently rated Aaa (sf) Super Senior class would be Aaa, 
Aa1, and Aa2, respectively; for the Aa1 (sf) rated class 
A-S would be Aa2, A1, and A3, respectively; 
for the Aa3 (sf) rated class B would be A1, A3, and Baa2, 
respectively. Parameter Sensitivities are not intended to measure 
how the rating of the security might migrate over time; rather they 
are designed to provide a quantitative calculation of how the initial 
rating might change if key input parameters used in the initial rating 
process differed. The analysis assumes that the deal has not aged. 
Parameter Sensitivities only reflect the ratings impact of each scenario 
from a quantitative/model-indicated standpoint. Qualitative 
factors are also taken into consideration in the ratings process, 
so the actual ratings that would be assigned in each case could vary from 
the information presented in the Parameter Sensitivity analysis.




These ratings: (a) are based solely on information in the public 
domain and/or information communicated to Moody's by the issuer at the 
date it was prepared and such information has not been independently verified 
by Moody's; (b) must be construed solely as a statement of opinion 
and not a statement of fact or an offer, invitation, inducement 
or recommendation to purchase, sell or hold any securities or otherwise 
act in relation to the issuer or any other entity or in connection with 
any other matter. Moody's does not guarantee or make any representation 
or warranty as to the correctness of any information, rating or 
communication relating to the issuer. Moody's shall not be liable 
in contract, tort, statutory duty or otherwise to the issuer 
or any other third party for any loss, injury or cost caused to 
the issuer or any other third party, in whole or in part, 
including by any negligence (but excluding fraud, dishonesty and/or 
willful misconduct or any other type of liability that by law cannot be 
excluded) on the part of, or any contingency beyond the control 
of Moody's, or any of its employees or agents, including any 
losses arising from or in connection with the procurement, compilation, 
analysis, interpretation, communication, dissemination, 
or delivery of any information or rating relating to the issuer.




Factors that would lead to an upgrade or downgrade of the rating:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range may indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously anticipated. 
Factors that may cause an upgrade of the ratings include significant loan 
paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's share of defeasance 
or overall improved pool performance. Factors that may cause a 
downgrade of the ratings include a decline in the overall performance 
of the pool, loan concentration, increased expected losses 
from specially serviced and troubled loans or interest shortfalls.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and 
sensitivity analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and 
Sensitivity to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




Moody's received and took into account one or more third-party 
assessments on the due diligence performed regarding the underlying assets 
or financial instruments in this transaction and the assessments had a 
neutral impact on the credit rating. 




Further information on the representations and warranties and enforcement 
mechanisms available to investors are available on 


http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF398099.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's quantitative analysis entails an evaluation of scenarios 
that stress factors contributing to sensitivity of ratings and take into 
account the likelihood of severe collateral losses or impaired cash flows. 
Moody's weights the impact on the rated instruments based on its 
assumptions of the likelihood of the events in such scenarios occurring. 





For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the rating action on the support provider and in relation to each particular 
rating action for securities that derive their credit ratings from the 
support provider's credit rating. For provisional ratings, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the provisional rating assigned, and in relation to a definitive 
rating that may be assigned subsequent to the final issuance of the debt, 
in each case where the transaction structure and terms have not changed 
prior to the assignment of the definitive rating in a manner that would 
have affected the rating. For further information please see the 
ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this rating action, and 
whose ratings may change as a result of this rating action, the 
associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.


Please see www.moodys.com for any updates on changes to 
the lead rating analyst and to the Moody's legal entity that has issued 
the rating.

Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable).

MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors.

Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000.

RATINGS RATIONALE




The ratings on eight P&I classes were affirmed because the transaction's 
key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value (LTV) 
ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and the 
transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), are within acceptable 
ranges.




The ratings on IO classes X-A and X-B were affirmed because 
the credit performance of the referenced classes is consistent with Moody's 
expectations.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 4.8% 
of the current balance. Moody's base expected loss plus realized 
losses is 4.7% of the original pooled balance. Moody's 
provides a current list of base expected losses for conduit and fusion 
CMBS transactions on moodys.com at http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255.




FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATING:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.




Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The principal methodology used in these ratings was "Approach to Rating 
US and Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014. 
Please see the Ratings Methodologies page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




DESCRIPTION OF MODELS USED




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, 
which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit 
enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, 
Moody's actual and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property 
quality grade (which reflects the capitalization rate Moody's uses 
to estimate Moody's value). Moody's fuses the conduit 
results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured 
credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents 10% 
or greater of the current pool balance. 




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan 
sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. 
Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, 
including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 31, 
compared to 32 at Moody's last review.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the February 12, 2016 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by 0.5% to $908.6 
million from $913.5 million at securitization. The 
certificates are collateralized by 74 mortgage loans ranging in size from 
less than 1% to 12% of the pool, with the top ten 
loans constituting 41% of the pool.




Three loans, constituting 3.3% of the pool, 
are on the master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes 
loans that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part 
of the CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As 
part of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency 
reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that 
could affect performance.




No loans have been liquidated from the pool and no loans are currently 
in special servicing.




Moody's received full year 2014 operating results for 100% of the 
pool, and full or partial year 2015 operating results for 89% 
of the pool. Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 113%. 
Moody's conduit component excludes loans with structured credit 
assessments, defeased and CTL loans, and specially serviced 
and troubled loans. Moody's net cash flow (NCF) reflects 
a weighted average haircut of 16% to the most recently available 
net operating income (NOI). Moody's value reflects a weighted 
average capitalization rate of 10.1%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.70X and 0.97X, 
respectively. Moody's actual DSCR is based on Moody's 
NCF and the loan's actual debt service. Moody's stressed 
DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and a 9.25% stress rate 
the agency applied to the loan balance.




The top three conduit loans represent 22% of the pool balance. 
The largest loan is the Airport Technology Park Loan ($108.8 
million -- 12% of the pool), which is secured 
by a 1,030,049 square foot (SF), 10-building 
office/research and development complex located in Salt Lake City, 
Utah. As of September 2015, the property was 96% leased 
to two credit tenants, L-3 Communications Corporation and 
Unisys Corporation. The loan is exposed to single tenant risk as 
81% of the NRA is leased to L-3 Communications Corporation. 
Moody's analysis considered a lit/dark blend to evaluate the single 
tenant risk. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 103% and 
1.15X, respectively.




The second largest loan is the Discovery Corporate Center Loan ($50 
million -- 5.5% of the pool), which is secured 
by a 228,048 SF Class A office space located in San Diego, 
California. The collateral includes three of the four low-rise 
buildings that comprise the larger Discovery Corporate Center office complex. 
All three buildings are entirely leased to Broadcom Corporation, 
a credit tenant. Moody's analysis considered a lit/dark blend 
to evaluate the single tenant risk. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR 
are 117% and 1.00X, respectively.




The third largest loan is the Campus Marketplace Loan ($41 million 
-- 4.5% of the pool), which is secured by a 144,291 
SF grocery-anchored retail center located in San Marcos, 
California. As of September 2015, the property was 93% 
leased to 30 tenants, compared to 91% at securitization. 
Top tenants include Ralphs Grocery Store, CVS Pharmacy, Petco 
Animal Supplies and Bank of America. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR 
are 122% and 0.80X, respectively.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the credit rating action on the support provider and in relation to 
each particular credit rating action for securities that derive their 
credit ratings from the support provider's credit rating. 
For provisional ratings, this announcement provides certain regulatory 
disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned, and 
in relation to a definitive rating that may be assigned subsequent to 
the final issuance of the debt, in each case where the transaction 
structure and terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive 
rating in a manner that would have affected the rating. For further 
information please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the 
respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this credit rating action, 
and whose ratings may change as a result of this credit rating action, 
the associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.

MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors. It would be reckless and inappropriate for retail investors to use MOODY’S credit ratings or publications when making an investment decision.

Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

Approximately $729 Million of Structured Securities Affected


New York, December 21, 2016 -- Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) has affirmed ratings of ten classes 
in GS Mortgage Securities Trust 2015-GC28 Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through 
Certificates as follows: 




Cl. A-1, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously on Feb

Cl. X-B, Affirmed Aa3 (sf); previously on Feb

RATINGS RATIONALE




The ratings on the P&I classes were affirmed because the transaction's 
key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value (LTV) 
ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and the 
transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), are within acceptable 
ranges.




The ratings on the IO classes were affirmed because the credit performance 
(or the weighted average rating factor or WARF) of the referenced classes 
is consistent with Moody's expectations.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 5.0% 
of the current balance compared to 4.8% at Moody's 
last review. Moody's base expected loss plus realized losses is 
now 4.9% of the original pooled balance, compared 
to 4.7% at the last review. Moody's provides 
a current list of base expected losses for conduit and fusion CMBS transactions 
on moodys.com at http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255. 







FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.




Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The principal methodology used in these ratings was "Approach to Rating 
US and Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014. 
Please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




DESCRIPTION OF MODELS USED




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, 
which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit 
enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, 
Moody's actual and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property 
quality grade (which reflects the capitalization rate Moody's uses 
to estimate Moody's value). Moody's fuses the conduit 
results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured 
credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents 10% 
or greater of the current pool balance. 




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan 
sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. 
Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, 
including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 31, 
unchanged from Moody's last review.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the November 12, 2016 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by 1% to $903 
million from $914 million at securitization. The certificates 
are collateralized by 74 mortgage loans ranging in size from less than 
1% to 12% of the pool, with the top ten loans (excluding 
defeasance) constituting 41% of the pool. The pool contains 
no loans with investment-grade structured credit assessments and 
no defeased loans.




Six loans, constituting 8% of the pool, are on the 
master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes loans 
that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part of the 
CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As part 
of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency 
reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that 
could affect performance.




Moody's received full year 2015 operating results for 93% of the 
pool, and partial year 2016 operating results for 86% of 
the pool. Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 113%, 
unchanged from Moody's last review. Moody's conduit 
component excludes loans with structured credit assessments, defeased 
and CTL loans, and specially serviced and troubled loans. 
Moody's net cash flow (NCF) reflects a weighted average haircut 
of 15.3% to the most recently available net operating income 
(NOI). Moody's value reflects a weighted average capitalization 
rate of 10.1%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.70X and 0.97X, 
unchanged from the last review. Moody's actual DSCR is based 
on Moody's NCF and the loan's actual debt service. 
Moody's stressed DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and a 9.25% 
stress rate the agency applied to the loan balance.




The top three performing conduit loans represent 22% of the pool 
balance. The largest loan is the Airport Technology Park Loan ($109 
million -- 12% of the pool), which is secured by a 1,030,000 
square foot office complex located in Salt Lake City, Utah, 
near Salt Lake International Airport. The property was 96% 
leased as of September 2016, unchanged from at securitization. 
Two tenants together lease all of the occupied space at the property. 
Moody's incorporated a lit/dark analysis to account for the concentrated 
rent roll. The loan is interest-only through the term. 
Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 103% and 1.15X,unchanged 
from the prior review.




The second largest loan is the Discovery Corporate Center Loan ($50 
million -- 6% of the pool). The loan is secured by 
a 228,0000 square foot office property in San Diego, California. 
The Class A property was completed in 2007, includes R&D space, 
and is located within the master-planned community of Rancho San 
Bernardo, approximately 24 miles north of downtown San Diego. 
The property is 93% leased to a single tenant, Broadcom Corp., 
whose lease is set to expire in just over two years, in January 
2019. After securitization, Broadcom was acquired by Avago 
Technologies, which precipitated the downgrade and subsequent withdrawal 
by Moody's of the Broadcom Corp. senior unsecured ratings. 
Moody's incorporated a lit/dark analysis to account for the single-tenant 
exposure. Moody's has reduced its lit renewal probability 
for the single tenant. The loan is interest-only through 
the term. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 129% and 0.93X, 
respectively, compared to 117% and 1.00X at the last 
review.




The third largest loan is the Campus Marketplace Loan ($41 million 
-- 5% of the pool). The loan is secured by a 144,000 
square foot grocery anchored retail center located in San Marcos, 
California, approximately 35 miles north of downtown San Diego. 
The property was 100% leased as of December 2015. The loan 
is interest-only through the term. Moody's LTV and stressed 
DSCR are 122% and 0.80X, unchanged from the prior 
review.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the credit rating action on the support provider and in relation to 
each particular credit rating action for securities that derive their 
credit ratings from the support provider's credit rating. 
For provisional ratings, this announcement provides certain regulatory 
disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned, and 
in relation to a definitive rating that may be assigned subsequent to 
the final issuance of the debt, in each case where the transaction 
structure and terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive 
rating in a manner that would have affected the rating. For further 
information please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the 
respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this credit rating action, 
and whose ratings may change as a result of this credit rating action, 
the associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.


Please see www.moodys.com for any updates on changes to 
the lead rating analyst and to the Moody's legal entity that has issued 
the rating.


Please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page on www.moodys.com 
for additional regulatory disclosures for each credit rating.

NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE ACCURACY, TIMELINESS, COMPLETENESS, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OF ANY SUCH RATING OR OTHER OPINION OR INFORMATION IS GIVEN OR MADE BY MOODY’S IN ANY FORM OR MANNER WHATSOEVER. Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable). This document is intended to be provided only to “wholesale clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. By continuing to access this document from within Australia, you represent to MOODY’S that you are, or are accessing the document as a representative of, a “wholesale client” and that neither you nor the entity you represent will directly or indirectly disseminate this document or its contents to “retail clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors. It would be reckless and inappropriate for retail investors to use MOODY’S credit ratings or publications when making an investment decision.

Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

	(1) Data in this table was calculated by allocating pro-rata the current loan information to the properties based upon the Cut-Off Date balance of each property as disclosed in the offering document. The Scheduled Balance Totals reflect the aggregate balances of all pooled loans as reported in the CREFC Loan Periodic Update File. To the extent that the Scheduled Balance Total figure for the “State” and “Property” stratification tables is not equal to the sum of the scheduled balance figures for each state or property, the difference is explained by loans that have been modified into a split loan structure. The “State” and “Property” stratification tables do not include the balance of the subordinate note (sometimes called the B-piece or a “hope note”) of a loan that has been modified into a split-loan structure. Rather, the scheduled balance for each state or property only reflects the balance of the senior note (sometimes called the A-piece) of a loan that has been modified into a split-loan structure.






























	(2) Anticipated Remaining Term and WAM are each calculated based upon the term from the current month to the earlier of the Anticipated Repayment Date, if applicable, and the Maturity Date.
































	(3) Debt Service Coverage Ratios are updated periodically as new NOI figures become available from borrowers on an asset level. As NCF DSCRs are reported in the Loan Periodic File, the most current NCF DSCR is used in the stratification section of this report. If no updated NCF DSCRs are reported, the most current NOI DSCR is used. If no updated DSCR information is provided, then information from the offering document is used. If the DSCRs reported by the Master Servicer are based on a period of less than 12 months, they are normalized based on the Most Recent Financial as of Start and End Dates reported in the Loan Periodic File. The DSCR information was provided to the Certificate Administrator by the Master Servicer and the Certificate Administrator has not independently confirmed the accuracy of such information.
