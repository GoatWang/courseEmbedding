            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.source> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11x1gf2m6>  .

<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.rate> 4.5 .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .


If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV
License: CC-BY

2 GB gzip8 GB uncompressed

Download



The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Company[edit]




Deutsche Börse


More than 3,200 employees service customers in Europe, the United States, and Asia. Deutsche Börse has locations in Germany, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Czech Republic, and Spain, as well as representative offices in Beijing, London, Paris, Chicago, New York, Hong Kong, and Dubai.
FWB Frankfurter Wertpapierbörse (Frankfurt Stock Exchange), is one of the world's largest trading centers for securities. With a share in turnover of around 90%, it is the largest of the German stock exchanges. Deutsche Börse AG operates the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.
Deutsche Börse is the owner of Clearstream, a clearing house based in Luxembourg.
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
On 3rd May 2000, It was announced that London stock exchange would merge with Deutsche Börse, however this fell through.[4]
Since 2007 Deutsche Börse operates the joint venture Scoach with SIX Swiss Exchange to provide a European derivative trading platform.
In 2001, Deutsche Börse tried to merge with the London Stock Exchange, followed by a takeover bid in late 2004, both rejected by LSE.[5] After CEO Werner Seifert was forced to resign by the main shareholders in 2005, Deutsche Börse changed plans and entered into advanced negotiations for a merger with Euronext which would have brought two of the biggest stock exchanges in Europe into one holding. The New York Stock Exchange beat out Deutsche Börse's final bid for Euronext in 2006.
Attempted NYSE Euronext merger[edit]
On 7 December 2008, Deutsche Börse rebuffed rumors that it might join with NYSE Euronext (the company formed as a result of the merger of NYSE and Euronext) to create the world's leading stock exchange.[6] While the company claims that it pursued the matter, on 8 December 2008, it reported that talks which began on 25 November 2008, were closed without any result due to differences in valuation of the company.[7]
Deutsche Börse had also considered the acquisition again in 2009.
On 9 February 2011, reports suggested that NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse were in advanced talks about an all-stock merger.[8] Deutsche Börse was in advanced talks to buy NYSE Euronext in a deal that would create the world's largest trading powerhouse. The shares of both companies were temporarily frozen on the news due to the risk of large price movements and clarifications of the deal. A successful deal would see the new company becoming the world's largest stock exchange operator with a market capitalisation of listed companies equal to US$15 trillion, US$13.39 trillion of which is part of the much larger NYSE Euronext, which is approximately six times the size of Deutsche Börse.
President and deputy CEO of NYSE Euronext Dominique Cerutti would become the new company's president and head of commercial and internal technology. Roland Bellegarde, also of NYSE Euronext, would become the head of European cash equities. The new company would potentially have 300 million euros (US$410 million) in cost savings. However, the merger would be subject to review in both the United States and European Union under concerns it could create a "de facto monopoly".[9] NYSE Euronext shareholders approved the Deutsche Börse’s all-stock deal on 7 July 2011,[10] and Deutsche Börse shareholders had accepted the deal by 15 July 2011.[11]
On 22 December 2011, Deutsche Boerse won U.S. antitrust approval to buy NYSE Euronext, on the condition that a Deutsche Börse subsidiary, the International Securities Exchange, divest its 31.5% interest in Direct Edge.[12] NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse AG delayed the deadline for completing their merger until 31 March 2012, as the exchange operators try to persuade European regulators to approve the deal.[13]
The European Commission blocked the merger on 1 February 2012, citing the fact that the merged company would have a near monopoly.[14] This measure taken by the EC is the fourth blocking in over a decade.[15] The commission rejected the merger on antitrust grounds, saying the combined businesses would dominate Europe's on-exchange derivatives trading with an estimated 93% market share. "This is a black day for Europe and its global competitiveness on financial markets", said former Deutsche Börse chief executive Reto Francioni. NYSE Euronext chairman Jan-Michiel Hessels said: "While we are disappointed and strongly disagree with the EU decision, which is based on a fundamentally different understanding of the derivatives market, it is now time to move on".[16]
Failed merger with London Stock Exchange Group[edit]
In March 2016, the company announced it had reached an agreement with London Stock Exchange Group to merge.[17] The companies will be brought under a new holding company, UK TopCo, and will retain both headquarters in London and Frankfurt. The deal needs approval from regulators in the European Union, the U.S. and Russia. The London Stock Exchange said Russian approval was needed because it owns Exactpro, a firm with offices in Russia specializing in quality assurance for exchanges and financial organizations.[18] The European Commission opened in-depth investigation into proposed Deutsche Börse/LSEG merger on 28 September 2016.[19] The European Commission delayed its decision on the deal by 15 working days to 6 March 2017. LSEG plans to hive off the French half of its LCH SA arm in a bid to ease EU concerns about the deal although the companies have not formally submitted any concessions to the Commission.[20] In February 2017, the Commission required that the parties commit to the divestment of LSEG's majority stake in fixed-income sovereign bond trading platform MTS S.p.A. LSEG stated it wouldn't sell MTS in Italy to appease anti-trust concerns.[21] The planned merger between the two exchanges, which was estimated to create the largest exchange in Europe, was subsequently described as "at risk" by the Wall Street Journal.[22] The merger attempt was blocked by EU Competition Regulator on 29 March 2017 stating that "The Commission's investigation concluded the merger would have created a de facto monopoly in the markets for clearing fixed income instruments".[23]
Art collection[edit]
Deutsche Börse Group is a major sponsor of contemporary photography. In 1999, the Group established the Art Collection Deutsche Börse, which today comprises more than 900 mostly large size works from around 90 international artists. In 2005, the stock exchange became the sponsor of the annually awarded Deutsche Börse Photography Prize of the Photographers' Gallery in London, which was started up in 1996 by the gallery, to promote the best work by contemporary photographers.
Charity involvement[edit]
Deutsche Börse Group have participated in and sponsored many events, including Futures For Kids Annual Football Tournament (held in the Docklands, England). The event raised £2,600,000.00 for charity and included firms such as Marex Spectron, Trading Technologies, Futex, Oak Futures and the LME.[24]

LSEG stated it wouldn't sell MTS in Italy to appease anti-trust concerns.[21] The planned merger between the two exchanges, which was estimated to create the largest exchange in Europe, was subsequently described as "at risk" by the Wall Street Journal.[22] The merger attempt was blocked by EU Competition Regulator on 29 March 2017 stating that "The Commission's investigation concluded the merger would have created a de facto monopoly in the markets for clearing fixed income instruments".[23]
Art collection[edit]
Deutsche Börse Group is a major sponsor of contemporary photography. In 1999, the Group established the Art Collection Deutsche Börse, which today comprises more than 900 mostly large size works from around 90 international artists. In 2005, the stock exchange became the sponsor of the annually awarded Deutsche Börse Photography Prize of the Photographers' Gallery in London, which was started up in 1996 by the gallery, to promote the best work by contemporary photographers.
Charity involvement[edit]
Deutsche Börse Group have participated in and sponsored many events, including Futures For Kids Annual Football Tournament (held in the Docklands, England). The event raised £2,600,000.00 for charity and included firms such as Marex Spectron, Trading Technologies, Futex, Oak Futures and the LME.[24]

Company[edit]




Deutsche Börse


More than 3,200 employees service customers in Europe, the United States, and Asia. Deutsche Börse has locations in Germany, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Czech Republic, and Spain, as well as representative offices in Beijing, London, Paris, Chicago, New York, Hong Kong, and Dubai.
FWB Frankfurter Wertpapierbörse (Frankfurt Stock Exchange), is one of the world's largest trading centers for securities. With a share in turnover of around 90%, it is the largest of the German stock exchanges. Deutsche Börse AG operates the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.
Deutsche Börse is the owner of Clearstream, a clearing house based in Luxembourg.
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
On 3rd May 2000, It was announced that London stock exchange would merge with Deutsche Börse, however this fell through.[4]
Since 2007 Deutsche Börse operates the joint venture Scoach with SIX Swiss Exchange to provide a European derivative trading platform.
In 2001, Deutsche Börse tried to merge with the London Stock Exchange, followed by a takeover bid in late 2004, both rejected by LSE.[5] After CEO Werner Seifert was forced to resign by the main shareholders in 2005, Deutsche Börse changed plans and entered into advanced negotiations for a merger with Euronext which would have brought two of the biggest stock exchanges in Europe into one holding. The New York Stock Exchange beat out Deutsche Börse's final bid for Euronext in 2006.
Attempted NYSE Euronext merger[edit]
On 7 December 2008, Deutsche Börse rebuffed rumors that it might join with NYSE Euronext (the company formed as a result of the merger of NYSE and Euronext) to create the world's leading stock exchange.[6] While the company claims that it pursued the matter, on 8 December 2008, it reported that talks which began on 25 November 2008, were closed without any result due to differences in valuation of the company.[7]
Deutsche Börse had also considered the acquisition again in 2009.
On 9 February 2011, reports suggested that NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse were in advanced talks about an all-stock merger.[8] Deutsche Börse was in advanced talks to buy NYSE Euronext in a deal that would create the world's largest trading powerhouse. The shares of both companies were temporarily frozen on the news due to the risk of large price movements and clarifications of the deal. A successful deal would see the new company becoming the world's largest stock exchange operator with a market capitalisation of listed companies equal to US$15 trillion, US$13.39 trillion of which is part of the much larger NYSE Euronext, which is approximately six times the size of Deutsche Börse.
President and deputy CEO of NYSE Euronext Dominique Cerutti would become the new company's president and head of commercial and internal technology. Roland Bellegarde, also of NYSE Euronext, would become the head of European cash equities. The new company would potentially have 300 million euros (US$410 million) in cost savings. However, the merger would be subject to review in both the United States and European Union under concerns it could create a "de facto monopoly".[9] NYSE Euronext shareholders approved the Deutsche Börse’s all-stock deal on 7 July 2011,[10] and Deutsche Börse shareholders had accepted the deal by 15 July 2011.[11]
On 22 December 2011, Deutsche Boerse won U.S. antitrust approval to buy NYSE Euronext, on the condition that a Deutsche Börse subsidiary, the International Securities Exchange, divest its 31.5% interest in Direct Edge.[12] NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse AG delayed the deadline for completing their merger until 31 March 2012, as the exchange operators try to persuade European regulators to approve the deal.[13]
The European Commission blocked the merger on 1 February 2012, citing the fact that the merged company would have a near monopoly.[14] This measure taken by the EC is the fourth blocking in over a decade.[15] The commission rejected the merger on antitrust grounds, saying the combined businesses would dominate Europe's on-exchange derivatives trading with an estimated 93% market share. "This is a black day for Europe and its global competitiveness on financial markets", said former Deutsche Börse chief executive Reto Francioni. NYSE Euronext chairman Jan-Michiel Hessels said: "While we are disappointed and strongly disagree with the EU decision, which is based on a fundamentally different understanding of the derivatives market, it is now time to move on".[16]
Failed merger with London Stock Exchange Group[edit]
In March 2016, the company announced it had reached an agreement with London Stock Exchange Group to merge.[17] The companies will be brought under a new holding company, UK TopCo, and will retain both headquarters in London and Frankfurt. The deal needs approval from regulators in the European Union, the U.S. and Russia. The London Stock Exchange said Russian approval was needed because it owns Exactpro, a firm with offices in Russia specializing in quality assurance for exchanges and financial organizations.[18] The European Commission opened in-depth investigation into proposed Deutsche Börse/LSEG merger on 28 September 2016.[19] The European Commission delayed its decision on the deal by 15 working days to 6 March 2017. LSEG plans to hive off the French half of its LCH SA arm in a bid to ease EU concerns about the deal although the companies have not formally submitted any concessions to the Commission.[20] In February 2017, the Commission required that the parties commit to the divestment of LSEG's majority stake in fixed-income sovereign bond trading platform MTS S.p.A. LSEG stated it wouldn't sell MTS in Italy to appease anti-trust concerns.[21] The planned merger between the two exchanges, which was estimated to create the largest exchange in Europe, was subsequently described as "at risk" by the Wall Street Journal.[22] The merger attempt was blocked by EU Competition Regulator on 29 March 2017 stating that "The Commission's investigation concluded the merger would have created a de facto monopoly in the markets for clearing fixed income instruments".[23]
Art collection[edit]
Deutsche Börse Group is a major sponsor of contemporary photography. In 1999, the Group established the Art Collection Deutsche Börse, which today comprises more than 900 mostly large size works from around 90 international artists. In 2005, the stock exchange became the sponsor of the annually awarded Deutsche Börse Photography Prize of the Photographers' Gallery in London, which was started up in 1996 by the gallery, to promote the best work by contemporary photographers.
Charity involvement[edit]
Deutsche Börse Group have participated in and sponsored many events, including Futures For Kids Annual Football Tournament (held in the Docklands, England). The event raised £2,600,000.00 for charity and included firms such as Marex Spectron, Trading Technologies, Futex, Oak Futures and the LME.[24]

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Moving to the cloud with confidence—Deutsche Börse Group chooses Office 365 
By Ron Markezich, on March 6, 2017June 28, 2017 |

Today’s post was written by Ron Markezich, corporate vice president for Microsoft.



Exciting news for global financial services providers in highly regulated countries looking to modernize their business operations with a move to the cloud: Deutsche Börse Group (DBG) is taking a thought leadership approach to digital transformation by moving to Office 365 to digitally transform the way they work. Based in Frankfurt, DBG is a leading stock exchange in Germany and one of the largest exchange organizations worldwide, with offices in more than 20 locations.
To drive business agility in a digital world, DBG chose Microsoft Office 365 as the foundation for a digital transformation to enhance their ability to grow with the demands of the market, and make their employees more productive.
According to Frank Fischer, chief security officer and head of security of Deutsche Börse Group:
“Microsoft satisfied DBG’s concerns about how it controls access to data and change management of automated processes, and did so through a deep examination of the features, such as Customer Lockbox and the capabilities of Office 365. We were also impressed by Microsoft’s transparency, audit measures, regulatory compliance support and overall willingness to meet our needs—performed as part of Microsoft’s Financial Services Compliance Program.” 
Microsoft’s innovative approach to helping our customers move to the Microsoft Cloud, while also meeting their regulatory obligations, including our Financial Services Compliance Program, gave DBG confidence in this move. Following our work with DBG, and by adapting our contract terms, Microsoft is in a great position to address industry regulations for all global financial services customers. Germany is one of the most sophisticated regulatory systems in Europe, and having Microsoft Cloud customers in Germany shows how robust Office 365 is in meeting financial regulatory obligations.
—Ron Markezich

As an operator of a highly regulated financial market infrastructure, close communication and exchange of information with political and regulatory authorities is vital to Deutsche Börse Group. Above all, our joint interest lies in efficient, transparent and secure financial markets.New regulatory website onlineHave a look at our newly released DBG Regulation website with detailed information on regulatory dossiers/topics and DBG’s regulatory service offering.
As a company, we therefore focus not only on current market developments but closely follow the political discussions on national and European financial market regulation as well as global regulatory trends. Based on our specific knowledge as a market venue operator, we contribute our expertise to the discussion on the development of the regulatory framework and thereby continuously add to the strengthening of the financial market infrastructure.We are, for example, involved in consultations on political as well as regulatory initiatives and present reports and position papers on the implications of certain regulatory proposals for Deutsche Börse Group, our clients, the financial market and society as a whole.In addition, our white papers and studies contribute to a better understanding of a broad range of financial market regulatory aspects.In specialist events and through our participation in expert committees and associations we also pursue an exchange of information and experience with political and regulatory representatives and advocate effective regulation that meets the objective of establishing efficient, transparent and stable financial markets.With our offices in Berlin and Brussels, our representatives are present where political decisions are made and can engage in a dialogue with politicians, members of organisations and other relevant stakeholders.Further informationPublicationsContact personAdditional InformationSecondary NavigationAbout usDeutsche Börse Group
