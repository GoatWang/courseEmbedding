Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

The 20-million square foot plant will initially employ 3,000 people, but Walker and Foxconn (FXCOF) said the company ultimately may employ 13,000 people at the site.

Pressed by President Donald Trump, Apple Inc. (AAPL) suddenly faces new pressure to build factories in the U.S, something it hasn't done for years and has shown no signs of wanting to do. Trump's statement that Apple plans to build three big plants in the U.S. has rekindled scrutiny of the company's policy of outsourcing of almost all of its manufacturing to contractor factories overseas-- mainly in China. Trump had needled the iPhone maker over that issue during the 2016 presidential...

The abrupt retreat for the tech-centric gauge came as the other main equity benchmarks pared an earlier advance.

(NFLX), and Alphabet, the parent company of Google.

Pressed by President Donald Trump, Apple Inc. (AAPL) suddenly faces new pressure to build factories in the U.S, something it hasn't done for years and has shown no signs of wanting to do. Trump's statement that Apple plans to build three big plants in the U.S. has rekindled scrutiny of the company's policy of outsourcing of almost all of its manufacturing to contractor factories overseas-- mainly in China. Trump had needled the iPhone maker over that issue during the 2016 presidential...
