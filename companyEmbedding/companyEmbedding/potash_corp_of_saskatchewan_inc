WhoWhatWhyWhereWhenHow 




Who we are


PotashCorp is the world’s largest fertilizer company by capacity, producing potash (K), nitrogen (N) and phosphate (P). These primary crop nutrients are vital to maintaining healthy and productive soils.
Our Canadian potash operations – the primary focus and namesake of our company – represent more than one-fifth of global capacity. To enhance our global footprint, we also have investments in four potash-related businesses in South America, the Middle East and Asia.
With operations and business interests in seven countries, PotashCorp is an international enterprise and a key player in helping to feed the world.

What we produce


Our potash, phosphate and nitrogen products help provide the primary  nutrients that crops need. They are also used to make livestock feeds and  industrial goods.
Produced from mineral deposits (potash and phosphate) and from the air we  breathe (nitrogen), our main products are:

potash, in standard and granular grades
DAP (diammonium phosphate), MAP (monoammonium phosphate) and phosphoric acid
Ammonia and urea

Why fertilizer?


With world population rising, arable land per person diminishing and demand increasing for higher quality diets that include more fruits and vegetables and protein from crop-fed livestock, the need to maximize the efficiency of farmland has never been greater.
Every crop harvested removes nutrients from the soil, which must be replaced to keep soil healthy and productive. Responsible for more than 40 percent of the world’s total crop yield, fertilizers feed plants, which help to feed animals and people.

Where we serve


Our products serve customers throughout the global marketplace — from China, the world’s most populous nation and largest fertilizer consumer, to India, with its 1.2 billion people. From Latin America — an agricultural superpower — to the rice and oil palm producing fields of Other Asian countries and the breadbasket markets of North America.
Together these five regions account for nearly three-quarters of the world’s population and roughly 80 percent of the total fertilizer consumption.

Delivering when we're needed


As the world’s food challenges become more pressing, we’re taking an  active role in meeting them, investing heavily in our assets to deliver quality  product when and where our customers need it.
We are adding to our current potash capacity without building a new mine – an  advantage as demand is expected to rise. And through our partnerships and  investments, we strive to better serve customers in emerging markets.

How we do business


We hold ourselves to the highest business standards and consider factors beyond financial performance when evaluating our success.
Guided by our Core Values, we cultivate mutually beneficial relationships with our communities, customers, employees, investors and other people critical to our success. Acting with a long-term view, we make decisions that consider people and the planet, always looking for opportunities to improve.

The Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan, also known as PotashCorp, is a Canadian corporation based in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. The company is the world's largest potash producer and the third largest producer of nitrogen and phosphate, three primary crop nutrients used to produce fertilizer. At the end of 2011, the company controlled twenty percent of the world's potash production capacity, two percent of nitrogen production capacity and five percent of phosphate supply.[4] The company is part-owner of Canpotex, which manages all potash exporting from Saskatchewan.[5] It also has a joint-venture with Sinochem named Sinofert. In late 2013, it was 60%-owned by institutional shareholders.[6] In 2007, the CEO, William Doyle was by far the highest earning CEO in Canada, earning over $320 million.[7]

History[edit]
The company was created by the government of Saskatchewan in 1975. In 1989 it became a publicly traded company as the government of Saskatchewan sold off some of its shares, selling the remaining shares in 1990.[8]
The Saskatchewan potash industry began in the 1950s and 1960s. The government saw it as a promising new field and granted large subsidies to the new projects, mainly by American companies. However, this led to overproduction and when a global potash glut began in the late 1960s the industry almost collapsed. The Liberal government of the province introduced an emergency plan setting up quotas and a price floor in 1969. This plan was popular among the companies, which could now charge monopoly prices. The NDP government that was elected in 1971 in Saskatchewan was dissatisfied with this plan as the huge profits went to the companies rather than the government, and it wasn't sustainable in the long term. In 1974 the government passed a new potash regulation scheme, that included a reserve tax. This plan was resisted by the potash producers, and its constitutionality was challenged. Thus in 1975 the provincial government established the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan as a government crown corporation.[9]
In November 1975 the province announced its intention to take part of the potash industry into public ownership. The government offered to negotiate with the producers, and many of them agreed to sell to the government. Over the next several years PCS bought mines around Saskatchewan, and eventually came to control 40% of domestic production. Public ownership drew the ire of the United States government, which criticised the provincial government for buying Americans' assets and creating a monopoly. In the 1980s the Commerce Department accused the corporation of dumping and imposed massive duties on all potash imports to the United States.[citation needed]
In the early 1980s the company struggled and lost money for several years accumulating an $800 million debt. In 1989 the Conservative government decided to privatize it by selling the company to private investors. During the 1990s PotashCorp expanded by buying up a number of American potash companies including Potash Company of America, Florida Favorite Fertilizer, Texasgulf, and Arcadian Corporation. Today it owns assets across Canada, the United States, and also in Brazil and the Middle East. By March 2008, due to rising potash prices it had become one of the most valuable companies in Canada by market capitalization, valued at almost C$63 billion.
In August 2010, PotashCorp became the subject of a hostile takeover bid by Anglo-Australian mining giant BHP Billiton.[10][11] On November 3, 2010, The Government of Canada announced that it was blocking the BHP bid as it did not feel the purchase would yield a "net benefit" for Canada;[12] BHP withdrew its bid soon thereafter.[13]
On April 6, 2014, the PotashCorp Board of Directors announced the selection of Jochen Tilk as the new President and CEO effective July 1, 2014. He succeeds Bill Doyle who has been President and CEO since 1999.
In October 2013, PotashCorp reported that its potash prices had slumped 28 percent after the company’s largest rival, Uralkali, announced plans to raise output.[14]
In December 2013, PotashCorp announced its plans to lay off more than 1,000 employees 20 days prior to Christmas. The Premier of Saskatchewan, Brad Wall, wrote CEO Bill Doyle asking him to consider cutting the dividend on the stock. The dividend, in Doyle's reply, was sacrosanct.[15]
On September 12, 2016, PotashCorp announced that it had agreed to merge with the Calgary-based firm Agrium, pending government approval. The merged company, whose head office will be located in Saskatoon, will be valued at US$36 billion, and be the first-largest producer of potash and second-largest producer of nitrogen fertilizer worldwide. The deal will be structured so that 52% of the merged company is held by PotashCorp shareholders, and 48% by Agrium shareholders.[16][17] The merged company will be renamed as Nutrien.[18]
Criticism[edit]
A coalition of conservation organizations are challenging a permit issued by the North Carolina Division of Water Quality to PotashCorp's Aurora, North Carolina, phosphate mining operation, which allows the company to expand its mining operation. The mining expansion will allegedly not have a significant impact on high-quality wetlands and aquatic habitat.[19] The permit presumes that the state will write new rules that accommodate the company’s ambitions.[citation needed]
A group of community members in Penobsquis, New Brunswick, where PotashCorp has existing and planned potash mines, has launched an action against the mine for damages relating to lost wells, subsidence, noise, light and dust pollution as well as anxiety. This action is being handled through the New Brunswick Mining Commissioner.[20]
In 2011, a planned sulfur melting plant facility in Morehead City, North Carolina was withdrawn after public opposition.[21][full citation needed]

The Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan, also known as PotashCorp, is a Canadian corporation based in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. The company is the world's largest potash producer and the third largest producer of nitrogen and phosphate, three primary crop nutrients used to produce fertilizer. At the end of 2011, the company controlled twenty percent of the world's potash production capacity, two percent of nitrogen production capacity and five percent of phosphate supply.[4] The company is part-owner of Canpotex, which manages all potash exporting from Saskatchewan.[5] It also has a joint-venture with Sinochem named Sinofert. In late 2013, it was 60%-owned by institutional shareholders.[6] In 2007, the CEO, William Doyle was by far the highest earning CEO in Canada, earning over $320 million.[7]

History[edit]
The company was created by the government of Saskatchewan in 1975. In 1989 it became a publicly traded company as the government of Saskatchewan sold off some of its shares, selling the remaining shares in 1990.[8]
The Saskatchewan potash industry began in the 1950s and 1960s. The government saw it as a promising new field and granted large subsidies to the new projects, mainly by American companies. However, this led to overproduction and when a global potash glut began in the late 1960s the industry almost collapsed. The Liberal government of the province introduced an emergency plan setting up quotas and a price floor in 1969. This plan was popular among the companies, which could now charge monopoly prices. The NDP government that was elected in 1971 in Saskatchewan was dissatisfied with this plan as the huge profits went to the companies rather than the government, and it wasn't sustainable in the long term. In 1974 the government passed a new potash regulation scheme, that included a reserve tax. This plan was resisted by the potash producers, and its constitutionality was challenged. Thus in 1975 the provincial government established the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan as a government crown corporation.[9]
In November 1975 the province announced its intention to take part of the potash industry into public ownership. The government offered to negotiate with the producers, and many of them agreed to sell to the government. Over the next several years PCS bought mines around Saskatchewan, and eventually came to control 40% of domestic production. Public ownership drew the ire of the United States government, which criticised the provincial government for buying Americans' assets and creating a monopoly. In the 1980s the Commerce Department accused the corporation of dumping and imposed massive duties on all potash imports to the United States.[citation needed]
In the early 1980s the company struggled and lost money for several years accumulating an $800 million debt. In 1989 the Conservative government decided to privatize it by selling the company to private investors. During the 1990s PotashCorp expanded by buying up a number of American potash companies including Potash Company of America, Florida Favorite Fertilizer, Texasgulf, and Arcadian Corporation. Today it owns assets across Canada, the United States, and also in Brazil and the Middle East. By March 2008, due to rising potash prices it had become one of the most valuable companies in Canada by market capitalization, valued at almost C$63 billion.
In August 2010, PotashCorp became the subject of a hostile takeover bid by Anglo-Australian mining giant BHP Billiton.[10][11] On November 3, 2010, The Government of Canada announced that it was blocking the BHP bid as it did not feel the purchase would yield a "net benefit" for Canada;[12] BHP withdrew its bid soon thereafter.[13]
On April 6, 2014, the PotashCorp Board of Directors announced the selection of Jochen Tilk as the new President and CEO effective July 1, 2014. He succeeds Bill Doyle who has been President and CEO since 1999.
In October 2013, PotashCorp reported that its potash prices had slumped 28 percent after the company’s largest rival, Uralkali, announced plans to raise output.[14]
In December 2013, PotashCorp announced its plans to lay off more than 1,000 employees 20 days prior to Christmas. The Premier of Saskatchewan, Brad Wall, wrote CEO Bill Doyle asking him to consider cutting the dividend on the stock. The dividend, in Doyle's reply, was sacrosanct.[15]
On September 12, 2016, PotashCorp announced that it had agreed to merge with the Calgary-based firm Agrium, pending government approval. The merged company, whose head office will be located in Saskatoon, will be valued at US$36 billion, and be the first-largest producer of potash and second-largest producer of nitrogen fertilizer worldwide. The deal will be structured so that 52% of the merged company is held by PotashCorp shareholders, and 48% by Agrium shareholders.[16][17] The merged company will be renamed as Nutrien.[18]
Criticism[edit]
A coalition of conservation organizations are challenging a permit issued by the North Carolina Division of Water Quality to PotashCorp's Aurora, North Carolina, phosphate mining operation, which allows the company to expand its mining operation. The mining expansion will allegedly not have a significant impact on high-quality wetlands and aquatic habitat.[19] The permit presumes that the state will write new rules that accommodate the company’s ambitions.[citation needed]
A group of community members in Penobsquis, New Brunswick, where PotashCorp has existing and planned potash mines, has launched an action against the mine for damages relating to lost wells, subsidence, noise, light and dust pollution as well as anxiety. This action is being handled through the New Brunswick Mining Commissioner.[20]
In 2011, a planned sulfur melting plant facility in Morehead City, North Carolina was withdrawn after public opposition.[21][full citation needed]

News from the north: Buying these commodity stocks looks like a home run

Fertilizer stocks surge to lead S&P 500 gainers as corn prices jump to 13-month high
Shares of fertilizer companies were sharply higher Monday, as a spike higher in prices for corn, which is used to develop fertilizer, helped fuel and support the gains. CF Industries Holdings Inc.'s stock  shot up 7.1% toward a three-month high, enough to make it the biggest percentage gainer in the S&P 500  index. Fellow fertilizer maker Mosaic Co.'s shares  were the second biggest S&P 500 gainer, as they ran up 6.5% to a two-month high. Helping fuel the gains, corn futures  soared over 2% to settle above $4.00 a bushel for the first time since June 2016, amid concerns over supply in the face of a drought and rising temperatures in the Great Plains region. Rising prices for corn and fertilizer could help fertilizer companies' result. Among other fertilizer companies, shares of Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc.  climbed 6.8%, also boosted by reports of an upgrade at Scotiabank, and Agrium Inc.  hiked up 7.1%. Meanwhile, CF Industries's stock was still down 4.8% year to date, while Mosaic shares had tumbled 18%, the SPDR Materials Select Sector ETF  had closed 9.9% and the S&P 500  had advanced 8.5%.

News from the north: Buying these commodity stocks looks like a home run

Fertilizer stocks surge to lead S&P 500 gainers as corn prices jump to 13-month high
Shares of fertilizer companies were sharply higher Monday, as a spike higher in prices for corn, which is used to develop fertilizer, helped fuel and support the gains. CF Industries Holdings Inc.'s stock  shot up 7.1% toward a three-month high, enough to make it the biggest percentage gainer in the S&P 500  index. Fellow fertilizer maker Mosaic Co.'s shares  were the second biggest S&P 500 gainer, as they ran up 6.5% to a two-month high. Helping fuel the gains, corn futures  soared over 2% to settle above $4.00 a bushel for the first time since June 2016, amid concerns over supply in the face of a drought and rising temperatures in the Great Plains region. Rising prices for corn and fertilizer could help fertilizer companies' result. Among other fertilizer companies, shares of Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc.  climbed 6.8%, also boosted by reports of an upgrade at Scotiabank, and Agrium Inc.  hiked up 7.1%. Meanwhile, CF Industries's stock was still down 4.8% year to date, while Mosaic shares had tumbled 18%, the SPDR Materials Select Sector ETF  had closed 9.9% and the S&P 500  had advanced 8.5%.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
