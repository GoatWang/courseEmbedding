History[edit]
Lithia Motors began in 1946 when Walt DeBoer opened a single car dealership in Ashland, Oregon. The first year the five person company sold 14 cars. In 1968, Walt's son, Sidney DeBoer, took over the business and incorporated Lithia Motors Inc. Sidney reorganized the business and in 1970 purchased a Dodge dealership in Medford. With this, Lithia’s base of operation moved to Medford and grew to a total of five stores with 19 franchises by 1990.[10]
In December 1996 the company went public, trading on the New York Stock Exchange with an IPO of $11 per share.[10] By 2003, Lithia had revenues of $2.5 billion from its 84 dealerships while employing just over 5,500 people.[11] The company had increased dealerships to 88 by 2005.[12] Lithia was fined $500,000 by the state of Alaska in 2006 for charging car buyers illegal document preparation fees at their Alaska dealerships.[13] That year they also settled with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for workplace discrimination.[14] In early 2007 began plans to build a 60-acre (240,000 m2) auto mall north of downtown Medford and to build a new corporate headquarters in downtown Medford. The Chrysler Jeep Dodge store moved to the auto mall in September 2007 but the project was put on hold for seven years because the recession hit shortly after. In late 2014, Lithia moved their Honda, Nissan, BMW, and Volkswagen stores to the auto mall. The group's Toyota store, which the group had planned to move to the auto mall, instead went through a $1.5 million renovation in 2013 and stayed on their 5-acre site in downtown Medford. [15] In 2010, it was reported that with the backing of two lenders, “the Commons”, a mixed-use building with Lithia Headquarters as the largest tenant, was a “go” and could proceed with construction. According to an article by The Mail Tribune, “Lithia partnered with the Medford Urban Renewal Agency to create The Commons, a revitalization project that includes the headquarters and another $14 million in infrastructure and three park blocks paid for with MURA dollars.[16] Lithia employees moved into their new headquarters in late 2012. In January, 2014 the Commons building was awarded Silver Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Certification by the U.S. Green Building Council.[17] Lithia has been the recipient of numerous awards, including Sports Illustrated's All-Star Dealer Award in 1990 and Time's Quality Dealer Award in 1997, 2016 Top Workplace-Oregon Award[18], 2016 Automotive News Best Dealerships to Work For[19] and 2016 Fortune 500-40th Fastest Growing Company.[20]




Headquarters in Medford, Oregon


As of January, 2014, Lithia operated 92 stores in 13 states.[21]
With the acquisition of the DCH auto group in late 2014, Lithia expanded to 139 stores in 14 states across the US, Hawaii, and Alaska.
In September 2016, Lithia Motors partnered with Carbone Auto Group bringing the Lithia Motors, Inc. store number to 150.[22]
Product[edit]
Lithia sells new cars from General Motors, Chrysler, Toyota, Honda, BMW, Volkswagen, Mazda, and Porsche among others.[23] New cars make up 58% of auto sales, with used cars making up the other 42%.[23] Additional revenues come from auto repair at the dealerships, financing, and insurance sales.[23]
In 2013 Lithia was named No. 9 on Automotive News' list of the 125 largest U.S. dealership groups, with retail new-vehicle sales of 56,960 units in 2012. In used-vehicle sales it also ranks No. 9, with retail used-vehicle sales of 49,067 in 2012.[24]
The company received a Global Automotive Shareholder Value Awards presented by PwC and Automotive News in 2015 the sixth consecutive year for Lithia, followed by a three-year award in 2016[25]. The awards are given to companies to recognize the highest shareholder returns within one-year and three-year periods among Global Vehicle Manufacturers, Global Automotive Suppliers and U.S. Automotive Retailers categories.[26]
2016 New Vehicle Revenue: $4,938,436, Used Vehicle Revenue: $2,226,951[27]

Community programs[edit]
Since 1946, Lithia has been dedicated to making the communities they serve better places to live, work and play. Through Lithia 4Kids, they create strategic partnerships with select not-for-profit organizations.[31] The Lithia 4Kids program believes the children within their communities are key to the future. “Educate, Advocate, Support and Strength” are the pillars of the Lithia 4Kids initiative. Lithia, DCH Auto Group, Carbone Auto Group and their stores support multiple organizations. Collaborating with their vendor partners, Lithia Motors, Inc. has contributed more than $1.4 million to the Southern Oregon University Raider Scholarship Fund.
In 2015, Lithia hosted its first Women in Leadership Conference as a way to help empower female staff members and further their professional skills in a field that has been predominantly male. Lithia flew in female managers from across the country with the goal to pursue higher advancement within the company and to inspire more females to seek careers in the industry. The conference was such a success that it became an annual event.[32]

Lithia Motors began in 1946 when Walt DeBoer opened a single car dealership in Ashland, Oregon. The first year the five person company sold 14 cars. In 1968, Walt's son, Sidney DeBoer, took over the business and incorporated Lithia Motors Inc. Sidney reorganized the business and in 1970 purchased a Dodge dealership in Medford. With this, Lithia’s base of operation moved to Medford and grew to a total of five stores with 19 franchises by 1990.[10]
In December 1996 the company went public, trading on the New York Stock Exchange with an IPO of $11 per share.[10] By 2003, Lithia had revenues of $2.5 billion from its 84 dealerships while employing just over 5,500 people.[11] The company had increased dealerships to 88 by 2005.[12] Lithia was fined $500,000 by the state of Alaska in 2006 for charging car buyers illegal document preparation fees at their Alaska dealerships.[13] That year they also settled with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for workplace discrimination.[14] In early 2007 began plans to build a 60-acre (240,000 m2) auto mall north of downtown Medford and to build a new corporate headquarters in downtown Medford. The Chrysler Jeep Dodge store moved to the auto mall in September 2007 but the project was put on hold for seven years because the recession hit shortly after. In late 2014, Lithia moved their Honda, Nissan, BMW, and Volkswagen stores to the auto mall. The group's Toyota store, which the group had planned to move to the auto mall, instead went through a $1.5 million renovation in 2013 and stayed on their 5-acre site in downtown Medford. [15] In 2010, it was reported that with the backing of two lenders, “the Commons”, a mixed-use building with Lithia Headquarters as the largest tenant, was a “go” and could proceed with construction. According to an article by The Mail Tribune, “Lithia partnered with the Medford Urban Renewal Agency to create The Commons, a revitalization project that includes the headquarters and another $14 million in infrastructure and three park blocks paid for with MURA dollars.[16] Lithia employees moved into their new headquarters in late 2012. In January, 2014 the Commons building was awarded Silver Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Certification by the U.S. Green Building Council.[17] Lithia has been the recipient of numerous awards, including Sports Illustrated's All-Star Dealer Award in 1990 and Time's Quality Dealer Award in 1997, 2016 Top Workplace-Oregon Award[18], 2016 Automotive News Best Dealerships to Work For[19] and 2016 Fortune 500-40th Fastest Growing Company.[20]




Headquarters in Medford, Oregon


As of January, 2014, Lithia operated 92 stores in 13 states.[21]
With the acquisition of the DCH auto group in late 2014, Lithia expanded to 139 stores in 14 states across the US, Hawaii, and Alaska.
In September 2016, Lithia Motors partnered with Carbone Auto Group bringing the Lithia Motors, Inc. store number to 150.[22]
Product[edit]
Lithia sells new cars from General Motors, Chrysler, Toyota, Honda, BMW, Volkswagen, Mazda, and Porsche among others.[23] New cars make up 58% of auto sales, with used cars making up the other 42%.[23] Additional revenues come from auto repair at the dealerships, financing, and insurance sales.[23]
In 2013 Lithia was named No. 9 on Automotive News' list of the 125 largest U.S. dealership groups, with retail new-vehicle sales of 56,960 units in 2012. In used-vehicle sales it also ranks No. 9, with retail used-vehicle sales of 49,067 in 2012.[24]
The company received a Global Automotive Shareholder Value Awards presented by PwC and Automotive News in 2015 the sixth consecutive year for Lithia, followed by a three-year award in 2016[25]. The awards are given to companies to recognize the highest shareholder returns within one-year and three-year periods among Global Vehicle Manufacturers, Global Automotive Suppliers and U.S. Automotive Retailers categories.[26]

Lithia, DCH Auto Group, Carbone Auto Group and their stores support multiple organizations. Collaborating with their vendor partners, Lithia Motors, Inc. has contributed more than $1.4 million to the Southern Oregon University Raider Scholarship Fund.
In 2015, Lithia hosted its first Women in Leadership Conference as a way to help empower female staff members and further their professional skills in a field that has been predominantly male. Lithia flew in female managers from across the country with the goal to pursue higher advancement within the company and to inspire more females to seek careers in the industry. The conference was such a success that it became an annual event.[32]

In January, 2014 the Commons building was awarded Silver Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Certification by the U.S. Green Building Council.[17] Lithia has been the recipient of numerous awards, including Sports Illustrated's All-Star Dealer Award in 1990 and Time's Quality Dealer Award in 1997, 2016 Top Workplace-Oregon Award[18], 2016 Automotive News Best Dealerships to Work For[19] and 2016 Fortune 500-40th Fastest Growing Company.[20]

History[edit]
Lithia Motors began in 1946 when Walt DeBoer opened a single car dealership in Ashland, Oregon. The first year the five person company sold 14 cars. In 1968, Walt's son, Sidney DeBoer, took over the business and incorporated Lithia Motors Inc. Sidney reorganized the business and in 1970 purchased a Dodge dealership in Medford. With this, Lithia’s base of operation moved to Medford and grew to a total of five stores with 19 franchises by 1990.[10]
In December 1996 the company went public, trading on the New York Stock Exchange with an IPO of $11 per share.[10] By 2003, Lithia had revenues of $2.5 billion from its 84 dealerships while employing just over 5,500 people.[11] The company had increased dealerships to 88 by 2005.[12] Lithia was fined $500,000 by the state of Alaska in 2006 for charging car buyers illegal document preparation fees at their Alaska dealerships.[13] That year they also settled with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for workplace discrimination.[14] In early 2007 began plans to build a 60-acre (240,000 m2) auto mall north of downtown Medford and to build a new corporate headquarters in downtown Medford. The Chrysler Jeep Dodge store moved to the auto mall in September 2007 but the project was put on hold for seven years because the recession hit shortly after. In late 2014, Lithia moved their Honda, Nissan, BMW, and Volkswagen stores to the auto mall. The group's Toyota store, which the group had planned to move to the auto mall, instead went through a $1.5 million renovation in 2013 and stayed on their 5-acre site in downtown Medford. [15] In 2010, it was reported that with the backing of two lenders, “the Commons”, a mixed-use building with Lithia Headquarters as the largest tenant, was a “go” and could proceed with construction. According to an article by The Mail Tribune, “Lithia partnered with the Medford Urban Renewal Agency to create The Commons, a revitalization project that includes the headquarters and another $14 million in infrastructure and three park blocks paid for with MURA dollars.[16] Lithia employees moved into their new headquarters in late 2012. In January, 2014 the Commons building was awarded Silver Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Certification by the U.S. Green Building Council.[17] Lithia has been the recipient of numerous awards, including Sports Illustrated's All-Star Dealer Award in 1990 and Time's Quality Dealer Award in 1997, 2016 Top Workplace-Oregon Award[18], 2016 Automotive News Best Dealerships to Work For[19] and 2016 Fortune 500-40th Fastest Growing Company.[20]

Following Walt's death in 1968, Walt's son Sid along with Dick Heimann, grew the business to include 5 stores and 19 franchises in Southern Oregon. In December 1996, this collection of dealerships was transformed into Lithia Motors, Inc., a publicly traded company (NYSE stock symbol-LAD). We envisioned a company that would continuously grow, provide great customer service, and opportunities for employees.TODAY Lithia is one of America's largest automotive retailers featuring most domestic and import franchises. Our stores serve urban and rural populations throughout the Western and Midwest United States. We are focused on providing customers with an honest and simpler buying and service experience. We are giving customers straightforward information so that they can make confident decisions. We believe that our local communities are our lifeblood. In addition to the employment opportunities we provide in each of our neighborhoods, we also provide contributions to charitable organizations that serve our families, friends, and customers.CONCERNSIf you have any concerns or would like to provide us with some feedback please let us know at 866.318.9660.  We look forward to hearing from you.

					Full Description



Lithia Motors, Inc. incorporated on December 23, 1968, is an operator of automotive franchises and a retailer of new and used vehicles and related services. As of February 28, 2017, it offered 30 brands of new vehicles and all brands of used vehicles in 154 stores in the United States and online at Lithia.com, DCHauto.com and CarboneCars.com. It operates through three segments: Domestic, Import and Luxury. Its Domestic segment consists of retail automotive franchises that sell new vehicles manufactured by Chrysler, General Motors and Ford. Its Import segment consists of retail automotive franchises that sell new vehicles manufactured primarily by Honda, Toyota, Subaru, Nissan and Volkswagen. Its Luxury segment consists of retail automotive franchises that sell new vehicles manufactured primarily by BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Lexus. The franchises in each segment also sell used vehicles, parts and automotive services, and automotive finance and insurance products. It sells new and used cars and replacement parts; provides vehicle maintenance, warranty, paint and repair services; arranges related financing, and sells vehicle service contracts, vehicle protection products and credit insurance. Its dealerships are located across the United States. It seeks domestic, import and luxury franchises in cities ranging from mid-sized regional markets to metropolitan markets.New VehiclesAs of February 28, 2017, the Company represented 30 domestic and imported brands ranging from economy to luxury cars, sport utility vehicles (SUVs), crossovers, minivans and light trucks. It purchases its new car inventory directly from manufacturers allocating new vehicles to stores based on availability, monthly sales levels and market area demand. Accordingly, it relies on the manufacturers to provide it with vehicles that meet consumer demand at suitable locations.Used VehiclesThe Company also sells used vehicles at each new vehicle store. As of February 28, 2017, it sold 113,498 retail used vehicles. It classifies its used vehicles in three categories: manufacturer certified pre-owned used vehicles (CPO); late model, lower-mileage vehicles (Core Product) and higher mileage, older vehicles (Value Autos). It offers CPO vehicles at its franchised dealerships. These vehicles undergo additional reconditioning and receive an extended original equipment manufacturer (OEM)-provided warranty. It acquires its used vehicles through customer trade-ins, purchases from non-Lithia stores, independent vehicle wholesalers and private parties, and at closed auctions.Vehicle Financing, Service Contracts and Other ProductsAs part of the vehicle sales process, it assists in arranging customer vehicle financing options, as well as offering extended warranties, insurance contracts and vehicle and theft protection products. It attempts to arrange financing for every vehicle it sells and offers customers financing on a same day basis. It also markets third-party extended warranty contracts, insurance contracts and vehicle and theft protection products to its customers. Extended warranty and service contracts for vehicles provide coverage for certain repairs beyond the duration or scope of the manufacturer's warranty. When customers finance an automobile purchase, it offers them life, accident and disability insurance coverage, as well as guaranteed auto protection coverage that provides protection from loss incurred by the difference in the amount owed and the amount received under an insurance claim. It receives a commission on each policy sold. It offers a lifetime lube, oil and filter (LOF) service. This service, where customers prepay for their LOF services, helps it to retain customers by building customer loyalty and provides opportunities for selling additional routine maintenance items and generating repeat service business.Service, Body and PartsThe Company provides parts and service for the new vehicle brands sold by its stores, as well as services and repairs most other makes and models. It focuses on growing its customer pay business and market its parts and service products by notifying owners when their vehicles are due for periodic service. As of December 31, 2016, it operated 22 collision repair centers: five in each Oregon and Texas; two each in Idaho, New York and Washington; and one each in Alaska, Iowa, Montana, Nevada, Vermont and Wyoming.

Within our program we offer a multitude of incentive based programs such as: no cost preventative exams, free tobacco cessation programs, low cost prescriptions. Participation in different wellness options will enable you to be eligible for discounted premiums or monetary rewards. 


Flexible Spending Accounts

Employees can elect to participate in a Health Care account or Dependent Care account using pre-tax payroll dollars resulting in a 20 – 40% savings.


Tuition Reimbursement Program
Lithia will reimburse eligible employees for completing undergraduate and graduate courses during employment. Lithia will also reimburse eligible employees for CPA testing, materials and a bonus program upon completion.

It’s more than just another job. It’s helping a family decide whether a hybrid or SUV best meets their needs. It’s using your service and repair skills to make sure that older truck is always ready for the road ahead. It’s helping a new customer find financing for the car of his or her dreams.





A little about us







Starting Up
When Walt DeBoer developed a plan to open a Chrysler-Plymouth-Dodge dealership in Ashland, Oregon, he decided to name the store after a nearby mineral spring and Lithia Motors was born. The year was 1946.


Today, Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE: LAD) is one of the largest auto retailers in the nation. Offering virtually every brand of new and used vehicle, publicly-traded Lithia has been recognized as one of the fastest growing Fortune 500 companies. Led by 3rd generation family and the best part, we’re still growing.





Moving Forward
People are the heart of our team. Every one of our divisions: Lithia Auto Stores, DCH Auto Group and Carbone Auto Group started as a humble family business designed to provide products and services to local friends and neighbors. As a blended company, we remain true to our roots.


Each one of our dealerships, store leaders and dedicated staff are empowered to partner with the people they serve, intent on “Earning Customers for Life,” they are the superstars of our company. With the benefit of Support Services, individual stores are uniquely able to respond to customer needs. The result: a stronger, more nimble organization prepared to move forward together.





Giving Back
At Lithia, we believe good corporate citizenship is a two-way street. We look for new ways to strengthen the neighborhoods where we do business and are responsive to needs of the community-lending a hand when and where it’s most needed.


We encourage our employees to donate their time and talent in ways that benefit community today and for the future, prioritizing programs that educate, advocate, support and strengthen children.


From coast-to-coast, Lithia folks are a giving group and feel volunteering is some of the most meaningful and rewarding work we do. We know actively engaged employees, loyal customers and empowered communities are a great formula for success.









OUR MISSION
Driven by our people and preferred by our customers, Lithia is the leading automotive retailer in each of our markets.

History[edit]
Lithia Motors began in 1946 when Walt DeBoer opened a single car dealership in Ashland, Oregon. The first year the five person company sold 14 cars. In 1968, Walt's son, Sidney DeBoer, took over the business and incorporated Lithia Motors Inc. Sidney reorganized the business and in 1970 purchased a Dodge dealership in Medford. With this, Lithia’s base of operation moved to Medford and grew to a total of five stores with 19 franchises by 1990.[10]
In December 1996 the company went public, trading on the New York Stock Exchange with an IPO of $11 per share.[10] By 2003, Lithia had revenues of $2.5 billion from its 84 dealerships while employing just over 5,500 people.[11] The company had increased dealerships to 88 by 2005.[12] Lithia was fined $500,000 by the state of Alaska in 2006 for charging car buyers illegal document preparation fees at their Alaska dealerships.[13] That year they also settled with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for workplace discrimination.[14] In early 2007 began plans to build a 60-acre (240,000 m2) auto mall north of downtown Medford and to build a new corporate headquarters in downtown Medford. The Chrysler Jeep Dodge store moved to the auto mall in September 2007 but the project was put on hold for seven years because the recession hit shortly after. In late 2014, Lithia moved their Honda, Nissan, BMW, and Volkswagen stores to the auto mall. The group's Toyota store, which the group had planned to move to the auto mall, instead went through a $1.5 million renovation in 2013 and stayed on their 5-acre site in downtown Medford. [15] In 2010, it was reported that with the backing of two lenders, “the Commons”, a mixed-use building with Lithia Headquarters as the largest tenant, was a “go” and could proceed with construction. According to an article by The Mail Tribune, “Lithia partnered with the Medford Urban Renewal Agency to create The Commons, a revitalization project that includes the headquarters and another $14 million in infrastructure and three park blocks paid for with MURA dollars.[16] Lithia employees moved into their new headquarters in late 2012. In January, 2014 the Commons building was awarded Silver Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Certification by the U.S. Green Building Council.[17] Lithia has been the recipient of numerous awards, including Sports Illustrated's All-Star Dealer Award in 1990 and Time's Quality Dealer Award in 1997, 2016 Top Workplace-Oregon Award[18], 2016 Automotive News Best Dealerships to Work For[19] and 2016 Fortune 500-40th Fastest Growing Company.[20]




Headquarters in Medford, Oregon


As of January, 2014, Lithia operated 92 stores in 13 states.[21]
With the acquisition of the DCH auto group in late 2014, Lithia expanded to 139 stores in 14 states across the US, Hawaii, and Alaska.
In September 2016, Lithia Motors partnered with Carbone Auto Group bringing the Lithia Motors, Inc. store number to 150.[22]
Product[edit]
Lithia sells new cars from General Motors, Chrysler, Toyota, Honda, BMW, Volkswagen, Mazda, and Porsche among others.[23] New cars make up 58% of auto sales, with used cars making up the other 42%.[23] Additional revenues come from auto repair at the dealerships, financing, and insurance sales.[23]
In 2013 Lithia was named No. 9 on Automotive News' list of the 125 largest U.S. dealership groups, with retail new-vehicle sales of 56,960 units in 2012. In used-vehicle sales it also ranks No. 9, with retail used-vehicle sales of 49,067 in 2012.[24]
The company received a Global Automotive Shareholder Value Awards presented by PwC and Automotive News in 2015 the sixth consecutive year for Lithia, followed by a three-year award in 2016[25]. The awards are given to companies to recognize the highest shareholder returns within one-year and three-year periods among Global Vehicle Manufacturers, Global Automotive Suppliers and U.S. Automotive Retailers categories.[26]
2016 New Vehicle Revenue: $4,938,436, Used Vehicle Revenue: $2,226,951[27]

In Q1 2015, the company had a net income of $36.9 million.[30]

Community programs[edit]
Since 1946, Lithia has been dedicated to making the communities they serve better places to live, work and play. Through Lithia 4Kids, they create strategic partnerships with select not-for-profit organizations.[31] The Lithia 4Kids program believes the children within their communities are key to the future. “Educate, Advocate, Support and Strength” are the pillars of the Lithia 4Kids initiative. Lithia, DCH Auto Group, Carbone Auto Group and their stores support multiple organizations. Collaborating with their vendor partners, Lithia Motors, Inc. has contributed more than $1.4 million to the Southern Oregon University Raider Scholarship Fund.
In 2015, Lithia hosted its first Women in Leadership Conference as a way to help empower female staff members and further their professional skills in a field that has been predominantly male. Lithia flew in female managers from across the country with the goal to pursue higher advancement within the company and to inspire more females to seek careers in the industry. The conference was such a success that it became an annual event.[32]

History[edit]
Lithia Motors began in 1946 when Walt DeBoer opened a single car dealership in Ashland, Oregon. The first year the five person company sold 14 cars. In 1968, Walt's son, Sidney DeBoer, took over the business and incorporated Lithia Motors Inc. Sidney reorganized the business and in 1970 purchased a Dodge dealership in Medford. With this, Lithia’s base of operation moved to Medford and grew to a total of five stores with 19 franchises by 1990.[10]
In December 1996 the company went public, trading on the New York Stock Exchange with an IPO of $11 per share.[10] By 2003, Lithia had revenues of $2.5 billion from its 84 dealerships while employing just over 5,500 people.[11] The company had increased dealerships to 88 by 2005.[12] Lithia was fined $500,000 by the state of Alaska in 2006 for charging car buyers illegal document preparation fees at their Alaska dealerships.[13] That year they also settled with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for workplace discrimination.[14] In early 2007 began plans to build a 60-acre (240,000 m2) auto mall north of downtown Medford and to build a new corporate headquarters in downtown Medford. The Chrysler Jeep Dodge store moved to the auto mall in September 2007 but the project was put on hold for seven years because the recession hit shortly after. In late 2014, Lithia moved their Honda, Nissan, BMW, and Volkswagen stores to the auto mall. The group's Toyota store, which the group had planned to move to the auto mall, instead went through a $1.5 million renovation in 2013 and stayed on their 5-acre site in downtown Medford. [15] In 2010, it was reported that with the backing of two lenders, “the Commons”, a mixed-use building with Lithia Headquarters as the largest tenant, was a “go” and could proceed with construction. According to an article by The Mail Tribune, “Lithia partnered with the Medford Urban Renewal Agency to create The Commons, a revitalization project that includes the headquarters and another $14 million in infrastructure and three park blocks paid for with MURA dollars.[16] Lithia employees moved into their new headquarters in late 2012. In January, 2014 the Commons building was awarded Silver Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Certification by the U.S. Green Building Council.[17] Lithia has been the recipient of numerous awards, including Sports Illustrated's All-Star Dealer Award in 1990 and Time's Quality Dealer Award in 1997, 2016 Top Workplace-Oregon Award[18], 2016 Automotive News Best Dealerships to Work For[19] and 2016 Fortune 500-40th Fastest Growing Company.[20]




Headquarters in Medford, Oregon


As of January, 2014, Lithia operated 92 stores in 13 states.[21]
With the acquisition of the DCH auto group in late 2014, Lithia expanded to 139 stores in 14 states across the US, Hawaii, and Alaska.
In September 2016, Lithia Motors partnered with Carbone Auto Group bringing the Lithia Motors, Inc. store number to 150.[22]
Product[edit]
Lithia sells new cars from General Motors, Chrysler, Toyota, Honda, BMW, Volkswagen, Mazda, and Porsche among others.[23] New cars make up 58% of auto sales, with used cars making up the other 42%.[23] Additional revenues come from auto repair at the dealerships, financing, and insurance sales.[23]
In 2013 Lithia was named No. 9 on Automotive News' list of the 125 largest U.S. dealership groups, with retail new-vehicle sales of 56,960 units in 2012. In used-vehicle sales it also ranks No. 9, with retail used-vehicle sales of 49,067 in 2012.[24]
The company received a Global Automotive Shareholder Value Awards presented by PwC and Automotive News in 2015 the sixth consecutive year for Lithia, followed by a three-year award in 2016[25]. The awards are given to companies to recognize the highest shareholder returns within one-year and three-year periods among Global Vehicle Manufacturers, Global Automotive Suppliers and U.S. Automotive Retailers categories.[26]
2016 New Vehicle Revenue: $4,938,436, Used Vehicle Revenue: $2,226,951[27]

Community programs[edit]
Since 1946, Lithia has been dedicated to making the communities they serve better places to live, work and play. Through Lithia 4Kids, they create strategic partnerships with select not-for-profit organizations.[31] The Lithia 4Kids program believes the children within their communities are key to the future. “Educate, Advocate, Support and Strength” are the pillars of the Lithia 4Kids initiative. Lithia, DCH Auto Group, Carbone Auto Group and their stores support multiple organizations. Collaborating with their vendor partners, Lithia Motors, Inc. has contributed more than $1.4 million to the Southern Oregon University Raider Scholarship Fund.
In 2015, Lithia hosted its first Women in Leadership Conference as a way to help empower female staff members and further their professional skills in a field that has been predominantly male. Lithia flew in female managers from across the country with the goal to pursue higher advancement within the company and to inspire more females to seek careers in the industry. The conference was such a success that it became an annual event.[32]

History[edit]
Lithia Motors began in 1946 when Walt DeBoer opened a single car dealership in Ashland, Oregon. The first year the five person company sold 14 cars. In 1968, Walt's son, Sidney DeBoer, took over the business and incorporated Lithia Motors Inc. Sidney reorganized the business and in 1970 purchased a Dodge dealership in Medford. With this, Lithia’s base of operation moved to Medford and grew to a total of five stores with 19 franchises by 1990.[10]
In December 1996 the company went public, trading on the New York Stock Exchange with an IPO of $11 per share.[10] By 2003, Lithia had revenues of $2.5 billion from its 84 dealerships while employing just over 5,500 people.[11] The company had increased dealerships to 88 by 2005.[12] Lithia was fined $500,000 by the state of Alaska in 2006 for charging car buyers illegal document preparation fees at their Alaska dealerships.[13] That year they also settled with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for workplace discrimination.[14] In early 2007 began plans to build a 60-acre (240,000 m2) auto mall north of downtown Medford and to build a new corporate headquarters in downtown Medford. The Chrysler Jeep Dodge store moved to the auto mall in September 2007 but the project was put on hold for seven years because the recession hit shortly after. In late 2014, Lithia moved their Honda, Nissan, BMW, and Volkswagen stores to the auto mall. The group's Toyota store, which the group had planned to move to the auto mall, instead went through a $1.5 million renovation in 2013 and stayed on their 5-acre site in downtown Medford. [15] In 2010, it was reported that with the backing of two lenders, “the Commons”, a mixed-use building with Lithia Headquarters as the largest tenant, was a “go” and could proceed with construction. According to an article by The Mail Tribune, “Lithia partnered with the Medford Urban Renewal Agency to create The Commons, a revitalization project that includes the headquarters and another $14 million in infrastructure and three park blocks paid for with MURA dollars.[16] Lithia employees moved into their new headquarters in late 2012. In January, 2014 the Commons building was awarded Silver Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Certification by the U.S. Green Building Council.[17] Lithia has been the recipient of numerous awards, including Sports Illustrated's All-Star Dealer Award in 1990 and Time's Quality Dealer Award in 1997, 2016 Top Workplace-Oregon Award[18], 2016 Automotive News Best Dealerships to Work For[19] and 2016 Fortune 500-40th Fastest Growing Company.[20]




Headquarters in Medford, Oregon


As of January, 2014, Lithia operated 92 stores in 13 states.[21]
With the acquisition of the DCH auto group in late 2014, Lithia expanded to 139 stores in 14 states across the US, Hawaii, and Alaska.
In September 2016, Lithia Motors partnered with Carbone Auto Group bringing the Lithia Motors, Inc. store number to 150.[22]
Product[edit]
Lithia sells new cars from General Motors, Chrysler, Toyota, Honda, BMW, Volkswagen, Mazda, and Porsche among others.[23] New cars make up 58% of auto sales, with used cars making up the other 42%.[23] Additional revenues come from auto repair at the dealerships, financing, and insurance sales.[23]
In 2013 Lithia was named No. 9 on Automotive News' list of the 125 largest U.S. dealership groups, with retail new-vehicle sales of 56,960 units in 2012. In used-vehicle sales it also ranks No. 9, with retail used-vehicle sales of 49,067 in 2012.[24]
The company received a Global Automotive Shareholder Value Awards presented by PwC and Automotive News in 2015 the sixth consecutive year for Lithia, followed by a three-year award in 2016[25]. The awards are given to companies to recognize the highest shareholder returns within one-year and three-year periods among Global Vehicle Manufacturers, Global Automotive Suppliers and U.S. Automotive Retailers categories.[26]
2016 New Vehicle Revenue: $4,938,436, Used Vehicle Revenue: $2,226,951[27]

Community programs[edit]
Since 1946, Lithia has been dedicated to making the communities they serve better places to live, work and play. Through Lithia 4Kids, they create strategic partnerships with select not-for-profit organizations.[31] The Lithia 4Kids program believes the children within their communities are key to the future. “Educate, Advocate, Support and Strength” are the pillars of the Lithia 4Kids initiative. Lithia, DCH Auto Group, Carbone Auto Group and their stores support multiple organizations. Collaborating with their vendor partners, Lithia Motors, Inc. has contributed more than $1.4 million to the Southern Oregon University Raider Scholarship Fund.
In 2015, Lithia hosted its first Women in Leadership Conference as a way to help empower female staff members and further their professional skills in a field that has been predominantly male. Lithia flew in female managers from across the country with the goal to pursue higher advancement within the company and to inspire more females to seek careers in the industry. The conference was such a success that it became an annual event.[32]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:
