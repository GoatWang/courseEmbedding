				      	Keep more of what you earn and enjoy serving clients without quotas or proprietary products.
				    





				      	Maintain your independence and own your book of business. The equity you build is yours alone.

RFG Advisory is an RIA built to support independent advisors



How RFG Advisory Supports Top Producing 
				Advisors, Serving High Net Worth Clients.

Watch the Story




"It’s a completely different culture, one that is
client-centric culture where doing the right thing by the
client is the first priority..." – Tim Banks, Independent Advisor





How RFG Advisory Supports Entrepreneurs
			and Your Business. 

Watch the Story




"I could never have jumped through all the compliance hoops and created a turn-key financial wellness solution,  that I think is pretty amazing, without RFG Advisory’s full support" – Travis Freeman, Independent Advisor










WHY CHOOSE INDEPENDENCE ?

More advisors are going independent than ever before. Why is that?
The benefits of being an independent financial advisor are many.  In addition to monetizing the value of the practice you built, independent advisors can deliver customized, client-focused support, as well as increased flexibility, and a more entrepreneurial spirit. And independent advisors who join RFG Advisory get access to an infrastructure and a support system that is already in place.  
 "Be in Business for yourself, Not By Yourself."
Bobby White, Founder
You won't have to invent the wheel but you also won't have to worry about quotas or being held to the demands of proprietary products. Instead, RFG Advisory will enable you to deliver a more wide-ranging investment portfolio for your clients. As a recent advisor who joined us said, "RFG Advisory meant going independent without the hassles of being on my own."






BENEFITS OF JOINING RFG ADVISORY'S RIA
What you get from us is a dedicated team that can help you grow your practice, access to wide-ranging investment solutions for your clients and the opportunity to keep more of the money you earn. 







+ Designed for Advisors and their families Succession Planning
+ A culture that embraces entrepreneurial thinking and practices
+ Clients are our first priority 





+ In-house Chief Investment Officer & Investment Team
+ In-house Compliance team
+ In-house marketing experts to help with branding and social media





+ Integrated technology platform to deliver efficiency & scalability into your practice

SUCCESSION PLANNING

Every advisory practice looks different and so does every succession plan.   RFG Advisory collaborated with its partners to design a succession plan that fit the entire team – founders, advisors and staff – and benefitted the client.

"RFG Advisory respects that each advisor is running an independent business.  They treat you as an independent business and are working for you.  Partnering with RFG was a win-win for my practice and all the advisors at FSWM" – Steve Wedel, Founding Partner


Shreveport, Louisiana
    Williams Financial Advisors (www.williamsfa.com)
"RFG Advisory was a great fit for our firm. We have a values-driven culture and so does RFG Advisory.  Trust, integrity, experience and putting people first is a common language we share."- Tommy Williams, President






PRACTICE TRANSITIONS

RFG Advisory has a team dedicated to your transition.  We’ve built a step-by-step process that we customize to fit your practice and is best for your clients.  Every step of the way we work with you to make your transition a success.
REPAPERING
It's a lot of paperwork.  We can help you with that. 
CLIENT RETENTION
Trust yourself.  Your clients don’t have a relationship with a firm; they have a relationship with you. We take the time to help you fully prepare your clients for the move by communicating before, during and after the transition period.
EXIT STRATEGY
Developing an exit strategy is an important first step – especially if you have a non-compete clause in place with your current employer or broker dealer. RFG Advisory and LPL will help you identify and deal with any potential legal hurdles involved with your transition, and can also provide referrals to outside legal counsel, if needed.

RFG Advisory Announces the Successful Acquisition of Williams Financial Advisors
Birmingham, Ala (July 14, 2017) Birmingham-based RFG Advisory, a high-growth wealth management firm, is pleased to announce the acquisition of a 51% interest in Williams Financial Advisors of Shreveport, Louisiana. Founded and led by 30-year industry veteran Tommy Williams, CFP®, Williams Financial Advisors is a trusted and recognized leader in personalized wealth management. “Three years ago, I formed a partnership with Bobby White and RFG as part of my succession strategy, and this transaction is an important step in that process.” Tommy stated. He went on to say, “It all comes down to trust. With RFG, I have a trusted partner with a shared value system – clients come first, deliver only valuable service and always act with upmost integrity. I look forward to continuing to lead Williams Financial Advisors and working with RFG in the years to come. I have committed to continue my role as President and Advisor for six years, which fits my life plan – and that of my colleagues very well. Most importantly, this transaction provides perpetual continuity our clients need to fulfill the financial objectives set forth for them and their families.” Williams Financial Advisors has a team of four experienced investment professionals, Tommy Williams, CFP®, Chase Crump, CFP®, MBA, Dany Martin, MBA, Steve Carney, ChFC, and a five-person dedicated professional client service team.

As part of this transaction, this future generation of leaders each became owners in the Company. “From the beginning, it was important to us that all the stakeholders had ownership,” adds Shannon Spotswood, President of RFG Advisory. “We are committed to building long-term relationships and for us that means everyone’s interests are aligned and invested in our shared future success.”
