Hops and Grain Overview
Hops and Grain is an award winning craft brewery based out of Austin, Texas. Since opening in 2011, Hops and Grain’s sustainable brewing practices and experimental beers have kept their Austin tap-room full of on-site drinkers while they continue to expand their wholesale distribution. Revenues from that Austin facility exceeded $1.9 million in 2015 and now Hops and Grain are looking to open a new location in nearby San Marcos that will help them expand their capacity from 13,000 barrels of beer to 33,000+.
To help finance that new facility, Hops and Grain is offering up to $1 million in revenue based loans on WeFunder. Investors in those loans will receive 10% of all revenues earned at the new San Marcos facility until their loan has been paid back with an additional 100% return.
I invested $100 in Hops and Grain for the reasons outlined above and described in detail below. To learn more about this new world of investment crowdfunding and how I analyze potential investments, head to krowdfund.com/invest.
Necessary legal-ese disclaimer: The views expressed in this post are my personal opinions I arrived at when deciding to invest my own personal funds in Hops and Grain. Since I am not a professional & licensed financial advisor and since I do not know your unique financial situation, none of the opinions expressed on my site should be taken as personal investment advice, nor should it be considered a solicitation for investment as I am not affiliated with Hops and Grain (although I have chosen to invest $100 in the business). You should conduct your own due diligence and/or consult a professional financial advisor before making your own decision to invest. 
Product & Market
All photo credits to Hops and Grain / WeFunder
Josh Hare opened the doors to Hops and Grain in 2011. With a focus on sustainable brewing practices, including canning (not bottling) their beers, that first east Austin location has gone on to hit nearly $2 million in annual sales and has created a lineup of beers that includes a World Beer Cup Gold Medal winner.
Although their limited production capacity has kept them from distributing widely, I’ve come across a can or two of the Pale Dog Pale Ale in my beer shop browsings and remember enjoying the balance between the crisp hops and malty backbone. But in today’s world of user generated reviews, you don’t have to take my word on the quality of the beer: Hops and Grain has averaged a score of 3.8 out of 5 on popular beer review sites Beer Advocate and Untappd. Considering my favorite local beer, the 7.2% Hop Drop ‘n Roll IPA which won a World Beer Cup Gold Medal in the super competitive American-style IPA category, scored just a 4.05 out of 5, that 3.8 average score for the entire lineup of Hops and Grain beers is pretty impressive.
Much like many of the other 4,000+ craft breweries in operation across the US, Hops and Grain sells their beer to patrons for on site consumption in a tap room, where profit margins can exceed 70%. However, according to Hops and Grain’s WeFunder investment page, 95% of their beer production gets sold to wholesale distributors, split almost evenly between draft kegs and canned beers. When distributors get involved, profit margins take a serious haircut, with Hop and Grain claiming their wholesale margins are somewhere between 4% and 8%.
It should be mentioned now that investors in Hops and Grain’s WeFunder offering will be investing only in the new San Marcos facility, or as the WeFunder page states “Separate entity, Same brand.” The new San Marcos location will be located between Austin and San Antonio and will also have a tap room, but in a town of just 50,000 (versus the 800k+ in Austin) we can assume that most of the 20,000 barrels of brewing capacity will be going out the doors to distributors. Hops and Grain’s brand recognition in Texas has allowed those distributors to get Austin-produced beers on the shelves of places like Whole Foods and Trader Joes, but as this new capacity will allow them to widen their geographic reach, Hops and Grain will surely face some stiff competition from those other 4,000+ American craft breweries I mentioned earlier.
But getting mass distribution of your brewery’s brew is the way to strike it rich in this industry. Just look at Ballast Point, the San Diego-based craft brewery that was recently purchased for one billion dollars by Corona & Model owner Constellation Brands. Unfortunately for investors considering hopping on Hop and Grain’s WeFunder offering, potential returns will be capped at just 2x your investment. More on that below, but for my product and market rating, while I think beer drinkers will always find a way to get their hands on good beer, it will still be an uphill battle for Hops and Grain to get more shelf space as they begin competing in the competitive nation-wide beer market.
My Product & Market Rating: 75
Team

Former professional triathlete Josh Hare founded Hops and Grain in 2011 after he couldn’t shake the idea to start up a craft brewery in his neighborhood of east Austin. Since then, he’s brought on other team members that have helped him continuously expand Austin’s operational capacity, revenues, and tap room crowds. While that management team will help oversee the new San Marcos location (it’s just a 45 minute or so drive after all), the new location’s success really depends on hiring and maintaining quality employees for that new location. Hops and Grain recognizes that fact and states on their WeFunder page:
“The biggest thing that we’ve found, as far as the challenges, is finding and retaining good people. We’ve got an incredible management team in place in Austin that will be able to really help communicate the culture to the employees underneath them at both facilities. That’s the most important thing in retaining staff. Knowing that we don’t have to start from scratch on a management team at the new facility will really help mitigate some of the risk.”
While that management team certainly does mitigate some of the risk, it’s still an unknown for investors. And since WeFunder investors will be reliant on the San Marcos location to return their capital, I had to reflect that uncertainty in my team rating.
My Team Rating: 65
Traction
Again, WeFunder investors will be reliant on the yet-to-open San Marcos facility to pay back their loan and return a potential profit (more details in the Terms of Offering section). If instead we could invest in the total Hops and Grain business, including the Austin location that is expected to clear $3 million in revenues in 2016, this would be a slam dunk investment.
But the new San Marcos facility will still greatly benefit from the groundwork the Austin location has achieved. With good (award winning) beer and solid distributor relationships, San Marcos has put many of the normal risks a new brewery faces behind them. Now they just need to focus on building a high quality facility and hiring good people. If they can do that, and the craft beer industry doesn’t fall off a cliff, Hops and Grain San Marcos should be able to generate the revenue needed to pay back investors.
So even though there is still a lot of work to be done to get San Marcos up and running, the traction that Hops and Grain Austin has already established factored heavily into my traction rating.
My Traction Rating: 85
Terms of Offering
So we’ve got good beer, good people, and a good history, but the terms of Hops and Grain’s crowdfund investment offering is where things went south for me. Had Hops and Grain offered a tiny sliver of equity or a smaller percentage of revenues for their entire operation, I would be much more bullish on this crowdfunding investment opportunity. Instead, Hops and Grain, LLC (the existing business in Austin) has created a new legal entity specific to the San Marcos location, Hops and Grain Production, LLC, which is who WeFunder “investors” are lending to.
WeFunder investors will provide up to $1 million in cash to help get the production facility at San Marcos up and running and in exchange for that capital investment, Hops and Grain Production will, on an annual basis beginning one year from opening, start sending 10% of all revenues derived from that San Marcos location to those investors. Once investors are paid back their initial investment and a return of 100%, the revenue loan will be paid in full and Hop and Grain’s obligation to investors will have been satisfied.
While most investment crowdfunding offerings sell an actual ownership percentage of the business to investors, there is one distinct advantage to the Revenue Based Financing that Hops and Grain Production is offering. While equity investors may have to wait years for the company to turn a profit or get acquired before receiving cash flows from their investment, Hops and Grain investors will receive ongoing cash distributions equating to 10% of the San Marcos facility’s revenues. Unfortunately, as more people invest in the offering, there will be “more mouths to feed” from that 10% slice of the revenue pie, which means it will take longer for everybody to earn their money back (plus the promised 100% return). So how long will it take to pay investors back if Hops and Grain raise the full $1 million?
CEO Josh Hare stated on the company’s WeFunder page that he expects it to take between 5 and 6 years for investors to receive their full 2x return. When I asked for San Marcos’s sales forecasts on Hops and Grain’s WeFunder page, Josh replied “At max capacity in our new facility we can generate close to $6M annually. We will be building the facility out to have max production capacity from day 1 and I anticipate that we’ll reach that maximum revenue point between years 2-3.”
If they are able to achieve AND sell through that max production capacity by year 3, Hops and Grain will have no problem returning the full 200% to investors well by year 5, regardless of how much money they end up raising. But as shown by the charts below, if sales are slow to pick up or Hops and Grain San Marcos experiences delays in opening their new facility, the length of time it time it takes to get paid back will stretch out and the rate of return investors will achieve will drop precipitously. Keep in mind that the figures shown below are my own “back of the napkin” assumptions, but they show how widely returns can vary, with “IRR” being the internal rate of return on the amount invested. IRR is a good way to analyze the average rate of return of an investment that doesn’t return its capital in one lump sum liquidity event (such as an acquisition or IPO).
My “Best Case” Scenario: Raise $1 million, no sales in Year 1 (buildout of facility), sell 50% of production capacity in Year 2, and sell 100% in Year 3 and beyond.

Based on those assumptions, it could take WeFunder investors anywhere from 4 to 7 years just to get their initial investment back and as much as ten to receive their full 100% profit. But those scenarios don’t take into account far gloomier possibilities.
What happens if we are in fact in a craft beer bubble and it pops? Or what if the San Marcos facility is a complete bust for some other reason? Hopefully that won’t be the case, but if that were to occur, investors couldn’t rely on the existing Austin operations to pay them back since that LLC is not a liable party on the loan agreement.
Instead, the only option investors would have would be to hope to sell off the assets of the San Marcos brewery (which the loan agreement grants them a security interest in). If the brewery does go belly up, I’m guessing it will be in part due to an economic environment that would be tough to sell used brewery equipment into, so investors would likely be better off just asking for the leftover inventory and having themselves a nice little going out of business party.
With that possibility in mind, a 21% return seems like a fair return given the risks involved. And while I will gladly take an 11% return on my investment and spend it on the cases of Hops and Grain beer that will surely be popping up in North Carolina by 2026, at that lower rate of return I would have been better off just sticking my money in less risky publicly traded stocks or bonds (which historically have averaged between 5% to 7% returns).
Given the variability of those returns and the risks involved, I had to score the terms of Hops and Grain’s offering pretty low.
My Terms Rating: 60
Risk Reward Profile
Given H&G Austin’s success since 2011, if Hops and Grain were offering even 3% to 5% of their entire operation (Austin and San Marcos) I would give this risk/reward rating a 90%. As it is however, investors are depending on the new San Marcos facility to open on schedule (within a year) and quickly ramp up production to get paid back and eventually make money. If any significant delays occur in construction or permitting or if Hops and Grain sees a drop in demand for any reason, it could take investors a decade or more to eventually receive the full 2x investment return they are promised.
On the other hand, if everything goes to plan and the world falls in love with Hops and Grain’s line of canned beers, equity owners of the company (mostly founders and management) will be Scrooge-McDuck-diving into their piles of gold long after the loan obligation to WeFunder investors has been paid and fully satisfied. My risk/reward score therefore reflects the fact that there is a decent amount of risk here but none of the unlimited financial upside that equity ownership offers.
My Risk Reward Rating: 65
Conclusion
With an overall score of 70, Hops and Grain still falls within the range I consider acceptable as a suitable crowdfund investment. Seeing as how I’ve always wanted to be a part owner of a brewery and since I should begin seeing some cash flows in as little as 12-24 months, I decided to add Hops and Grain to my personal investment crowdfunding portfolio with a $100 investment.

Why I Like Hops and Grain



I love Hops & Grain for so many reasons. It first starts with the beer which is delicious; the kind of delicious that brings a smile to your face. The Hops & Grain team continues to create new beers that amaze. Yet, as good as their products are; they are not the reason that Hops & Grain is a remarkable company.  As an investor, I have had first-hand exposure to how and why the Hops & Grain brand has been successful. It starts with Josh Hare, the CEO and founder who is committed to creating a culture that allows his employees to flourish. Josh embodies his company’s commitment to continually evolving. Early on, he discovered the importance of motivated employees and the power of an empowered workforce. He figured out that the more he could create an environment where his employees could make decisions; the more committed, engaged and passionate they became.    Hops & Grain is a special company for so many reasons. I love it for both what is inside the can and what that can represents.

Brewing the Best Beer in Central Texas
People love our beer, but they also love our story. And that story is about community so we're expanding our community with a new tap room in San Marcos, TX.Rather than saying, “These are our beers, enjoy it or not.” We open our doors, invite people in, and hear what they want. There are aspects of our beer that scream Austin: because it was crafted by and for the people of Austin.




















The Beginning: Beers and Bikes
I started brewing beer since before I was legally able to enjoy it—in my college dorm room.  
        Since graduation, I’ve been a professional triathlete, helped found Rogue Running, and taught 7th grade science. But I never stopped thinking about beer. In 2011, I finally scratched that itch and opened Hops & Grain.
      
























Say Hello to Our Beers
I write all of our recipes myself, but it really starts from my conversations with our customers—they tell me what flavors they've been craving or the crazy ideas they have.  Our product lineup is a reflection of our biggest fans.






78702
78702 is brewed in the style of a traditional Kolsch. This German style brew is blonde in color, bright and clear with a lasting white foam head.  It has a refreshing medium hop bitterness upfront and clean and crisp finish. 



ALT-eration
Our 2012 World Beer Cup Gold Medal winning Altbier is brewed with old world techniques, quality German malts and noble hop varieties. It undergoes a multiple temperature mashing program to make a classic upfront maltiness with a clean, crisp finish.



Greenhouse IPA
The Greenhouse is a breeding ground. Each month we'll release around 300 cases per batch and each month we'll change the hop varieties that we use for dry-hopping in order to give you a different aroma and flavor experience with every new batch. 



Porter Culture
Our Baltic Porter starts with a base of Pilsner and Munich malts and we layer in chocolate wheat and de-bittered black malt to provide flavors of coffee, dark chocolate, raisins, and just a hint of roast. A neutral yeast profile lets the malts take center stage.





A Pale Mosaic
American style IPA showcasing a fairly new hop variety called Mosaic. The beer begins with a base of German Pale Ale and we dry-hop with Mosaic, Simcoe, and Nugget to deliver a clean and complex finish with notes of pine resin, grapefruit pith, and blueberries.



Pale Dog
Pale Dog is full of malt character with a dry, crisp, and hoppy finish. We start with a base of the highest quality 2 Row malted barley and blend with a small amount of Vienna and Caramel malts to add distinct character and a mouthful of hoppiness.



The One They Call Zoe
It’s similar to old world German lagers but dry-hopped to add an extra layer of complexity. Zoe is based on pale and vienna malts, with a beautiful white layer of foam resting on top, delivering floral and citrus dry-hop aromatics with every sip.




Our First Location: Austin, TX
We didn't anticipate the overwhelming response when we started selling our beer. We, almost overnight, were completely sold out. Having lived and fallen in love with Austin, I knew it was the perfect location for us. Our customers proved that gut feeling right.
 




  
    









Growth in Austin (Separate Entity, Same Brand)
Over the past two years we've increased revenue from under $60k per month to over $200,000 per month. We've also perfected our production processes, widened margins from 33% to 78%, and fostered a community of fun-loving, quality beer fans. We plan to replicate this model with our new entity in San Marcos.

Revenue graph for location 1. San Marcos location hasn't opened yet.









Invest in Our New Location (New Entity, Same H+G Brand)
Our Austin brewery is established. We've spent five years crafting high quality local beer at a great price. Now we're ready to expand with an all new tap room in San Marcos, TX, steps from Texas State University and 30,000 beer thirsty students.





  







Join Us for a Drink
May 17th, 2016It’s an exciting time to be a small business owner and an even more exciting time to be a small business owner in the craft beer industry!  We thrive as a brewery because our customers love to hear our story. That story revolves around our community and without that strong support base we wouldn’t be where we are today.  With that commitment to community, we’re incredibly excited to be able to raise funds for the next phase of our growth through this crowdfunding platform.  Enabling anyone interested to invest in our company, not just the wealthiest investors, is incredibly gratifying and truly encapsulates our company culture.  We are committed to brewing the highest quality beer that we can and serving it fresh for our customers to enjoy.  Quality beer is what has enabled our industry to experience rapid growth and we’re confident that our commitment to quality will enable us to sustain our growth into the future.  I’m very excited for the opportunity to involve you in our business and look forward to growing our community together.
Cheers!

                  What are you building?
                  



After 5 years of rapid growth in our local market, we are setting out to build a second production facility and tasting room in San Marcos, TX with the goal of tripling our current production capacity and reaching a vibrant, fast growing market of young professionals.

We plan to carry our attention to detail, adherence to quality standards and devotion to consistency to this new facility. We’ll be building a state of the art brewery and a large tasting room and event space for private events as well as weekly hours for sampling and tours.  Our expansion to San Marcos will enable us to reach more people, introduce new products and bring our capacity from 13,000 barrels to 33,000.




                  How did you get started?
                  



My background in beer began in college as a young biology student. I attended small university that didn’t allow alcohol consumption during your tenure so my buddies and I found that you could purchase all the ingredients to make beer without being legal drinking age.  It began as more of an experiment and ultimately turned into a pretty elaborate homebrew operation.

Years later, I was just as in love with homebrewing as when I started. So I began pitching this idea of building a brewery that not only makes great beer, but markets it to this huge community of people that love to get outside, love to eat good food, and love to support local.




                  Why open up in East Austin?
                  



For the 11 years that I’ve lived in Austin I’ve always resided in East Austin. It’s a rapidly developing area that has seen a lot of changes in the 11 years that I’ve been here.  Historically the neighborhood has been rooted in 3rd, 4th, 5th generation families that really, really love their neighborhood. They like the idea of not having to drive all the way across town to go to a grocery store. You kind of have everything, it’s a self sustaining community—but it lacked a brewery. Having lived there and fallen in love with the neighborhood, it seemed like a perfect fit for a brewery.



                  What do you think a local brewery adds to the community?
                  



What I fell in love with was this romantic vision of a brewery in the middle of a neighborhood with huge vent stacks on the roof and steam coming out the top of it. The neighborhood brewery.   As major cities like Austin and Denver continue to grow in numbers and space it’s becoming more and more important to provide access to what makes our cities great without having to drive an hour to get to them.

Austin receives an incredible amount of tourism because of our reputation as such a locally committed city.  Visitors say they love the local feel of Austin. The local feel that they recognize and enjoy in Austin is being in the middle of a neighborhood and popping into a restaurant or a bar or a brewery.  So when it came to opening a brewery, there were no other options for me.




                  What makes your brand unique?
                  



The beer that we produce is one component but the story that we tell is what brings people back time and again. For us, our story is about our focus on the community.

We make beers that we believe are culturally relevant. Rather than going in and saying, “These are the beers that we like to drink, enjoy it or not.” We like to open our doors, invite people in, and hear what the community wants. There are elements of it that scream Austin.

Our product is build on quality.  Early on we made a huge investment in an onsite lab.  You can get people to drink your beer once, but if you want them to drink it twice it needs to be consistent, and it needs to be high quality and it needs to taste great. Our lab is where we ensure that quality.  At a brewery of our scale it’s unheard of to have the type of equipment that we have in our lab but I believe there’s no way you can scale a brand if you can’t make it over and over and over identical to the way that you did before, and continue to grow the quality.




                  Tell us about the beer lab.
                  



The first one is our QA/QC lab where we test shelf stability, storage stability and multiple other data points that ensure we are producing a consistent and high quality product.  We test every parameter that we can throughout our entire process.

The second lab is our pilot brewery. Inside of our facility is this small scaled down replica of our main brew house that produces 100 gallons per batch. That’s the place where we churn out all kinds of experimental beers, test out new ingredients and train new staff. We only serve those products on-site and we really involve every customer that comes into our tasting room in that process.




                  How do you choose your beers and flavors?
                  



I currently serve the role of brewmaster.  I write all of our recipes and I oversee quality management. The recipes all really start from my conversations with people.  Our product lineup is a reflection of our community.

Once we dial in the concept for a new beer, that’s when I sit down and really start to dig into specific recipe formulation from water profiles all the way down to the specific malt and hop varieties. From there every beer starts on that small pilot system. We brew multiple batches on that system testing out different things, testing out feedback from our customers, before we ever decide to scale that up and actually put it into a package.

During that trial and error process is when we start to involve our graphic designer. We involve him in the entire evolution of the brand, and the story of the brand, so that when he starts to put together those visual elements from can design, to tap handle, to inclusion into our website, it’s all consistent.




                  How had the business been doing up to now?
                  



We did not anticipate the overwhelming response that we go when we started selling out beer. Our projections showed us selling the volume that we currently sell in our 10th year. We, almost overnight, were completely sold out.

We basically doubled our production year over year for 4 straight years. Our current facility is just about maxed out on available space and capacity so we’ve started installing systems that enable us to yield a little bit more beer out of each tank.

We are in year 5 and we still have not been able to expand outside of Austin. We’re not even able to supply the demand in Austin. It’s been an incredible experience but it’s also been a stressful experience just trying to balance it out. We’ve had to say no a lot over the past year with new accounts because I believe it’s critically important that we maintain inventory at all of our current accounts. It’s been frustratingly gratifying.




                  What percent of your revenue is from the tap house v. distributors?
                  



95% of what we produce in gallons goes out to our wholesalers. Among that we’re pretty evenly split 50/50 between 6 packs of 12 oz cans and kegs for draft sales. We’ve got a really great presence in HEB, Whole Foods, Central Market, Trader Joe’s, Total Wine, Spec, all of the major chain stores here in Austin as well as almost 300 independent liquor stores and corner shops that love to showcase craft beer. We have a really great reach in the off-premise channels. Wit the on-premise side there are literally hundreds of restaurants and bars that are really committed to craft beer here in Austin and we service all of those as well.

The other 5% of volume is what we pour in our tasting room. When you look at revenue though, 25% of our annual revenue comes from our tasting room.




                  What kind of margins do you get on beer sold on site v. distribution?
                  



Our margins on the beer that goes out into the wholesale market is between 4-8%.  Kegs are a little bit higher margin because of the lower packaging cost but all around the margins are very tight when you work with a wholesaler. We have to focus on volume to maintain profitability whereas when we make it in house and serve it in house our only overhead is our labor. Our margins are in the 60-65% when we sell it on-site.

Because of our current model of selling a souvenir glass we have the cost of the glass that eats into our margins. After all is said and done our cost of goods for that $10 souvenir glass is nearly $2. Selling it by the glass and not having to sell the actual glass itself, but just the liquid, that should improve our profit margin another 10-12%.




                  Is selling beer on site or retail distribution more important to the business?
                  



We get customers that are buying our beer out in the market, and then they look up our website and see we have a tasting room and then they come to visit. We also have people that find our tasting room first, come in and then realize that we also package our beer and the next time they’re at the grocery story they pick up a six pack.  They really feed each other I think almost equally.



                  Why are you expanding and how did you choose the new location?
                  



The plan for this new expansion is to enable our current facility to keep operating at full capacity. The new facility in San Marcos will also have an on-site tasting room and production space similar to our Austin facility. San Marcos as a city is much easier from a city code perspective than Austin which also heavily factored into the decision making.

San Marcos is growing incredibly fast.  There are almost 35,000 students there and a large population of young professionals.  Because the cost of living is much cheaper than Austin, many people live there and commute into the city. We’ve been wanting to expand down into the San Antonio market, Houston, El Paso and then eventually Dallas/Ft. Worth. This second facility will enable us to service all of those new markets.

The corridor between San Antonio and Austin is connecting more closely every year. San Marcos is perfectly positioned between the 2 cities and there is a lot of commuter traffic up and down that corridor.




                  How do you think about competition?
                  



Competition is definitely ramping up in our industry, especially when you look at retail shelf space. There’s a lot of brands out there, a lot of choices, which is ultimately why people come to craft beer to begin with, because of those choices. We want to make beer that’s high quality, but it’s the beer that you have in your fridge all the time.

That’s a big differentiator for us, our focus has not just been around making the whales, as our industry calls them. We make very consistent, very high quality, very reliable beer. From a competition standpoint we own that shelf space.




                  How fast have you been growing?
                  



Last year we cleared just over $2 million in revenue and we should do $3.2 million this year. Because of our continued growth in our tasting room sales we’ve been able to continue that 75/25 revenue split each year.

With our new efficiencies in raw materials purchasing as well as new production efficiencies, we’re able to get a little bit higher margin from our wholesale revenue. This year is where we’ll see our revenue will grow over 100% but our production volume will be around 80% growth. Something that we’ll take into this new facility is building those efficiencies in from the beginning so we can realize the raw material economies of scale ordering for both facilities.




                  Have you chosen the site for the new brewery yet?
                  



We’ve been looking at a lot of properties in San Marcos and have a number of great potential sites.  We’ve already met with the local city and building offices there and have a good idea for the construction timeframe. I already know exactly how long the brewing equipment takes to fabricate and make.  Wrapping up the fundraising piece is the next step for us.



                  What are the risks and challenges?
                  



The biggest thing that we’ve found, as far as the challenges, is finding and retaining good people. We’ve got an incredible management team in place in Austin that will be able to really help communicate the culture to the employees underneath them at both facilities. That’s the most important thing in retaining staff.  Knowing that we don’t have to start from scratch on a management team at the new facility will really help mitigate some of the risk.

Construction permitting is never as easy as you would like for it to be, so that’s a challenge as well. Building in a new city will be a learning experience, but knowing, and having a great general contractor that has done work in San Marcos definitely takes some of the load off. I would say some of the biggest challenges are going to be the staffing element, and then just getting through the initial construction permitting.




                  What are the backgrounds of your teammates?
                  



Our operations manager’s background has been in farming and operations management.  Being in an industry like beer where we produce an agricultural product he’s been a huge asset in really streamlining inventory management, staffing, and the day to day production and operations. Then we have our packaging manager who came to us from the petroleum industry working in demolition and excavation and is very operations focused. He manages everything from the beer going into kegs and cans all the way downstream to wholesalers picking up from us and managing their inventory.

Our marketing manager came to us from Whole Foods. She was the marketing lead here in Austin. She’s got an incredible amount of experience both in digital marketing, and then also event marketing. She manages all of our digital channels, social media, monthly newsletter, Yelp, our Google Plus pages, all of those elements that ultimately tell our story. She also manages all of our on-site events. Our tap room manager came to us from from Boston where she had 10 years in bar management experience.

Our sales manager spends most of his time out in the field managing both the sales team with our distributors, as well as doing higher level account management with our retailers. Our tap room manager has a great staff underneath her that tells the story directly to our customers.

On the production side, having 2 people that are really focused around efficiency, and have a lot of experience in that has been huge.  Because we’re dealing with farmers and growers all over the country, and brokers in the middle, and we’re at the mercy of mother nature, having people that have worked in industries that understand that and understand how to compensate for it has been huge.




                  What are your guiding principles?
                  



Commitment to our industry, our community, and our environment. Any time we decide to do anything, be it hiring a new employee, changing raw materials suppliers, writing a new recipe, buying glassware for the tasting room, we always ask ourselves if we are going to add, or bring more, sustainability to all three of those areas with that decision.

If we can say yes, then we move forward with that exploration and that’s a huge piece of what we stand for. We use 100% wind energy, we make dog treats out of our spent brewing grains and we divert all of our solid waste away from our waste water stream. We work with a local company that uses it for compost starter. We are a recognized platinum green business leader by the city of Austin for our sustainability initiatives.

Some fine print:  1) These numbers include startups currently live on Wefunder if they pass their minimum target.  2) Some startups use two different laws at the same time (i.e., Regulation D and Regulation Crowdfunding).
