Peter Wirth is the Head of Business Development at RTI-HS and leads the business development team and activities for the entire portfolio of RTI-HS services. He applies various skills based on his 29 years of pharmaceutical industry experience. He has a wide range of experience in customer relationships, people management, sales, health economics and outcomes research, medical and drug information, marketing support, clinical trials, and product safety. He is involved in developing strategic alliances that support the needs and goals of RTI-HS clients.
Mr. Wirth is a pharmacist who began his career in 1988 working with GSK as a pharmaceutical representative in Monterey, CA. In 1992 he relocated to North Carolina and joined Ask the Pharmacist, a nationally known leader in the provision of medical and drug information services. He served as the VP of Sales and Client Operations and became responsible for operations, training, QA, HR, IT, and sales and marketing. During this time, Mr. Wirth was involved in the launch of more than 35 products, as well as several drug recall/withdrawal projects. In 1999, PPD acquired Ask the Pharmacist and Mr. Wirth was appointed as Senior Business Development Executive for PPD Market Development. He focused on selling their late-phase suite of services, which included product safety, medical writing, marketing-support programs, patient registries, postmarket studies (phase 3b/4), and medical and drug information. He also sold their risk management, health outcomes, and Rx-to-OTC switch studies. In 2004, Mr. Wirth joined Ninaza, Inc. as Director of Business Development and marketed their electronic data collection (EDC) services.

Static Control Introduces Cartridge World-Branded Printer Supplies
by   
Kathleen Wirth
 ·
            June 15, 2017





Static Control – which is said to be the largest manufacturer of aftermarket imaging systems, components and printer replacement cartridges – reports that it’s launched a new line of printer cartridges available in Cartridge World packaging.
“Static Control has been supplying its cartridge remanufacturing components to CW (Cartridge World) franchisees for close to two decades. We are excited to now also be able to offer our cartridges with the added convenience of Cartridge World branded boxes,” said Erwin Pijpers, vice president of sales for Static Control.
In April 2017, Cartridge World announced a partnership with Static Control as an approved supplier for both components and finished cartridges.
“Our partnership has grown even stronger since this year’s announcement,” said Peter Lim, Global Vice President and COO for Cartridge World. “For Static Control to be able to now also offer our branded items shows we have deep trust in their ability to provide high quality solutions to our franchisees.”
Static Control operates sales and distribution facilities worldwide. Research, development, engineering, and manufacturing as well as global distribution, are located at Static Control’s world headquarters in Sanford, North Carolina. The company manufactures more than 10,000 imaging products in-house, and offers a product catalog of more than 14,000 imaging products to the aftermarket industry.

About Peter Wirth

Senator Peter Wirth (D-Santa Fe - 25) is a third term state Senator and the newly elected Senate Majority Leader. He spent four years as a Representative in the State House from 2004 through 2008 replacing Max Coll who retired from the seat. 

Peter’s New Mexico roots go back several generations on both sides of his family. His maternal grandfather, John Gaw Meem, was one of New Mexico’s preeminent architects and first came to New Mexico in 1920 to recover from Tuberculosis. His paternal grandfather was a math teacher and camp counselor at the Los Alamos Ranch School before World War II. Peter’s late father John Wirth, a historian, took great pride in the fact that he was born in Dawson, New Mexico, now a ghost town.

When he is not working at the Legislature, Peter is a lawyer in Santa Fe. Read More...
