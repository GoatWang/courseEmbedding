The MaxLinear Difference
At MaxLinear, our drive towards excellence shows in all that we do. The end result is a sharp focus on creating technology and products that solve some of the world’s most challenging communication technology problems. It all starts with building a great, cohesive team with an exacting quality standard.
Our eight founders started MaxLinear in the Fall of 2003, with a commitment to building a great engineering company. The low-power broadband CMOS single-chip tuner they developed is at the core of groundbreaking technology that is used worldwide in  televisions and set-top boxes today. Our focus on low power technology and engineering excellence remains part of our chip design DNA.
Since those early days, our product portfolio has expanded to include complex multi-gigabit transceivers for broadband data and satellite channel stacking switches, 400 Gbps high-speed interconnect chips for datacenters and telecommunications, home networking MoCA and G.hn technology that transmits broadband data throughout your connected home, and more. We’ve come a long way since our early days, but we are still committed to solving the world’s most challenging communication technology problems. And our drive towards excellence in all we do permeates our culture from our CEO down to every last employee. Below are some of the industry-first technologies that set MaxLinear apart from the competition.













Full-Spectrum Capture: The Fastest Way to the Internet
In 2010, cable and satellite providers were searching for a technology to boost the bandwidth and increase the number of video channels they could deliver to our homes. The technology needed for scaling up bandwidth to gigabit per second levels without  paying a prohibitive penalty in size and power dissipation just did not exist yet. As our engineering team took on this challenge, Project Hercules was born. 
The core technology behind Project Hercules is called Full-Spectrum Capture. Full-Spectrum Capture digitizes, filters, processes and then outputs a high-resolution digital version of the entire cable or satellite signal spectrum. As a result, when Hercules connects to the Internet it delivers up to 1.6 Gbps of digital data. All this technology is packed into a single chip that measures only 7mm x 7mm. 
Several years after the launch of Project Hercules, millions of products based on Full-Spectrum Capture technology are deployed around the world by satellite and cable providers in multi-channel video gateways, and gigabit speed data services to customers who want to download, watch and record content on their TVs, computers, tablets and smartphones.
Staying true to our low-power roots, our Full-Spectrum Capture products consume ten times less power than traditional receivers need to process the same amount of data. Another engineering world’s first by MaxLinear.

History[edit]
Founding and growth[edit]
MaxLinear was founded in 2003[1] in Carlsbad, California[3] by "eight semiconductor industry veterans."[2] Kishore Seendripu was co-founder, and would become chairman, president, and chief executive. Among other companies, in the past Seendripu had worked on the technical staff at Broadcom.[1] Prior to 2009, the majority of the company's revenue was from the sale of its "mobile handset digital television receivers" which contained MaxLinear's digital television RF receiver chips, in Japan. The biggest customers for the product were Panasonic, Murata, and MTC[disambiguation needed]. However, in 2009, the company sold more chips for use in digital set top boxes in Europe, automotive navigation displays, and digital TVs.[2] In 2009, the company shipped 75 million chips to companies such as Panasonic and Sony,[4] with 99 percent of its sales in Asia.[2]
In November 2009, MaxLinear announced it intended to go public.[1] At the time of the IPO, MaxLinear’s venture investors included Mission Ventures in San Diego, U.S. Venture Partners, Battery Ventures and UMC Capital.[5] MaxLinear raised around $35 million in venture capital prior to the IPO, spending around half of it. By the end of 2009, the company had $17.9 million in cash.[1] That year, MaxLinear had $51.4 million in revenue and $4.3 million in profit.[1]
IPO[edit]
The company held an initial public offering on March 24, 2010[1][5] on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).[3] under the ticker symbol MXL. Initially the company expected to raise around $43 million with the IPO, with that projection later raised to $90 million after a last-minute increase in share price by the company.[5] Writes the San Diego Union-Tribune, "shares soared 34 percent on their debut. MaxLinear collected about $92 million from the offering, with its shares opening at $14 and peaking at $18.70 on the first day of trading."[1] After the debut, MaxLinear said it planned to use the proceeds for "general corporate purposes," and perhaps for acquiring competitor businesses or products.[4]
Recent[edit]
By May 2010, the company employed 135 people.[1] In May 2015, MaxLinear acquired Entropic Communications. In April 2016, MaxLinear bought Microsemi's wireless backhaul business, adding about 30 workers to its workforce. In May 2016, MaxLinear announced it would buy Broadcom's "wireless backhaul infrastructure for 80 million in cash," in what was its second acquisition for the year. In the Broadcom deal, MaxLinear took on about 120 additional employees.[3] On March 29, 2017, MaxLinear Inc. announced it would buy Exar Corporation for about $661.6 million cash.[6] As of 2017, MaxLinear is on the Multimedia over Coax Alliance board of directors as well as Arris, Broadcom, Comcast, Cox Communications, DirecTV, Echostar, Intel, and Verizon.[7]
Facilities and employees[edit]
MaxLinear is based in Carlsbad, California,[3] with research and development centers in Irvine, California, China and India.[citation needed] A "fabless" company, it uses outside chipmaking facilities, known as foundries or fabs, to manufacture its chips.[citation needed] By 2010, it used "third-party contractors in Asia for manufacturing and assembly," with all its chips made by United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) at foundries in Taiwan and Singapore.[2] As of early March 2010, the company had 177 employees, with most in R&D.[2]
Products[edit]
MaxLinear sells its products to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), module makers and original design manufacturers (ODMs).[citation needed] The San Diego Union-Tribune writes that "MaxLinear’s product is very small radio-frequency TV tuner chips — half the size of an individual dial button on the keypad of a cell phone."[4] According to Xconomy, "MaxLinear focuses on designing semiconductor chips that enable people to watch TV on devices with a wireless broadband connection."[5] The "tiny chips"[1] are further described as "high-performance radio frequency (RF) systems-on-a-chip for receiving and processing digital TV broadcasts, digital videos, and broadband data downloads," in order to "enable people to watch TV on a handheld wireless device."[2]
San Diego Union-Tribune writes that the company aims to "take over from bulky 'can' tuners in TVs and other electronics. It plans to get its chips into computers, set-top boxes, mobile phones and in-vehicle video systems."[4] Most of its customers were in Europe and Japan as of 2010, where the chips are used in "analog-to-digital set-top boxes."[4] They are also used in televisions, mobile phones, computers,[1] terrestrial digital[citation needed] and cable set-top boxes, car video systems,[1] DOCSIS 3.0 voice and data cable modems, digital televisions, and netbooks.[citation needed] The company designs its analog and mixed-signal circuits in standard CMOS process technology for low-cost manufacturing.[1]
Collaborations[edit]
In April 2013, SES S.A. announced the development by Inverto, Abilis and MaxLinear Inc of a prototype Sat-IP LNB (IP-LNB), which was demonstrated at a conference held at SES' headquarters in Luxembourg. The IP-LNB incorporates eight-channel satellite-to-IP bridging technology to deliver eight concurrent channels via IP unicast or multicast to fixed and portable client devices. As of July 2012, the prototype IP-LNB was being developed into a commercial product.[8]

History[edit]
Founding and growth[edit]
MaxLinear was founded in 2003[1] in Carlsbad, California[3] by "eight semiconductor industry veterans."[2] Kishore Seendripu was co-founder, and would become chairman, president, and chief executive. Among other companies, in the past Seendripu had worked on the technical staff at Broadcom.[1] Prior to 2009, the majority of the company's revenue was from the sale of its "mobile handset digital television receivers" which contained MaxLinear's digital television RF receiver chips, in Japan. The biggest customers for the product were Panasonic, Murata, and MTC[disambiguation needed]. However, in 2009, the company sold more chips for use in digital set top boxes in Europe, automotive navigation displays, and digital TVs.[2] In 2009, the company shipped 75 million chips to companies such as Panasonic and Sony,[4] with 99 percent of its sales in Asia.[2]
In November 2009, MaxLinear announced it intended to go public.[1] At the time of the IPO, MaxLinear’s venture investors included Mission Ventures in San Diego, U.S. Venture Partners, Battery Ventures and UMC Capital.[5] MaxLinear raised around $35 million in venture capital prior to the IPO, spending around half of it. By the end of 2009, the company had $17.9 million in cash.[1] That year, MaxLinear had $51.4 million in revenue and $4.3 million in profit.[1]
IPO[edit]
The company held an initial public offering on March 24, 2010[1][5] on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).[3] under the ticker symbol MXL. Initially the company expected to raise around $43 million with the IPO, with that projection later raised to $90 million after a last-minute increase in share price by the company.[5] Writes the San Diego Union-Tribune, "shares soared 34 percent on their debut. MaxLinear collected about $92 million from the offering, with its shares opening at $14 and peaking at $18.70 on the first day of trading."[1] After the debut, MaxLinear said it planned to use the proceeds for "general corporate purposes," and perhaps for acquiring competitor businesses or products.[4]
Recent[edit]
By May 2010, the company employed 135 people.[1] In May 2015, MaxLinear acquired Entropic Communications. In April 2016, MaxLinear bought Microsemi's wireless backhaul business, adding about 30 workers to its workforce. In May 2016, MaxLinear announced it would buy Broadcom's "wireless backhaul infrastructure for 80 million in cash," in what was its second acquisition for the year. In the Broadcom deal, MaxLinear took on about 120 additional employees.[3] On March 29, 2017, MaxLinear Inc. announced it would buy Exar Corporation for about $661.6 million cash.[6] As of 2017, MaxLinear is on the Multimedia over Coax Alliance board of directors as well as Arris, Broadcom, Comcast, Cox Communications, DirecTV, Echostar, Intel, and Verizon.[7]
Facilities and employees[edit]
MaxLinear is based in Carlsbad, California,[3] with research and development centers in Irvine, California, China and India.[citation needed] A "fabless" company, it uses outside chipmaking facilities, known as foundries or fabs, to manufacture its chips.[citation needed] By 2010, it used "third-party contractors in Asia for manufacturing and assembly," with all its chips made by United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) at foundries in Taiwan and Singapore.[2] As of early March 2010, the company had 177 employees, with most in R&D.[2]
Products[edit]
MaxLinear sells its products to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), module makers and original design manufacturers (ODMs).[citation needed] The San Diego Union-Tribune writes that "MaxLinear’s product is very small radio-frequency TV tuner chips — half the size of an individual dial button on the keypad of a cell phone."[4] According to Xconomy, "MaxLinear focuses on designing semiconductor chips that enable people to watch TV on devices with a wireless broadband connection."[5] The "tiny chips"[1] are further described as "high-performance radio frequency (RF) systems-on-a-chip for receiving and processing digital TV broadcasts, digital videos, and broadband data downloads," in order to "enable people to watch TV on a handheld wireless device."[2]
San Diego Union-Tribune writes that the company aims to "take over from bulky 'can' tuners in TVs and other electronics. It plans to get its chips into computers, set-top boxes, mobile phones and in-vehicle video systems."[4] Most of its customers were in Europe and Japan as of 2010, where the chips are used in "analog-to-digital set-top boxes."[4] They are also used in televisions, mobile phones, computers,[1] terrestrial digital[citation needed] and cable set-top boxes, car video systems,[1] DOCSIS 3.0 voice and data cable modems, digital televisions, and netbooks.[citation needed] The company designs its analog and mixed-signal circuits in standard CMOS process technology for low-cost manufacturing.[1]
Collaborations[edit]
In April 2013, SES S.A. announced the development by Inverto, Abilis and MaxLinear Inc of a prototype Sat-IP LNB (IP-LNB), which was demonstrated at a conference held at SES' headquarters in Luxembourg. The IP-LNB incorporates eight-channel satellite-to-IP bridging technology to deliver eight concurrent channels via IP unicast or multicast to fixed and portable client devices. As of July 2012, the prototype IP-LNB was being developed into a commercial product.[8]

We are a fabless system-on-chip product company, designing highly integrated, radio-frequency, and mixed-signal Communications ICs for broadband and infrastructure applications.
 
We hire the best people in the world and engage them in some of the most exciting opportunities in our broadband and infrastructure markets. Our growth has come from innovative, bold approaches to solving some of the world’s most challenging communication technology problems.
 
MaxLinear began by developing the World’s first high-performance TV tuner chip using standard CMOS process technology. Others said we couldn’t achieve the extremely high performance requirements using CMOS, but we proved them wrong and achieved enduring global market leadership with our designs. Since then, we’ve developed a full line of products for satellite communications, cable modems, and terrestrial TV; diversified into high speed products addressing Datacom applications such as 400 Gbps fiber-optic interconnect chips for high-speed networks; and MoCA technology for home networking.
 
Our headquarters is in Carlsbad, near San Diego, California. We also have major design centers in Irvine and San Jose, CA; in Vancouver, Canada; in Herzliya, Israel; and in Bangalore, India.
 
We have approximately 585 employees, a substantial majority of whom have engineering degrees, and include masters and Ph.D. graduates from many of the premiere universities around the world. Our engineers thrive on innovation, outstanding execution, outside-the-box thinking, nimbleness, and collaboration. Together, we form a high-energy business team that is focused on building great products.CLICK HERE TO APPLY

History[edit]
Founding and growth[edit]
MaxLinear was founded in 2003[1] in Carlsbad, California[3] by "eight semiconductor industry veterans."[2] Kishore Seendripu was co-founder, and would become chairman, president, and chief executive. Among other companies, in the past Seendripu had worked on the technical staff at Broadcom.[1] Prior to 2009, the majority of the company's revenue was from the sale of its "mobile handset digital television receivers" which contained MaxLinear's digital television RF receiver chips, in Japan. The biggest customers for the product were Panasonic, Murata, and MTC[disambiguation needed]. However, in 2009, the company sold more chips for use in digital set top boxes in Europe, automotive navigation displays, and digital TVs.[2] In 2009, the company shipped 75 million chips to companies such as Panasonic and Sony,[4] with 99 percent of its sales in Asia.[2]
In November 2009, MaxLinear announced it intended to go public.[1] At the time of the IPO, MaxLinear’s venture investors included Mission Ventures in San Diego, U.S. Venture Partners, Battery Ventures and UMC Capital.[5] MaxLinear raised around $35 million in venture capital prior to the IPO, spending around half of it. By the end of 2009, the company had $17.9 million in cash.[1] That year, MaxLinear had $51.4 million in revenue and $4.3 million in profit.[1]
IPO[edit]
The company held an initial public offering on March 24, 2010[1][5] on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).[3] under the ticker symbol MXL. Initially the company expected to raise around $43 million with the IPO, with that projection later raised to $90 million after a last-minute increase in share price by the company.[5] Writes the San Diego Union-Tribune, "shares soared 34 percent on their debut. MaxLinear collected about $92 million from the offering, with its shares opening at $14 and peaking at $18.70 on the first day of trading."[1] After the debut, MaxLinear said it planned to use the proceeds for "general corporate purposes," and perhaps for acquiring competitor businesses or products.[4]
Recent[edit]
By May 2010, the company employed 135 people.[1] In May 2015, MaxLinear acquired Entropic Communications. In April 2016, MaxLinear bought Microsemi's wireless backhaul business, adding about 30 workers to its workforce. In May 2016, MaxLinear announced it would buy Broadcom's "wireless backhaul infrastructure for 80 million in cash," in what was its second acquisition for the year. In the Broadcom deal, MaxLinear took on about 120 additional employees.[3] On March 29, 2017, MaxLinear Inc. announced it would buy Exar Corporation for about $661.6 million cash.[6] As of 2017, MaxLinear is on the Multimedia over Coax Alliance board of directors as well as Arris, Broadcom, Comcast, Cox Communications, DirecTV, Echostar, Intel, and Verizon.[7]
Facilities and employees[edit]
MaxLinear is based in Carlsbad, California,[3] with research and development centers in Irvine, California, China and India.[citation needed] A "fabless" company, it uses outside chipmaking facilities, known as foundries or fabs, to manufacture its chips.[citation needed] By 2010, it used "third-party contractors in Asia for manufacturing and assembly," with all its chips made by United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) at foundries in Taiwan and Singapore.[2] As of early March 2010, the company had 177 employees, with most in R&D.[2]
Products[edit]
MaxLinear sells its products to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), module makers and original design manufacturers (ODMs).[citation needed] The San Diego Union-Tribune writes that "MaxLinear’s product is very small radio-frequency TV tuner chips — half the size of an individual dial button on the keypad of a cell phone."[4] According to Xconomy, "MaxLinear focuses on designing semiconductor chips that enable people to watch TV on devices with a wireless broadband connection."[5] The "tiny chips"[1] are further described as "high-performance radio frequency (RF) systems-on-a-chip for receiving and processing digital TV broadcasts, digital videos, and broadband data downloads," in order to "enable people to watch TV on a handheld wireless device."[2]
San Diego Union-Tribune writes that the company aims to "take over from bulky 'can' tuners in TVs and other electronics. It plans to get its chips into computers, set-top boxes, mobile phones and in-vehicle video systems."[4] Most of its customers were in Europe and Japan as of 2010, where the chips are used in "analog-to-digital set-top boxes."[4] They are also used in televisions, mobile phones, computers,[1] terrestrial digital[citation needed] and cable set-top boxes, car video systems,[1] DOCSIS 3.0 voice and data cable modems, digital televisions, and netbooks.[citation needed] The company designs its analog and mixed-signal circuits in standard CMOS process technology for low-cost manufacturing.[1]
Collaborations[edit]
In April 2013, SES S.A. announced the development by Inverto, Abilis and MaxLinear Inc of a prototype Sat-IP LNB (IP-LNB), which was demonstrated at a conference held at SES' headquarters in Luxembourg. The IP-LNB incorporates eight-channel satellite-to-IP bridging technology to deliver eight concurrent channels via IP unicast or multicast to fixed and portable client devices. As of July 2012, the prototype IP-LNB was being developed into a commercial product.[8]

MaxLinear is based in Carlsbad, California,[3] with research and development centers in Irvine, California, China and India.[citation needed] A "fabless" company, it uses outside chipmaking facilities, known as foundries or fabs, to manufacture its chips.[citation needed] By 2010, it used "third-party contractors in Asia for manufacturing and assembly," with all its chips made by United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) at foundries in Taiwan and Singapore.[2] As of early March 2010, the company had 177 employees, with most in R&D.[2]
Products[edit]
MaxLinear sells its products to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), module makers and original design manufacturers (ODMs).[citation needed] The San Diego Union-Tribune writes that "MaxLinear’s product is very small radio-frequency TV tuner chips — half the size of an individual dial button on the keypad of a cell phone."[4] According to Xconomy, "MaxLinear focuses on designing semiconductor chips that enable people to watch TV on devices with a wireless broadband connection."[5] The "tiny chips"[1] are further described as "high-performance radio frequency (RF) systems-on-a-chip for receiving and processing digital TV broadcasts, digital videos, and broadband data downloads," in order to "enable people to watch TV on a handheld wireless device."[2]
San Diego Union-Tribune writes that the company aims to "take over from bulky 'can' tuners in TVs and other electronics. It plans to get its chips into computers, set-top boxes, mobile phones and in-vehicle video systems."[4] Most of its customers were in Europe and Japan as of 2010, where the chips are used in "analog-to-digital set-top boxes."[4] They are also used in televisions, mobile phones, computers,[1] terrestrial digital[citation needed] and cable set-top boxes, car video systems,[1] DOCSIS 3.0 voice and data cable modems, digital televisions, and netbooks.[citation needed] The company designs its analog and mixed-signal circuits in standard CMOS process technology for low-cost manufacturing.[1]
Collaborations[edit]
In April 2013, SES S.A. announced the development by Inverto, Abilis and MaxLinear Inc of a prototype Sat-IP LNB (IP-LNB), which was demonstrated at a conference held at SES' headquarters in Luxembourg. The IP-LNB incorporates eight-channel satellite-to-IP bridging technology to deliver eight concurrent channels via IP unicast or multicast to fixed and portable client devices. As of July 2012, the prototype IP-LNB was being developed into a commercial product.[8]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
