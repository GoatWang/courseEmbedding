Our Story

 







Made with Love from our Farm to your Home, Praise the Lard!

 









 




Welcome to Heal-Fast Body. I am James Henderson and this is my story.  For ages now an elderly Mennonite friend of mine has regaled me with tales of the miraculous curative powers of lard.   For the longest time I merely considered Amos’ stories as quaint mythology.  But in 2014 he inspired me enough to begin research on the topic.   I also embarked on using lard products on myself and my farm animals any time we had wound care needs.  As it turns out- Lard is exactly EVERYTHING Amos Schrock said it would be!  I then created the Lard Counsel.  We we are a group of farmers like myself, as well as physicians, Naturopaths, herbalists, and biochemists who are committed to the research and development of utilizing lard for healing.
Amos Schrock
After 7 months of testing and trials I was ready to release my basic line of lard based skin care products the first Saturday of December.  Being a small time farmer with a big time vision, I  planned to start a website and expand the product line after 15 months.  But fate had other plans, because two days later Katie Brooke did a story on Heal Fast Body and EVERYTHING CHANGED.  Thanks to her exceptional reporting skills, Katie’s story got us into the news in 100 million homes!  At that point I went from farmer’s market sales to gearing up to supply the world with my awesome products.
Katie Brooks
Though we make no medical claims about our products, I will tell you that I what we are seeing in our trials is just blowing our minds.  I personally have never seen anything like it!  Check out our testimonials, or just see for yourself the amazing power of our lard based products.  One thing’s for certain: our powerful products are also all natural– so no matter what level of help you find for your skin, it ain’t a gonna hurt ya!  We take Primum Non Nociere seriously around here!
Great things are on the horizon.  Our regional hospital is considering beginning a trial for us using our product with pre and post Chemo patients.  See testimonials for some stories of those already using our Basic D Lotion for post chemo relief.  We will be releasing our new (hand and foot) crack cream, as well as our windburn protection salve (for those like me with sensitive skin), within the month.  And before too long we will be adding these products: cancer care lotion, stretch cream, muscle rub, pain and strain cream, acne-gone, eczema exodus, psoriasis buster, dry scalp cream, hair cream, athlete’s foot cream, body scrubs, body wraps, soaps, and a wound care cream for pets.
Our Products
To make our world class formulas work their best we are choosing to use the very best essential oils in the world.  Just remember that it’s generally a good idea to test a small patch of skin with ANY product you buy to check for possible reactions, and if you are pregnant to check with your health care professional.  And remember- a little will take you far.  We just know that you will love our products, and can’t wait to hear from you.  Thanks ya’ll- James Henderson
