Worthington Foods (1939 -
        ): Work With Soyfoods
by William Shurtleff and Akiko
        Aoyagi
 A Chapter from the Unpublished Manuscript, History of Soybeans and
          Soyfoods, 1100 B.C. to the 1980s
ŠCopyright 2004 Soyinfo Center, Lafayette, California





      Worthington Foods is the largest and most
      innovative U.S. company making meat analogs and vegetarian entrees. They
      pioneered the development of spun soy protein fibers in meat analogs in
      the late 1950s and early 1960s. Their Morningstar Farms line of soy-based
      meatless meats, introduced into supermarkets and grocery stores nationwide
      in 1975 and widely advertised, provided millions of Americans with their
      first experience of soy used in this way.
      The Founding (1939) and Founders.
      The forerunner of today's Worthington Foods Inc. was Special Foods,
      founded in 1939 in Worthington, Ohio by Dr. George Harding Sr. (a relative
      of U.S. President Warren G. Harding), Elwin Knecht, and Bill Robinson. Dr.
      Harding, a Seventh-day Adventist, was head of the Harding Hospital, a
      private psychiatric hospital that was founded by his father in 1916 and
      followed Adventist meatless diet and healing practices. Dr. Harding felt
      that the meat analogs (especially Protose) then produced by J.H. Kellogg's
      Battle Creek Food Company, America's first producer of "meatless
      meats," were the best he had ever tasted. Being on the board of
      Madison College in Nashville, Tennessee (which made its own analogs), he
      knew it didn't take much to start a small food company. He also knew that
      similar foods were being prepared in the kitchen of the Adventist-run
      Washington Sanitarium in Washington, D.C. Knecht, a classmate of Harding's
      at Loma Linda University in California and a graduate dietician, had first
      learned how to make meat analogs in about 1930 as a cook at the Loma Linda
      Sanitarium. By 1938 he was foodservice manager for the Harding Hospital,
      where he was known for his ability to make delicious meatless meats. Bill
      Robinson, an Adventist friend and a patient of Dr. Harding's, lived in the
      community and was a former salesman for the Battle Creek Food Company; he
      had sold meat analogs but had been laid off during the Depression.
      Actually the prime motivation for starting the new company was to attract
      young families to the founders' small church and church school by
      providing employment opportunities. This would allow the school to grow to
      a viable size.
The project was launched in January 1939,
      when Dr. Harding borrowed $5,000 against the mortgage on his home. The
      company started on a shoestring. Bill Robinson was hired as the
      administrator and was the only salaried employee for the new company,
      which was incorporated later that year as Special Foods, Inc. In the
      little plant, built to look like a colonial-style house so that it could
      be sold as a home if the food company failed. Food manufacturing was done
      in the basement, offices occupied the first and second floors, and the
      storeroom was on the third. Product development was done when B.J. Knecht
      would bring in new products for taste tests; he had to be coaxed to write
      down his recipes, so that they could be duplicated. It was definitely a
      family operation (Twomley 1981).
The group's first product, introduced in
      1939, was Proast, a dark gluten-based meatloaf analog made with wheat
      gluten, peanuts, and a little defatted soy grits or flakes; it resembled
      Battle Creek's Protose. Next came Numete, a light nutmeat loaf made with
      ground peanuts, corn flour, salt, and yeast, resembling Battle Creek's
      Nutose. Another famous early product, introduced in 1941, was Choplets;
      the name had been suggested by Harding's 11-year-old son. Resembling Dr.
      Miller's Cutlets, Choplets were made of wheat gluten and packed in a broth
      of yeast extract and mushroom broth; they were a unique best-seller into
      the 1960s. Served to patients at the hospital, the new foods (of which
      only Proast contained soy) were an immediate success.
Sales grew to $20,000 by early 1941. But
      Bill Robinson, a salesman at heart, did not enjoy the worries and
      pressures of managing a small company. So he persuaded his old classmate
      Jim Hagle, then Assistant Administrator of the Hinsdale Sanitarium at
      Hinsdale, Illinois, to consider working with the new company. Hagle agreed
      to come on board if Harding would loan him the money to buy 15-20% of the
      company's stock. The deal was made, and it proved to be a turning point in
      Worthington Foods' history. Robinson left in 1942, Hagle became secretary,
      treasurer, and manager, and Dr. Harding continued as president.
Dr. Dale Twomley, Dean of the Andrews
      University School of Business, where Hagle was a business major from 1931
      to 1935, in an excellent biographical sketch of Hagle, described him as
      "an uncommon businessman." As president of Worthington Foods and
      administrator of Harding Hospital for 35 years, he stepped carefully to
      avoid compromise in order to make more money. A deeply religious man and a
      vegetarian, as well as an excellent businessman and leader with high
      principles, Jim Hagle played the key role in building Worthington Foods
      into the major company that it is today.
New Developments in the 1940s.
      Things soon began to happen at Worthington Foods. After Hagle's first
      year, sales had increased 400%, to $80,000. During World War II, as meat
      was rationed and its prices soared, there was a growing interest in meat
      analogs, and several hotel and restaurant chains began to use
      Worthington's products. But there was also strong competition from other
      Adventist producers, all of which were larger than Worthington in 1941:
      Madison Foods, Loma Linda Foods, Battle Creek Foods, and Dr. Harry
      Miller's International Nutrition Laboratory. Yet Worthington soon took the
      lead in sales of meat analogs, and in the areas of nutritional and
      technological research, and product development. This later became a prime
      factor in Worthington's growth and success. In 1941 two new soyfoods were
      introduced: Canned Soybeans (plain or with tomato sauce in 17­or 30-ounce
      cans) and Sandwich Spread (with chopped olives, in 10-ounce cans). In 1945
      Choplet Burger, the company's first product and meat analog with soy as a
      main ingredient, was introduced. Sold in 30-ounce cans, it had a texture
      like hamburger plus the famous Choplet flavor; it could be shaped into
      patties and fried. In 1946 soy sauce (purchased from another manufacturer)
      was introduced in 4.5-ounce table dispenser bottles. 1949 saw the
      introduction of both Soyloin Steaks (great name!, made by mixing ground
      gluten pieces, not suitable for the Choplets with defatted soy grits or
      flakes, then shaping the mixture into patties), and of Meatless Wieners
      (in a 19-ounce can), renamed Veja-Links in 1954. The soy in each of these
      products was generally defatted soy flour, grits, or flakes used both to
      complement the very low quality protein in wheat gluten and to work as a
      filling and binding agent.
In December 1945 Special Foods, which had
      operated during the war as a partnership including Hagle and the Harding
      family, was incorporated as Worthington Foods, Inc. In 1948, when Dr.
      Harding left to become president of Loma Linda University, Hagle became
      president of Worthington Foods. By the end of the war, sales were roughly
      $500,000 a year (a 25-fold increase in 5 years). A new plant had to be
      built. Shortly after the war, Alan Buller became general manager and
      Warren Hartman was hired as head of research. They were among the
      "core of good people who stayed with us through the years," to
      whom Hagle later attributed so much of the company's success. Soon the
      company developed their own sales force, using men who were vegetarians
      and who used and believed in the products. Sales grew (Twomley 1981).
In September 1949, Robert Boyer (see
      Chapter 67 visited Worthington to discuss his new idea for spinning soy
      protein fibers and to offer them a license. Hagle was immediately excited
      with the idea but the company was reluctant to take a license until there
      was a source of soy protein fiber. So Boyer went on his way, not to return
      for 7 years. During this period Worthington's market was limited primarily
      to Seventh-day Adventist members and institutions.
Acquisitions and Analogs
      (1950-69). In June 1950 Worthington Foods
      bought up half of its first competitor, acquiring the rights to
      manufacture and market the meat analogs formerly produced by Dr. Harry
      Miller's International Nutrition Laboratories, including Miller's Cutlets,
      Cutlet Burgers, and Vegetable Stew . . . none of which contained soy. The
      rights to the rest of Miller's products (including his best-selling
      Soyalac soymilk) and his plant in Ohio were purchased by Loma Linda Foods.
In 1954 Worthington began marketing its
      first soymilk, Soyamel, sold in liquid form in 1-pound cans. Instant
      Soyamel was introduced in 1956, using isolated soy proteins manufactured
      by the Gunther Co. in Illinois, to give both an instant (powdered) and
      regular (liquid) product in plain and malt flavors, sold in 12-ounce,
      3-pound, and 15-pound sizes. This was the world's first soymilk based on
      isolates. In 1961 a fortified Instant Soyamel was put on the market (not
      thought of or marketed as an infant formula) and in 1966 a Banana Beverage
      Soyamel. Other products containing soy introduced in the 1950s were Entree
      in Tomato Sauce (1954; 20-ounce can), Entree in Mushroom Gravy (1954;
      4.5-ounce can), Meatless Wiener (1954; 14-ounce can), VP ("Vegetable
      Protein" 1957; 20-oz. or 4.75-pound cans), Kreem Chee (natural white
      or pimiento; 6- or 16-ounce cans), and Fry Sticks (1957). Indeed the 1950s
      were a time of great innovation at Worthington with new vegetarian
      soyfoods, and also a period of large-scale expansion of the business.
But Worthington's "big break"
      came in the late 1950s with the decision to go ahead in developing Robert
      Boyer's spun protein fiber idea into a new line of vegetarian meat
      analogs. In 1956, when Boyer returned to America from England, where he
      had been working with Unilever on his fiber project, he went immediately
      to Worthington. The company was now ready to buy the rights to his patent
      for the health food industry. Boyer was invited to work as a consultant in
      the lab at Worthington and the result was, over a period of several years,
      the development of a new line of products, beginning with chicken-like
      textures. But the actual manufacture of these products presented
      difficulties, for the only soy protein isolates (the basic ingredient in
      the spun fibers) then available were industrial grade products, made
      without concern for bacterial levels or flavor. Boyer convinced Ralston
      Purina, one manufacturer of industrial-grade isolates, to invest in a new
      plant that made food-grade soy protein isolates then spun them into fibers
      using Boyer's license. It would have been too expensive at that time for
      Worthington to spin their own fibers. By 1956 or 1957 Ralston's new plant
      was in production with a capacity of 10,000 pounds a day of fresh white
      fibers, looking (named) like silky long ropes. Worthington agreed to take
      all this production, although their market was not yet large enough. Yet
      according to Hagle, "Sales took off and we had hit a new product. The
      Adventists and the vegetarians thought it was great."
At Worthington, Ralston's freshly spun
      fibers were cut, mixed with binders (such as egg albumen), flavors,
      colorings, soy oil, nutrients, etc. and made into meat analogs. Tests were
      showing that Worthington's familiar methods of canning their products were
      not working with the new spun soy protein fiber products. They
      deteriorated in flavor and texture under the high canning temperatures. So
      Worthington made the bold, complex, and costly decision to sell the new
      analogs in frozen form. Yet it paid off; sales increased sharply and by
      being the first to offer both the new spun protein products and any meat
      analogs in a frozen form, Worthington jumped ahead of its competitors by
      10 years.
In 1962 Worthington Foods began
      commercial production and marketing of its first new spun protein foods in
      the form of frozen chicken analogs. Fried Chicken Style was a deep-fried
      product that resembled fried chicken and was sold in 6 ounce or 15 pound
      portions, frozen or canned. Sliced Whitemeat Style, resembling the white
      meat of chicken, was packed in 6-ounce portions or bulk rolls. At about
      this same time the company began to use the word Soyameat to refer to its
      canned meat analogs made from spun soy protein fibers. By 1966 Soyameat
      came in the forms of Fried Chicken, Sliced Chicken, Diced Chicken, Sliced
      Beef, Diced Beef, and Salisbury Steak. It is interesting to note that the
      spun protein fibers were first used in meat analogs rather than simply as
      meat extenders.
Worthington was also using increasing
      amounts of plain food-grade soy protein isolates in its products. Starting
      in the late 1950s both Ralston Purina and Central Soya had invited
      Worthington to try their powdered isolates and some prototype food
      products. Soon Worthington was using small amounts of the isolate in their
      gluten and nut products for both their functional and their complementary
      protein properties. Gradually the amount used was increased.
During the 1960s Worthington added only
      two new, traditional-type soyfoods to its product line, Patties (1961) and
      Numete (1966) (Ingreds?). The same year? Worthington was making tofu, but
      not on a commercial scale. By now, much of the line was labeled
      "kosher."
In 1960 Worthington acquired the entire
      assets of Dr. John Harvey Kellogg's Battle Creek Food Company of Battle
      Creek, Michigan, including the patents on various soy-based meat analogs.
In 1964 Madison Foods (Madison,
      Tennessee), an Adventist-run food company and competitor of Worthington,
      had been turned over to the Adventist Southern Union Association and
      become a division of the Nutrition International Corporation (NIC). By
      1966 Worthington had acquired NIC and its pioneering subsidiary, Madison
      Foods - largely because Worthington wanted Infa-Soy, a liquid soy
      formula).
Starting in 1966 Worthington began
      spinning its soy protein fibers, buying its isolates from Ralston Purina
      and Central Soya, then using a modified version of the process described
      by Boyer in his landmark 1954 patent (Ref??).
Worthington's next big break came in 1969
      when Stanford University?? (Ref??, SRI??) published a special report on
      vegetable proteins as part of its service called President's Service.
      In the report Worthington Foods was referred to as a leader in the field
      of meat analogs and its operations were praised extensively. Soon Hagle
      began to receive calls and enquiries from many large companies from around
      the world. Worthington was facing growth pains, realizing that there was a
      huge potential worldwide market for their products, that as a small
      company they did not have the capital to reach this market, and that if
      they did not do something much larger corporations would move in and take
      over the entire industry. Hagle finally decided he must choose one of four
      possible courses: (1) work out a relationship that would make possible a
      merger with Worthington's biggest competitor, Loma Linda Foods; (2) go
      public and raise stock to raise a large amount of capital; (3) merge with
      some other company; or (4) sell out altogether. Hagle favored the first
      plan, which he felt would benefit the Adventist church and end past
      rivalries. Yet after 3 years of negotiations, no satisfactory agreement
      could be reached; the church insisted on owning 51% of the stock in the
      new company and Hagle felt that the church was not an appropriate
      institution to be running a big business. Hagle was disappointed in the
      outcome, but other big corporations (such as Ralston Purina, Quaker Oats,
      Coca-Cola, and Staley) were ready to offer ten times the company's book
      value to acquire it. Eventually, however, it was Miles Laboratories
      (producers of Alka-Seltzer) who offered the best price and terms,
      including the guaranty that any product sold under the Worthington brand
      would conform to Adventist standards.
The Big Time Then Back Home
      Again (1970s and 1980s). In March 1970
      Miles officially acquired Worthington Foods, which then became the glamour
      company of the industry. Sales at the time of the merger were about $6
      million a year; 2 years later they had reached $18 million a year and were
      growing rapidly. During the 1970s the research staff was expanded from 5
      people to 50 and the research budget grew to about $2 million a year.
Miles soon bought a large food production
      plant in Schaumburg, Illinois, with lots of frozen storage space, and
      began to develop a new line of meat analogs for national distribution.
      These were first sold commercially in limited test markets in 1972. Based
      on the response, in 1974 Miles/Worthington introduced nationally their new
      line of textured soy protein breakfast meat analogs under the Morningstar
      Farms label. The three initial products, Breakfast Links, Breakfast
      Patties, and Breakfast Slices (substitutes for sausage and ham) were
      launched with a $7.5 million television advertising campaign. Although
      General Mills had been on the market since the mid-1960s with Bac-O's
      (imitation bacon bits), it is fair to say that the Morningstar Farms
      products represented the first line of modern meat analogs (rather than
      condiments) to be sold at supermarkets nationwide. Lublin (1977) in the Wall
      Street Journal documented Miles' "soybean saga." About 10
      million American families tried the Morningstar Farms breakfast line in
      the first 18 months after its introduction in 1974, but sales after that
      failed to measure up to the expectations. Lublin reported that Miles had
      chalked up pretax losses of $33 million on its meat substitute products.
An improved version of the products was
      prepared in late 1977 and again promoted nationwide with extensive
      advertising as "Cholesterol Free, No Animal Fat, Protein Rich."
      Morningstar Farms products found in supermarkets in 1979 included
      Breakfast Links, Leanies, Grillers, Breakfast Strips, and Luncheon Slices.
      But the Morningstar line did not succeed. While others acknowledged that
      Miles/Worthington was "probably 25 years ahead of its time,"
      promotion was gradually withdrawn and sales dropped. As of 1981 the future
      of the Morningstar Farms line was uncertain??. It may be dropped and
      Worthington may go back to making foods primarily for the vegetarian
      market.
By the late 1970s most producers of meat
      analogs agreed that the general market for these products in the US had
      been disappointing, however, the Adventist or "motivated"
      vegetarian market continued to show an increase every year. By 1974
      Worthington produced over 45 varieties of meatless meats. Although no
      precise sales figures are available on the meat analog market size, it was
      approximately?? $30 million a year in 1980; Worthington had about
      two-thirds of this.
In late 1977 Bayer AG, Germany's huge
      maker of Aspirin, bought Miles. Since Bayer is fundamentally a chemical
      and not a food company and since they are dissatisfied with Worthington's
      profit performance, what they will do with Worthington remains uncertain??
      By 1981 Miles was planning to pull out of the Morningstar Farms line; they
      may?? try to place it in the natural food market like Health Valley
      products. If Worthington goes up for sale, one potential buyer will be
      Sanitarium Health Foods, the Australian Adventist organization that since
      April 1980 has run Loma Linda Foods and Granose in England.
In about 1976 Worthington introduced a
      new line of "third generation" meat analogs, made using an
      entirely new and secret process in which, apparently??, textured soy
      concentrates were used with or in place of spun soy protein fibers to give
      an improved texture. The most popular of these were Stakelets, Chik Stiks,
      and Fillets (fish analog). Then in 1980 Worthington expanded this new line
      to include ready-to-eat, heat-and-serve vegetarian entrees, including the
      best-selling Veelets Parmesano, Vegetarian Lasagna, Pizza, and Stakes au
      Sauce.
In 1981 Worthington manufactured and
      marketed three dry foods, 20 canned foods, and 27 frozen foods (meat
      analogs). The dry foods containing soy were regular and fortified Soyamel
      and Granbuger (unflavored textured soy flour). The more popular canned
      products containing soy were the various "Soyameat" products
      (Prime Stakes, Fri-chik (sp??), Chicken Diced, and Beef Sliced),
      Veja-Bits, Numete, Non-Meat Balls, Veja-Links, Super-Links, and Saucettes.
      Popular frozen products containing soy as a main ingredient were
      Stakelets, Chik Stiks, Stripples, Sliced Chicken, and Prosage. These
      generally contained spun soy isolates or textured soy concentrates.
