                                Report abuseTranscript of Sociology of Media Research ProjectHistorical Event: The Death and Media Coverage of Princess DianaMedium 4: Print Media-New York Times Meduim 1: Broadcast MediaHours following the crash, news stations around the world presented the breaking news that Diana was involved in a car crash and later confirmed her death.  This broadcast was one of the first to report the news to people in the United States.  The MSNBC coverage begins with live footage of the scene of the crash and later gives the update that Diana died in the crash.  The anchor goes on to talk about the state of the Royal family which gives a more personal perspective to her death.  Footage of the actual car, motorcycles, and location are very detailed and zoomed in, putting the viewer at the scene of the accident. The video does not go into a lot of detail because few facts were actually known during the time of the breaking news.  It leaves a lot of questions unanswered but is able to alert viewers very quickly after the crash occurred. http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9708/30/diana.dead/tom.richardson.24.aiffhttp://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9708/30/diana.dead/joanna.luz.15.aiffhttp://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9708/30/diana.dead/mike.walker.18.aiffJoanna Luz"It was a blue Mercedes and the airbag was on the passenger side, for sure, and the horn, right after the huge explosion there was a horn - for about two minutes and I think that was the driver up against the steering wheel."Tom Richardson"So I and another gentleman ran into the tunnel to see if we could help anybody get out of the car and a gentleman at the car, at the scene, was starting to run towards us out of the tunnel like the car was about to explode, so we turned and ran out of the tunnel...... 'Bout fifteen seconds later we turned around...er the paparazzi snapping off pictures..".Recording of Eyewitness Reports"Well, we was coming from the Eiffel Tower, and we were coming down, he was coming one way and we were coming down the hill, and the traffic, there was a little traffic so it was going slow there because the accident had just happened and when we got there we seen either the car had flipped over... and it looked like it had hit another car; looked like it had evidently hit the wall or something," he said.Medium 2: Recording of Eyewitness ReportsFollowing the initial reaction and footage of the crash, several witness reports were aired and made public.  The three included all give a different viewpoint of the crash, but when combined, paint a vivid picture of what it was like to be at the scene. Two of the three talk about experiencing the explosion of the car.  Eyewitness Tom Richardson explains how the paparazzi were present at the scene and were taking pictures of the car while Diana and two others were still in the car.  This is a very intense description which lead many to believe that if the paparazzi had helped the victims instead of taking pictures, Diana and the others may not have died.  Autopsy reports later explain that Diana was alive post-crash which lead to further blame on the paparazzi.  Hearing the voices of people who witnessed the accident allows me to picture myself in that tunnel seeing the aftermath of the crash.  The audio provides a human view to the accident and the surroundings at the time. Diana Spencer, the former Princess of England, was killed in a tragic car accident in August, 1997.  The relentless paparazzi trailing her car that night were believed to be a contributing factor to the crash.  The accident received extensive media coverage, which resulted in exploitation, false rumors, and questioning of the Royal familyMedium 3:Photos from the crash and funeral, magazine reportsDays following the crash, images of the car began to circulate on print media and television.  The photos allowed millions to see what it looked like the night of the accident.  One image in particular shows the burnt face of a blonde woman (Diana?) in the car. This is the only known photograph of Diana post-crash because most paparazzi photos were confiscated.  Images of Diana and the crash were on numerous magazine and newspaper covers following her death.  Many of these sources circulated false rumors about Diana, her relationships, and the Royal Family.  I believe that the photographs are a key piece in the media coverage of her death because they illustrate just how serious the crash was.  It is near impossible to imagine people being crushed inside the car or how scary it must have been for those involved.  The photographs bring to life the eyewitness reports and add a clearer visual to the news reports.  Additionally, photos from her funeral, the palace, and of her family bring more emotion to her death and reemphasize that she was a person who had a life outside of what the media illustrated.Hover for Audio Playback Hover for Audio Playback Hover for Audio Playback "Paris, Sunday, Aug. 31 -- Diana, the Princess of Wales, was killed shortly after midnight today in an automobile accident in a tunnel by the Seine. The accident also killed Emad Mohammed al-Fayed, the Harrods heir, and their driver, the police said.Diana's death was announced this morning by the Interior Minister, Jean-Pierre Chevenement. She died after being hospitalized in intensive care at the Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital in southeast Paris.A bodyguard was seriously injured, according to a police spokesman. 'The car was being chased by photographers on motorcycles, which could have caused the accident,' a spokesman for the Prefecture of Police said. Several motorcyclists were detained for questioning after the crash, Reuters reported, quoting police officials.The Princess, 36, was divorced from Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales and heir to the British throne, last year. She had vacationed with Mr. al-Fayed, 41, the son of Harrods's owner, Mohammed al-Fayed, on the French Riviera earlier this month and had been expected to return to London today to be with her two sons, the Princes William and Harry. [Obituaries of Diana and Mr. al-Fayed appear on page 31.]French radio stations reported that a spokesman for the British royal family in London expressed anger and said the accident was predictable because photographers relentlessly pursued the Princess wherever she went.The crash occurred 35 minutes past midnight in the Alma Tunnel, on the right bank of the Seine under the Place de l'Alma, the police said."This article from the New York Times made headlines a day after the car crash and goes into detail on the events of the accident and who was involved.  The article summarizes information and imagrey from the news, eyewitness reports, and photographs and ties the entire event together.  The story really sinks in when reading the full article because it fills in the pieces that the other mediums left out.  Concrete facts are stated and a sense of legitimacy is added to the report.  I appreciate how concise the article is, it reports facts and does not dwell on rumors or pin fault on anyone involved.  I believe that this publication and others similar to it was a very effective and accessible source of news on this event and fueled a lot of its media coverage.  Several media sources aimed at pinning her death on an individual while others claim that her death was planned by the British Monarchy.  No reports could be legitimately proven but they circulated the idea that Diana was a victim of the media and that her death could have been avoided. While the images, videos, writings, and recording are all very shocking and concerning to me, the reaction from those who were older during that time must have had a much stronger reaction.  750 million people tuned in to watch her wedding, she was an advocate for numerous causes, and a large icon to many people.  With that kind of following and notoriety, the public reaction to her death and the media coverage it received was immense.

Ramsey Carey, 26 First assistant to co-CEO Modi Wiczyk, Media Rights Capital
Carey has been promoted twice in his 2½ years at MRC and now runs the assistant training program and the assistant weekend read program. He works closely with execs coordinating film and television distribution deals, including the “Ted” sequel; the deal for Neill Blomkamp’s “Chappie” with Sony; “Blunt Talk” from Seth MacFarlane and Jonathan Ames, which received a straight-to-series, two-season order from Starz; and TV project “The One Percent” from Alejandro Gonzalez Innaritu, also for Starz.
Alexis Galfas, 25 Assistant to John Sloss, Cinetic Media and Sloss Eckhouse Law Co.
The New York native and Cornell grad got her start interning at Locomotive Film and was then hired at Marcy Drogin’s Maximum Films & Management, where she assisted execs in scouting literary properties for clients such as DreamWorks and NBC TV. Since joining Cinetic in 2013, Galfas has run the indie mogul’s busy desk, assisted with campaigns for recent hits “Boyhood” and “Life Itself,” and is helping expand Cinetic’s management division, which is shepherding new talent such as “Boyhood’s” Ellar Coltrane.
Mackenzie Kirk, 24 Executive assistant to president of worldwide distribution & marketing Megan Colligan, Paramount Pictures
The Loyola Marymount U. grad interned at Summit Entertainment and in 2011 accepted an internship in Paramount’s creative advertising department. After five months, Kirk was offered a permanent position assisting Colligan, then-CMO and prexy of domestic marketing. Since then she’s been promoted and in addition to maintaining office mechanics, she assists in generating ideas for marketing campaigns and coordinating events for charitable organizations affiliated with the studio.







JT Kounelias, 24 Assistant to United Talent Agency co-founder Peter Benedek
The NYU grad interned at “The Colbert Report” and Warner Bros., was hired by UTA in 2012, and has quickly risen through the ranks to his current position after stints with talent and theater agent Gennifer Lieber and TV literary agent Joel Begleiter. Kounelias works closely with the entire television department and Benedek, who reps A-list creators, showrunners and writers, including Lena Dunham, David Chase, Tom Fontana, Michael J. Fox, Lake Bell, Neil Cross and Jack Bender.
Anthony Marotto, 25 Coordinator, physical production, APA
Marotto started under the tutelage of Montana Artists Agency prexy Matt Birch, and moved with Birch to APA in 2013. He was quickly promoted to coordinator and works closely with Birch and APA below-the-line clients, including production designer Jennifer Dehghan (Disney’s “Teen Beach Movie 2: Making Waves”) and producer Sara White (Marvel’s “Agent Carter”). In just two years, Marotto has become a key player in the department, liaising between the agency’s numerous divisions and exploring new ways to bridge diverse talents.
Bennett Sherman, 27 Associate, digital strategy, ICM Partners
Sherman moved up the old-fashioned way — by starting in the mailroom after attending Arizona U. and interning for Brian Grazer at Imagine Entertainment. He went on to assist the head of TV business affairs, moved to the talent department, and was then hired by topper Chris Silbermann in 2012. During his tenure at Silbermann’s desk, in 2013, he was accepted into the agent trainee program. Sherman was recently promoted to associate in digital strategy, where he’ll help bridge all departments and create new opportunities for clients.
Ally Shuster, 29Coordinator, Theatre Literary Department, Paradigm Talent Agency
The native New Yorker, a 2011 graduate of the Cardozo School of Law, is still Gotham-based and focused on Broadway and theater. “Ally has a great eye for talent and a strong work ethic,” says department head Jack Tantleff, who thinks of her as “more partner” than assistant. “She’s a big part of all my projects,” he says, including the upcoming Broadway revival of “Side Show” with Paradigm clients director Bill Condon and composer Henry Krieger; and “Waitress: The Musical,” scored by client Sara Bareilles.
Andrew Tolbert, 27 Executive assistant to head of TV Margie Cohn, DreamWorks Animation TV
Tolbert joined DreamWorks as an intern in 2010, worked as a manager in its live theatrical group and, as an early member of the TV team, helped build the studio from a small operation to a major competitor in animated TV content. DWA TV is producing and developing 300 hours of original material as part of a deal with Netflix. Tolbert also co-produced a pilot reading of “Hollywood & Vine” with CAA and produced digital series “Lazy Actress,” now being shopped.

I remember applying to The Gersh Agency a year ago. I went to one of the most expensive prep schools, graduated from college cum laude, and had some pretty big internships on my resume. You would think after walking through an office seeing a see of white trainees, that they would at least hire the token person of color that was very well qualified. Sometimes it’s these HR Directors that are intentionally not hiring talented/qualified candidates of color.

There are a few out there employed with the major agencies but they’re too afraid to take a risk on a new minority talent. So, for the most part they are invisible to us.

I think there must be an immigration policy in Hollywood – people of color seem to be excluded.  The white bias is stunning –
