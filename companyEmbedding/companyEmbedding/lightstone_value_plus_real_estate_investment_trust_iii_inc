Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)
 

At Lightstone, we believe investing in large-scale, commercial real estate shouldn’t be limited to large corporations, institutions, or high net worth individuals. Since 2005, Lightstone has offered investors the opportunity to invest in a diversified portfolio of real estate through its various public non-traded REIT offerings.
A real estate investment trust is a company that owns, and in many cases manages, income-producing real estate. Investors purchase shares within the REIT and receive a pro-rata share of income that is derived from the real estate. REITs offer distinct advantages for investors, including: portfolio diversification and income through a transparent and regulated operating structure.
Lightstone’s Non-Traded REIT offerings, include:

Lightstone Value Plus REIT, Inc. (closed to new investors)
Lightstone Value Plus REIT II, Inc. (closed to new investors)
Lightstone Value Plus REIT III, Inc.
Lightstone Real Estate Income Trust, Inc.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Lightstone Value Plus Real Estate Investment Trust III, Inc. and Subsidiaries and the notes thereto. As used herein, the terms "we," "our" and "us" refer to Lightstone Value Plus Real Estate Investment Trust III, Inc., a Maryland corporation, and, as required by context, Lightstone Value Plus REIT III, L.P., which we collectively refer to as the "Operating Partnership".  Forward-Looking Statements  Certain information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains, and other materials filed or to be filed by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), contain or will contain, forward-looking statements. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, including, among others, statements regarding our possible or assumed future results of our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, plans and objectives, are forward-looking statements. Those statements include statements regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of Lightstone Value Plus Real Estate Investment Trust III, Inc. and members of our management team, as well as the assumptions on which such statements are based, and generally are identified by the use of words such as "may," "will," "seeks," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "expects," "plans," "intends," "should" or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements.  Such statements are based on assumptions and expectations which may not be realized and are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which cannot be predicted with accuracy and some of which might not even be anticipated. Future events and actual results, financial and otherwise, may differ from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements.  Risks and other factors that might cause differences, some of which could be material, include, but are not limited to, economic and market conditions, competition, tenant or joint venture partner(s) bankruptcies, our lack of operating history, the availability of cash flows from operations to pay distributions, changes in governmental, tax, real estate and zoning laws and regulations, failure to increase tenant occupancy and operating income, rejection of leases by tenants in bankruptcy, financing and development risks, construction and lease-up delays, cost overruns, the level and volatility of interest rates, the rate of revenue increases versus expense increases, the financial stability of various tenants and industries, the failure of the Company to make additional investments in real estate properties, the failure to upgrade our tenant mix, restrictions in current financing arrangements, the failure to fully recover tenant obligations for common area maintenance, insurance, taxes and other property expenses, the failure of the Company to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust ("REIT"), the failure to refinance debt at favorable terms and conditions, an increase in impairment charges, loss of key personnel, failure to achieve earnings/funds from operations targets or estimates, conflicts of interest with the Advisor and the Sponsor and their affiliates, failure of joint venture relationships, significant costs related to environmental issues as well as other risks listed from time to time in this Form 10-Q, our form 10-K, our Registration Statements on Form S-11, as the same may be amended and supplemented from time to time, and in the Company's other reports filed with the SEC.  We believe these forward-looking statements are reasonable; however, undue reliance should not be placed on any forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations. All written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us, or persons acting on our behalf, are qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements. Further, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to future operating results over time unless required by law.  Overview  Lightstone Value Plus Real Estate Investment Trust III, Inc. (the "Lightstone REIT III") and Lightstone Value Plus REIT III, LP (the "Operating Partnership") and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the ''Company'' and the use of ''we,'' ''our,'' ''us'' or similar pronouns refers to the Lightstone REIT III, its Operating Partnership or the Company as required by the context in which such pronoun is used. Lightstone REIT III intends to elect to qualify and be taxed as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2015.  Principally through our Operating Partnership, we have and will continue to seek to acquire hotels and other commercial real estate assets primarily located in the United States. Our acquisitions may include both portfolios and individual properties and may be acquired and operated by us alone or jointly with another party. We may also originate or acquire mortgage loans secured by real estate.  Our registration statement on Form S-11(the "Offering"), pursuant to which we are offering to sell up to 30,000,000 shares of our common stock(which may be referred to herein as ''shares of common stock'' or as ''Common Shares'') for an initial offering price of $10.00 per share, subject to certain volume and other discounts (the "Primary Offering") (exclusive of 10,000,000 shares available pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan (the "DRIP") which are offered at a discounted price equivalent to 95% of the Primary Offering price per Common Share) was declared effective by SEC under the Securities Act of 1933 on July 15, 2014. On June 30, 2016, we adjusted our offering price to $9.50 per Common Share in our primary offering, which was equal to our estimated net asset value ("NAV") per Common Share as of March 31, 2016, and effective July 25, 2016, our offering price was adjusted to $10.00 per Common Share in our primary offering, which is equal to the estimated NAV per Common Share as of June 30, 2016. As of June 30, 2016 , we had received aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $67.9 million from the sale of 6.9 million shares of our common stock (including $2.0 million in Common Shares at a purchase price of $9.00 per Common Share to an entity 100% owned by David Lichtenstein, who also owns a majority interest in the Company's Sponsor). We initially expected to offer the Common Shares offered in our Primary Offering over a two-year period, or until July 15, 2016. However, because we had not sold all the Common Shares offered in our Primary Offering within two years, we will continue the Primary Offering for an additional year, until July 15, 2017, provided that the Offering will be terminated if all 30.0 million shares of our common stock are sold before such date. We reserve the right to reallocate the shares of common stock we are offering between the Primary Offering and the DRIP. Additionally, the Offering may be terminated at any time.  Capital required for the purchases of real estate and/or real estate-related investments is expected to be obtained from the public offering of shares of our common stock, and from any indebtedness that we may incur either in connection with the acquisition of any real estate and real estate related investments or thereafter. We are dependent upon the net proceeds from public offerings of our common stock to conduct our proposed activities.  We sold 20,000 Common Shares to Lightstone Value Plus REIT III LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the ''Advisor''), an entity majority owned by David Lichtenstein, on December 24, 2012, for $10.00 per share. Mr. Lichtenstein also is a majority owner of the equity interests of our sponsor, The Lightstone Group, LLC (the ''Sponsor'').  Lightstone SLP III LLC (the ''Special Limited Partner''), a Delaware limited liability company of which Mr. Lichtenstein is the majority owner, is a special limited partner in the Operating Partnership and has committed to make a significant equity investment in the Company of up to $36.0 million, which is equivalent to 12.0% of the $300.0 million maximum amount of the Offering. Specifically, the Special Limited Partner has committed to purchase subordinated participation interests in the Operating Partnership (the "Subordinated Participation Interests") quarterly in an amount equal to the product of (i) $10.00 minus our then current NAV per Common Share, multiplied by (ii) the number of our Common Shares outstanding. The Operating Partnership will issue one Subordinated Participation Interest for each $50,000 in cash or interests in real property of equivalent value that the Special Limited Partner contributes. The Special Limited Partner's obligation will continue until the earlier of: (i) the termination of our Offering; (ii) the Special Limited Partner's purchase of an aggregate of $36.0 million of Subordinated Participation Interests and (iii) our receipt of gross offering proceeds of $300.0 million. Through June 30, 2016, the Special Limited Partner purchased an aggregate of approximately 222 Subordinated Participation Interests in consideration of $11.1 million, including approximately 208 Subordinated Participation Interests in consideration of $10.4 million during the six months ended June 30, 2016. The Special Limited Partner may elect to purchase the Subordinated Participation Interests for cash or may contribute interests in real property of equivalent value. The Subordinated Participation Interests may be entitled to receive liquidation distributions upon the liquidation of Lightstone REIT III.  We have no employees. We have retained the Advisor to manage our affairs on a day-to-day basis. Beacon Property Management Limited Liability Company and Paragon Retail Property Management LLC (the ''Property Managers''), both affiliates of the Sponsor, may serve as property managers and/or we may utilize third-party property managers. Orchard Securities, LLC (the ''Dealer Manager''), a third-party not affiliated with us, our Sponsor or our Advisor, serves as the dealer manager of our public offering. In addition to Property Managers, the Advisor is also an affiliate of our Sponsor. These related parties will receive compensation and fees for services related to the investment and management of our assets. These entities will receive fees during our offering, acquisition, operational and liquidation stages.  To qualify or maintain our qualification as a REIT, we engage in certain activities through wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRS"). As such, we are subject to U.S. federal and state income and franchise taxes from these activities.  Current Environment  Our operating results as well as our investment opportunities are impacted by the health of the North American economies. Our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by current and future economic conditions, such as availability of credit, financial markets volatility, and recession.  Our business may be affected by market and economic challenges experienced by the U.S. and global economies. These conditions may materially affect the value and performance of our properties, and may affect our ability to pay distributions, the availability or the terms of financing that we have or may anticipate utilizing, and our ability to make principal and interest payments on, or refinance, any outstanding debt when due.  We are not aware of any other material trends or uncertainties, favorable or unfavorable, other than national economic conditions affecting real estate generally, that may be reasonably anticipated to have a material impact on either capital resources or the revenues or income to be derived from the acquisition and operation of real estate and real estate related investments, other than those referred to in this Form 10-Q.  Portfolio Summary - Percentage Occupied Revenue per Available Average Daily Rate for the Six Room for the Six For the Six Year to Date Months Ended Months Ended Months Ended Location Year Built Date Acquired Available Rooms June 30, 2016 June 30, 2016 June 30, 2016 Des Moines, Iowa 1987 2/4/2015 21,840 66 % $ 79.99 $ 121.53 Durham, North Carolina 1996 5/15/2015 26,572 76 % $ 78.37 $ 103.57 Lansing, Michigan 2013 3/10/2016 9,718 76 % $ 98.36 $ 129.32 Warwich, Rhode Island 2003 3/23/2016 9,200 82 % $ 111.10 $ 135.18 Green Bay, Wisconsin 2007 5/2/2016 7,620 78 % $ 99.78 $ 128.78  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  There were no material changes during the three months ended June 30, 2016 to our critical accounting policies as reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  Results of Operations  During 2015, we acquired our first investment property, the Hampton Inn - Des Moines on February 4, 2015 and subsequently acquired the Courtyard - Durham on May 15, 2015. During 2016, we acquired the Hampton Inn - Lansing on March 10, 2016, the Courtyard - Warwick on March 23, 2016 and the SpringHill Suites - Green Bay on May 2, 2016. As a result, we have five investment properties as of June 30, 2016. The operating results of these investment properties are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations commencing from their respective dates of acquisition.  Our primary financial measure for evaluating the operating performance of our properties is net operating income ("NOI"). NOI represents revenues less property operating expenses, real estate taxes and general and administrative expenses. We believe that NOI is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of our properties.  Comparison of the Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 vs. June 30, 2015  Consolidated  The rental revenue, property operating expenses, real estate taxes and depreciation and amortization for the three months ended June 30, 2016 is attributable to the Hampton Inn - Des Moines, the Courtyard - Durham, the Hampton Inn - Lansing, the Courtyard - Warwick and the SpringHill Suites - Green Bay.

Interest expense  Interest expense was approximately $377,000 during the six months ended June 30, 2016 and compared to $352,000 for the same period in 2015. Interest expense is attributable to financings associated with our hotels.  Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources  Overview:  For the six months ended June 30, 2016, our primary source of funds were (i) $29.0 million of proceeds from our sale of shares of common stock under our Offering, (ii) $14.1 million in net proceeds from our revolving promissory notes payable - related party and (iii) $10.4 million from the purchase of approximately 208 Subordinated Participation Interests by the Special Limited Partner.  We have and intend to continue to utilize leverage either in connection with acquiring our properties or subsequent to their acquisition. The number of different properties we will acquire will be affected by numerous factors, including, the amount of funds available to us. When interest rates on mortgage loans are high or financing is otherwise unavailable on terms that are satisfactory to us, we may purchase certain properties for cash with the intention of obtaining a mortgage loan for a portion of the purchase price at a later time.  Our future sources of funds will primarily consist of (i) proceeds from our sale of shares of common stock under our Offering, (ii) cash flows from our operations, (iii) proceeds from our borrowings, (iv) proceeds from the sale of Subordinated Participation Interests and (v) our DRIP. We currently believe that these cash resources will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for the foreseeable future, and we do not anticipate a need to raise funds from other than these sources within the next twelve months.  As of June 30, 2016, we had two revolving promissory notes, the $8.0 million Lansing Promissory Note and the $14.5 million Green Bay Promissory Note, both from the operating partnership of Lightstone Value Plus Real Estate Investment Trust II, Inc. ("Lightstone II"), a REIT also sponsored by our Sponsor. The Lansing Promissory Note and the Green Bay Promissory Note each had terms of one year, with an option to extend for an additional year that would have expired on May 15, 2017 with an aggregate outstanding principal balance and remaining aggregate availability of $16.2 million and $6.3 million, respectively. However, as discussed below, these two revolving promissory notes were repaid in full on July 13, 2016 and terminated.  Revolving Credit Facility  On July 13, 2016, we, through certain subsidiaries, entered into a $60.0 million revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility"), with Western Alliance Bank ("Western"). The Revolving Credit Facility bears interest at Libor plus 4.95% and provides a line of credit over the next three years, with two, one-year options to extend solely at the discretion of Western. The Revolving Credit Facility may be accelerated upon the occurrence of customary events of default. Interest is payable monthly and the entire unpaid principal balance is due upon expiration of the Revolving Credit Facility. Under the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility, we may designate properties as collateral that allows us to borrow up to a 65.0% loan-to-value ratio of the properties. On July 13, 2016 we received initial advances aggregating $45.4 million under the Revolving Credit Facility which is secured by five hotel properties consisting of the SpringHill Suites - Green Bay, the Hampton Inn - Des Moines, the Hampton Inn - Lansing, the Courtyard - Durham, and the Courtyard - Warwick, and as a result, $14.6 million remained available under the Revolving Credit Facility.  Approximately $14.4 million of the financing proceeds were used to repay in full the aggregate outstanding principal and interest on the Lansing Promissory Note and the Green Bay Promissory Note, which were terminated in connection with the closing of the Revolving Credit Facility. The remaining financing proceeds of approximately $31.0 million may be used for acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital and other general corporate funding purposes, including distributions.  We intend to limit our aggregate long-term permanent borrowings to 75% of the aggregate fair market value of all properties unless any excess borrowing is approved by a majority of the independent directors and is disclosed to our stockholders. Market conditions will dictate our overall leverage limit; as such our aggregate long-term permanent borrowings may be less than 75% of aggregate fair market value of all properties. We may also incur short-term indebtedness, having a maturity of two years or less.  Our charter provides that the aggregate amount of our borrowing, both secured and unsecured, may not exceed 300% of net assets in the absence of a satisfactory showing that a higher level is appropriate, the approval of our Board of Directors and disclosure to stockholders. Net assets means our total assets, other than intangibles, at cost before deducting depreciation or other non-cash reserves less our total liabilities, calculated at least quarterly on a basis consistently applied. Any excess in borrowing over such 300% of net assets level must be approved by a majority of our independent directors and disclosed to our stockholders in our next quarterly report to stockholders, along with justification for such excess. Market conditions will dictate our overall leverage limit; as such our aggregate borrowings may be less than 300% of net assets. As of June 30, 2016, our total borrowings were approximately $16.2 million which represented 24% of our net assets.  Our future borrowings may consist of single-property mortgages as well as mortgages cross-collateralized by a pool of properties. Such mortgages may be put in place either at the time we acquire a property or subsequent to our purchasing a property for cash. In addition, we may acquire properties that are subject to existing indebtedness where we choose to assume the existing mortgages. Generally, though not exclusively, we intend to seek to encumber our properties with non-recourse debt. This means that a lender's rights on default will generally be limited to foreclosing on the property. However, we may, at our discretion, secure recourse financing or provide a guarantee to lenders if we believe this may result in more favorable terms. When we give a guaranty for a property owning entity, we will be responsible to the lender for the satisfaction of the indebtedness if it is not paid by the property owning entity.  In general the type of future financing executed by us to a large extent will be dictated by the nature of the investment and current market conditions. For long-term real estate investments, it is our intent to finance future acquisitions using long-term fixed rate debt. However there may be certain types of investments and market circumstances which may result in variable rate debt being the more appropriate choice of financing. To the extent floating rate debt is used to finance the purchase of real estate, management will evaluate a . . .  Aug 08, 2016  (c) 1995-2016 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS:  You should read the following discussion and analysis together with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following information contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Please see "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" above for a description of these risks and uncertainties.  Overview  Lightstone Value Plus Real Estate Investment Trust III, Inc. (the "Lightstone REIT III" or "Company") primarily has and intends to continue to acquire and operate full-service or select-service hotels, including extended-stay hotels and to a lesser extent commercial and residential properties, principally in North America. Principally through the Lightstone Value Plus REIT III, LP, (the "Operating Partnership"), our acquisitions may include both portfolios and individual properties.  Our registration statement on Form S-11 (the "Offering"), pursuant to which we are offering to sell up to 30,000,000 shares of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share (which may be referred to herein as ''shares of common stock'' or as ''Common Shares'') for an initial price of $10.00 per share, subject to certain volume and other discounts (the "Primary Offering") (exclusive of 10,000,000 shares available pursuant to its distribution reinvestment plan (the "DRIP") at an initial purchase price of $9.50 per share) was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") under the Securities Act of 1933 on July 15, 2014. As of December 31, 2016, we had received gross proceeds of $112.8 million from the sale of 11.5 million shares of its common stock (including $2.0 million in Common Shares at a purchase price of $9.00 per Common Share to an entity 100% owned by David Lichtenstein ("Lichtenstein") our sponsor, who does business through The Lightstone Group, LLC (the "Sponsor") and majority owns the limited liability company of that name.  Capital required for the purchase of real estate and real estate related investments is expected to be obtained from the public offering of shares of our common stock, and from any indebtedness that we may incur in connection with the acquisition of any real estate and real estate related investments.  Even though we intend primarily to acquire hotels, we may use a portion of the offering proceeds to purchase other types of real estate. We believe that at least 75% of the net proceeds raised in the Offering will be used to acquire hotels and the remaining portion of the net proceeds raised in the Offering will be used to acquire properties and real estate-related assets other than hotels. However, we may use more or less than 75% of the net proceeds raised in the Offering to acquire hotels and are not bound to that limit. Assets other than hotels may include, without limitation, office buildings, shopping centers, business and industrial parks, manufacturing facilities, single-tenant properties, multifamily properties, student housing properties, warehouses and distribution facilities and medical office properties. We expect to invest a significant portion of our funds in direct real estate investments and other equity interests, and the remainder of our funds in debt interests, which may include bridge or mezzanine loans, including in furtherance of a loan-to-own strategy. However, we are not prohibited from investing all our funds in debt interests.  We initially expected to offer the Common Shares offered in our Primary Offering over a two-year period, or until July 15, 2016. However, because we had not sold all the Common Shares offered in our Primary Offering within two years, we will continue the Primary Offering for an additional year, until July 15, 2017, provided that the Offering will be terminated if all 30.0 million shares of our common stock are sold before such date. We reserve the right to reallocate the shares of common stock we are offering between the Primary Offering and the DRIP. Additionally, the Offering may be terminated at any time.  We do not have employees. We entered into an advisory agreement with Lightstone Value Plus REIT III LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, which we refer to as the "Advisor," pursuant to which the Advisor supervises and manages our day-to-day operations and selects our real estate and real estate related investments, subject to oversight by our Board of Directors. We pay the Advisor fees for services related to the investment and management of our assets, and we will reimburse the Advisor for certain expenses incurred on our behalf.  To qualify or maintain our qualification as a REIT, we engage in certain activities through a wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiary ("TRS"). As such, we are subject to U.S. federal and state income and franchise taxes from these activities.  Acquisitions and Investment Strategy  We have made and intend to make direct or indirect real estate investments that will satisfy our primary investment objectives of preserving capital, paying regular cash distributions and achieving appreciation of our assets over the long term. The ability of our Advisor to identify and execute investment opportunities at a pace consistent with the capital raised through our public offerings will directly impact our financial performance.  We will continue to seek to acquire and operate hotels and other commercial real estate assets primarily located in the United States. We may acquire and operate all such properties alone or jointly with another party.  The following summarizes our completed acquisitions and investments from our inception through December 31, 2016:  � On February 4, 2015 we acquired a 120-room select service Hampton Inn Hotel (the "Hampton Inn - Des Moines") located in Des Moines, Iowa;  � On May 15, 2015 we acquired a 146-room select service Courtyard by Marriott Hotel (the "Courtyard - Durham") located in Durham, North Carolina;  � On March 10, 2016 we acquired an 86-room select service Hampton Inn Hotel (the "Hampton Inn - Lansing") located in Lansing, Michigan;  � On March 23, 2016 we acquired a 92-room select service Courtyard by Marriott Hotel (the "Courtyard - Warwick") located in Warwick, Rhode Island;  � On May 2, 2016 we acquired a 127-room select service SpringHill Suites by Marriott Hotel (the "SpringHill Suites - Green Bay") located in Green Bay, Wisconsin;  � On August 2, 2016 we acquired a portfolio of two select service Home2 Suites by Hilton Hotels, a 139-room select service hotel located in Tukwila, Washington (the "Home2 Suites - Tukwila") and a 125-room select service hotel located in Salt Lake City, Utah (the "Home2 Suites - Salt Lake" and collectively the "Home2 Suites Hotel Portfolio");  � On September 13, 2016 we acquired an 84-room select service Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Hotel (the "Fairfield Inn - Austin") located in Austin, Texas; and  � On October 7, 2016 we acquired an 80-room select service Staybridge Suites Hotel (the "Staybridge Suites- Austin") located Austin, Texas.  Current Environment  Our operating results as well as our investment opportunities are impacted by the health of the North American economies. Our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by current and future economic conditions, such as availability of credit, financial markets volatility, and recession.  Our business may be affected by market and economic challenges experienced by the U.S. and global economies. These conditions may materially affect the value and performance of our properties, and may affect our ability to pay distributions, the availability or the terms of financing that we have or may anticipate utilizing, and our ability to make principal and interest payments on, or refinance, any outstanding debt when due.  We are not aware of any other material trends or uncertainties, favorable or unfavorable, other than national economic conditions affecting real estate generally, that may be reasonably anticipated to have a material impact on either capital resources or the revenues or income to be derived from the acquisition and operation of real estate and real estate related investments, other than those referred to in this Form 10-K.  Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies  General.  Our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report include our accounts and the Operating Partnership (over which we exercise financial and operating control). All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments about the effects of matters or future events that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and judgments may affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including contingencies and litigation. We base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable in the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  To assist in understanding our results of operations and financial position, we have identified our critical accounting policies and discussed them below. These accounting policies are most important to the portrayal of our results and financial position, either because of the significance of the financial statement items to which they relate or because they require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments.  Investments in Real Estate  We record investments in real estate at cost and capitalize improvements and replacements when they extend the useful life or improve the efficiency of the asset. We expense costs of repairs and maintenance as incurred. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of our real estate assets, which is approximately 39 years for buildings and improvements, 5 to 10 years for furniture and fixtures.  We make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to our investments in real estate. These assessments will have a direct impact on our net income because, if we were to shorten the expected useful lives of our investments in real estate, we would depreciate these investments over fewer years, resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis.  When circumstances such as adverse market conditions indicate a possible impairment of the value of a property, we review the recoverability of the property's carrying value. The review of recoverability will be based on our estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows, excluding interest charges, expected to result from the property's use and eventual disposition. Our forecast of these cash flows will consider factors such as expected future operating income, market and other applicable trends and residual value, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors. If impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a property, we record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property.  We make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the values of our investments in real estate. We will evaluate our ability to collect both interest and principal related to any real estate related investments in which we invest. If circumstances indicate that such investment is impaired, we reduce the carrying value of the investment to its net realizable value. Such reduction in value will be reflected as a charge to operations in the period in which the determination is made.  Real Estate Purchase Price Allocation  When we make an investment in real estate, the fair value of the real estate acquired will be allocated to the acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building and tenant improvements, identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above-market and below-market leases, for acquired in-place leases, and the value of tenant relationships, and certain liabilities such as assumed debt and contingent liabilities, based in each case on their fair values. Purchase accounting will be applied to assets and liabilities related to real estate entities acquired based upon the percentage of interest acquired. Fees incurred related to acquisitions will be expensed as incurred within general and administrative costs within the consolidated statements of operations. Transaction costs such as professional fees, commissions, acquisition fees and closing costs incurred related to our investment in unconsolidated real estate entities, accounted for under the equity method of accounting, will be capitalized as part of the cost of the investment.  Upon acquisition of real estate operating properties, we estimate the fair value of acquired tangible assets and identified intangible assets and liabilities, assumed debt and contingent liabilities at the date of acquisition, based upon an evaluation of information and estimates available at that date, including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property and other relevant market data. Based on these estimates, we evaluate the existence of goodwill or a gain from a bargain purchase and will allocate the initial purchase price to the applicable assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interest, if any. As final information regarding fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interest is received and estimates are refined, appropriate adjustments will be made to the purchase price allocation. The allocations will be finalized within twelve months of the acquisition date.  Revenue Recognition and Valuation of Related Receivables  Our revenue is comprised primarily of revenue from the operations of hotels. Hotel revenue will be recognized as earned, which is generally defined as the date upon which a guest occupies a room or utilizes the hotel's services.  Accounting for Organization and Other Offering Costs  We record selling commissions and dealer manager fees paid to our dealer manager, and other third-party offering expenses such as registration fees, due diligence fees, marketing costs and professional fees as reduction against additional paid-in capital. Any organization costs are expensed to general and administrative costs.  Treatment of Management Compensation, Expense Reimbursements  Management of our operations is outsourced to our Advisor and certain other affiliates of our Sponsor. Fees related to each of these services are accounted for based on the nature of such service and the relevant accounting literature. Fees for services performed that represent our period costs are expensed as incurred. Such fees include acquisition fees associated with the purchase of interests in real estate entities; asset management fees paid to our Advisor and property management fees paid to affiliates of our Advisor. These fees are expensed or capitalized to the basis of acquired assets, as appropriate.  Affiliates of our Advisor may also perform fee-based construction management services for both our development and redevelopment activities and tenant construction projects. These fees will be considered incremental to the construction effort and will be capitalized to the associated real estate project as incurred. Costs incurred for tenant construction will be depreciated over the shorter of their useful life or the term of the related lease. Costs related to development and redevelopment activities will be depreciated over the estimated useful life of the associated project.  Leasing activity at our properties may be outsourced to affiliates of our Advisor. Any corresponding leasing fees we pay will be capitalized and amortized over the life of the related lease.  Expense reimbursements made to both our Advisor and affiliates of our Advisor will be expensed or capitalized to the basis of acquired assets, as appropriate.  Income Taxes  We elected to qualify and be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2015. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our net taxable income that we distribute currently to our stockholders. To maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income, as calculated in accordance with GAAP), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain. If we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT in any subsequent year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, our income for that year will be taxed at regular corporate rates, and we may be precluded from qualifying for treatment as a REIT for the four-year period following our failure to qualify as a REIT. Such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to our stockholders.  We engage in certain activities through taxable REIT subsidiaries TRSs. When we purchase a hotel we establish a TRS and enter into an operating lease agreement for the hotel. As such, we may be subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes and franchise taxes from these activities.  As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had no material uncertain income tax positions. Additionally, even if we qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may still be subject to some U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income and property and to U.S. federal income taxes and excise taxes on our undistributed income.  To qualify or maintain our qualification as a REIT, we engage in certain activities through TRSs. As such, we are subject to U.S. federal and state income and franchise taxes from these activities.  Results of Operations  During 2015, we acquired our first investment property, the Hampton Inn - Des Moines on February 4, 2015 and subsequently acquired the Courtyard - Durham on May 15, 2015. During 2016, we acquired the Hampton Inn - Lansing on March 10, 2016, the Courtyard - Warwick on March 23, 2016, the SpringHill Suites - Green Bay on May 2, 2016, the Home2 Suites Hotel Portfolio on August 2, 2016, the Fairfield Inn - Austin on September 13, 2016 and the Staybridge Suites - Austin on October 7, 2016. As a result, we have nine investment properties as of December 31, 2016. The operating results of these investment properties are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations commencing from their respective dates of acquisition.  Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2016 vs. December 31, 2015  Consolidated  The rental revenue, property operating expenses, real estate taxes and depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2016 is attributable to the Hampton Inn - Des Moines and the Courtyard - Durham and the Hampton Inn - Lansing, the Courtyard - Warwick, the SpringHill Suites - Green Bay, the Home2 Suites Hotel Portfolio, the Fairfield Inn - Austin and the Staybridge Suites - Austin from their respective dates of acquisition.  The rental revenue, property operating expenses, real estate taxes and depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2015 is attributable to the Hampton Inn - Des Moines and the Courtyard - Durham from their respective dates of acquisition.  Rental revenue  Rental revenue increased by $16.4 million to $22.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $6.2 million for the same period in 2015. Approximately $14.5 million of the increase was attributable to the hotels acquired subsequent to the 2015 period and $1.9 million of the increase was attributable to the Hampton Inn - Des Moines and the Courtyard - Durham which did not have a full year of operations in the 2015 period.  Property operating expenses  Property operating expenses increased by $9.4 million to $13.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $3.7 million for the same period in 2015. Approximately $8.1 million of the increase was attributable to the hotels acquired subsequent to the 2015 period and $1.3 million of the increase was attributable to the Hampton Inn - Des Moines and the Courtyard - Durham which did not have a full year of operations in the 2015 period.  Real estate taxes  Real estate taxes increased by $0.6 million to $0.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $0.3 million for the same period in 2015. Approximately $0.4 million of the increase was attributable to the hotels acquired subsequent to the 2015 period and $0.2 million of the increase was attributable to the Hampton Inn - Des Moines and the Courtyard - Durham which did not have a full year of operations in the 2015 period.  General and administrative expense  General and administrative expense increased by $2.0 million to $2.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $0.9 million for the same period in 2015. The increase reflects (i) higher acquisition fees and acquisition-related costs of $1.7 million in the 2016 period and (ii) an increase in accounting and corporate filing fees.  Depreciation and amortization  Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $2.5 million to $3.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $0.7 million for the same period in 2015. Approximately $2.1 million of the increase was attributable to the hotels acquired subsequent to the 2015 period and $0.4 million of the increase was attributable to the Hampton Inn - Des Moines and the Courtyard - Durham which did not have a full year of operations in the 2015 period.  Interest expense  Interest expense was $2.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $0.9 million for the same period in 2015. Interest expense is attributable to financings associated with our hotels. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, interest expense of $0.6 million, which included origination fees of $0.3 million, and interest expense of $0.9 million, which included origination fees of $0.2 million, respectively, was paid to the operating partnership of Lightstone Value Plus Real Estate Investment Trust II, Inc. ("Lightstone II"), a REIT also sponsored by the Company's Sponsor.  Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources  Overview:  For the year ended December 31, 2016, our primary source of funds were (i) $73.9 million of proceeds from our sale of shares of common stock under our Offering,  We have and intend to continue to utilize leverage either in connection with acquiring our properties or subsequent to their acquisition. The number of different properties we acquire will be affected by numerous factors, including, the amount of funds available to us. When interest rates on mortgage loans are high or financing is otherwise unavailable on terms that are satisfactory to us, we may purchase certain properties for cash with the intention of obtaining a mortgage loan for a portion of the purchase price at a later time.  Our future sources of funds are expected to primarily consist of (i) proceeds from our sale of shares of common stock under our Offering, (ii) cash flows from our operations, (iii) proceeds from our borrowings and (iv) proceeds from the potential sale of additional Subordinated Participation Interests to the Special Limited Partner and (v) proceeds from our DRIP. We currently believe that these cash resources will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for the foreseeable future, and we do not anticipate a need to raise funds from other than these sources within the next twelve months.  We intend to limit our aggregate long-term permanent borrowings to 75% of the aggregate fair market value of all properties unless any excess borrowing is approved by a majority of the independent directors and is disclosed to our stockholders. Market conditions will dictate our overall leverage limit; as such our aggregate long-term permanent borrowings may be less than 75% of aggregate fair market value of all properties. We may also incur short-term indebtedness, having a maturity of two years or less.  Our charter provides that the aggregate amount of our borrowing, both secured and unsecured, may not exceed 300% of net assets in the absence of a satisfactory showing that a higher level is appropriate, the approval of our Board of Directors and disclosure to stockholders. Net assets means our total assets, other than intangibles, at cost before deducting depreciation or other non-cash reserves less our total liabilities, calculated at least quarterly on a basis consistently applied. Any excess in borrowing over such 300% of net assets level must be approved by a majority of our independent directors and disclosed to our stockholders in our next quarterly report to stockholders, along with justification for such excess. Market conditions will dictate our overall leverage limit; as such our aggregate borrowings may be less than 300% of net assets. As of December 31, 2016, our total borrowings were $86.9 million which represented 81% of our net assets.  Our future borrowings may consist of single-property mortgages as well as mortgages cross-collateralized by a pool of properties. Such mortgages may be put in place either at the time we acquire a property or subsequent to our purchasing a property for cash. In addition, we may acquire properties that are subject to existing indebtedness where we choose to assume the existing mortgages. Generally, though not exclusively, we intend to seek to encumber our properties with non-recourse debt. This means that a lender's rights on default will generally be limited to foreclosing on the property. However, we may, at our discretion, secure recourse financing or provide a guarantee to lenders if we believe this may result in more favorable terms. When we give a guaranty for a property owning entity, we will be responsible to the lender for the satisfaction of the indebtedness if it is not paid by the property owning entity.  In general the type of future financing executed by us to a large extent will be dictated by the nature of the investment and current market conditions. For long-term real estate investments, it is our intent to finance future acquisitions using long-term fixed rate debt. However there may be certain types of investments and market circumstances which may result in variable rate debt being the more appropriate choice of financing. To the extent floating rate debt is used to finance the purchase of real estate, management will evaluate a number of protections against significant increases in interest rates, including the purchase of interest rate cap instruments. . . .

NEW YORK—Lightstone Value Plus Real Estate Investment Trust III, Inc. announced it has acquired the 120-key Hampton Inn at Des Moines International Airport for $10.9 million. This marks the first acquisition for the public, non-traded REIT. The purchase further increases Lightstone's footprint in Des Moines, adding to its 2013 purchase of SpringHill Suites by Marriott and Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott.
The Hampton Inn is one of the closest properties to the Des Moines International Airport and is in close proximity to downtown Des Moines.
"We're excited to make our third acquisition in the Des Moines area, which represents our confidence in this region, with its strong economy and low unemployment", said David Lichtenstein, chairman and CEO of Lightstone. "This property is strategically located in a highly desirable area that is widely recognized for its significant presence in the insurance and financial services sectors."
The property will be placed under new management, which will be overseen by Lightstone's hospitality division.

With Rise in Travel Spending, Dreams Can Come True
        I took a summer vacation to Alaska. This natural beauty of a state might be our 49th, but it was my 50th. Why all this talk of my summer vacation? Well, Allianz Global Assistance (AGA) just released data earlier this week saying that Americans are spending more on summer vacations this year, topping $100 billion for the first time in the AGA survey’s eight-year history. This represents a 12.5% increase over last year.

NEW YORK, March 6, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, Lightstone Value Plus Real Estate Investment Trust III, Inc. ("LVPR III") announced it has acquired the 120-key Hampton Inn at Des Moines International Airport for $10.9 million. This marks the first acquisition for the public, non-traded REIT.
