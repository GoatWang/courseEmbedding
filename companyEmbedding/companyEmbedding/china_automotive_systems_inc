	·

	·




	Cash

	·




	Net
	cash flow from operating activities was $11.8 million






	 




	Mr.
	Qizhou Wu, chief executive officer of CAAS, commented, "After regaining growth in the third quarter, we are encouraged by
	the acceleration of top line growth as nearly all subsidiaries of CAAS received increased orders from OEM customers during the
	fourth quarter. Many of our top 10 OEM customers such as Great Wall, Geely, and Chang’an posted robust growth in 2016. In
	addition, our product mix change continues to drive our growth and Electric Power Steering (EPS) sales grew nearly 45%, accounting
	for 28% of our total revenue in 2016. Entering 2017, we believe that the auto replacement cycle with new models coming into the
	market and ongoing tax incentives for fuel-efficient vehicles will help continue to propel the growth of auto sales in China.
	As the largest steering system provider in China, we are well positioned to ride the growth and create shareholder value.”




	 




	Mr.
	Jie Li, chief financial officer of CAAS, commented, "We took prudent measures to respond to product recalls as we recorded
	a charge to the cost of sales that affected our gross margin in the fourth quarter. However, we believe that this impact is short-lived.
	With the progress from our R&D program, especially the breakthrough in the key components for EPS systems, we expect our gross
	margin to recover in 2017.”



	 






	 





	 





	 





	Fourth
	Quarter of 2016






	 





	In
	the fourth quarter of 2016, net sales were $149.6 million, compared to $120.1 million in the same quarter of 2015, reflecting
	a 24.6% year-over-year growth. The net sales increase was mainly due to increased auto sales and a shift in the product mix to
	more electric power steering products (“EPS”).




	 




	Gross
	profit was $21.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $20.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The gross margin
	was 14.6% in the fourth quarter of 2016, versus 16.8% in the fourth quarter of 2015. The decrease in gross margin was mainly due
	to the impact of recalls by two customers related to the Company’s products in January 2017. The Company has recorded a
	$5 million charge relating to anticipated costs for the recalls in cost of sales for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2016.
	The recalls were for 152,811 EPS steering units delivered between 2012 and 2015. In one instance, a torque sensor exhibited abnormal
	wear after long-term usage creating a potential risk. In a different steering model, an electronic-assist ECU may malfunction
	under certain circumstances. No serious injuries from these component issues have been reported. The affected steering models
	were early versions of the Company’s EPS technologies which have been superseded with more advanced models.




	 




	Gain
	on other sales was $1.8 million, compared with $1.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.




	 




	Selling
	expenses were $4.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $4.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase
	was primarily due to higher marketing expenses. Selling expenses represented 3.3% of net sales in the fourth quarter of each of
	2016 and 2015.




	 




	General
	and administrative expenses ("G&A expenses") were $4.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $5.7 million
	in the same quarter of 2015. G&A expenses represented 3.2% of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 4.7% in the fourth
	quarter of 2015. The decrease in G&A expenses and G&A expenses as a percentage of net sales during the fourth quarter
	was mainly due to more stringent cost control measures.




	 




	Research
	and development expenses ("R&D expenses") were $8.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $4.6 million
	in the fourth quarter of 2015. R&D expenses represented 5.9% of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to 3.8% in
	the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase in R&D expenses was due to increased investment in EPS product research and development
	such as brushless motor and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) related projects. The Company has hired more engineers,
	acquired more technologies, and purchased more testing equipment.




	 




	Income
	from operations was $5.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $7.1 million in the same quarter of 2015. The decrease
	was mainly due to lower gross profit and higher R&D and selling expenses.




	 




	Interest
	expense was $0.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to interest expense of $0.3 million in the fourth quarter of
	2015 due to the decrease in weighted average loans outstanding.




	 




	Net
	financial income was $0.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to net financial income of $0.9 million in the fourth
	quarter of 2015 due to lower interest income.



	 






	 





	 





	 




	Income
	before income tax expenses and equity in earnings of affiliated companies was $5.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared
	to $7.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The decrease in income before income tax expenses and equity in earnings of affiliated
	companies was mainly due to lower operating income and reduced financial income in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared with the
	fourth quarter of 2015.




	 




	Net
	income attributable to parent company's common shareholders was $5.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to net income
	attributable to parent company's common shareholders of $6.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Diluted earnings per share
	were $0.18 in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.22 in the fourth quarter of 2015.




	 




	The
	weighted average number of diluted common shares outstanding was 31,711,888 in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to 32,131,453
	in the fourth quarter of 2015.

	net sales were $462.1 million in 2016, a 4.2% increase compared to $443.5 million in 2015. The overall increase was mainly due
	to higher volumes and a change in the product mix as electric power steering systems (EPS) sales grew 44.8% in 2016.




	 




	Gross
	profit in 2016 was $80.9 million, compared to $79.5 million in 2015. Gross margin was 17.5% in 2016, compared to 17.9% in 2015.
	The margin decrease was primarily due to the $5 million charge relating to anticipated costs for the recalls by two Company customers
	in cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. A shift in product mix and higher material costs also affected gross profit
	and margin in 2016.




	 




	Gain
	on other sales mainly consisted of the net amount retained from the sales of materials, property, plant and equipment and scraps.
	For the year ended December 31, 2016, gain on other sales amounted to $3.8 million, compared to $4.4 million in 2015.




	 




	Selling
	expenses were $17.2 million in 2016 compared with $15.0 million in 2015, which was mainly due to higher marketing expenses during
	the year. Selling expenses represented 3.7% in 2016, compared to 3.4% of net sales in 2015.




	 




	G&A
	expenses were $16.8 million in 2016, down slightly from $17.0 million in 2015. G&A expenses represented 3.6% in 2016, compared
	to 3.8% of net sales in 2015.




	 




	R&D
	expenses were $27.7 million in 2016 compared to $22.3 million in 2015. R&D expenses are primarily associated with the costs
	incurred with the Company's further development of its EPS technology, including transitioning advanced manufacturing equipment
	to EPS, expanding the EPS trial-production department, hiring technologists and installing advanced technology and test equipment.
	R&D expenses represented 6.0% of net sales in 2016, compared to 5.0% of net sales in 2015. The increase in R&D expenses
	was mainly due to increased expenditures on R&D activities for EPS products.



	 






	 





	 





	 




	Operating
	income was $23.0 million in 2016, compared with $29.7 million in 2015. The decrease was due to higher operating expenses in 2016.
	The operating margin was 5.0% in 2016 compared with 6.7% in 2015.




	 




	Interest
	expense was $0.7 million in 2016, compared to interest expense of $1.3 million in 2015 due to the decrease in weighted average
	loans outstanding.




	 




	Net
	financial income was $1.4 million in 2016, compared to net financial income of $2.9 million in 2015 due to lower interest income.




	 




	Income
	before income tax expenses and equity in earnings of affiliated companies was $24.9 million for 2016 compared with $32.0 million
	for 2015. This decline was mainly due to a decrease in income from operations.




	 




	Income
	tax expense was $2.5 million for 2016, compared to $4.5 million for 2015. This tax decrease was mainly due to lower income before
	tax. The effective tax rate decreased to 10.0% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 14.0% for the year ended December 31,
	2015. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in the tax benefit from the super deduction of R&D expense.




	 




	Net
	income attributable to parent company's common shareholders was $22.5 million in 2016, compared to $27.4 million in 2015. Diluted
	earnings per share were $0.70 in 2016, compared to $0.85 in 2015. The weighted average number of diluted common shares outstanding
	was 31,957,052 in 2016, compared with 32,134,866 in 2015.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
