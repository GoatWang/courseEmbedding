Internap Names George E. Kilguss III as CFO
Seasoned Financial Executive Brings Planning, Reporting, Systems,     and Market Development Expertise to Enable Profitable Growth
ATLANTA, Mar 27, 2008 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- 
Internap Network Services Corporation (NASDAQ:INAP), a global provider of end-to-end Internet business solutions, announced today the appointment of George E. Kilguss III as Internap's Chief Financial Officer effective April 7, 2008. "I am pleased to welcome George Kilguss as Internap's CFO," said James P. DeBlasio, Chief Executive Officer at Internap. "George's skills and experience as a seasoned CFO with publicly traded, high-growth technology companies, combined with his hands-on knowledge of the financial markets, will help drive Internap's expansion into new areas. George has significant and relevant sector expertise, specifically in telecommunications and wireless that will be beneficial to our growth." Mr. Kilguss has significant financial management, operations, and development experience in publicly traded and privately held technology companies as well as the 
investment banking sector. Most recently, he served as the Chief Financial Officer of Towerstream Corporation (NASDAQ:TWER), which delivers high speed wireless internet access to businesses in major metropolitan markets using WiMAX microwave access. While at Towerstream, Kilguss orchestrated the company's initial public offering, was integral to the development and execution of the strategic plan, and raised the necessary capital to enable the company to enter eight new markets with an enhanced product line and a new distribution model. Prior to his tenure at Towerstream, Mr. Kilguss was the Chief Financial Officer of Stratos Global Corporation in Toronto, Ontario providing remote communications products including mobile and fixed satellite and microwave services to over 20,000 customers worldwide (www.stratosglobal.com
). There, he was instrumental in the development of the plan 
to pursue a consolidation strategy in the remote communications market and spearheaded the company's acquisition initiatives. As a result of these efforts, the company completed seven transactions over four years that grew revenues from $3 million to $300 million and drove an increase in market capitalization from $39 million to over $700 million. Mr. Kilguss also has had hands-on experience with capital markets and a wide variety of merger and acquisition activities across industries. As a partner at Riparian Partners and a Vice President at Fleet Financial Group's Investment Bank, he was active in all aspects of investment banking including valuations, mergers and acquisitions, private placements, and debt structuring. Commenting on his appointment, Mr. Kilguss said, "I appreciate the confidence placed in me by Jim DeBlasio and I am excited to be joining the Internap 
team. Working together, we will drive the operational efficiency, management systems and product innovation to expand our existing customer relationships and grow into new markets." Mr. Kilguss holds an MBA in finance and accounting from the University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business in Chicago, Illinois and a BS in economics and finance from the University of Hartford in West Hartford, Connecticut.

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.
