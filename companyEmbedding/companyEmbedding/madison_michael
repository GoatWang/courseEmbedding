Review This Product













            
                From Tyndale to Madison is a sweeping literary work passionately tracingthe epic history of religious liberty across three centuries, from the turbulent waning days of medieval Europe to colonial America and the birth pangs of a new nation. With literally a cast of thousands, the tapestry of world history is on display here. From the remarkable translation work of William Tyndale to the court intrigues of Henry VIII and Thomas More, the battle for the English Bible culminates in the venerable King James Version. Also detailed is the spread of the Reformation through the eyes of Martin Luther, John Knox, and John Calvinin their own, often surprising words. Readers witness the anguish of religious dissenters under the oppressive reign of Bloody Mary and the first sparks of liberty with the rise of Oliver Cromwell and the English Commonwealth. A little more than one hundred years later, across the sea, James Madison, Patrick Henry, and Thomas Jefferson fight to establish a bill of rights that will guarantee every American citizen the "free exercise" of their religion. Without sugarcoating either side of the story, author Michael Farris, an exemplary twenty-first-century statesman and constitutional lawyer who regularly defends religious freedom on Capitol Hill, shares eye-opening historical details regarding the sacrifices people made then to secure the inalienable rights we enjoy today. "We must tell the story of the Christian persecutors, so that we can put to the test the claim that people who cared little about faith and religion were the heroes of liberty. The true heroes are not to be found among the salons of the Enlightenment philosophes, but in the cells in King's Bench Prison and tied to the stake at Smithfield." This is their story.

Early life[edit]
Madison was born October 15, 1977 to Diane Madison and John Baldwin, the result of an accidental pregnancy. Baldwin denied that he was Madison's father and was not a part of his life.[1]
Discovery and arrest[edit]
On July 19, 2013, police responding to reports of a foul odor investigated a garage leased to Madison and discovered a decomposing body lying inside. Two more bodies were found the following day – one in a backyard and the other in the basement of a vacant house. The bodies, which all belonged to African-American women, were found 100 yards (91 m) to 200 yards (180 m) apart and were each wrapped in plastic bags. After obtaining a search warrant, police entered Madison's apartment and found "further evidence of decomposition." After a brief standoff with police at his mother's house, Madison was taken into custody without incident.[2][3]
Court appearance[edit]
On July 22, 2013, Madison was charged with three counts of aggravated murder. His bail was set at six million dollars and he also waived his right to a preliminary hearing.[4]
Trial and conviction[edit]
On October 31, 2013, Madison's attorney David Grant entered a not guilty plea to an updated indictment that included aggravated murder charges; prosecutors had announced that they were now seeking the death penalty, a move his attorney had tried to prevent but had expected. The case has drawn comparisons[by whom?] to that of the now-deceased Ariel Castro, of Cleveland, who kidnapped three area women (Amanda Berry, Gina Dejesus, and Michelle Knight) and held them for 10 years, and also that of death row inmate and fellow Cleveland-area serial killer Anthony Sowell, who was convicted of killing 11 area women. The 14-count updated indictment includes two counts each of aggravated murder for each victim, three counts of kidnapping, three counts of gross abuse of a corpse, one count of rape, and one count of weapons possession by an ex-convict. He had originally been registered as a sex offender in 2002 after serving four years for an attempted rape conviction, having had previous drug convictions in 2000 and 2001.[5]
Madison's trial began April 4, 2016.[6] On May 5, 2016, Madison was found guilty in the murders of Shirellda Terry, Shetisha Sheeley and Angela Deskins.[7] The jury spent less than one day deliberating before returning a guilty verdict on all 13 counts. Madison told the court he plans to appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court.[8] On May 20, 2016, the jury recommended that Madison should be sentenced to death.[9] On June 2, 2016, Cuyahoga Common Pleas Judge Nancy R. McDonnell sentenced Madison to death.[10] During the sentencing, the father of victim Shirellda Terry tried to attack Madison in anger over his daughter's murder.[11]
Victims[edit]
The victims were identified as:

Angela Deskins, 38, a resident of Cleveland who was reported missing in June 2013.[12]
Shetisha Sheeley, 28, who had been missing since September 2012.[13]
Shirellda Helen Terry, 18, who was last seen July 10, 2013, leaving a Cleveland Elementary School where she had a summer job.[14]

Early life[edit]
Madison was born October 15, 1977 to Diane Madison and John Baldwin, the result of an accidental pregnancy. Baldwin denied that he was Madison's father and was not a part of his life.[1]
Discovery and arrest[edit]
On July 19, 2013, police responding to reports of a foul odor investigated a garage leased to Madison and discovered a decomposing body lying inside. Two more bodies were found the following day – one in a backyard and the other in the basement of a vacant house. The bodies, which all belonged to African-American women, were found 100 yards (91 m) to 200 yards (180 m) apart and were each wrapped in plastic bags. After obtaining a search warrant, police entered Madison's apartment and found "further evidence of decomposition." After a brief standoff with police at his mother's house, Madison was taken into custody without incident.[2][3]
Court appearance[edit]
On July 22, 2013, Madison was charged with three counts of aggravated murder. His bail was set at six million dollars and he also waived his right to a preliminary hearing.[4]
Trial and conviction[edit]
On October 31, 2013, Madison's attorney David Grant entered a not guilty plea to an updated indictment that included aggravated murder charges; prosecutors had announced that they were now seeking the death penalty, a move his attorney had tried to prevent but had expected. The case has drawn comparisons[by whom?] to that of the now-deceased Ariel Castro, of Cleveland, who kidnapped three area women (Amanda Berry, Gina Dejesus, and Michelle Knight) and held them for 10 years, and also that of death row inmate and fellow Cleveland-area serial killer Anthony Sowell, who was convicted of killing 11 area women. The 14-count updated indictment includes two counts each of aggravated murder for each victim, three counts of kidnapping, three counts of gross abuse of a corpse, one count of rape, and one count of weapons possession by an ex-convict. He had originally been registered as a sex offender in 2002 after serving four years for an attempted rape conviction, having had previous drug convictions in 2000 and 2001.[5]
Madison's trial began April 4, 2016.[6] On May 5, 2016, Madison was found guilty in the murders of Shirellda Terry, Shetisha Sheeley and Angela Deskins.[7] The jury spent less than one day deliberating before returning a guilty verdict on all 13 counts. Madison told the court he plans to appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court.[8] On May 20, 2016, the jury recommended that Madison should be sentenced to death.[9] On June 2, 2016, Cuyahoga Common Pleas Judge Nancy R. McDonnell sentenced Madison to death.[10] During the sentencing, the father of victim Shirellda Terry tried to attack Madison in anger over his daughter's murder.[11]
Victims[edit]
The victims were identified as:

Angela Deskins, 38, a resident of Cleveland who was reported missing in June 2013.[12]
Shetisha Sheeley, 28, who had been missing since September 2012.[13]
Shirellda Helen Terry, 18, who was last seen July 10, 2013, leaving a Cleveland Elementary School where she had a summer job.[14]

Product Description▼▲
It's often repeated in textbooks, speeches, and non-fiction: religious liberty came from the enlightenment. Farris doesn't flinch away from the history of persecution that did come from Christians, but takes the position that the advocates of freedom didn't believe in religious liberty in spite of their Christianity, but because of their faith in Christ. Tracing the development of religious liberty from medieval Europe to colonial America, this detailed historical overview explores the attitudes and sacrifices that helped drive the dream of religious liberty in America. 496 pages, softcover.

When Keeli and Wyatt cross paths the steam between them is not from the hot  Chicago summer . Can Wyatt trust that this fiery redhead wants him and not his fortune?

Top customer reviews5.0 out of 5 starsGreat read...Byjuliekon May 1, 2016Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseLoved the independent spirit of Keeli! This is one of those books that shows that being classy on the outside (Sloane...) is not the same and is so much less attractive than being classy on the inside (our Keeli!). You have to admire her drive to succeed, and she found the perfect match in Wyatt. Can't wait for the next book in this  Beguiling Bachelors series!Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsI was fortunate to receive this book as a giftByBarb Parkeron June 27, 2016Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseI was fortunate to receive this book as a gift, and while not usually a romance reader, I found this book to be a real 'gem' (excuse the pun!). Not only was it really well written, the characters were interesting, the setting in Chicago a ton of fun, and I found myself invested in the characters, both those likeable and those you love to hate... This is a book I can wholeheartedly recommend on many levels, and i am eager to find out 'what happens next', it is a really a great read!Read more0Comment|

Watkinson July 1, 2016Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseI really enjoyed this book. The writing is witty, sophisticated and smart. The author creates characters who you could imagine are part of your social circle.  You immediately like them. And of course the book contains those you don't route for.  But that is what makes the story so interesting and fun. I love this book and I can't wait to read the rest of the series.Read more0Comment|

It was a perfect read! I could not put it down from beginning to end and I loved the characters, like Wyatt and Keeli. I do not want to spoil anything, but it definitely surprises you at times.
