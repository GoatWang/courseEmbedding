            Terms & Conditions - blooom, inc
    

























Terms & Conditions



 



Last Updated: June 29, 2017
These Terms of Use (“Terms”) set forth the terms and conditions that apply to your access and use of the internet web site (and its contents) located at www.blooom.com or any visitors from affiliations of .poweredbyblooom.com (the “Site”) and the online services offered through the Site (the “Services”). The Site and Services are operated by blooom, inc. (“blooom”), an investment adviser registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and a Delaware corporation, and its affiliates. All Services are provided in accordance with and pursuant to the Client Agreement (“Agreement”) currently in effect, to which Clients (defined below) must agree to be bound. The term “you” refers to a visitor or a client of the Services (a “Client”). The terms “we,” “our” or “us” refer to blooom.
THE TERMS INCLUDE A CLASS ACTION WAIVER AND REQUIRE BINDING ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS.
IF YOU SUBSCRIBE TO SERVICE FOR A TERM (THE “INITIAL TERM”), THEN THESE TERMS WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY RENEWED FOR ADDITIONAL PERIODS OF THE SAME DURATION AS THE INITIAL TERM AT OUR THEN-CURRENT FEE FOR THE SERVICE UNLESS YOU DECLINE TO RENEW YOUR SUBSCRIPTION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE TERMS.
1. ACCEPTING THE TERMS
PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY. BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SITE OR THE SERVICES, COMPLETING THE REGISTRATION PROCESS, AND/OR MERELY BROWSING THE SITE, YOU REPRESENT THAT (1) YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS, (2) YOU ARE OF LEGAL AGE TO FORM A BINDING CONTRACT WITH BLOOOM, AND (3) YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO THESE TERMS PERSONALLY OR ON BEHALF OF THE COMPANY YOU REPRESENT, AND TO BIND THAT COMPANY TO THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SITE OR THE SERVICES.
2. PRIVACY POLICY
We value your right to privacy and take steps to protect it. For more information, please refer to our current Privacy Policy.
3. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES
Our Services provide a web-based advisory service designed to help Clients with their Employer Sponsored Retirement Account(s) (“ESRA”) such as a 401(k) or 403(b) account. Our Services generate investment portfolio recommendations, recommendations of securities to buy and sell, and ongoing rebalancing of your ESRA. Our clients have access to ask questions of blooom Financial Advisors via online chat and email. We rely on accurate information provided by you in order to provide our Services to you.
BLOOOM CANNOT ALWAYS FORESEE OR ANTICIPATE TECHNICAL OR OTHER DIFFICULTIES WHICH MAY RESULT IN FAILURE TO OBTAIN DATA OR LOSS OF DATA, INCREASED COSTS, OR OTHER SERVICE INTERRUPTIONS. WE USE REASONABLE CARE, CONSISTENT WITH SOUND INDUSTRY PRACTICE, IN PROVIDING OUR SERVICES. WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT OUR SERVICES, COMMUNICATIONS, OR ANY CONTENT WILL BE DELIVERED TO YOU UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE. OPERATION OF OUR WEBSITE AND OUR SERVICES MAY BE INTERFERED WITH BY NUMEROUS FACTORS OUTSIDE OUR CONTROL.
BLOOOM MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES REGARDING THE AMOUNT OF TIME NEEDED TO IMPLEMENT INVESTMENT RECOMMENDATIONS IN YOUR ESRA BECAUSE SUCH IMPLEMENTATION IS DEPENDENT ON NUMEROUS FACTORS OUTSIDE OUR CONTROL.
YOU CAN ALWAYS ACCESS YOUR ESRA DIRECTLY THROUGH YOUR CUSTODIAN.
You may cancel our Services at any time. THIS Site is for the use of Clients and potential Clients of blooom. It is not to be used by any other investment advisor or investment professional as an information/marketing materials source, asset allocator, risk capacity or risk tolerance assessment, or for any other purpose.
4. INVESTMENT TOOLS AND MODEL RECOMMENDATIONS
ALTHOUGH BLOOOM SEEKS MULTIPLE ASSET CLASSES FOR ITS CLIENTS IN ORDER TO CREATE WELL-DIVERSIFIED RECOMMENDED PORTFOLIOS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT DIFFERENT OR UNRELATED ASSET CLASSES MAY ALL EXHIBIT SIMILAR PRICE CHANGES IN SIMILAR DIRECTIONS. THIS CORRELATION OF PRICE BEHAVIOR MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT YOUR ESRA ACCOUNT, AND MAY BECOME MORE ACUTE IN TIMES OF MARKET UPHEAVAL OR HIGH VOLATILITY. ALTHOUGH BLOOOM CAREFULLY EVALUATES POTENTIAL ACCOUNT ALLOCATIONS, BLOOOM MAKES NO REPRESENTATION REGARDING THE LIKELIHOOD OR PROBABILITY THAT ANY ACTUAL OR PROPOSED ACCOUNT ALLOCATION WILL IN FACT ACHIEVE A PARTICULAR INVESTMENT OUTCOME OR GOAL. PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT A GUARANTEE OF FUTURE SUCCESS, AND RETURNS IN ANY PERIOD MAY BE FAR ABOVE OR BELOW THOSE OF PREVIOUS PERIODS. BLOOOM IS UNABLE TO PREDICT OR FORECAST MARKET FLUCTUATIONS OR OTHER UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDING INVESTMENT EXPENSE RATIOS THAT MAY AFFECT THE VALUE OF ANY INVESTMENT. BLOOOM DOES NOT MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING THE EXECUTION QUALITY OF ORDERS PLACED WITH THE CUSTODIAN OF YOUR ESRA.
The Services are designed to provide helpful investing guidance. However, you should carefully consider the appropriateness of the proposed allocations in light of your own personal financial circumstances, including cash flow needs, tax circumstances, or other complex or subjective concerns. We urge you to use all available resources to educate yourself about investing in general, as well as the investments and the overall allocation of your ESRA. Additionally, market conditions and your personal financial circumstances may change—perhaps suddenly or maybe gradually over time. We recommend that you reassess any investing program on a regular basis to ensure that it remains consistent with your current financial resources and investment objectives.
Blooom and our communications may include forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements (including words such as “believe,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “may,” “will,” “should,” and “expect”). Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Various factors could cause actual results, investment expense ratio fees or performance to differ materially from those discussed in such forward-looking statements.
Some Clients may have investment results that differ materially. ESRAs managed by blooom may lose value.
During the initial sign-up process, blooom may perform a complimentary fee analysis on your ESRA. The calculations presented in our application are estimates. The analysis we provide is made on a best-efforts basis to determine the internal expenses in your ESRA. The analysis is designed to give you an estimate for the actual costs you incur in your ESRA. You will need to check the prospectus for each fund you own in your account to determine the exact actual costs you incur in your ESRA.
When we calculate your cost-savings we use the average internal expense for the average blooom user’s asset allocation as a baseline comparison. We strive to create the lowest cost portfolio for every client, but we are limited to the fund options available in your ESRA. We cannot achieve in every case the average expense that other blooom users achieve.
5. COMMENTARY
The Site may contain commentary and links to certain articles only as a convenience. Linked articles written by third parties may or may not be affiliated with blooom. No information contained in these articles has been endorsed or approved by blooom, and blooom is not responsible for the content.

This information neither is, nor should be construed, as an offer, or a solicitation of an offer. You shall be fully responsible for any investment decisions and allocations that you make or select while either a Client of blooom or making decisions above and beyond blooom’s recommendations via direct interaction with your ESRA custodian, be it web-based, by phone, or in person. Such decisions will be based solely on your own evaluation of your financial circumstances, age, time to retirement, investment objectives, risk tolerance, and liquidity needs.
Certain information contained in the Site may have been obtained from published sources prepared by third parties. While such sources are believed to be reliable, blooom does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of such information. Neither delivery of these Terms nor any statement herein or on the Site should be taken to imply that any information contained herein or on the Site is correct as of any time subsequent to the date hereof.

Depending on the third party accounts you choose and subject to the privacy settings that you have set in such third party accounts, personally identifiable information that you post to your third party accounts may be available on and through your account on the Services. Please note that if a third party account or associated service becomes unavailable or our access to such third party account is terminated by the third party service provider, then Account Information may no longer be available on and through the Services. You will have the ability to disable the connection between your account on the Services and your third party accounts at any time by amending the appropriate settings from within your account settings on the applicable third party account. PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR THIRD PARTY ACCOUNTS IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT(S) WITH SUCH THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS. We make no effort to review your Account Information for any purpose, including but not limited to accuracy, legality, or non-infringement, other than to construct an appropriate portfolio allocation for you, and we are not responsible for any Account Information. We are not responsible for the products and services offered by or on third-party sites.
7. YOUR REGISTRATION INFORMATION
To access our Services you must first register for an account (“Account”) and electronically sign our Agreement. Our Site is the only means of accessing our Services.
You agree and understand that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password that, together with your Login ID (i.e., your email address), allows you to access our Services. That Login ID and password, together with any other registration information, constitute your “Registration Information.” You represent and warrant that all required Registration Information you submit is true, accurate, current and complete, and, where applicable, that you will update all such Registration Information as necessary to maintain its truth, accuracy, and completeness.
You agree not to create an Account or use the Services if you have been previously removed by us or banned from the Services. You agree not to create an Account using a false identity or information, or on behalf of someone other than yourself. We reserve the right in our sole discretion to suspend or terminate your Account and/or refuse any and all current or future use of the Services (or any portion thereof) at any time for any reason. You agree that we will not liable to you or to any third party for any suspension or termination of your Account or any refusal of any use of the Services (or any portion thereof). We reserve the right in our sole discretion to remove any content that you provide and/or upload to the Services at any time for any reason, including, but not limited to, information you provide for your Account. You agree that we will not be liable to you or to any third party for such removal.
You are responsible for all activities that occur under your Account. You agree to immediately notify us at support@blooom.com of any unauthorized use, or suspected unauthorized use, of your Account or any other breach of security. We will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above requirements.
8. YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICES
Your use of our Services is personal to you and not transferable to any other person or entity. Subject to these Terms, we grant you a non-transferable, non-exclusive, revocable, limited license to use and access the Services, solely for your own personal, noncommercial use and for lawful purposes only. You will need to subscribe for our Services in order to receive investment advice specific to your ESRA.
Blooom’s advisory services are discretionary. Blooom does not and will not accept custody of your assets, although we are deemed to have constructive custody of your assets by virtue of our authority regarding your ESRA. Your assets shall be held by an independent custodian (“Custodian”). Our Services are intended to help you make investment decisions and assist you in your investment management. Our Services are not a substitute for your own informed judgment. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR OWN INVESTMENT DECISIONS. YOU MAY ACCEPT, MODIFY OR REJECT THE PORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT RECOMMENDATIONS PROVIDED BY BLOOOM. WHEN WE GENERATE A RECOMMENDATION FOR YOU, YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO ADJUST THE RECOMMENDATION BEFORE DIRECTING US TO IMPLEMENT THE RECOMMENDATION IN YOUR ESRA AT YOUR CUSTODIAN.
Blooom relies on information provided by you in order to generate your recommendations and cannot be held responsible for any recommendations based on inaccurate information. You acknowledge that if you provide false or inaccurate information to blooom, the investment advice provided to you may not match your investment needs. No Client or prospective Client should assume that the Services serve as a substitute for personalized holistic advice that takes into account all of their current financial circumstances.
Web-based advice has limitations that prospective customers should consider before subscribing to use the Site or our Services. Specifically, in a web-based advisory arrangement, you will not receive investment advice face-to-face, by telephone, or other individualized interaction with an investment advisor. Our Services use our web-based application to facilitate the Client/advisor relationship. Support provided by telephone, live chat, email, and text is for the express purpose of assisting in technical matters, subscription setup, and processing of paperwork. YOU CAN ALWAYS CONTACT YOUR CUSTODIAN DIRECTLY TO IMMEDIATELY CHANGE INVESTMENT ALLOCATIONS EVEN IF YOU ARE A CLIENT. Clients receive investment advice through the web service only, therefore limiting your ability to ask specific investment questions or relay detailed personal information beyond what is gathered through the blooom.com application. Moreover, such a web-based advisory arrangement also limits our ability to assess the unique financial condition of each Client, as well as each Client’s specific investment goals.
We reserve the right, at any time, to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Services (in whole or in part) with or without notice to you. You agree that we will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services or any part thereof.
Unless otherwise indicated, any future release, update, or other addition to functionality of the Services will be subject to these Terms. We make no representation that the Services are appropriate for use in locations other than the United States.
You acknowledge and agree that we will have no obligation to provide you with any support or maintenance in connection with the Services. You agree that we are not obligated to create or provide any corrections, updates, upgrades, bug fixes, and/or enhancements of the Services (each an “Update”). However, in the event we offer an Update, you agree that we may amend these Terms in connection with such Update without specific notice to you and that your use of the Services following such Update is conditioned upon your acceptance of any revised Terms. By using the Services following an Update, you are representing that you have reviewed the then-current version of these Terms and agree to be bound by such version.
You agree that blooom may use your feedback, social media content, suggestions, or ideas (“Feedback”) in any way, including in future modifications of our Services, other products or services, advertising, or marketing materials and that the submission of any Feedback is at your own risk and that we have no obligations (including without limitation obligations of confidentiality) with respect to such Feedback. You grant blooom a perpetual, worldwide, fully transferable, sublicensable, irrevocable, fully paid-up, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, perform, display, distribute, adapt, modify, re-format, create derivative works of, and otherwise commercially or non-commercially exploit in any manner we deem appropriate the Feedback you provide to blooom and to sublicense the foregoing rights. Blooom will not sell, publish or share your feedback in a way that could identify you without your explicit consent.
Blooom does not guarantee continuous, uninterrupted, or secure access to blooom.com or any other website.

It is your responsibility to update your email address when necessary. You acknowledge and agree that all communications sent to you at your email address on record will be treated as if they were delivered to you personally, whether or not you receive them.

Such notice shall be deemed given when received by blooom by letter delivered by nationally recognized overnight delivery service or first class postage prepaid mail at the above address.

                    becoming aware of it.
18. ENDING YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH BLOOOM
Subject to this Section, these Terms will remain in full force and effect while you use the Services.
A Client may terminate their Account at any time.
To close your Account, visit your blooom.com profile page and follow the instructions to close your Account. Your Account will be closed and your ability to log in deactivated immediately. Your Account data will be archived for at least three years or as otherwise required by federal securities laws, and then deleted. Your Custodian will maintain all ESRA records. The provisions of these Terms which by their nature should survive suspension or termination of your Account shall survive, including, without limitation, the provisions relating to blooom’s intellectual property rights, disclaimers, limitations of liability, governing law, arbitration, and waiver of class actions and jury trials.
We may suspend or terminate your rights to use the Services (including your Account) at any time for any reason at our sole discretion, including for any use of the Services in violation of these Terms. Upon termination of your rights under these Terms, your Account and right to access and use the Services will terminate immediately.
Blooom may immediately terminate your Account at any time by emailing you written notice. In particular, blooom may terminate your Account if you have breached any provision of your Agreement or these Terms (or have acted in a manner that clearly shows that you do not intend, or are unable, to comply with the provisions of your Agreement or these Terms).
19. MODIFICATIONS
Blooom may modify these Terms from time to time. We will notify you of changes to these Terms by posting the new Terms at blooom.com/terms-and-conditions/ and updating the “Last Updated” date above. If we make any material changes, we may notify you by sending you an email to the last email address you provided to us (if any). Any changes to these Terms will be effective upon the earlier of 30 calendar days following our dispatch of an email notice to you or posting of the new Terms (if applicable). These changes will be effective immediately for new users of the Services. Continued use of the Services following notice of such changes will indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of such changes. PLEASE REGULARLY CHECK THE SITE TO VIEW THE THEN-CURRENT TERMS.
20. BROWSER SUPPORT
Blooom supports the two latest versions of the following browsers: Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari. We cannot guarantee the accuracy or functionality of any advice or information offered on the Site unless viewed in a supported browser.
21. FEES AND PURCHASE TERMS
You agree to pay all fees or charges to your Account in accordance with the fees, charges, and billing terms in effect at the time a fee or charge is due and payable. Such fees and charges include, without limitation, the fee for your subscription to the Services. Except as otherwise described herein or in our billing terms in effect at the time a fee or charge is due and payable, all fees are nonrefundable.
All payment information that you provide in connection with the Services must be accurate, current, and complete. YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL RIGHT TO USE ANY PAYMENT CARD(S) OR OTHER PAYMENT MEANS USED TO PAY ANY FEE OR CHARGE. By providing us with your payment information, you agree that we are authorized to invoice you immediately for all fees and charges due and payable to us hereunder and that no additional notice or consent is required. You agree to notify us immediately of any change to your payment information. We reserve the right at any time to change our prices and billing methods, either immediately upon posting on the Site or by email delivery to you.
You will be responsible for paying any applicable taxes relating to your payments hereunder and will indemnify and hold us harmless from any and all taxes, including sales tax, based on any payments made or received by you in connection with the Services. Any taxes imposed on payments will be your sole responsibility. Upon our request, you will provide us with official receipts issued by the appropriate taxing authority, or other such evidence that you have paid all applicable taxes.
Your subscription to the Services will continue indefinitely until terminated in accordance with these Terms. After your initial subscription period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will automatically commence on the first day following the end of such period (each a “Renewal Commencement Date”) and continue for an additional equivalent period, at our then-current price for such subscription. You agree that your Account will be subject to this automatic renewal feature unless you cancel your subscription at any time prior to the Renewal Commencement Date by closing your Account (see Section 18 above). If you cancel your subscription, your subscription will immediately terminate. By subscribing, you authorize us to charge your method of payment now, and again at the beginning of any subsequent subscription period. Upon renewal of your subscription, if we do not receive payment, (i) you agree to pay all amounts due on your Account upon demand, and/or (ii) you agree that we may either terminate or suspend your subscription and continue to attempt to charge your method of payment until payment is received (upon receipt of payment, your Account will be activated and for purposes of automatic renewal, your new subscription commitment period will begin as of the day payment was received).
Blooom offers a refer-a-friend (Ambassador) program. For more information, please refer to our current Promotion Terms at https://www.blooom.com/terms-promo. Terms subject to change without prior notice.
22. THIRD PARTY LINKS
The Services may contain links to third-party websites and services (collectively, “Third-Party Links”). Such Third-Party Links are not under our control, and we will not be liable for any Third-Party Links. We provide access to these Third-Party Links only as a convenience to you, and we do not review, approve, monitor, endorse, warrant, or make any representations with respect to Third-Party Links. You use all Third-Party Links at your own risk, and should apply a suitable level of caution and discretion in doing so.
23. GOVERNING LAW & ARBITRATION
Except to the extent that it is preempted by federal law, the laws of the State of Kansas, consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, will govern the construction, validity, and administration of your Agreement and these Terms, without giving effect to any principles that provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to these Terms. However, nothing in your Agreement or these Terms will be construed contrary to the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.
If a dispute or claim arises relating to your use of the Site or the Services or these Terms (“Dispute”), you agree to contact blooom to give us the opportunity to resolve the Dispute. Either party may request arbitration if such Dispute cannot be resolved within 60 days after presenting the Dispute to the other party. All Disputes that cannot be resolved informally (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Section. This Section applies to you and blooom, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under these Terms.
The arbitration of any Dispute shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association and conducted in accordance with the then current and applicable rules of the American Arbitration Association as modified by this Agreement (the “Arbitration Rules”). The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than US$10,000.00 may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is US$10,000.00 or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the United States, the arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time, and place of any oral hearing. The arbitrator may not award relief in excess of or contrary to what these Terms provide, order consolidation or arbitration on a class wide or representative basis, award punitive or consequential damages or any other damages aside from the prevailing party’s actual damages, or order injunctive or declaratory relief, except that the arbitrator may award on an individual basis damages required by statute and may order injunctive or declaratory relief pursuant to an applicable consumer protection statute. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Any
                    arbitration shall be confidential, and none of you, blooom or the arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by law or for purposes of enforcement or appeal of the arbitration award. If any portion of this Section is determined by a court to be inapplicable or invalid, then the remainder shall still be given full force and effect.
Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorney’s fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the American Arbitration Association.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, blooom may seek injunctive or other equitable relief to protect its confidential information and intellectual property rights in any court of competent jurisdiction.
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ALL DISPUTES MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, and instead elect that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Section. In the event any litigation should arise between you and blooom in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND BLOOOM WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and instead elect that the dispute be resolved by a judge.
In any circumstances where these Terms permit the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Johnson County, Kansas, for such purpose.
In no way shall these Terms constitute a waiver or limitation of rights that you may have under federal or state securities laws to pursue a remedy by other means.
24. MISCELLANEOUS
These Terms, together with the Agreement, constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the use of the Site and the Services. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The word “including” means “including without limitation”. If any provision contained in your Agreement or these Terms is or becomes invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in whole or in part, such invalidity, legality, or unenforceability shall not affect the remaining provisions and portions of your Agreement or these Terms and the invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law. Our failure to enforce a provision of these Terms is not a waiver of our right to do so later.
Neither party is an agent or partner of the other. These Terms, and your rights and obligations herein, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without our prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void. We may freely assign these Terms. The terms and conditions set forth in these Terms will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon permitted assignees.
The Services may be subject to United States export control laws and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries. You agree not to export, reexport, or transfer, directly or indirectly, any U.S. technical data acquired from us, or any products utilizing such data, in violation of the United States export
                    laws or regulations.
We are located at: 5325 W. 115th Place, Leawood, KS 66211.

26. BUSINESS CONTINUITY STATEMENTS
SEC rules require investment advisors to create and maintain a disaster recovery and business continuity plan. In accordance with these rules, blooom has developed a plan that will enable us to continue to meet our responsibilities as a fiduciary and manage critical business operations when we are affected by natural
                    disasters, power outages, or other significant events.
Blooom makes no representations or warranties that our Services will continue without interruption in all circumstances.
Our plans address the actions and considerations that will be taken in response to a significant disruption. Our initial priority will be the safety and security of our employees and business partners. Account access will be restored as soon as possible, followed by other critical business operations. YOU CAN ALWAYS ACCESS YOUR ESRA DIRECTLY THROUGH YOUR CUSTODIAN.
If there is a location disruption such as due to tornado or fire, our plans call for us to establish operations at an alternate location.
We maintain sophisticated backups of all our data in a secondary location so that any regional disruption will not affect our data integrity. We intend for Account access to be available through this secondary location if our primary location should suffer a disruption.
27. QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS
Reach out to us. If you have questions, comments, concerns or feedback for these Terms, our Privacy Policy or any security concern, send an email to: info@blooom.com.

blooom Believes in Flat-Fee Pricing.
 
 
 


We think charging clients as a percentage of their retirement account balance is old-school and lacks transparency. Some of our employer-clients are so worried about their employees’ financial well-being they sponsor blooom for everyone. Other employers choose to have their employees pay. We’re happy either way.
 
 

Also, we don’t believe in pricey, time-consuming set up, so we don’t charge you a dime to get blooom rolling for your employees.

Blooom Review 2017 


 


Arielle O'Shea 

January 3, 2017




















SavedSave 



Advisors, Investing





The recent and rapid rise of robo-advisors has left one significant hole in the market: Few of these advisors manage workplace retirement plans like 401(k)s, which hold many of America’s retirement assets.
Enter Blooom, which exclusively manages defined contribution plans: 401(k)s, 403(b)s, 457s, 403(a)s and thrift savings plans. The company manages nearly $500 million in assets. It uses automated technology and human advisors to make the most of a client’s plan offerings, then checks for rebalancing opportunities every 90 days. Clients have access to financial advisors via chat and email. There’s no account minimum, and Blooom charges a flat fee of $10 a month.

Where Blooom shines
401(k) management: An employer-sponsored plan like a 401(k) is the primary retirement savings vehicle for many people. However, it’s rare for an online advisor to manage them; most deal exclusively with individual retirement accounts and taxable accounts. The field isn’t completely without competition, though it’s close: Vanguard Personal Advisor Services and Personal Capital both offer 401(k) guidance, but not direct management. Blooom excels in its ability to manage any 401(k), no matter where the account holder works or where the account is held. There’s no need for your employer to have a partnership with the service.
No account minimum: Beginner savers can have Bloom manage their accounts right from the start, giving them a better shot at getting off on the right foot.

Free analysis: Anyone can connect and analyze a 401(k) for free, a process that’s about as painless as it gets. You create a Blooom account and link your 401(k) by selecting your provider and logging in on Blooom’s site. Using a flower as a symbol of your 401(k)’s health, the company shows how your existing allocation is faring and suggests ways to improve it. At that point, do-it-yourselfers could easily take those recommendations and change their asset allocations on their own. Investors who want help can sign up for management with Blooom, which includes rebalancing every 90 days. Blooom sends its customers an email notification each time it makes an adjustment.
Investment expense audit: Employer plans generally offer limited investment options, many of which carry higher-than-average fees. Blooom works within the investments available in the account by classifying each fund option into one of 14 categories. Then the company’s algorithm selects the fund in each bucket with the lowest internal expense ratio. Although there are many instances when there’s only one fund in each category — and, as such, no way to lower expenses — this method can help investors lower their expenses overall while maintaining an appropriate asset allocation and diversification.
Financial advisors: We ding any company that doesn’t have direct phone support for its customers. But if that doesn’t matter to you, you’ll be happy with Blooom’s email and chat support, which includes access to financial advisors. The company says these advisors are available to answer any financial planning question, including questions that fall outside of 401(k) management — things like debt repayment, budgeting and preparing for major life events.
Cost: There’s something to be said for Blooom’s clean, flat monthly fee. Investors know exactly how much they’re paying, and the fee is charged to a credit or debit card rather than being skimmed from the account balance. But there’s a downside to flat fees, too. In order to compare costs with other advisory services, both robo and human, it’s important to evaluate that fee as a percentage of the assets under management.
Here are a few examples of Blooom’s pricing at various account levels:




Account balanceFee as percentage of assets per year




$2,0006%


$10,0001.2%


$25,0000.48%


$50,0000.24%


$100,0000.12%




Blooom says its median account balance is $33,100 — $10 a month on that balance works out to an annual fee of 0.36%. For comparison, human advisors typically charge around 1% of assets under management, and robo-advisors typically range from 0.25% to 0.35%. Given that Blooom is one of the few robo-advisors that manages 401(k)s, and that the company offers customers access to financial advisors, we think that’s a reasonable charge.
Where Blooom falls short
Limited investor assessment: The company sign-up process, which involves linking your 401(k) account by signing in with your user name and password, is straightforward. But it may not be comprehensive enough from an investing standpoint. The questions that determine how Blooom allocates your assets don’t delve any deeper than your birthday and target retirement age, and no mention is made of risk tolerance or investment goals. Some of that can be explained by the company’s focus on employer retirement plans: It rightly assumes that the goal of every client is retirement. However, investors of every age vary in their risk tolerance, and that should be considered. Blooom says that many investors aren’t confident in their risk tolerance and that the company’s streamlined application makes the service more appealing.
Aggressive allocation: For the sake of testing, several NerdWallet staffers — ranging in age, though all under 40 — linked their 401(k) accounts to Blooom. All were given the same asset allocation recommendation of 100% exposure to stocks. Bloom says its algorithm tends to favor equities until the investor is roughly 20 years from retirement. Many investors would consider this too aggressive; few people have the stomach for this strategy, even with an investment manager like Blooom watching their backs. Investors who don’t agree with the allocation that Blooom recommends can change it by simply moving a slider during the sign-up process.

Is Blooom right for you?
Blooom earns four stars from NerdWallet because it brings much-needed investment management to employer-sponsored retirement plans, which are usually the primary retirement vehicle for those who have them. Few other robo-advisors have tapped this market, and those that have either require high account minimums or don’t provide the kind of comprehensive management that Blooom offers. If you’re looking for a robo-advisor for your 401(k), Blooom is the best option.
But before signing up, do the math to figure out what percentage of assets you’ll pay based on your account balance and how that will change as your balance grows. You can cancel the service at any time, and it’s easy to do because your 401(k) remains where it is. Investors can also test drive the service with the company’s free analysis tool.

PH saves time. And I like that. UpvoteShare·3 years agoZach Anderson Pettet@zachpettet · blooom inc.@sarahintampa Fees are confusing. We get a lot of questions about them. Just to clarify, that's kind of an apples to oranges comparison. While Wealthfront charges basis points which will increase the dollar amount your paying as the account balance increases, blooom keeps it simple and transparent. We charge $1/mo. if your account is less than $20,000 and $15/mo. if it's over $20,000. That amount will never increase. We do this because we understand that charging basis points can get confusing for the average investor and we want the client to know EXACTLY what they're paying.

Welcome to the newest member of the Dog Bloom family at Sundowner Retrievers




Meet Zena, Duestch Drahthaar. Super sweet and very smart. She is 7 months old and from Germany.  



 If you can always be cheerful, ignoring aches and pains,If you can resist complaining and boring people with your troubles,If you can eat the same food every day and be grateful for it,If you can understand when your loved ones are too busy to give you any time, If you can take criticism and blame without resentment,If you can conquer tension without medical help,If you can relax without alcohol, If you can sleep without the aid of drugs,











 
Then You Are Probably The Family Dog!
 















And you thought I was going to get all spiritual.Handle every stressful situation like a dog.If you can't eat it or play with it, Pee on it and walk away.
