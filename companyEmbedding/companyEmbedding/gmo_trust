What You Need to Know About GMOs

By Kate  Siegel, Suzanne  Verity









Genetically modified organisms -- plants and animals whose genes have been changed by scientists -- aren't just thought over, they're fought over. GMOs often make news related to the environment, world hunger, the economy, politics, and yes, even health.
Those against them say eating foods made from GMOs is bad for you. Those in favor argue that you're way better off from the benefits that GMOs and other science-based innovations bring to the farm, the store, and the table.
A 2015 survey by the Pew Research Center shows this divide. Nearly 9 out of 10 scientists from the American Association for the Advancement of Science say GMOs are "generally safe" to eat. Though if you're like more than half of U.S. adults from the general public in that same survey, you think you probably shouldn't eat them.
People disagree about when you should call something genetically modified. They argue about whether or not food made with GMOs should be labeled. They debate the long-term effects that producing and eating them will have on our planet and our bodies.
So what do you need to know to make good choices for your health?

Nature on Fast-Forward

Let's start with the basics. Changes to genes aren't necessarily a bad thing. They happen in nature. In fact, no matter what's on the menu, it isn't exactly the same as what grew hundreds or thousands of years ago.
Bits of DNA, called genes, are responsible for all sorts of characteristics and traits in every living thing, from height to how certain cells work. Useful traits help the plants and animals with them survive or thrive better than ones without them, so they get passed along and eventually become common.
Our ancestors sped up the process when they saved seeds of cream-of-the-crop plants to grow the next time, and the next, and the next. That's what turned small bunches of tiny kernels on tall grass 10,000 years ago into the big ears of juicy corn on the cob we have today. With animals, picks of the litter were paired to breed "new-and-improved" babies.

Faster still -- bypassing many, many generations and seasons -- are the ways that scientists create today's genetic changes, or modifications. They alter the DNA of seeds with radiation or chemicals, then choose which resulting plants to breed.
Or they can snip a gene (or several) from a plant, virus, or bacteria and plug it in to another to transfer a desired feature. These more precise and targeted adjustments, often referred to as genetic engineering, create what people typically think of when they hear "GMOs." Sometimes scientists move genes that come from the same kind of thing, like from one tomato plant to another. But they can mix different species, too, like a virus and a tomato plant.

Why Bother?

Mixing plant species is how we've gotten papayas free of viruses, corn plants that survive drought, soybeans that stand up to weed killer, potatoes that don't bruise, and crops that yield more and cost less. That's good news for our food supply and the business of farming.
Some GMOs are specially made to be packed with extra vitamins, minerals, and other health benefits. For example, Swiss researchers created a strain of "golden" rice with a lot of beta-carotene, an antioxidant good for your eyes and skin. Soybeans whose fats have been changed so they're more like olive oil can be turned into a heart-healthy replacement for oils with trans fats that's more heat-tolerant and better for cooking. And those bruise-free potatoes are supposed to cut down on cancer-causing chemicals created when spuds become french fries.
Some biotech companies are doing experiments to make meat better for us, such as boosting the amount of omega-3-fatty acids in it. These essential fats help prevent heart disease and stroke and may protect against cancer and other conditions. They may also help control lupus, eczema, and rheumatoid arthritis. But your body doesn't make them, so you have to get them from food.
As the population grows, it's going to get harder to feed everyone. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) estimates food production will need to double in some parts of the world by 2050. GMOs are one way to make enough nutritious food available with limited land, water, and other resources.
But people worry about pollen and seeds from genetically engineered plants spreading beyond the fields where they were planted. Or what could happen if genetically modified animals mate with non-modified or wild ones.

Are They Safe?

Many critics think of the DNA in GMO-based foods as if it's toxic, a bad thing, says Alison Van Eenennaam, PhD, cooperative extension specialist in animal genomics and biotechnology at the University of California, Davis. As unappetizing as it may sound, "DNA has always been part of our diet, and it's digested in your stomach along with the rest of your food," she says. "There is not some evil trace of poison."
We got ruby red grapefruits through natural mutation, yet "few are questioning the safety of all the random genetic changes that went into their development," says Kevin Klatt, a PhD student in the molecular nutrition program at Cornell University. What seems to make people uncomfortable is when those changes happen deliberately in a lab.
A group of scientists did an extensive review of research on the safety of crops from GMOs over the past 10 years. They found no significant harm directly tied to genetic engineering.
And the American Medical Association thinks genetically modified foods are OK. Part of an official statement notes that in almost 20 years, no clear impacts on human health have been reported or confirmed in professional journals.
The World Health Organization agrees. They, along with the FAO, maintain a set of science-based standards, guidelines, and practices called the Codex Alimentarius to promote good, safe food for everyone. It includes biotechnology and genetic engineering, too. Many governments draw from the Codex to write their regulations and recommendations.
But there are still big differences of opinion, even among some scientists and doctors.
Stephen MacDonald, PhD, a biotechnology and business strategy consultant, agrees that all foods -- at the most basic level -- are made of the same stuff. Even so, he doesn't dish up GMO-based foods for dinner because he's not convinced they have the same exact nutritional value. "I don't think they are dangerous per se, but I don't trust the data that says they are entirely safe either," he says.
"But," Klatt says, "there is no evidence that exposing foods to chemicals or radiation is 'safer' than methods of genetic engineering." Over the last 60 years, these approaches to causing genetic changes in seeds has given us around 3,000 altered crops. Why isn't there as much fuss over them? "The public might be less familiar with traditional breeding techniques and therefore less concerned," he says.

The Role of the FDA

The FDA's job is to make sure all food -- genetically altered or not -- is safe to eat.
Through the Plant Biotechnology Consultation Program, the FDA raises safety concerns during the engineering process and helps developers identify the kinds of testing they should do.
A team of FDA scientists reviews information provided by the developer. They look at how a genetically engineered food compares to the original. Is it different nutritionally? Did the new genes introduce something that could be harmful? For example, a soybean enriched with a protein from a Brazil nut wasn't brought to market, even as animal feed, because tests showed that it might trigger a reaction for people with an allergy to those nuts.
You can't catch a disease or get a virus from a plant, but every now and then one makes its way from animals to humans, like swine flu and bird flu. Because animal viruses may be used in genetic engineering, some people worry they could infect humans or other animals that eat meat produced this way.
That's why the FDA takes a slightly different approach with genetically engineered animal products. They've issued guidance to help developers meet the high standards of the Codex Alimentarius and U.S. food safety regulations. The Center for Veterinary Medicine makes sure the animal is different in the way the developer says it is and that it's safe to eat. The FDA is also required by the National Environmental Policy Act to consider potential significant impacts of GMO animals on the environment, like how easily they could spread disease.
For a genetically engineered salmon that grows to full size in about half the time it normally takes, the FDA wanted to know how likely these fish would be to mix with ones whose genes haven't been tinkered with and how likely they would be to survive and reproduce if they did. To minimize the risks, the developer raises the salmon in secure facilities in Canada and Panama. The tanks aren't connected to any body of water, and they have barriers such as screens and nets to prevent fish and eggs from getting out as well as birds and other predators from getting in. The salmon grown for food are sterile.
A GMO food isn't allowed in stores in the U.S. until the FDA team is satisfied it's safe. Ultimately, the developer is legally responsible for the food's safety, like any other product we eat.

Can GMOs Change Your DNA?

Even though it's never happened before, some people fear that you could become genetically modified from eating GMO food. But genetic material doesn't get tacked on like pin the tail on the donkey. An "added" gene isn't going to fall off and get stuck to yours.
Bacteria-fighting enzymes and processes in your body are designed to prevent a genetic invasion. As a report from the American Medical Association's Council on Science and Public Health explains, if an outside germ somehow survived digestion and got into your gut bacteria, it would have to be enough like your own DNA, in just the right place at just the right time, to glom onto one of your genes and change it.
To put things in perspective: It's just as possible (or impossible) for non-GMO foods to change your genes. Anything you eat has DNA that's "foreign" to you.
Even so, scientists take great care not to use genes that have any hint that they might cause problems.

What's in Your Food?

Even though you may not realize it, you probably eat GMOs now. Up to 80% of processed foods in the U.S. have them.
Most of the sugar we eat comes from beets, and almost all of them are GMOs these days. Changing their genes has brought about bigger, better sugar beets that are stronger and last longer than those grown in the past.
And whatever the source, "It's just sugar or sucrose. No DNA, no protein," Van Eenennaam says. "There isn't something different or extra in sugar that comes from a bioengineered sugar beet." Nothing in the sugar can tell you where it came from. You can't avoid eating "genetically engineered sugar" because it doesn't exist, she explains.
Engineered corn is the source of a lot of cornstarch used to thicken soups and sauces as well as the corn syrup that sweetens foods and drinks. Cottonseed, canola, and soybean oils made from GMOs go into mayo, salad dressing, cereal, bread, and snacks galore.
But way more GMOs -- as much as 90% of what's grown -- are used as animal feed. Studies show there is no difference in the makeup of meat, milk, eggs, or other food that comes from animals who've been fed them.
And the animals themselves are just as healthy as those that eat non-GMO meals. The FDA looks out for them by testing the safety of animal feed, too.


Continued

Can You Avoid Them?

China, Australia, and the European Union require GMO foods to be labeled, but the U.S. doesn't. Many states are in the process of passing laws about the labeling and sale of genetically engineered food, but some federal lawmakers are trying to overrule them and prevent that.
The FDA favors voluntary labeling and has published recommendations for manufacturers. The agency also takes public comments about this guidance and is considering some citizen petitions.
The question of what could need a label is another sticky subject. Foods created by changing genes with radiation or chemicals don't fall under GMO regulations and wouldn't have to be labeled. The latest methods of genetic engineering aren't covered by older rules, so you won't see labels on those foods either. But the National Academy of Sciences says this inconsistency doesn't make sense: What matters is the fact that genes have been artificially changed, not the way it was done.
If you want to stay away from GMOs, eat only fresh, whole, unprocessed foods marked "certified organic" or "USDA organic." That's how MacDonald shops. But the makers of these foods tag them on the honor system, and they're not checked by the government. And it's OK for these claims to appear on foods developed from genes originally altered by chemicals or radiation.
Claims of "non-GMO" and "GMO free" can't be scientifically or legally supported by any testing methods. But the nonprofit Non-GMO Project has independently certified specific foods and products from more than 1,900 brands as made with best practices for avoiding GMOs: Look for the Non-GMO Project Verified seal.
In the produce section, only a few things might be GMOs:

Edamame
Papayas from Hawaii
Summer squash
Sweet corn
Zucchini

The faster-growing salmon, which the FDA cleared in November 2015 after several years of study, will probably be the first animal GMO in the supermarket, after guidelines are set for how to label it. Even if that happened today, it would be months or years before you could buy any.
Stores like Earth Fare, The Fresh Market, Sprouts Farmers Market, and Whole Foods want to make sure their customers know what they're buying and have choices. These grocers offer their own non-GMO products as well as stocking other brands without GMOs. When you're dining out, your best bet is a restaurant that uses organic ingredients.


Continued

The Great Plate Debate

The overwhelming science so far says that GMOs won't hurt us. But concerns like the chance -- however unlikely -- that GMOs may cause genetic changes, allergies, or other serious harm to your health leave room for further study. There could be consequences no one thought to look for, or traits scientists can't test for yet, or worst-case scenarios reviewers hadn't considered.
For his peace of mind, MacDonald would like to see more careful, well-designed studies done in unbiased academic settings, free from the influence of politicians and special interest groups.

Where GMOs hide in your food
New Consumer Reports’ tests find genetically modified organisms in many packaged foods—including those labeled 'natural' 
Published: October 2014 




























More than 70 percent of Americans say they don’t want genetically modified organisms in their food, according to a recent Consumer Reports National Research Center survey of 1,000 adults. The trouble is, it’s hard to avoid them. Consumer Reports’ tests of breakfast cereals, chips, soy infant formulas, and other popular products found that GMOs lurk in many packaged foods—including some that carry labels suggesting that they don’t have these controversial ingredients.




In more than 60 countries, manufacturers must label foods that contain genetically modified ingredients. But GMO labeling isn’t required in the U.S. Yet our survey found that 92 percent of Americans want genetically modified foods to be labeled. And concerns about the potential health and environmental risks of GMOs coupled with an unwillingness on the part of the federal government to mandate labeling are leading many states to take action on their own.
Vermont recently passed legislation requiring GMO labeling, and similar actions are being considered in more than two dozen other states, including Colorado and Oregon, where residents will begin voting on a GMO-labeling ballot initiative in late October. “Federal law already requires labeling that lets consumers know whether foods have been previously frozen, made from concentrate, pasteurized, or irradiated, and we believe the label should also say if food is genetically engineered,” says Jean Halloran, director of Food Policy Initiatives at Consumers Union, the policy arm of Consumer Reports.













What are GMOs, anyway?
Genetically modified organisms are created by deliberately changing the genetic makeup of a plant or animal in ways that could never occur in nature. The majority of GMO crops currently on the market have been genetically engineered to produce their own pesticides and/or withstand herbicides that normally would kill them.  Farmers use the herbicides to control weeds.













Safety concerns
You may be surprised to know that the federal government has not mandated that genetically modified organisms be proved safe before they're used in your food. But safety assessments are mandatory in other major developed countries, including China, Japan, and the countries of the European Union. Some animal studies suggest that GMOs may cause damage to the immune system, liver, and kidneys. “There hasn’t been enough research to determine whether GMOs are harmful to people,” says Michael Hansen, Ph.D., senior scientist at Consumers Union and an authority on genetic engineering. “But scientists around the world agree that GMOs have the potential to introduce allergens and create other unintended changes that may affect health.”
The use of genetically modified seeds has steadily grown over the last two decades. That has led to about a 10-fold increase in farmers’ use of glyphosate, a weedkiller better known as Roundup, which is made by Monsanto—a company that also produces genetically modified seeds—because the herbicide won’t harm their GMO crops. But that in turn has created a new problem for farmers to battle: a rising number of “superweeds” that have now become immune to glyphosate. “This defeats one of the major reasons why GMOs were introduced in the first place,” Hansen says.   












The food industry’s take
Companies that produce genetically modified organisms and their allies in the food industry argue that genetic engineering is just an extension of traditional breeding, which humans have been doing for thousands of years. But that process involves the transfer of DNA between closely related plants or animals. Genetic engineering techniques, on the other hand, move genetic material from any organism to any other organism.  




There is fierce opposition to GMO labeling from many seed manufacturers and big food companies, which have spent nearly $70 million in California and Washington state alone to defeat GMO-labeling ballot initiatives. One of the major arguments they make is that stamping foods with a statement such as “contains GMO ingredients” implies that those foods are inferior to other conventional or organic foods when there’s no evidence that genetically modified organisms are harmful. “Our position is that GMO foods should be labeled, period," Halloran says. "Consumers have the right to know what’s in their food so that they can make informed choices." (Learn what you can do to support mandatory GMO labeling.)




GMOs are found in surprising places
GMO labeling should be required in the U.S., but in the meantime some food manufacturers are choosing not to use genetically modified ingredients and are noting that on their products' packaging. To see how many foods have GMOs and whether you can trust the claims you see on food packages, we bought more than 80 different processed foods containing corn or soy between April and July 2014. (Corn and soy are the two most widely grown genetically engineered crops in the U.S.) We tested at least two samples of each product, each sample from a different lot, to measure the GMO content. Then we compared our results with any non-GMO-related claims.







Find a list of all the products we tested in our full report.








Genetically modified corn and soy are used in a wide variety of foods. Nearly all of the samples we tested of the products that did not make any non-GMO-related claim on the package did, in fact, contain substantial amounts of genetically modified corn or soy. They included many familiar foods, such as Kellogg’s Froot Loops, General Mills Corn Chex, Jiffy Corn Muffin Mix, Doritos Oven Baked Nacho Cheese chips, and Boca Original Vegan Veggie Burgers. Four of the products in this group were soy-based infant formulas: Enfamil ProSobee Soy Infant Formula, Gerber Good Start Soy, Similac Soy Isomil, and Similac Go & Grow Soy Infant formula.








Because our tests represented only a small slice of the market, we can’t draw conclusions about all products containing corn or soy, or about every product for a given brand.  But until genetically modified organism labeling becomes mandatory, our test results can help you decode the meaning behind the claims you see on grocery store shelves.

Organic claims 
This indicates that a third party has certified that the product complies with USDA Organic guidelines, which forbid the use of genetically modified organisms. Our tests found that products with organic ingredients—such as Amy’s All American Veggie Burgers, 365 Everyday Value Organic Corn Tortillas, and Soy Dream Vanilla Frozen Dessert—qualified as non-GMO. Many of the products that make organic claims also make some kind of non-GMO claim on their packaging.

Non-GMO Project Verified seal 
All of the products we tested with this seal qualified as non-GMO. That means the product had no more than 0.9 percent genetically modified organisms. (In EU countries, products that have ingredients that contain more than 0.9 percent genetically modified organisms are required by law to carry GMO labeling.) The Non-GMO Project certifies manufacturers' products through third-party testing. Among the products we tested that carried this seal were Post Grape Nuts Original cereal and Silk Original soymilk.









Uncertified non-GMO claims 
These claims made by the manufacturer—which may include the words "No GMO" and "Non-GMO"—have no standard definition and don’t require independent verification. Even so, most of the products we tested containing nonorganic corn or soy that made an uncertified claim met non-GMO standards. These included Clif Builder’s Chocolate Peanut Butter Bar and Bob’s Red Mill Golden Corn Flour.
The exception was Xochitl Totopos de Maiz original corn chips. The package read “No GMO” and “All Natural.”  But our tests showed that the amount of genetically modified corn in the six samples we tested averaged more than 75 percent. The manufacturer said it uses corn from a supplier that provided test results with many of the deliveries Xochitl received indicating that the corn was non-GMO. When we tested samples from two packages of Xochitl Totopos de Maiz Organic White Corn Chips, which were also labeled "No GMO," we found that the product met non-GMO standards.




Natural claims 
More than 60 percent of people in our national survey said they believed that “Natural” means “No GMOs.” But that’s not what our tests found. Virtually all of the samples we tested of products that made only a "Natural" claim did have a substantial amount of GMOs, although since we did our testing some manufacturers have removed the "natural" claim or have become Non-GMO Project Verified.
 “The confusing nature of this claim is just one reason we are asking the government to ban the use of 'natural' labels on food,” says Urvashi Rangan, Ph.D., director of the safety and sustainability center at Consumer Reports.  
—Andrea Rock 






Take action

If you’re in favor of genetically modified organism labeling efforts and you live in Oregon or Colorado, your vote this fall obviously can communicate that message. Those who live elsewhere can contact their state legislators to express their support for mandatory labeling. This is especially important if you live in one of the more than 30 states that have legislation pending on this issue.You also can contact your Congressional representatives in Washington, D.C., to urge them to support the Genetically Engineered Food Right to Know Act, a federal bill calling for mandatory labeling that has been introduced by Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-California) and Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Oregon).  ‪And for more information on GMO food and updates on labeling, go to NotinMyFood.org.

To the Editor:Re “On Hawaii, a Lonely Quest for Fact” (front page, Jan. 5):Your article about genetically modified crops says that there is a “global scientific consensus” that they are safe, and suggests that opponents are driven by emotion, not fact.As a medical research scientist, I disagree that there is any such consensus, and there is no evidence that any genetically modified product is safe. There is no required safety testing, no epidemiological study relating consumption to health.Although the industry aggressively tries to discredit all studies showing potential harm, there are many showing toxicity in animals that predict serious medical consequences in humans from long-term exposure. Finally, contrary to industry claims, genetically modified crops have produced no increase in yield, have elevated the use of herbicides tenfold, and have resulted in no social or economic benefit except for the reduction of factory farm labor costs.The public has every right to distrust what it is told about genetically modified food safety.DAVID SCHUBERT

 The writer is a professor at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies.To the Editor:Your article about the struggle to ban genetically modified crops sadly demonstrates how belief without evidence is trumping science (belief based on evidence). There is not a shred of valid evidence that such crops pose any danger; all the worldwide evidence points to major benefits.As a child, I often read of recurrent famines in places like India and China that caused millions to starve to death. These days we no longer hear of such famines. Why? Because of the Green Revolution. The Green Revolution has saved a billion lives. The use of genetically modified organisms, an extension of the Green Revolution, has increased agricultural yields and developed crops designed to combat specific nutritional deficiencies (“golden rice” is an example). Do devotees of the anti-G.M.O. religion regret this?Effective solutions to the many far-reaching problems of this world will be achieved only by the intelligent and wise application of science. Banning G.M.O. crops is an appalling step in the wrong direction.MARVIN SCHISSEL
Roslyn Heights, N.Y., Jan. 5, 2014To the Editor:Your article about the Hawaii councilman and his “lonely quest” for facts about genetically modified crops ignores the most fundamental problem associated with G.M.O.’s: In most cases they are used to prop up an inherently fragile and profoundly destructive agricultural model that we ought to be figuring out how to replace.Most of the problems that G.M.O.’s “solve” are the inevitable consequence of industrial monoculture: a single species and often a single genome planted acre upon acre and sometimes county upon county.

There is a whole world of research, some of it mainstream, some of it small-scale and informal, on ways to grow diverse crops and raise livestock in ways that compromise little in the way of yields but that create natural barriers against disease, while building the soil instead of degrading it.

Although many G.M.O. opponents have taken the bait, it’s in the interest of the companies and endowed institutions that promote G.M.O.’s to let this issue degrade into a narrow debate about whether particular G.M.O. crops cause health problems in those who consume them. That’s an important question that shouldn’t be ignored, but it’s a side issue.DAVID RUBENSTEIN
Minneapolis, Jan. 6, 2014To the Editor: The lonely quest of Greggor Ilagan, the Hawaii councilman, to understand genetically modified organisms is a poignant reminder that technology is neither good nor bad; it is a tool. How the tool is wielded determines the balance of benefits and risks.Since the dawn of agrarian society, this has held true for the scythe as well as for G.M.O’s.JEFFREY H. TONEY
Union, N.J., Jan. 5, 2014To the Editor:As the parent of a child with a complex array of allergies, I rely on accurate and comprehensive labeling every time I shop. Unfortunately “trust us” is not good enough when it comes to undocumented food sources — not to mention how the practice of not labeling G.M.O. foods frustrates the responsibility we have for our children.The article leaves many questions unanswered: What regulations exist on G.M.O. foods? What proofs are required, in the name of public safety, before G.M.O. products go to market? Why should we ease the burden of proof from companies that make G.M.O. products? Why are citizens being denied their right to information about what they eat?Scientific consensus has a long history of U-turns. For now I say no to anonymous G.M.O.’s. Let the public decide.DAVID LINCOLN

As more consumers avoid genetically modified organisms, manufacturers that fail to label whether their products contain GMOs are at an increased risk of losing consumer trust and relevance, according to The Hartman Group. 
 


 
A consumer survey conducted by the market research firm recently revealed that four out of 10 consumers claim to be avoiding or reducing genetically modified foods in their daily diet, and 23% of consumers are buying more non-GMO products than last year.The main reason for avoiding GMOs given by 71% of consumers is they are concerned about the possible impact of GMOs on their health and well-being, followed by 48% of consumers who said they avoid GMOs because they “want to know exactly what goes into the food I eat,” according to the Hartman Organic & Natural 2014 report
. “But, when probed, very few [consumers] can identify any singular specific health issue or disease risk to GMO consumption through their diet,” which suggests “their stated health concern [is] really a concern about transparency,” according to the report.“Fear of the unknown is driving most of the attitudinal concerns among consumers,” the report adds, noting that as a result 66% of consumers support mandatory GMO labeling and nearly half support banning the ingredients.Many manufacturers are responding by labeling when products do not include GMO, with more than 24,500 bearing the Non-GMO Project Verified seal, according to Caroline Kinsman, communications manager for the Non-GMO Project.  


She notes that since the first Non-GMO Project product was verified in 2010, “we have been experiencing exponential growth” and “are verifying approximately 500-600 products each month.”Consumers are drawn to products with the seal because it offers them transparency into what they are eating and provides assurance that they are consuming “the most trusted alternatives to GMO food and products available today,” Kinsman said.Manufacturers that fail to label their products one way or the other risk losing consumer trust and could face liability issues in the near future, according to The Hartman Group.“The increasing availability of Non-GMO and labeled products further erodes consumer trust in companies who remain silent,” the group notes, adding that “taking a proactive approach to labeling GMOs is likely to be perceived as positive in terms of transparency and care for the consumer.”Consumer perception of sealsBut simply qualifying for the Non-GMO Project Verified seal is not a panacea for food manufacturers facing the threat of lost sales due to GMO concerns, The Hartman Group’s research reveals.It found a 57% of GMO adverse consumers are not aware of the Non-GMO seal, followed by 12% who have seen the seal but do not know what it means and 16% who are familiar with it but do not consider it when making food and beverage choices. Currently, only 15% of GMO adverse consumers and 28% of core organic consumers actively look for the seal when making food and beverage choices, according to The Hartman Group’s report.Many GMO adverse consumers also do not trust the USDA Organic seal to identify non-GMO products, the report reveals.“Although very trusting of the USDA organic seal when shopping for organic foods/beverages,” only 49% of GMO adverse consumers would use the seal to identify non-GMO products, according to the report.This may be due to so few consumers knowing that products must be non-GMO to qualify as certified organic. The report found only 9% of GMO adverse consumers and 8% of core organic consumers correctly stated without a prompt that USDA certified organic products did not contain GMO ingredients.“Long term, non-GMO’s overlap with organic is likely to become more widely known in the coming years, reducing its uniqueness,” but until then manufacturers of organic foods might consider the redundant certification, according to The Hartman Group. It adds that current consumer behavior suggests the Non-GMO Project Verified seal will most likely “create the strongest correlation to purchase in non-organic, but otherwise natural, fresh dairy, meat and select center store categories. More education necessaryConsumer education about GMOs beyond using seals also is important for food manufacturers because GMO is “a nebulous concept” that many consumers do not understand, which is generating mistrust of the food industry as a whole, The Hartman Group said.It explains that while most consumers have heard of GMOs, confusion lingers about what they are, what foods they are in and the pros and cons of them.Only 52% of consumers say they know what GMOs are, only 30% know which crops are most likely to be GMO and only 28% know which products have GMO ingredients.This lack of understanding is generating concerns that damage the overall food industry’s reputation, the report’s findings suggest.For example, some consumers view GMOs as “unnatural and manipulated in a laboratory for questionable purposes,” and others believe companies using GMO ingredients “are putting profit over consumers’ health,” according to the report. In addition, “indignation over producers of GMOs treating small farmers poorly and using coercive and unfair business tactics” reflects poorly on the food industry, The Hartman Group notes.The easiest solution might be labeling GMOs, it adds, given that “continued silence of food companies on the issue, as well as some companies’ attempts to fight labeling, only fuels consumer distrust and fears that companies are hiding something.”

Thank you
Thank you for a factual and unbiased article on this issue. It's nice to read a news article that's actually an account of 'what is' rather than another opinion piece. Nicely done, in my opinion. These are some good insights into consumer thinking on GMO foods and the Non-GMO project label.

Is Organic Always GMO Free?

Posted on May 5, 2011  by  GMO Awareness 


Organic is Usually GMO Free
Buying 100% Organic, certified Organic, and USDA Organic-labeled products is usually the easiest way to identify and avoid genetically modified ingredients.
The United States and Canadian governments do NOT allow companies to label products “100% / Certified Organic” if they contain genetically modified foods.
To put it in more detail:
100% Organic: Must contain 100 percent organically produced ingredients (excluding water and salt). This is the only label that certifies a completely organic product AND completely GMO-free ingredients.
Certified Organic / USDA Organic: At least 95 percent of content is organic by weight (excluding water and salt). The <5% remaining ingredients must consist of substances approved on the USDA’s National List. GMOs are NOT on this list, so USDA Organic products are also usually GMO-free. For verification, consult the following sources:

The USDA’s National Organic Program overview page
The USDA’s National List of Allowed and Prohibited Substances
The USDA’s Organic 101 blog
A 2011 USDA policy memo in response to confusion over GMOs in organics
The National Organic Standards Board Policy and Procedures Manual

Made with Organic: Up to 70% of the ingredients are organic. These products can NOT carry a “USDA organic” label, however their “remaining non-organic ingredients are produced without prohibited practices, including genetic engineering.”
But lately, even organic products are at risk….

Why Say “Usually?”
If USDA certification requires at least 95% of content to be organic, and a GMO ingredient can’t be included in that 5%, then USDA Organic is GMO-free, right? Not always. Depending on the product, sometimes there are tiny loopholes.
Says Barry Estabrook (author of Politics of the Plate) in this excellent article: “The casings for those tasty USDA Organic sausages can come from conventionally raised animals that have been fed antibiotics (or GMO-laden corn). The hops in your favorite organic beer can be sprayed with all manner of chemical pesticides and fertilizers.”
The USDA’s loophole list also includes two far more common ingredients: non-organic cornstarch (which in our opinion is long overdue for removal from the “acceptable” list, considering how many sources of organic cornstarch are now readily available to commercial food manufacturers), and soy lecithin (though only one form of soy lecithin is allowed, and only when an organic option is not available).
The loophole list includes a few surprises too, such as the use of antibiotics on organic apples and pears, in order to prevent fire blight. Fortunately the National Organics Standards Board recently decided to disallow this practice effective October 2014.
How are these organic loopholes possible? Typically it’s because there is no readily available, commercially manufactured organic option for that particular product or ingredient (though in the case of organic cornstarch, we beg to differ). If you’re curious to know more, here’s a great article that describes how these decisions get made.
But sometimes there’s another reason… says Barry: “The National Organic Standards Board (NOSB), which has the power to determine what materials can — and cannot — be used in organic production, too often weakens regulations in the face of intense lobbying by corporations who are more interested in the higher profits conferred by the word “organic” than in strong and meaningful standards.” And let’s just remember how much Monsanto has invested in corporate lobbying dollars…
Getting discouraged yet? There’s more…
Despite rigid organic certification procedures, organic certification is about the *process* of growing food, not about the actual resulting food. There is no testing process for organic ingredients, so there is a chance that GMO contamination could occur.
And sadly, GMO contamination can happen any number of natural ways: 1.) via cross-pollination between GMO and non-GMO crops, 2.) from trace amounts of GMO ingredients found in animal feed (as per the alfalfa/bluegrass section above), 3.) from seeds traveling by wind or by migratory birds that take root in the soil of an organic farm, and 4.) from ingredient suppliers that co-mingle various sources.
Just look at this recent response from the USDA regarding a series of questions raised by organic farmers after GMO alfalfa was approved. A similar situation is already happening in Australia— a farmer just lost his organic certification due to wind-borne contamination from a neighboring GMO crop.
Even more sobering is the potential contamination from genetically engineered Kentucky Bluegrass. This grass is used in animal forage — including grass-fed animals. Now that Kentucky Bluegrass been genetically engineered for RoundUp resistance, not only does it contain genetic material that is no longer natural, but it can be heavily sprayed with RoundUp to remove weeds. And because grass spreads rapidly, it’s only a matter of time before this becomes the next superweed.
Last but not least, “contamination” can also happen when it takes nearly three years for a manufacturer who illegally uses the term “organic” in their labeling to be noticed, reported, investigated, and forced to amend their label. The oversight of organic manufacturers “falls far short of assuring standards are met.”
Buying USDA Organic / GMO Free
As explained above, buying USDA Organic is by no means a failsafe. However at this point in time, USDA Organic remains one of the best and most easily-identifiable ways of assuring that you are eating GMO-free foods most of the time.
Want to take it one step further? Buy products that are also certified by the Non-GMO Project. The certification process behind this label is currently the best possible way of assuring that you are eating GMO-free food (though bear in mind, not all of the products bearing the Non-GMO Project label are organic—for the best of both worlds, chose products that also include the USDA Organic label).
Sadly however, just like organic certification, the word “usually” once again comes into play: the Non-GMO Project’s website clearly states that its label does not guarantee a product is 100% GMO-free, because contamination is an ever-growing threat. So what does the label really mean?

GMO Free Certification Process
When you see the above label on a product, it means the producer took additional time, effort and money to go through a certification program similar to the one used to obtain organic certification, only it’s designed to focus on GMO-free processes.
Started initially by retailers, the Non-GMO Project’s Product Verification Program (PVP)‘s core requirements include “traceability, segregation, and testing at critical control points.” Compliant products bear the Non-GMO Project Seal shown above (explained in detail here), indicating that the product has been produced in accordance with the best practices of the Non-GMO Project Standard.
Read a great article about the reasons why this program was started, despite similar process testing procedures for organic products.
Another GMO Free Certification Process
Those of you who are familiar with Natural Food Certifiers‘ “Apple K Kosher” certification process / label will be happy to know that the organization now offers their own non-GMO verification program and label, called GMO Guard. Announced in 2013, NFC’s program “meets the no-GMO verification needs for the entire food chain from farm to table, is designed to be as clear and easy to navigate as possible, and remain affordable.”

When you see a “GMO free” label on an organic product, how does it compare to certified organic or certified Non-GMO Project standards? Hard to say.
Because there is no certification program associated with this label, it is simply the producer’s word that all fields, ingredients, processes, and storage avoid contact with, and contain no genetically modified ingredients.
This doesn’t mean this label isn’t valid; sometimes producers can’t afford the cost of becoming certified organic or certified through the Non-GMO Project, and thus use this label as a sign of good faith.
And because so many consumers don’t know that Certified Organic = GMO free (I didn’t, until I did the research), it can be a more obvious and affordable way of letting customers know.
No label in sight? Sometimes you need to read the fine print: some manufacturers don’t include a little GMO free icon, but they do include the words “we don’t use genetically engineered ingredients” (or similar wording) on the back of their labeling (hope you brought your reading glasses to the grocery store). 🙂
Organic versus Certified Naturally Grown
When the USDA Organic program started in 2002, many small farms were forced to make a difficult choice: either pay high certification fees and complete mounds of paperwork to become “Certified Organic,” or give up using the word “organic” to describe their produce and/or livestock.
Believing that neither choice was very attractive, a group of farmers created Certified Naturally Grown (CNG), to provide an alternative way to assure their customers that they observed strict growing practices. Their methods include using natural biological cycles – incorporating a careful balance of micro-organisms, soil flora and fauna, natural pollinators, plants and animals – to create a sustainable farming system.
The resulting products meet and in some cases exceed the USDA standards but do not carry any of the official government approved organic seals. CNG now consists of more than 500 member farms in 47 states and growing.
Note: the majority of the CNG producers (farms and apiaries) that I perused included the words “GMO free” in their product descriptions.
Other “Natural” Product Labeling Terms
Additional labeling terms – such as Natural, Cage Free, Free Range, Certified Humane (raised and handled), Vegetarian Diet, Fair Trade, and Locally Grown – have no direct relevance to whether a product is GMO free (genetically modified vegetables can and do get used in animal feed sometimes… particularly corn fed to pigs, cows and chickens).

The Even Longer Story Behind GMOs and Organics
(includes excerpts from The Organic and Non GMO Report website)
To have a product certified as organic, a producer/manufacturer/farmer must undergo third party verification to ensure that the requirements of USDA National Organic Program are met. These requirements certify the process of growing the crop (they do not test the resulting crops/food). Processes that are reviewed include:
• All production methods — which must be free from most synthetic chemicals (e.g. pesticides, herbicides & fertilizers, antibiotics & hormones), genetically modified organisms, irradiation, and use of biosolids;
• All farmlands — which must be free from synthetic chemicals for generally 3 or more years;
• Storage procedures — producers must keep strict physical separation of organic products and non-certified products
• On-site inspections — producers are subject to initial (and sometimes subsequent) inspections.
Want to read an even more detailed description about organic certification? click here.
Organic certifiers want to ensure that GMOs are not used in organic products, but getting 100 percent verification that all substances are non-GMO may not be possible. Apparently the effort is significant, and requiring 100 percent verification could grind a processor’s operation to a halt.
Due to a lack of guidance from US National Organic Program (NOP), organic certifiers have developed their own methods to address GMO challenges posed by non-organic ingredients (for that <5% of non-organic ingredients allowed in foods labeled organic).
Oregon Tilth Certified Organic and CCOF developed flowcharts or “decision trees” to evaluate the GM status of ingredients. Quality Assurance International (QAI) developed a GMO Declaration that it asks clients to submit to verify the non-GMO status of ingredients.
Says Gwendolyn Wyard, Oregon Tilth’s processing program reviewer, “The problem is that “organic” is a process certification. We’re asking whether they use GMOs, not whether there is GM DNA or protein in the final product.”
Verifying the non-GM status of some ingredients can be challenging. For example, the supply of the ingredient tocopherol/Vitamin E has been controlled by one or two companies who collected soybean oil from many co-mingled sources. Oregon Tilth requires that tocopherols come from an identity preserved, non-GM source, but Quality Assurance International (QAI) does not require an IP (identity preserved) tocopherol, says Jessica Walden, QAI technical specialist.
Instead, QAI developed a “GMO Declaration” to address questions raised by the NOP’s rule on genetic engineering. The declaration describes QAI’s policy toward GMOs focusing on three categories:
When a product is a non-organic agricultural ingredient such as cornstarch, in order to qualify as non-GMO in “Organic” and “Made with Organic” categories, the original organism that produced the ingredient must be non-Genetically Modified. When a product is a non-organic non-agricultural ingredient, such as flavors and colors, the product must be free from Genetically Modified DNA or proteins. Lastly, if microorganisms such as citric acid are used, the microorganism must be a non-GMO.
On the declaration, the supplier must highlight measures taken to verify their non-GMO claim, such as traceability/identity preservation, GMO testing, and independent audits.
QAI’s GMO declaration has streamlined the response from suppliers for GMO documentation. Instead of receiving various GMO statements, QAI has its clients submit the GMO declaration.
Reading all of this, you gain a new respect for farmers who not only buck the industrial farming system by going organic, but by their perseverance in navigating the volumes and diverse methods of certification!
So what does this all boil down to, when you’re trying to choose a product?
Just this week I was looking for mayonnaise at my local natural foods co-op. They had a fairly broad selection of various organic mayonnaises from different manufacturers.
All of the mayo labels said “organic” somewhere on the label. Two of them said USDA Certified Organic. But only one had “GMO free” in addition to “organic” on the label. Coincidentally, it was the only mayonnaise that was not made from one the “Big Four” GMO crops (corn, soy, canola or cotton seed oil).
Does that mean it was the only mayo that was GMO free? No. The others were labeled organic, which technically means they couldn’t be GMO. Yet they didn’t have a “non-GMO” label, and they were sourced from crops with high incidences of GMO farming (soy and canola).
I tried consulting my two “non GMO shopping list” iphone apps, but none of the mayo brands on the shelf were mentioned (either as a pro or a con).
So I ended up playing it extra safe and buying the safflower-based mayo with the Non-GMO label.

I am concerned with organic juices, and other items containing water, can it be considered organic if they use fluoridated water?


Reply ↓ 





Thank you thank you thank you from me, my fmialy, the planet and all of its occupants.  May the people rise up and be heard.


Reply ↓ 





Kim that’s a very good question. Water sources are not something typically divulged in ingredients lists, and would likely require direct contact with the food manufacturer to detetermine. Speaking from personal experience, I have found that a friendly email is often met with a reply… and if nothing else, begins to raise awareness at the manufacturer’s level about what their consumers care about.


Reply ↓ 





I have the same concern regarding organic food that’s grown abroad. Say Mexico for example: although the food is USDA organic certified, how do we know that the water sources are clean? Especially knowing the fact that in many part of Mexico, even local don’t drink tap water. How do we know that the water used for irrigation is free of contaminates?

I LIKE TO KNOW THAT

After calling the FDA, flouridation is a by product of chamicals and is natural.
When i asked where do i find rhe definition of this special term natural, thay said is not defined and is an unregulated word.
Good luck, there is no regulation on the disclosure of fluoride.


Reply ↓ 





Unfortunately they do not consider the poison fluoride a contaminant, so they can use it in the process. When it comes to the USDA certification, the government just put a man in charge of their organic certification that was an executive for Monsanto, and under the USDA guidelines, beef can be fed and injected with anything up till the last 4 to 6 weeks before slaughter, when they must be fed only organic feed, but the damage has already been done. The best way to be sure of what you get is to go to a local farm if possible and grow your own gardens, these can be grown in cities as well as in the country, just use raised beds and get rid of the lawn.

I’ve done some research on this.  Certified organic does not mean it is non-GMO, according to what I found out. Nor is there any such thing as government certification for non-GMO.  There are private certifications, but they are not regulated by the government, which can then mean you have to simply trust them (like I trust the government). The problem with non-GMO is there is NO national standard, and it can be very misleading to consumers to claim “non-GMO” in a product.


Reply ↓ 





Jouh, I did extensive research myself. And while it’s true, that there is no way to guarantee a product is truly GMO-free (due in part to cross-contamination, testing of practice versus product, and companies who are quite simply not telling the truth) Certified Organic does indeed have established parameters to prevent GMOs in the product. If you check my links you will see I have sourced actual documents wherever possible. Now I will agree that many of us have lost faith in both the government and private certifications, but underneath that is a lack of faith in any human effort, and I am more of a “glass half full” person who wants to believe that somewhere, somehow, the truth will prevail 😀

Thank you for this information, it is so sad that we live in a world where food is becoming less of a solution and more of a problem.  Greed is the standard and those with less will suffer so much more.  Safe, healthy, nonmodified, hazard free food should really be the goal of all providers, governments and even big business!!! Money should not mean more than human life!!!


Reply ↓ 





You are most welcome Tameca. It is sad… but I take comfort that we live in a country where we have choices. I couldn’t agree with you more…


Reply ↓ 





Are we really sure that we have choices? Just because we are on the subject, does to you sounds like we have a choice when our govenrment  imposes us to drink water added with fluoride? Have anyone even asked why we are coerced to drink water with fluoride? I made a research and turns out that constant assumption of fluoride is unhelthy, in particular for the adverse effects having on the human epithelial gland, the most important gland in our body. This is an extract of what I discovered: “…Fluorosis a progressive degenerative disorder resulted from excessive intake of fluoride (F) either by natural or by anthropogenic sources and most commonly through drinking-water. Endemic fluorosis is prevalent in many parts of the world and often seriously impairs the health of human or animals. Fluorosis causes damage not only to skeletal tissue and teeth but also to soft tissues such as brain [1]. Several studies indicated that excessive exposure to fluoride may be associated with central nervous system dysfunction. Animal studies have shown that chronic or subchronic fluoride exposure may lead to changes in behavior and neurodegeneration [2–4]. Intelligence Quotient (IQ) in children with exposure to high fluoride levels in drinking water was reduced [5–7]. Although the toxic effects of fluoride on the central nervous system were found, the specific mechanisms remained unknown…”. My question is: why should authorities add fluoride to our waters but not for example vitamines or other substances? Seen the effects of fluoride, such as reducing human IQ and seen the autority decision to impose us consumption of such substance, couldn’t the answer be that fluoride is a very easy way for the government (allies of the powerful rich) to keep people mentally AND SO SOCIALLY QUITE AND OBBIDIENT so that the reacher can become reacher and powerful without having to deal with people that would be otherwise incomodous if belligerant? This is a theory that I heard from other as well and makes perfectly sense to me, maybe because my IQ level is still in good condition due to the fact that I lived most of my life in Europe where fluoride is not imposed by governments in water???  Something to carefully think about it!








Spittin real shit my nigga. Keep fightin’ the good fight.














that’s the truth

I use a relatively affordable over the counter water filtration system that removes fluoride from my drinking water, among other harmful elements it filters. It’s ten stage water filtration/ Enviro Products by New Wave, for which you can buy refill cartridges.

You are most welcome! I heard a fascinating talk on a local news station last night, comparing the long fight for no GMOs to the long fight for equal marriage rights in the U.S. Though marriage rights laws have been attempted and failed many times over the years, finally this year several states passed it successfully. As the radio host kept repeating: never give up, never surrender, keep fighting. I like that mantra!  🙂

SO nice to find explanations that are thorough. Whew. Like we don’t have enough other things to do – being a little confused just makes it hang-banging-hard! LOL! I am still learning and wanted to ask the question – if it is labeled with a statement “Non-GMO, Non-Soy” doesn’t that equate with organic? Or no? I am trying to raise an organically kept flock of hens and so far, the local organically inclined gardening shop I purchase feed from has this new layer feed with that on the label. Looking ti up online, the label explains that it uses peanuts and sorghum – which they also claim is non-gmo at this time. Thoughts? 🙂


Reply ↓ 





Hello Tracy, thanks for such an awesome compliment. Here’s my opinion about things that are labeled “non-GMO” (or any “non-whatever” statement). First, I’m assuming there is no Non-GMO Project certification label on the feed bag, as that would answer the question for me immediately. Second, if there’s no certification brand on the bag (remember, USDA Organic = non-GMO too), I personally like to see more proof behind mere words on a label. Does the chicken feed bag have a website printed on it? Does the website have an FAQ page that mentions GMOs, along with the company’s approach behind testing/certification? If not, is there an email or phone number you can contact to ask? (though sometimes the “customer service” people simply read the written stuff they’ve been given, which often mirrors what’s printed on a label). Third, I know of no genetically modified peanuts, but I *have* heard of genetically modified sorghum, and concerns about it cross-pollinating with non-GMO sorghum: http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2007/09/gm-aluminum-tol/  This does not mean they are using GMO Sorghum, it just means it exists. Last but not least, have you heard of a company called “Scratch and Peck, an Eggsellent Feed Company? They are Non-GMO Project certified (and they claim to be the ONLY feed that is): https://www.facebook.com/scratchandpeck?fref=ts  My summary opinion: Certified Organic and/or Certified Non-GMO Project products are superior not only for their lack of genetically engineered ingredients, but also for their methods involving less pesticides, antibiotics, better animal welfare, routine inspections, and the like. Whew. Sorry for the long reply. 🙂 And kudos to you for taking the extra time and effort to be aware and be healthy!

I have heard many people wonder why should they spend more $$ on GMO-free products when they cannot trust whether their food is GMO free or not. The answer is simple:
      If you buy products that are labeled “organic” then you have a 90% chance that you are buying GMO free and pesticide free food. If you decide to purchase NON-organic food, then what is your chance of getting GMO free food?? Practically ZERO !
The choice is yours but I’d rather take my chances on the 90% than the ZERO!
How about you??


Reply ↓ 





I’ve used the same argument… agreed 100%! Another thing I like to tell people is… where our dollars go, so follows the market. Do you want to support mega corporations who use your dollars to fight GMO labeling measures? (like so many of them did with California’s Prop 37) Or do you wanna support family-owned companies with ethics, who provide us with organic, GMO-free food *and* go out of their way to help raise awareness about GMOs? I know what my answer is…  🙂  Thanks for commenting!

The problem I’ve found with a company saying they use gmo free ingredients or a store claiming there is no gmo produce in their stores is that they don’t know because gmo’s are not labeled. 
I met a lady who makes a homemade product and puts a sticker on it that says it’s gmo-free. When I looked at the ingredients and asked her about the coconut she uses, she said it’s just the Baker’s Angel Flake Sweetened Coconut from the store. 
I called Baker’s & they said their sugar has gmo sugar beet sugar. So this lady was wrong in putting her sticker on her product, even though it was an innocent mistake. 
Also, I think Walmart has gmo sweet corn on the cob in the produce isle but when I asked the produce manager, he looked on the box the corn was delivered in and since it didn’t say “genetically modified” he said they don’t have any gmo corn in the store. 
(the problem is that nothing in the U.S. is labeled as gmo so everyone thinks they are not eating or buying gmo foods) This is a tradgedy!

WE must do our due diligence here. Before you begin purchasing a product, call them and ask them. I called the Alexia brand Criss cut Sweet Potatoes while standing in Whole Foods. I asked them if their was any ” bio-tech” in their products and they confirmed it. ( I then went and complained to the Manager-to no avail, apparently as Whole Foods stills sells that crap.) When they began selling the “Back-to Nature packaged foods, I called them, again standing in trhe isle. Kraft asnwered the phone so I just hung up. Kraft, like Post, General Mills, Kellogs, ConAgra and many others are “pushers” for Monsanto so why bother reading them the riot act, they’ve all heard it from me many times over. If you cannot talk to someone at least by e-mail, then do NOT buy the product. My 2 cents worth…

And Alexia is owned by ConAgra, who donated $1,176,700 to prevent GMO Labeling in California. :-\

Well, in 2018 all food sold at Whole Foods will be labeled as either containing GMOs or GMO Free.


Reply ↓ 





I heard that Whole Foods bowed to pressure from Monsanto to rescind their pledge to not carry GMOs. I’d appreciate any links to whether or not this is true.


Reply ↓ 





Lesley, this story (from back in 2011) was based on a comment made by the Whole Foods’ CEO in regard to a meeting they had with Tom Vilsack. I think personally that the truth lies somewhere in the middle. Whole Foods sent an email out that was most definitely not very clear about their stance, indicating things like “GMOs were prevalent” and “while we oppose, we also recognize…” A copy of this email which originally appeared on their blog has since been removed, which would indicate they (at least) recognized that it was poorly written or (at most) realized their error in making the statement. The Organic Consumers Association blasted them for not taking a stronger stance. (You can find the freshly minted Whole Foods’ positions about these issues on their blog) More recently, Whole Foods announced that all products on their shelves will have GMO labeling by 2018. I give them kudos for setting a precedent, and a big “hmm” for taking so long, but then again I’ve never owned a national food chain so I can’t speak to the intricacies of carrying out such an order. I have additional personal opinions about Whole Foods (and Trader Joes) that keep me shopping at another local organic co-op chain in my area. 🙂

Thanks for the response. I am ambivalent about WF too. A new store is coming to my area in late 2014. I watched WF absorb the absolutely splendid Bread & Circus in MA which I still miss. I live in Ohio now and shop at Earth Fare which is good as far as it goes. Their selections are very limited, but ok. I wish that WF were as proactive as Bread & Circus used to be.

Thank you for the website and the information.  My family (husband, daughter, and I) put forth a lot of effort to eat organic foods.  I know there are times that certain products just aren’t available, but we are eating so much better/healthier than I did 30 years ago. Recently we purchased chickens to raise for organic eggs.  They have started with eating “regular” feed which I believe may not be organic.  😦  However, this week, they will be moving on to adult feed.  I am so thrilled to have found organic feed about 1 1/2 hrs. from my house at Hiland’s Naturals.  Interestingly, they sell Certified Organic feed and Non-Gmo feed.  When I asked the difference, I found that the non-gmo is not organic.  I think the best bet for us is the Certified Organic.  We will have organic healthy eggs in a couple months!  I have wondered if there have been tests on eggs that are not organic.  Do traces of gmo toxins show up?  Thanks again!  Looking forward to eating more organic non-gmo foods!

We’ve been trying to go organic and now non-GMO for over a year now. Our problem is that in a household such as ours, the cost involved becomes prohibitive. I’m working at building my business online with the largest percent of my earnings going toward food that is healthier for my family. We live on disability here, though. This means that we’re often scraping by and don’t have the choice as to what brand to purchase, it’s literally purchase what we can afford or the kids don’t get a sandwich, etc. 
It’s disheartening, but I think the information here and in other sites Iv’e found at least makes me feel like I’m not alone in caring, and in desperately NOT wanting this food on my family table.

Katrina, bless you for trying! You are not alone in the struggle with cost. Is it possible for you to grow a portion of your own food, either in your back yard, front yard, containers, or a local “pea patch” community garden perhaps? Here’s a link for safe non-GMO seeds. Another great tip is Costco… they are starting to stock more and more organic products and produce (I took photos of the organics I found on a recent visit); it never hurts to talk to their managers and ask for more… they are definitely a company that responds to input from their customers. Last but not least, I saw a great article on FoodBabe’s blog not too long ago, listing 75 tips for eating organic on a budget… my guess is you are already doing a lot of these, but perhaps there are a few that might be new to you? Very best of luck, and my sincere kudos to you for your efforts!!

Are organic foods “processed or packaged in the USA” that are from China GM free?  I was crushed when I heard that Costco’s organic green beans are actually from China, and leads me to wonder how to tell what else is?   In the maze of things out there, my most frustrating challenge has been the “processed or packaged in USA” that Costco, Trader Joe’s and many other stores are carrying.  I love Costco, and hope you can tell me some good news about the organics being sold there.


Reply ↓ 





Bailey, I love how Costco has been bringing in more and more organics, making it more affordable for the average family to eat healthy food. That said, I am less convinced that their organic produce is at a standard I am personally willing to purchase. I have been sticking to the USDA Organic labeled packages on brands that I recognize (Annie’s, Nature’s Path, etc.). As for China, that is a topic I’ve been slowly gathering research on… and it hasn’t been easy to get to the bottom of the story. They do have organic standards in place, but they are even more convoluted than the U.S.’ standards to read, much less interpret, and I can’t find any confidence in their enforcement. In their defense, China recently told Brazil they want GMO-free soy… so we know the intentions are there, I’m just not sure about the processes. Sorry I can not give you a better answer!

I was very impressed with your site until I came to the big promo for Non-GMO Project.  Your false statement that eating “products certified by the Non-GMO Project . . . [assures] that you are eating GMO-free food” calls into question the accuracy and truthfulness of all the other information you provide here.  How can you make such a reckless claim when Non-GMO Project’s own website specifies that their “verified” seal does NOT mean the product is GMO-free?  See: http://www.nongmoproject.org/learn-more/understanding-our-seal/  Furthermore, Organic Consumers Association and others have revealed that the test results, data, and related information which Non-GMO Project supposedly utilizes are all SECRET and can never be released publicly (by contractual agreement with the corporations that pay them for their label).  We don’t even know who conducts the tests.  OCA has called Non-GMO Project a greenwashing operation.  I will watch for your reply, hoping you will amend your recommendation and plead that you made an honest mistake.

Thanks for your comment; I take your use of the words “reckless” and “recommendation” quite seriously. 
I’m puzzled why you feel this article is a promo piece for the Non-GMO Project. The intent is to provide consumers with an overview of all of the labeling methods that apply to identifying GMO (free) products. Allow me to excerpt several statements from this article:
Under the header “Buying USDA Organic / GMO Free…”
First paragraph: “As explained above, buying USDA Organic is by no means a failsafe. However at this point in time, USDA Organic remains one of the best and most easily-identifiable ways of assuring that you are eating GMO-free foods most of the time.” 
Second paragraph: “Want to take it one step further? Buy products that are also certified by the Non-GMO Project.” **Note the use of the word “also.”** “The certification process behind this label is currently the best possible way of assuring that you are eating GMO-free food (though bear in mind, not all of the products bearing the Non-GMO Project label are organic—for the best of both worlds, chose products that also include the USDA Organic label). 
**Note my reference to the certification process–which goes beyond what the USDA Organic certification process does. My use of the word ‘also’ indicates that a manufacturer has taken the time to go through two separate certification processes–something I personally find to be an indicator of added attention to GMOs… versus an assurance of no GMOs as you interpreted the paragraph to imply.
Third paragraph: **Since you reference the Non-GMO Project’s website in your comment, I’m surprised you missed my reference to it here:** “Sadly however, just like organic certification, the word “usually” once again comes into play: the Non-GMO Project’s website clearly states that its label does not guarantee a product is 100% GMO-free, because contamination is an ever-growing threat. So what does the label really mean?” 
**contamination is discussed at length prior to this third paragraph; we reference it again here to illustrate that both labeling methods–USDA Organic and Non-GMO Project–are still susceptible to contamination. 
Regarding your statement about SECRET test results and “who conducts the tests,” you can request (and receive) test results directly from the Non-GMO Project (I have on several occasions); they include a list of the labs and resources that perform their testing on their website. This does not make me a fan of them any more than I am a fan of the USDA. They and the USDA are simply the two main certification agencies / processes that we have currently available to us as consumers.
In summary, no process is failsafe (as I state in this article); I’ve seen the test reports on products that were previously certified by the Non-GMO Project that later came back contaminated. This is the world we live in. The purpose of article is to help consumers navigate that world realistically, in an informed manner, in the best way they can, in light of (and in spite of) the processes that are being used today.

You’re puzzled?  I was clear the first time.  Again, your statement — that Non-GMO Project certification assures “you are eating GMO-free food” — is false.  Again, Non-GMO Project itself says their label does NOT mean a product is “GMO-free.”  One has to dig for that information, but it’s there, and I linked you to that page on Non-GMO Project’s website.  										
It’s your use of the term “GMO-free” that’s at issue here.  This is an important point, and one that cannot be glossed over: a food product carrying the Non-GMO Project seal may well contain GMOs!  In fact, even when testing clearly shows the presence of GMOs, Non-GMO Project may still provide their Non-GMO Project “verified” label.  Again, they say so on their website.
This is quite the opposite of what any consumer who sees that seal is reasonably likely to believe.  After all, other food labels that say “Non-GMO” do indeed mean the product  contains no GMOs.  It’s only Non-GMO Project, which (by adding the word “Project”) drains the original meaning from the term non-GMO, and transforms it into something entirely different.  It’s not unlike the way some companies use the word “natural” on the labels of their GMO frankenfoods in an effort to mislead consumers with a term that appears to mean one thing, but in fact means something else.
Your statement that Non-GMO Project’s label is “the best possible way” of assuring you are eating GMO-free food only compounds the problem.
Now, if your intentions are to accurately inform your readers, you should  remove all references linking Non-GMO Project to any “GMO-free” claims.  You should also publish a correction to your article, stating your original text was misleading, and not only is the Non-GMO Project label no *guarantee* that a product is 100% GMO-free, in fact Non-GMO Project EXPLICITLY REJECTS the use of the term “GMO-free” and their label is NOT INTENDED to mean the product contains no GMOs (quite unlike the USDA Organic label).
I should mention that your portrayal of Non-GMO Project’s seal as somehow equivalent to, or even superior to, the USDA Organic label is quite unfortunate.  For anyone interested, Cornucopia Institute has some incisive information on that subject.  Sign up for their free email newsletters.
As to the secrecy of Non-GMO Project test data, you say you have received some.  I notice you do not identify yourself, except to say you have a “background in regulatory affairs and biotechnology.”  The truth is, many independent scientists and others (not associated with biotech companies or the institutions they fund) are being denied this data.  If the data is indeed available to the public (as you say), you are free to publish it on your site.  Will you do that?  I don’t think you will, because that data is not to be released publicly.  In other words, it’s secret.

I think your article was clear that there is no way to know 100%; the point is that we are all at least trying to be conscience about eating non-GMO and looking at these labels is a start and still better than nothing.

From Jeffrey Smith/IRT’s Non-GMO Shopping Guide website (http://www.nongmoshoppingguide.com/what-is-organic.html):
“When the product is labeled ‘100% organic,’ ‘organic,’ or just ‘made with organic ingredients,’ then even the non-organic ingredients cannot be produced from GMOs. For example, products labeled as ‘made with organic ingredients’ only require 70% of the ingredients to be organic, but 100% must be non-GMO.”
Organic means GMO-free, whether there is an additional “gmo-free” label on the product or not. In the U.S., a seller can’t claim a product is “organic” unless that product meets USDA standards. 
Sellers can claim “natural” and “beyond organic” and “pesticide-free” and “pastured” etc. and none of those are necessarily GMO-free unless that is stated on the product. I trust the Non-GMO Project Verified label since that project is supported by Jeffrey Smith/IRT.
GMO contamination is the only thing a farmer cannot predict or, in most cases, prevent until after the fact.
Nothing is guaranteed in life. As far as GMOs in my food supply, I shop with my local farmers who I have met, I grow/raise more and more of my own food and I decide which labels I will trust. Short of being on the farm, at some point, you have to gather the evidence and trust.

My store assures me the if there is an “Organic” label with the #9 on the sticker, it’s organic though not necessarily FDA certified … in this case, apples. Is this true?


Reply ↓ 





Yes, if it’s a 5 digit code starting with #9, it is indeed organic. However this 5 digit code will NOT tell you if the product is GMO… because this code system is not mandatory, GMO producers / manufacturers are not using it. More info here: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeffrey-smith/plu-codes-do-not-indicate_b_473088.html

All this article tells me is that NOTHING is 100% GMO free. Because of cross contamination there will always be trace amounts. All we can do as consumers is limit our exposure. Even the companies who claimed they did not support Monsanto STILL had trace amounts in their products. Do we even know what a limited exposure will do to us over time?

This is great! I have recently began a personal mission to understand more about what I’m eating as well as providing for my family. I’ve always been a fairly “healthy” eater… or so I thought in terms of what I was buying at the store… wheat bread, brown eggs, etc. but never truly understanding what I’m buying and where it comes from. This was a great article for me on this journey. This spring I’d like to create my own garden as produce is the majority of my shopping cart…. do you have any insight or resources to ensuring I have an organic garden? based on seeds I purchase, soil, etc. that I should be using?


Reply ↓ 





Beth, we are always thrilled to see another person’s growing awareness… kudos to you! Here’s another blog post we wrote which you may find helpful: 5 Steps to Becoming GMO Free. In it you’ll see we mention home gardens, with a link to a safe seed resource and an article with great tips for getting started in vegetable gardening. The only other tip I’d add is to make sure you’re buying organic compost (if you aren’t starting / using your own (presumably organic) compost bin). Avoid getting manure from farms that spray pesticides on their fields and/or feed their chickens/cows GMO grain. I’ve also had superb luck buying bags of worm casings (these are less easy to find… if you can track down nurseries that grow worms, you’re likely headed in the right direction!).

Boy if only we had the answer to that question…! At least the first two qualities are a moot point (USDA Organic = GMO-free) but adding in the soy factor does seem to confuse both the producers / labelers as well as we poor consumers. Hopefully with more and more naturopaths encouraging patients to find soy-free eggs as part of a gradual elimination diet process, the demand will spark some labeling updates… (I’m told Whole Foods can be a good source to find all three).

Wanted to add one thing missing from the article as to why those looking for Non-GMO should consider Non-GMO Project Verification to be of a higher standard than USDA Organic, the latter sets no thresholds for inadvertent contamination and you will not lose your organic standards due to it. That is to say if you are following all the guidelines set in the standards and your crop is contaminated inadvertently you’re good to go.
Non-GMO Project Verification sets the same standards for contamination found in places like EU and China, which is no more than 0.9%. If you have inadvertent contamination you will lose your right to the Non-GMO Project Verified seal in your annual testing.
Of course there are other reasons to choose organic other than Non-GMO but if your primary goal is to choose Non-GMO foods then the project is the #1 label you should be looking for, THEN organic.
Of course the best way to go Non-GMO is to avoid all possible GE ingredients, the list is short if you’re always using whole foods and for the few processed ingredients or corn/soy/sugar/cotton/canola ingredients choose one of the means above.

I am making it my life goal to end this abomination know as gmos
As well as taking fluoride, arsenic, and other harmful chemicals out of water
Since those enter our organic crops
Since they don’t regulate the water
The most important part
Food and water are our greatest natural resource and we need to treat it that way
And cherish it more than gold
How was it a huge problem to use stem cells for research
But they can genetically modify your food America ?!!?!?
We should be outraged at the people behind this
As bill gates claims we need population control
And is the biggest contributor to Monsanto
The largest gmo company
And gmos have caused infertility in lab rats in later generations
This is an attack on the American people
We need to fight back and end this
See how hard it is to find 100% non gmo foods?
Monsanto went to courts
And had a judge sign a document
That states
If any crop – including organics crops get contaminated from a gmo crop that Monsanto now owns it under legal authority 
And just look up cross contamination
Idk if you have ever grown a crop
But their are male and female plants
The females have nodes or basically vaginas where the pollen or sperm can enter
The male plants have balls which produce pollen which is very light
And bees winds bugs pretty much everything in the air takes it places
If you have one male plant in your crop of females they will ALL get seeds
Aparantley the cross contamination is out of control with Monsanto crops
Simply because pollen is impossible to control
They can literally end real food
Legally too
How are people ok with this?
I read this stuff and my blood boils I get so enraged I want to do everything I can to change this shit
It’s barbaric
So maybe that’s the only way we can act to take these corporations down
Then again
Mass awareness is the only way to start social change

Thanks for the info!
But why not include that the Non-GMO Project label allows for about 1lb of GMO ingredients for every 100lb?
Is that not relevant?
What this label is doing is to devalue organic products, which should at the moment be the only products that are of actually zero gmo content. The Non-GMO PROJECT label also sneaks GMOs under a “healthy” type of label that should simply not exist. What should exists is a NO GMO label that allows zero GMO content or a GMO INSIDE label. Only one of these would be honest and clear about GMO content and provide the informed or uninformed customer with a way to avoid GMOs completely. I find the Non-GMO PROJECT label to be a misleading marketing gimmick that is unnecessary and effective only to add value where it isn’t needed for the sake of more sales, of course. 
As per the non-GMO PROJECT’s website:
“We use an Action Threshold of 0.9%. This is in alignment with laws in the European Union (where any product containing more than 0.9% GMO must be labeled). Absence of all GMOs is the target for all Non-GMO Project Standard compliant products. Continuous improvement practices toward achieving this goal must be part of the Participant’s quality management systems.”

In response to the person who asked about imported cheese from Europe. I read in more than one place that in such cases they sell their GMO free cheese to their own, but to the U.S. they sell GMO cheese. So we cannot assume it’s GMO free without the label saying so just because it is imported, unfortunately. They are already making GMO free cheese, why can’t they just extend that to us? Why consciously feed Americans poison? My guess is because it’s cheaper, higher profits from the U.S. market. We don’t have the label to turn us off, whereas in Europe they have the GMO label. Still, shame on them, we’re all people, we deserve the same, we deserve to be free of toxins as much as possible.

The safest way to make sure what you eat is non-gmo is to never eat anything that has a gmo alternative. In other words, just keep eliminating foods from your diet and the feed of your animals as any gmo potential for cross-contamination exists. Grow heirloom and only buy from people you personally know or brands that test. 
If we can’t stop this runaway train, there will be less and less to eat and our pastures will be overrun with gmo grasses and alfalfa.

Someone here mentioned that greed is the underlying problem behind all of the problems in our food chain.  The inherent weakness of capitalism is the fact that corporations are beholden to its shareholders.  Unfortunately, the primary reason why someone INVESTS in a corporation is to have increased dividend payments, increased equity value, or a combination of both.  Here, corporations have two options: 1. decrease costs, and/or 2. increase sales.  A corporation increases sales by basically giving the consumers what they want: a cheaper product with a higher value proposition.  However, said corporation has to keep the investors (shareholders) happy, so they have to maintain their profits while producing that cheaper product.  In order for them to maintain profits, they have to decrease its costs in producing the product.  It’s a vicious cycle that is fed by the system.  But the REALITY is that WE, the consumer, are ultimately responsible for this problem.  We are demanding our products for cheaper and we strive to justify the reduced cost by turning a blind eye to the idea that somewhere in the supply chain, corners are being cut to supply this product.  This is something that extends to all industries: food, clothing, transportation, housing, etc.  We have become so used to paying pennies for a crappy product that when we see a product that is more expensive, we think that product is a rip-off.  Yes, there are impoverished communities that can’t afford more, but these communities are spelling their own demise by shopping at the Wal-Marts.  The fact is that the farms can’t survive by being completely clean.  It simply costs too much and in the end, the consumers don’t CARE enough to pay the extra amount it takes to produce the clean product.

Getting concerned about the apples we are eating.  I have read a few times about the GMO apple that doesn’t turn brown.   I recently bought a bag of organic apples and after I cut an apple,  24 hours later it is still white.  I have also read an article a few years back talking about how organics can be GMO because of a loophole.  I do buy most of my food organic, but this apple thing is very confusing.
thanks Jae

Many apple varieties naturally resist browning, some varieties brown much faster than others (i.e., there was no need to genetically develop a non-browning apple in our opinion). If the apple was correctly labeled, you likely have no fear. If you want to be extra safe, check with the store and ask the manager for more information.

Other “Natural” Product Labeling Terms
Additional labeling terms – such as Natural, Cage Free, Free Range, Certified Humane (raised and handled), Vegetarian Diet, Fair Trade, and Locally Grown – have no direct relevance to whether a product is GMO free (genetically modified vegetables can and do get used in animal feed sometimes… particularly corn fed to pigs, cows and chickens).

Hi. I though a natural fruit (not GMO) like an orange, should have seeds, as that is how they continue their natural cycle, as opposed to GMO fruits that usually don’t have seeds assumedly to make the companies buy more seeds directly from the GMO producer. However, many fruits I buy, labeled as Organic, don’t have seeds. I’m looking at the label of an orange I just ate that didn’t have any seeds, that says “organic certified by QAI”. Does this mean it’s a GMO? Thank you.

There is a lot of confusion between hybridization and genetic engineering. Seedless fruits were developed through hybridization.

There’s a pretty obvious typo in the first paragraph of this page: https://gmo-awareness.com/2011/05/05/is-organic-always-gmo-free/
