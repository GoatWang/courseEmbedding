              MARRIAGE RECORDS            	
Are you ready to get copies of your Marriage Records? You might want to search for Marriage Records in public records. Typically when people want to find copies of their Marriage Records, they will check in public records for Marriage Records because Marriage Records that may include the marital certificate and other documents are considered public record files that the clerk may file so anyone can access them. That means if you want to find Marriage Records you can locate them in public records. You can even look up Marriage Records for a relative or neighbor. 

If you would like to search for public records, you may want to search on our site for your available public records. To start a new search, you can go to our public records site and begin by entering your name in the search box to begin searching for records. Regardless of whether you require criminal records, birth records, address records, prison records, alias records or court records, you can find them through a name search just by writing a name on our records site in the available search box. You may think we require authorization or approval of some sort, but that's not required as the records are public, so anybody can access them.

FAQs – CyramedX






























































 

CyramedX - Built for the ASC

Take a look around our standard FAQ’s, if you don’t see your question answered, give us a call or send an email.


 Implementation




 How quickly can we implement CyramedX?

CyramedX effectively replicates the look and feel of your current paper based system providing an environment that is instantly recognizable to its user and is therefore very easy to train learn and implement. CyramedX is the quickest “to-live” product in the market today and our go-live process is measured in days rather than weeks and months.




 What if I have no experience with computers?

No problem! Many if not most of our users have only very basic computer knowledge. CyramedX so closely resembles the natural workflow in a physicians practice as well as the physical look and feel of a paper chart that even those folks who have never touched a computer before will pick up the basics of our system in mere minutes.




 Can I even fax forms like prescriptions directly from the Patient’s chart?

Yes CyramedX allows you to fill out prescriptions with a few clicks and fax them while you’re documenting the encounter.




 Can I send and receive faxes with CyramedX?

Yes CyramedX has full in and outbound faxing capabilities.




 What ROI can be expected of CyramedX?

Because CyramedX has such a quick “to-live” time and is so easy to learn and adopt it provides very fast ROI in sharp contrast to competitor systems that tend to slow down the physician and therefore patient throughput. We suggest having one of our specialist conduct a site study/evaluation for you, to show you exactly how the system’s ROI will perform in your facility.

 Technical Questions




 Can CyramedX be deployed in a hosted environment or is it client-server based?

Both! CyramedX can be deployed either using the client-server model whereby you own and manage your database and hardware infrastructure fully or, you can deploy CyramedX in a cloud hosted environment via a monthly subscription model avoiding the cost & hassles of maintaining your own server/storage hardware infrastructure.




 Is the system fully HIPAA compliant?

Yes, CyramedX’s activity log for each patent’s file keeps track of staff activity while working in the patient’s record. You will always have a record of who did what, when, where, and how. The log displays staff print, fax, edit, form add, task, message, as well as any copying activity and much more. Call or e-mail us to obtain a full list of built-in security features and protocols.








 Surgeons and Administrators




 Can I dictate into the patient chart rather than type?

Absolutely! You can dictate directly into the patient chart via our own built-in proprietary dictation module or Dragon Naturally Speaking to avoid all or part of related transcription charges.

CyramedX ASC EHR – CyramedX





































































 

CyramedX - Built for the ASC

AN EHR THAT MIMICS YOUR CENTER’S EXISTING WORKFLOWUsing an EHR at your ASC doesn’t have to mean being a slave to a computer on a heavy rolling cart! CyramedX EHR for the ASC runs on tablet PCs and allows you to use digitized version of your existing paper charts thanks to our proprietary “Forms Under Glass” technology.


Did you know…
That an EHR can actually save you money?
ASCs spend up to $7 on materials to build a paper chart. Multiply that by your annual case count and we’re talking about a considerable expense.
Add the cost of time and labor for your office staff to assemble, retrieve, disassemble, and reassemble (to fax, copy or de-identify) those paper charts. What does it cost to pay your office staff to handle a chart over its life, and how much does that add up to over the course of a year? CyramedX eliminates this costly inefficiency.
Imagine charting concurrently, never having to search for a wayward chart, eliminating dual entry for data needed in multiple places. You could find ways to increase case volume. CyramedX helps you manage the day better.
How much do you spend on medical records storage and shredding? A CyramedX digital record doesn’t require either, of course. You can even scan your old charts into CyramedX and eliminate that cost once and for all!
Contact us for a Net Savings Analysis customized for your ASC. See how much you’ll save with CyramedX!
Ever wondered…
How much time could you be saving?
A typical ASC spends about 5 minutes building a paper chart. That’s an entire business day per month for every 100 cases!
It takes even longer each time a charts is disassembled and later reassembled in order to copy and mail, fax, or de-identify for peer review.
Plus, you’ll never lose a digital chart and can always access it, even if someone else is charting at the same time.
