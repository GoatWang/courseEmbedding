Headquartered in Silicon Valley and SF, we have subsidiaries in Israel and India. Israel India What Entrepreneurs Are Saying Promod Haque and Norwest provided exceptional support during a fairly long product gestation and initial market fit exercise during the early period of FireEye’s business evolution. They showed fortitude as an investor and believed in the eventual opportunity to defend the world from advanced cyber attacks even when there were insufficient market proof points. I am grateful for their support in helping build FireEye into the global company it is today. Ashar Aziz, Founder, Vice Chairman of the Board, and Chief Strategy Officer - FireEye Norwest’s ability to invest against the grain in an enterprise mobility company like MobileIron speaks to the firm’s belief in its entrepreneurs and backing companies in new markets that aren’t yet obvious. MobileIron is a great example of how Norwest partners with companies to build great businesses. Bob Tinker, President & CEO - MobileIron As we built out our sales force across the United States and grew our sales over 3000% from commercialization to IPO, Norwest’s financing and guidance was critical to our success. Their partnership was and remains key during our rapid commercial growth and scaling. We would not be where we are today without them.

NGF raises another $1.3 million, giving the fledgling firm a total of $2.5 million of capital. NGF invests $500,000 in an ice cream company: International Dairy Queen (IDQ). IDQ became a successful publicly-traded company that would eventually allow NGF to sell its stake for an estimated $3.5 million NGF makes an early investment in National Computer Systems, an optical reader company that is now a staple in virtually all standardized tests. Cray Research, a pioneer in supercomputing, is added to the NGF portfolio. NGF helps start Network Systems Corp., a company that pioneered the development of high speed data transmission products that would be the backbone of the first high speed computer networks. NGF raises its second fund, Northwest Venture Partners, a $60 million offering that included a $10 million contribution from Northwest Bancorporation. The firm transitions to the name Norwest Venture Capital (NVC). With the technology sector suffering from a downturn in the mid-1980s, NVC turns to opportunities in the consumer sector with investments in athletic footwear company Avia and children’s clothing company Gymboree. NVC’s East Coast presence takes shape with investments in Bright Horizons, GelTex Pharmaceuticals, Raptor Systems and VideoServer. George Still joins the firm and works out of its Bellevue, Washington office. Promod Haque also joins NVC as a consultant in the firm’s Minneapolis office to assist with due diligence on technology investments. NVC later hires Haque on a full-time basis in 1990.  The firm launches Norwest Equity Partners IV, LP,  a $200 million fund. NVC is instrumental in the development and consolidation of the emerging specialized mobile radio (SMR) communications business through investments in Atlantic Cellular, OneComm, and Transit Communications. PeopleSoft, one of the world’s first client server software companies, goes public. George Still led the firm’s investment in PeopleSoft in 1989, and Norwest was the sole venture investor. The investment helped drive the firm’s software strategy for years to come. George Still opens Norwest’s Silicon Valley office – on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, CA. Norwest continues its successful software streak, with investments in, and later exits from, Documentum, Vantive, and Xylan Coporation. Norwest completes a leveraged buyout of Transaction Systems Architects (TSA).  TSA goes public in 1995; Norwest would eventually realize $132 million on an investment of $8.6 million, a multiple of 15.4. The firm launches Norwest Equity Partners V, LP, a $300 Million fund. Promod Haque made his mark on such investments as Tivoli Systems (which went public in 1995 and was acquired by IBM in 1996) and Forte Software ( which went public in 1996 and was acquired by Sun Microsystems in 1999), generating returns of 32.0 and 23.0 times the firm’s initial investment, respectively. George Still and Norwest associate, Darin Brannan, develop the initial business plan for Verio, which was incubated in the firm’s West Coast office in 1996. At the time of Verio’s IPO in May 1998 at a $1.2 billion valuation, Verio had acquired 46 ISPs and was ultimately sold in 1999 to NTT DoComo for $5.5 billion cash. Promod Haque leads a seminal investment in Extreme Networks. Extreme was exceptionally successful, and with the help of a white-hot IPO market, delivered returns to NVC of more than $700 million, representing a multiple of 95.0 times its initial investment. The convergence of voice and data puts telecommunications at center stage with key NVC investments and exits. Brooks Fiber Properties goes public in 1996, and is acquired by MCI WorldCom in 1998 for $3.4 billion. Polycom results in a successful IPO in 1996. Brocade goes public in May of 1999, creating more than $313.5 million in returns for Norwest, a multiple of 46.0 times its original investment. Norwest moves its headquarters to downtown Palo Alto, CA – where it remains today. Norwest Venture Capital becomes Norwest Venture Partners (NVP), with George Still as Managing General Partner, launching Norwest Venture Partners VI (NVP VI), a $300 million fund. Norwest raises a brand new $325 million fund just one year later—Norwest Venture Partners VII (NVP VII), after a series of significant venture exits. Promod Haque transitions into a Managing General Partner role and joins Managing General Partner George Still in leading and expanding the firm. Norwest backs Michael Hatfield, co-founder and early CEO of Cerent, investing $11.8 million. Just 16 months later, Cisco Systems acquires Cerent for $7.2 billion. Cerent delivers returns of nearly $1.5 billion to Norwest, representing a multiple of 125.0 times the firm’s initial investment. Norwest invests $3.5 million in Siara Systems. Kleiner Perkins and Norwest later agree to merge Siara Systems with Redback Networks, a $4.3 billion transaction that in 1999 created one of the most powerful suppliers in the communications industry. Norwest’s investment in Siara Systems resulted in a 104 times return for the firm. Norwest makes a $7.2 million investment in Broadband Access Systems, a provider of highly integrated switching, broadband access and telephony systems for cable companies and carriers. A year later, ADC Telecommunications acquires Broadband Access Systems for $2.2 billion. Norwest raises an additional $300 million fund, Norwest Venture Partners VIII (NVP VIII), just two years after its previous fund had launched. Virtela, a virtual private network company, is funded and co-founded by General Partner Vab Goel. Norwest’s investment in Quantum Effect Devices (QED), an embedded microprocessor company, results in a successful IPO. Norwest eventually realizes $122 million on its investment of $5.2 million in QED, a multiple of 23.5. Israel-based Accord Networks, a voice and video company, goes public and is later sold to Polycom for $339 million. Norwest’s consistent returns over the previous decade helped the firm launch its largest fund to date in 2001—Norwest Venture Partners IX (NVP IX), a $411 million fund. SaaS emerges as a formidable infrastructure sector with Norwest’s investments in Cast Iron Systems and AmberPoint. Both companies would ultimately be acquired by tech giants IBM and Oracle, respectively. Norwest’s Matt Howard makes a significant investment in a wireless local area networking (“WLAN”) systems pioneer called Airespace. Winphoria Networks, a mobile data networking company, is sold to Motorola for $179 million. Norwest’s Vab Goel incubates Austin-based KMV Technologies, which would later be called LifeSize Communications, a pioneer in videoconferencing technology. Norwest portfolio company Spinnaker Networks, the Pittsburgh-based seller of network-attached storage servers, is acquired by Network Appliance Inc. for $300 million. Promod Haque ranks #1 on the 2004 Forbes Midas List as a top dealmaker. Norwest makes its first investment in India, a growth equity investment in Persistent Systems, a leading offshore product development company based in Pune. The company would later go public on the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange of India. Local area networking (“WLAN”) systems provider Airespace is acquired by Cisco Systems for $450 million. Norwest notches additional big exits with Arbortext, Authentica, Corio, Open-Silicon, ShoreTel, Sidestep, Skystream, Veraz Networks and Website Pros. The firm raises Norwest Venture Partners X (NVP X), a $650 million fund. In an effort to diversify and invest across multiple stages and sectors in India, Norwest establishes a day-to-day presence in the country via its NVP India advisory subsidiary in Mumbai, led by Niren Shah and Sohil Chand. Norwest expands further, establishing an advisory subsidiary in Herzliya, Israel, led by Dror Nahumi. Norwest adds a second Indian subsidiary in Bengaluru, led by Mohan Kumar. Norwest benefits from Rackspace’s successful initial public offering as the largest venture investor in the company. Rackspace is one of the largest and only technology IPOs occurring this year. Qumranet, an enterprise software company offering a virtual infrastructure platform, is acquired by Red Hat. Norwest portfolio company LifeSize Communications is sold to Logitech for $405 million. Norwest brings on Jon Kossow to focus more aggressively on growth equity opportunities and build out Norwest’s growth equity team. General Partners Jon Kossow and Sonya Brown now head up the growth equity practice at Norwest. Norwest begins investing out of its largest fund to date, Norwest Venture Partners XI (NVP XI), a $1.2 billion fund. Norwest revives its healthcare practice with an emphasis on growth equity and late stage venture investments. Norwest hires two partners to spearhead this practice—Dr. Ryan Harris and Casper de Clercq. Persistent Systems has a successful public offering on the Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange of India (Norwest’s first direct investment in India), and Cast Iron Systems, a SaaS/Cloud integration company is acquired by IBM. Omneon, a leading provider of scalable media server and active storage systems, is acquired by Harmonic at a deal valued at approximately $306 million, while Jigsaw, a leading provider of business information and data services, is acquired by Salesforce.com for $142 million. ngmoco Inc., a mobile game publisher, is acquired by DeNA in November for approximately $400 million, and Playdom Inc., a leader in the online social gaming space, is acquired by The Walt Disney Company in August for approximately $764 million, a combined transaction value in excess of $1 billion.
