The 2015-16 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) is now available.

Overview

Asset classes are a result of a period strategic asset allocation process and approved by the CalPERS Board of Administration.
CalPERS' investment portfolio is diversified into several asset classes.
Strategic asset allocation is the dominant determinant of portfolio risk and return; a well-diversified portfolio shapes our long-term performance, protects the Retirement Fund, and ensures any weaknesses in one area are offset by gains in another.

NEW YORK, April 10, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- One Rock Capital Partners, LLC ("One Rock"), a leading middle-market private equity firm, announced that it held a first and final closing of One Rock Capital Partners II, LP ("Fund II") with total capital commitments of $964 million. Fund II was launched in mid-January 2017 with a $700 million target, and due to strong investor demand, closed at its hard cap on March 31.








One Rock was formed in 2010 by Tony W. Lee and R. Scott Spielvogel, formerly Managing Directors at Ripplewood Holdings.

Managing Partner Tony Lee added, "One Rock is committed to creating value through operational improvements, and we are pleased that our Operating Partners, our strategic relationship with Mitsubishi, and our investment approach have resonated as distinguishing factors for investors.  Our second fund will seek to build on our track record as we continue to pursue complex situations in the middle-market in the industries where we have significant operational and strategic resources."
With the final closing of Fund II, One Rock has approximately $1.4 billion of assets under management. Fund II's investor base consists of a diverse set of government and corporate pension plans, insurance companies, health organizations, endowments and foundations, and high net worth families.  
Moelis & Company LLC and Mitsubishi Corporation Asset Management Ltd. served as placement agents, and Debevoise & Plimpton LLP served as legal counsel to Fund II.

Since 1990, Rockwood has executed a value add, U.S. focused real
estate investment program through a consecutive series of closed
end funds.  The first six of these funds are completed and the
second four funds are at different points in their life cycles
although none of these funds are currently open to new
investors.  Through these value add vehicles, Rockwood has
invested in various property sectors, specializing in assets
where it believes there is potential for income growth through
repositioning, releasing, rehabilitation or development with
appropriate risk dependent upon our view of demographic, employment
and financial market trends.

Private Equity Program Fund Performance Review

As of September 30, 2016, the since inception Net IRR is 10.7% and the Net Multiple is 1.4x.
The table below reflects the performance of all active PE partnership investments as of September 30, 2016. At the end of each quarter, the General Partners report on the value of invested capital. The General Partners have 120 days to provide Limited Partners with financial data, so there is generally a 2-quarter delay in performance reporting.



  How to Read the Performance Review Table  



The table is updated quarterly and provides information on the status of all active CalPERS private equity commitments; it doesn't include any exited partnership investments.

The Fund column lists the names of all active partnership investments.
Vintage Year is the year in which CalPERS’ first cash flow for the investment occurred.
Capital Committed identifies the original amount CalPERS committed to each fund.
Cash In represents capital contributed for investments and management fees.
Cash Out represents distributions CalPERS has received back from the fund.
Cash Out & Remaining Value represents the distributions CalPERS has received plus the reported value of the invested capital.
Net IRR is the Net Internal Rate of Return based on CalPERS’ actual cash flows and the reported value of the invested capital.
Investment Multiple is the Cash Out & Remaining Value divided by the Cash In.

In evaluating private equity performance, CalPERS emphasizes using both the realized Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and Investment Multiple. Interim IRRs by themselves are not the best indicators of current or future fund performance.
The IRR is calculated based on CalPERS records of cash flows and financial statements from the investment managers.

1Not Meaningful: Funds with a vintage year of 2012 or later are in the initial stages of their investment life cycle. Any performance analysis done on these funds would not generate meaningful results as private equity funds are understood to be long-term investments.
2Partnership investment is using a cash adjusted market value.

Q: What is fixed income?
Fixed income is nothing more than a fancy word for the world of investing in bonds. And when we think about the stock market, it turns out that the world of investing in bonds is much, much larger. What does bond investing entail? Well it entails interest rates, and government bonds, but so much more than government bonds is available to investors inside the overall bond market. What are some of the other opportunities for investors in bonds include high yield bonds, and investment grade bonds, global opportunities in non-dollar-denominated developed market bonds, and opportunities in emerging markets both across dollar-denominated issues, from sovereign, that’s country issuers, corporate issuers, also typically in dollar form, as well as local currency-denominated emerging market bonds. The world of bonds goes beyond fixed income in the sense of we have floating rate bonds. We have things that are in the bond market that are not bonds, they are called loans. That’s the bank loan market. One of the attractions to the bank loan market is that it is generally a floating rate market. Floating rate means that rather than fixed, as interest rates rise, the coupons on your loans in this case can rise as well.








 More about fixed income




What are common misconceptions about fixed income investing?


In a changing interest rate environment, many Americans with investments lack a good understanding of the impact of rates on their portfolios – and even many who claim to be “knowledgeable” about fixed income have fundamental misconceptions about those investments, according to new research from BlackRock.
BlackRock conducted a survey from April 21 to 23, and covered 417 Americans with $50,000 or more in investible assets. Common misconceptions included:

Nearly one third (31%) of those surveyed incorrectly believe that when it comes to fixed income investing, “you can’t lose your money.”
Only 31% correctly noted that if interest rates rise, the effect on the fixed income investments that investors already own is negative (when interest rates rise, bond prices fall).
60% of americans surveyed don‘t consider themselves knowledgeable regarding fixed income, and just 43% said they understand the market and economic forces that drive bond prices.

What are the potential benefits of fixed income?


Fixed income investments can potentially benefit investors in different ways, depending on their financial goals.
If you are seeking to grow your assets over time to save for retirement or other long-term goals, you probably hold a significant amount of equity in your portfolio. Allocating a portion of your portfolio to fixed income investments can potentially help offset losses when stock markets are erratic.
If you are seeking to generate income, fixed income investments are likely a critical part of your portfolio. Fixed income investors receive a fixed amount of income at a pre-determined cadence in the form of coupon payments on bond holdings. Fixed income asset classes provide different levels of yield and entail different types and amounts of risks.
Reasons to consider bond funds :

Capital preservation
Income generation
Diversification from equity market risk






Why BlackRock?


Investors trust BlackRock with more assets than any other fixed income manager.4 Our goal is to provide you with the quality and value you deserve and expect, evidenced through our history of attractive performance, competitive prices and a comprehensive set of offerings.





What are the risks associated with fixed income?


Bonds are broadly known to carry lower risk than stocks. Fixed income assets generally are less sensitive to most macro threats such as economic downturns and geopolitical events. But there are risks associated with fixed income investments.

Interest rate risk garners the most attention among investors because when interest rates rise, bond prices fall. Interest rate movements are the major cause of price volatility in bond markets.
Inflation is another source of risk for bond investors. If the rate of inflation outpaces the fixed amount of income a bond provides, the investor loses purchasing power.
Credit risk (also known as business risk or financial risk) refers to the possibility of an issuer defaulting on its debt obligation.
Liquidity risk is the risk that an investor wishing to sell a fixed income asset is unable to find a buyer.

You can manage these risks by diversifying investments within your fixed income portfolio.

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses which may be obtained visiting the iShares ETF and BlackRock Mutual Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.






Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.






Important Risks of the Funds: The mutual funds are actively managed and characteristics will vary. Bond values fluctuate in price so the value of your investment can go down depending on market conditions. The two main risks related to fixed income investing are interest-rate and credit risk. Typically, when interest rates rise, there is a corresponding decline in the market value of bonds. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the bond issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments. The principal on mortgage- or asset-backed securities normally may be prepaid at any time, which reduces the yield and market value of those securities. Obligations of US gov’t agencies and authorities are supported by varying degrees of credit but generally are not backed by the full faith and credit of the US gov’t. Investing in derivatives entails specific risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and increase volatility. International investing includes risks related to foreign currency, limited liquidity, less government regulation and the possibility of substantial volatility due to adverse political, economic or other developments. These risks often are heightened for investments in emerging/developing markets or smaller capital markets. Investments in non-investment-grade debt securities (”high-yield” or ”junk” bonds) may be subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of default or loss of income and principal than securities in higher rating categories. There may be less information on the financial condition of municipal issuers than for public corporations. The market for municipal bonds may be less liquid than for taxable bonds. Some investors may be subject to Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). Capital gains distributions, if any, are taxable.
