Gavin Southwell
Thank you, Cindy. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we report HIIQ's first quarter 2017 results. Our first quarter performance demonstrated continued strong demand for our products and solid execution. We are very pleased with our performance. Record first quarter revenues grew by 32% year-over-year to $55.9 million. Additionally, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share both increased year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $9.7 million, up 127% year-over-year. Adjusted EPS for the first quarter was $0.36, up from $0.17 in the first quarter of 2016.

Sales of our individual and family plans or IFPs continued to accelerate throughout the open enrollment period. We had record policies in force at the end of Q1 2017, 345,000 policies which represents a 34% year-over-year increase. We continue to drive top line growth and bottom line results with strong disciplined execution. Our entire organization continues to embrace a dynamic healthcare industry and we continue to execute our strategy to provide affordable healthcare solutions to consumers. I'm proud of our accomplishments during the first quarter and I look forward to continued success throughout 2017 and beyond.
Our success in the first quarter is a direct result of our work on our key strategic areas of focus. These areas include firstly, maintaining industry leadership in product innovation. We create quality, affordable, and efficiently administered health insurance products to meet the needs of consumers and we continue to believe that the current macro political environment is favorable to our ability to innovate affordable health insurance products. Secondly, strong sales growth through our licensed agent third-party call centers. As well as innovative products, we support our third-party distributors by investing in resource and technology in our customer service, compliance, and call center quality teams and expect to continue to lead our market in this regard throughout 2017.
And thirdly, our focus on scalability and leverage, we have a sophisticated technology driven platform with demonstrated operating leverage, which we will continue to enhance whilst controlling our cost base. During the first quarter, we added several additional hospital indemnity plans to our industry leading line-up. These products provide additional diversity and value to our product portfolio. We also added new supplemental plans and continue to improve our bundling capabilities increasing the value proposition for our consumers.
We continued to execute on our plan to deliver scalability in our operations. As I previously discussed, the heart of our operating model is our highly scalable technology driven quote by print platform. It provides 24/7 real-time transaction type of services. This platform drives our scalability as a cloud-based administrator fulfilling the needs of our consumers, our agents, and our carriers, it's a foundation of our differentiated distribution channel including call centers and our emerging broker network and it is also a backbone of our direct-to-consumer website agilehealthinsurance.com.
Now I'd like to provide an update on the rule issued by Department of Health and Human Services or HHS related to short-term medical insurance or STM under the Obama administration. HHS issued a rule change in 2016 STM policies to be no more than 3 months in duration and requires that specific language be used to explain non-compliance with the Affordable Care Act as well as providing a 3 months STM allowing consumers to reapply. We believe strong demand continues to exist for the STM product and other affordable health insurance options and we will continue to provide innovative and affordable health insurance products. The HHS rule limiting STM to 3 months and yet allowing reapplies was implemented on April 1, 2017. With respect to our STM sales, year-over-year sales increased during the month of April. Our fixed indemnity product, we refer to as hospital indemnity or limited medical has become increasingly more popular with consumers. We believe that hospital indemnity addresses many of the consumers' affordable health insurance needs and the total addressable market opportunity maybe even greater than that of STM.
With respect to the potential repeal and replace of the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare, we have prepared product and marketing strategies for the various potential outcomes. Consumers come to us looking for solutions to their affordable healthcare needs and we intend to continue to provide affordable solutions and we believe we are uniquely positioned for future regulatory change. We are working with various states as they review our numerous carriers and distributors compliance with state insurance regulations. We are proactively communicating and cooperating with all applicable regulatory agencies and we have provided a detailed action plan to regulators that summarizes the company's enhanced compliance and control mechanisms. It is too early to determine whether any of these regulatory examinations will have a material impact on the company. We look forward to working with state and federal insurance regulators to ensure consumers continue to have access to health insurance products that meet their personal and financial needs.

The sum of our outlook for full year 2017, our goals are straightforward, top line growth with adjusted EBITDA growing faster than revenue. The drivers are best-in-class products, our use of data, compliant distributors while achieving market-leading customer satisfaction. Throughout 2017, we will continue expansion of our third-party call center distribution both adding new distributors and increasing organically, sales at our existing distributors.
We will continue to invest in our technology platform including agilehealthinsurance.com to enhance our scalability and maintain our competitive advantage. We will also be adding additional best-in-class IFP and supplemental products in 2017 to keep driving value for our consumers. Based on our strong first quarter, we are increasing our full year guidance for both revenue and earnings. We are increasing our expected 2017 revenue to $212 million to $222 million and we are increasing our adjusted EBITDA to between $36 million and $39 million or approximately 30% to 40% increase year-over-year and non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.40 and $1.50.
We expect that our strongest sales quarters for 2017 will be Q1 and Q4, consistent with last year and that aggregate customer acquisition cost at Agile included in SG&A expense will be higher during our seasonally stronger sales quarters due to the upfront nature of recognizing these marketing costs for accounting purposes. We're off to a strong start to 2017 and we are optimistic about the future. HIIQ is uniquely positioned to take advantage of the growing demand for affordable health insurance solutions. We appreciate your time today, thank you for your interest in our company and I'd like to turn the call over to Mike Hershberger, our Chief Financial Officer.
Michael Hershberger
Thanks, Gavin and good morning everyone. As Gavin mentioned, 2017 is off to a strong start. Record revenue, record adjusted EBITDA, and record policies in force at the end of Q1. We have executed on several strategic initiatives that contributed to the acceleration of sales and profit during the open enrollment period that ended January 31, 2017 and should contribute sustained growth throughout the remainder of 2017 and beyond. We will continue to invest in what we consider to be attractive growth opportunities in 2017. We anticipate continued leverage of our SGA throughout the year.
I'd like to share with you some of the key highlights from the first quarter of 2017. Our first quarter revenues were $55.9 million, an increase of 31.5% compared to last year and 8.6% sequentially. Our total policies in force increased to a record 345,000 at the end of the first quarter, up 33.8% year-over-year and 18.9% sequentially. We experienced strong growth in our short-term medical and hospital indemnity plans that we refer to as individual and family plans or IFPs with the strongest growth occurring in our hospital indemnity plans. Additionally, we continue to add new products to our portfolio that help us to continue to meet the affordable health insurance needs of our members. Total submitted IFP policies for the quarter were up 22.7% year-over-year and 37.3% sequentially.
Total SGA expenses were $15.3 million for the first quarter of 2017, up $3.4 million year-over-year. And breaking down the Q1 SGA expenses, approximately $3.8 million were spent on marketing, leads, and advertising, $800,000 in stock compensation expenses, and another $800,000 in transaction, severance, restructuring, and other charges. The remaining core of our SGA for Q1 was $9.8 million or 17.6% of revenue compared to 20.1% of revenue in Q1 2016 and 16.5% in Q4 of 2016. The driver of this metric continues to be our highly scalable technology platform integrating carriers and distributors while allowing consumers to quote their policy, buy their policy, print their insurance card, and electronically secure health insurance coverage. We're also seeing improved leverage in SGA resulting from continued scrutiny of all SGA spend. We expect continued improvement in our ratio of core SGA to revenue throughout 2017. EBITDA was $8 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $3.5 million in the same period in 2016. First quarter 2017 GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.58 compared to $0.12 in Q1 of 2016 and a loss of $0.03 sequentially. Included in our GAAP earnings was a $0.14 tax benefit that resulted from the early adoption of an accounting policy related to share-based payment transactions.

Turning to our non-GAAP metrics, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share increased both year-over-year and sequentially. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was a record $9.7 million compared to $4.2 million in Q1 2016 and $8.9 million sequentially. We continued to execute on our plan to grow our top line revenue and control our SGA spend. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue increased to 17.3% for Q1 2017 compared to 10% in Q1 2016 and 17.2% sequentially. Adjusted EPS for the first quarter was $0.36 compared to $0.17 in Q1 2016 and $0.35 sequentially. We believe that our non-GAAP metrics of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share provide a meaningful measure of our financial performance.
We provided a reconciliation of our GAAP metrics to our non-GAAP metrics in our earnings press release that was published last night. We continue to make secured short-term loans to our distributors, based on actual sales, that we refer to as advanced commissions. These advanced commissions assist our distributors with upfront policyholder acquisition costs and provide them with working capital. We recover the advanced commissions from future commissions earned by the distributors on premiums collected over the period in which the policies renew. In the first quarter, we experienced a $1.3 million decrease in advanced commission loans that we provide to our distributors for a total of $35.7 million outstanding at March 31, 2017. We expect our advanced commission balance to remain at similar levels throughout 2017.
Cash and short-term investments totaled $15.8 million at the end of the first quarter of 2017, up $3.6 million during the quarter and we had no debt during the quarter. We expect to generate cash flow from operations throughout 2017. Based on our first quarter results and projections for the remainder of the year, we are raising all of our 2017 guidance metrics. We now expect revenue to range from $212 million to $222 million, adjusted EBITDA to range from $36 million to $39 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share to range from $1.40 to $1.50. Our earnings reflect continued strong operational results and improved scalability offset by accelerated product development and implementation expenses and our expected upfront recognition of our consumer acquisition costs at agilehealthinsurance.com.
We believe that we are well positioned to continue our success in the dynamic individual health insurance marketplace. We expect to deliver strong results through our continued expansion of innovative products, continued expansion of our distribution networks including both existing and new distributors, maximizing our e-commerce opportunity, providing best-in-class customer service, and continued scalability driven by our technology.
Thank you for your time today and now we'd like to open up the call for questions, Operator?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Mark Argento of Lake Street Capital.
Mark Argento
Quick question for you in terms of -- it looks like short-term continues to perform fairly nicely, but also possible indemnities picking up as well. Could you break down the mix in terms of the growth in the quarter?
Michael Hershberger
Thanks, Mark, appreciate the question. So as we look forward -- as we look back on the first quarter, we saw a more robust growth with our limited medical than we did with short-term major medical. I would say that there were -- if we look at the total -- probably in the 55% to 45% range limited medical over short-term major medical.
Gavin Southwell
Yes, which is a great theme for us. So we saw growth across both products, which we're happy with, but we continue to see a theme of hospital indemnity or limited medical product growing at a more accelerated rate than the STM product, but, of course, we're happy to reassure everybody that we prepared for the rule change for STM that came in place on the April 1 and we had greater sales in April 2017 than we had in prior year. So good news across both of those kind of core products.

Mark Argento
So just so I understand, obviously, both grew, but you said -- maybe you could just -- the 55% versus 45% kind of reconcile that again for me?
Michael Hershberger
Sure, yes, 55% of our IFPs were limited medical in the first quarter and about 45% were short-term major medical.
Mark Argento
And then, I think Gavin you had mentioned in your prepared remarks about new distribution partners or new distributors coming on to the platform, could you elaborate on that a little bit?
Gavin Southwell
Yes, we had a lot of success in attracting new distribution to add to our existing partners. So from our existing partners, we've seen good organic growth which we're very happy with and we've been very happy with some additional distribution that we've also added. What I'd flag is winning new distribution and getting them physically set up on to our platform and trained is a quick process. We have invested a lot in our technology platform and getting people up and running is pretty quick. What we do after that is, we want to make sure that the distribution is meeting our compliance standards, which are higher than anybody else in our industry and so we track them very closely over that initial period, live, the number of sales, the number of cancellations, the number of customer service calls. There's a lot of different metrics in there.
So we wait a period of time after we've added new distribution and we've ensured that the partnership is working the way that we want before we bake in the impact -- the upside into our figures, which is of course is the right thing to do because we want to have some certainty that it's panning out the way that we planned. So we've had some good success, we haven't built that into the figures and I think as we go through '17, we'd expect to see some good upside there.
Operator
Our next question is coming from Richard Close of Canaccord Genuity.
Richard Close
Gavin, I was wondering if you could comment a little bit on the risk premium back to the carriers as a percentage of premium equivalents that was -- it came in a lot better than what we were looking for and I think year-over-year improvement there, can you just talk a little bit about that?
Gavin Southwell
I'm going to hand over to Michael Hershberger to take the first part of that and then I'll kind of give a summary comment at the end. So, Hersh?
Michael Hershberger
Thanks, Richard, and as we continue to look forward into 2017, we're looking at not only our SGA spend, controlling our SGA spend, but we're looking at all different kinds of revenues. So as we continue to work with our carrier partners, we work to identify not only those products that are optimal for the consumer, but those products that are optimal for HIIQ as well.
Richard Close
Would you expect similar levels throughout the rest to the year or how should we think about that?
Gavin Southwell
There's a couple of different parts here, so we started a process of working with carriers and really trying to get as much benefit out of them as possible, first, a consumer in terms of expanding out the coverages that were available and secondly for HIIQ, in terms of what we were able to retain from a commercial point of view. So that process hasn't finished. We'll continue to kind of work through carriers and the impact of that will filter through in '17 and into '18 and we expect to see meaningful positive impact to our financials as we go through '17 and '18. The other side is, as we have a continued rise in sales at agilehealthinsurance.com, the pricing there and the makeup of those products is slightly different. So I think as we go through this process and we see those figures come through, we'll provide a greater narrative so people can understand exactly what those drivers are, but the short answer is yes, we'd expect to see continued improvement certainly through '17 and '18.

Richard Close
Okay. Next question I guess, Hersh is on the advanced commissions and obviously a lower level of advanced commissions positive on the cash flow front. Can you just walk us through that line item and how we should think about that? Why is that going down and what exactly that means when they're going down?
Michael Hershberger
Sure, just kind of as a recap, advanced commissions are secured distributor financing. So we make loans from time-to-time to our distributors. Not all distributors want advances and so that there is not a ratio with respect to advanced commissions to sales. So it's certainly not a reflection on our sales. The way that we look at it is we look at it as certainly as a generating additional cash flow. We're looking at advanced commissions to remain fairly constant throughout 2017.
Richard Close
Has anything changed there? You just mentioned that some of your distributors don't take advanced commissions. Has anything else changed with respect to that and why that's going to be relatively flat as you experience revenue growth?
Gavin Southwell
Well, I guess for my part, over the last 12 months, we had questions from people coming in around advances growing and the balance that was there. So we looked at, okay, can we use our carriers balance sheet, they have gigantic balance sheets, why don't we use some of those their cash in order to give advances to distributors who want it. So we implemented that which allowed us to kind of reduce the growth in advances at a slower rate than we were increasing our revenue. So we see that as a positive. And the other side is, we're fortunate in that we've attracted some excellent very large grown up distribution who have less of a need for advances than perhaps other distribution. And so for us, there isn't a kind of direct intrinsic link between growth in advances and revenue. We think it's a good thing to have advances, it certainly can help and it can drive growth. It works for a lot of our distribution, it doesn't work for everybody. We have the ability to take cash from carriers. Really, what we wanted to show is as a business, we're in a really good cash position compared to where this business has been historically. We're generating a very large amount of cash.
Our cash position keeps improving time-over-time and as a management team, we wanted to be able to kind of focus on that metric. So I hope I gave some color because I think historically, you would have seen more of a link between that balance and the revenue and I think we've taken some steps to kind of remove that direct link. We're not trying to lessen the positive nature of advances, it does generate an income for us, it does make distribution sticky, but it's not as directly linked as it has been historically. So I hope that's helpful. I think that gives a bit of color.
Richard Close
And I guess my last question would be, just to dive into the comments that the first quarter and the fourth quarter are seasonally strongest, I know you don't give quarterly guidance, I think the Street's at revenue of $52.9 million in the second quarter, adjusted earnings around $0.35 and just curious if you're comfortable with those numbers putting that into the context of you say in the first quarter and the fourth quarter are strongest.
Gavin Southwell
Yes, I mean we're in a nice position in the business here. We sell policies in quarter one and in April that we know are going to last throughout 2017 and some into 2018. So we have a unique position compared to a lot of businesses where we can kind of see forward and got a long runway in order to kind of get a guide as to how future quarters are looking and that's great as a management team. So we're really happy with Q4 and Q1, we've had record quarters, record results across the board and we think that sets us up really well for the rest of the year. There's a lot of noise, we're in a pretty dynamic market. There's noise again today and last night. We've had this for several months now and I think we've responded to it very well. I look at our market, I look at our competitors and I feel that we're very well positioned not just for '17, but I think building into '18 as well. So you're right, we don't give quarterly guidance, but we have just raised our full year guidance for '17 on both revenue and adjusted earnings and we do have a history of outperforming.

Richard Close
So there's no reason why there would be a big step down in earnings in the second quarter?
Gavin Southwell
No, we just really wanted to flag that there has been a seasonality in prior periods in Q4 and Q1 and because we're on such a growth path and people can see that we have great sequential growth as well as year-over-year growth. I think we were just highlighting that we can have a great '17 and '18, we don't necessarily always have to have sequential growth as well. So it's still the right thing to kind of flag that to people because not everybody understands that some of the market dynamic that's there. So it's really just trying to be as helpful as possible for the audience.
Operator
Our next question is coming from Mike Grondahl of Northland Capital Markets.
Michael Grondahl
Could you expand a little bit on your comments about April, post the HHS rule change. Was that better than sort of your internal expectations if sales were up year-over-year?
Gavin Southwell
We wanted to give guidance to April, it felt amiss to talk about Q1. Everyone was aware that a new rule change came in April 1 and we talked about it a lot. So we wanted to be able to say, look, we saw a very healthy April in terms of performance that was there. To echo some of my previous comments, we feel that we're very well positioned, we're very happy with the year-to-date. In this business, we do a lot of pre-planning. We've got the access to giant amounts of data, not just from our business, but we deal with over 100 distributors, we have over 20 carriers. There's a lot of analytical work that's there. We have brokers who are involved and we also of course have HealthPocket, which gives us an oversight of every available product and of course we have the online business as well. So we spend a lot of time looking at what's happening on a daily sales point, a weekly sales point, a monthly sales point and constantly adjusting our models for different scenarios. So I think we've got a good view of how '17 is playing out and we're really happy with Q1 and also with April.
Michael Grondahl
Got it. Secondly, you provided an update kind of on your progress with new distributors. Could you also touch on any progress you're making with new carriers?
Gavin Southwell
When we attract a new carrier and we -- in our market, as we announce record quarters and we keep growing the way that we are, we are aware that we're fairly uniquely positioned in our market and we're very visible and so having attracted some new carriers, we're going through a process of launching products and getting them out there to our distribution and getting that established and so we looked at putting out press announcements to talk about some of the carriers that we'd added and we decided instead, we'll save that until after we've kind of gone through this bedding-in period. So, I think from our side, we made some great progress with carriers. I'd like to give some more detail, but from a commercial point of view, as we said before, we think '17 is a great opportunity for this business.
So the focus for us is let's focus on getting these products to the consumer who'll really benefit from the work we've done to provide broader coverages than you can historically get from these products and the consumer really needs that right now in this market and let's focus on that side and then I think we'll talk about it once we can see the impact of those products coming into our financials. So I'm sorry not to give more color, it simply with -- there's an opportunity we're laser focused on executing on this year and that's the priority.
Michael Grondahl
Got it, got it. And then lastly, did you see sort of the last quarter or 2, any change in kind of the retention of your policies or the duration of your policies for STM, limited medical or the supplements?

Gavin Southwell
Yes, I'll start and I'll hand over to Hersh. So there are some favorable signs in there in terms of our product mix. So we're seeing the hospital indemnity of a limited medical product grow at a more accelerated rate than STM and that has a greater lifetime value and so that has a material positive impact on our book of business. And so that's -- I mean, we are very happy with. Internally, we became a lot more obsessed with our data and what's happening within our book of business. So we're doing a lot of around retention and the ability for products to be able to last longer and that's by product, by carrier across the piece. And so that impacts the bundles that we're putting together and providing the distributors as we add distribution, as we add carriers, this work kind of builds upon itself. So I'd say that we're absolutely seeing some positive signs in terms of retention. The length of time is increasing in terms of products that are staying. The impact of that hitting our figures, it will filter through, again kind of through '17 and '18 and we won't see the full benefit, but that's a good place to be. We'll see kind of incremental gains as we move through the piece.
Michael Hershberger
That was great color on that and I would also add maybe our really laser focus on improved customer service and providing these best-in-class products have really been the function of that is the improved duration of our products.
Gavin Southwell
No, thank you. I did want to comment on that. We spend a lot of time, we invested a lot of time and energy in 2016. We added significant resource to our customer service and to our compliance departments. We added some very senior market people and a lot bodies. So our customer service response time is down to 2 seconds if you call our customer service. In our market, the average is way, way, way above that. We have a compliance team that's of a very significant size compared to businesses that have a far greater scale to ourselves and we have a complaint ratio which is at 0%. So we do have complaints, but we're at such a low level, it rounds down to 0.0 something and that's a great position to be in and we do that very deliberately, one is it's the right thing to do. This is individual health insurance and treating the consumer the right way, trying to help them understand what is a complex process and it's a very personal product to buy, it's very important that it's the right thing to do, but from a commercial point of view, if you can improve customer satisfaction and you can improve retention, the impact that has on your data and your stats and feeding through to your financials is very meaningful.
So we did that work in '16. We're building on that and we'll see the impact flowing through in '17 and '18. So there won't be any additional cost for this year. We already absorbed that cost in '16 and we were very happy with '16's financials. I just really wanted to give that flavor of sort of our approach and our view as to what we've done to kind of build out this business and prepare ourselves for the future, position ourselves for the opportunity that's ahead of us.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Steven Halper of Cantor Fitzgerald.
Steven Halper
Could you just talk about your views on the competitive environment in the short-term medical area especially after the changes that were implemented as of April 1?
Gavin Southwell
Yes, happily. The position that we have is favorable to perhaps our competition in that we have several carriers who provide STM products to our business on our technology platform and we have the ability to decide to choose which product goes to which distribution. And so when a regulatory change like that is announced, we work with each carrier in order to come up with the best solution for the consumer and that means that we had a lot of interested parties, a lot of aligned interests and it means that we were able to design solutions to the consumer, which meant that they were no worse off under the new legislation taking place on the 1st of April than they were prior to that. So the way that we did that, the way we designed it, we believe is unique in the STM market and it’s to do with the carriers agreeing to treat claims to kind of look through the periods so that it doesn't have a detrimental effect to the consumer by having 3 month policies and we think that's great for the consumer.

So we feel very proud that we were able to do that and it gives us a competitive advantage. So what we saw is a distribution out there who had previously worked with carriers, who were able to come up with similar solutions much more open to working with a business like ours than perhaps previously. So I think there's a bigger point here as well is that the STM change was a real change crystallized and that happened in our market that could have had an impact on our business and we're happy to say that change happened and April, we were ahead of prior year and Q1 we have record results across the board leading up to it. So I think it gives a bigger insight into our ability to adapt to change and so I think we absolutely have a competitive advantage in the STM market and I think once people understand that and then we can talk to them around look here's what's happening with our customer service and our compliance which are market leading, here's our technology platform, which allows you to significantly improve your ease of doing business, here's our approach to supplemental products and how this can help you as a distributor improve your sales and your retention and all of that good stuff.
And so that rule change, if anything, really helped us kind of highlight the things that we often talk about which is our ability to innovate and our ability to leverage these multiple carrier relationships. So we are very satisfied with how that whole process played out and so that's why we wanted to talk a little about April to kind of reassure people look, this is an actual change that happened and this is how we responded and we're very proud of that.
Operator
Our next question is coming from Frank Sparacino of First Analysis.
Frank Sparacino
Gavin, just wanted to go back to some of the earlier commentary around distribution capacity and try to get a sense of the additions your making this year in terms of how much additional capacity and I realize there's still productivity gains that you had within the existing channel, but just trying to get a sense of how much growth you think we'll have there?
Gavin Southwell
I'll be slightly careful because we -- I think that we've attracted a new distribution that certainly has the potential to be significant and I think that once we've created new relationships, there is that kind of bedding-in period and once we get past that period and we know that -- and there's no reason why it shouldn't of course, but we are very kind of pragmatic here is once we can see the compliance metrics are operating the way that we want, that the customer experience is working out the way that we need it to happen and all of those other things, that's when we'll start kind of building the impact on that distribution to our financials. So I'd say that I think there's great potential there. We're very happy with the progress we have made in that regard. It's a competitive market, it's a dynamic market and I think we're well positioned and that's why we've been able to have this success. So we are happy to talk about it, but in terms of giving specific guidance, it's probably a little early for that, but certainly as we go through '17, we'll be able to refer to it in a lot more detail. So I hope that's helpful. I know it's not the -- I hope that's helpful.
Operator
At this time, I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Southwell for any additional or closing comments.
Gavin Southwell
Thank you very much. Overall, we have a proposed rule that already hit our market and we've overcome all the kind of attention that currently is on healthcare in the US. I really just wanted to make the overarching point that our strategy hasn't changed. We are a consumer advocate and we've made significant investment in technology and resource to provide market leading customer service and compliance and by building on that and our enhanced use of data and our ability to work with leading carriers as well as distribution all across the nation, I think we're very well positioned for future growth and the need for affordable products the health insurance market in our market is only rising.

So whenever we look at changes happening in our market, we feel very confident about our ability to execute against our plan and we think that shown by our performance in -- certainly in the last two quarters. So I just wanted to thank you for your time and your interest in our business and we look forward to speaking again to you.

Gavin Southwell
Thanks, Cindy, and thank you everyone for joining us today. I am Gavin Southwell, President and CEO. As you will recall, I joined the Company in early 2016, I became the President in July, and I was appointed CEO and President by our Board of Directors in quarter four. I have met many current and potential investors already and I look forward to continuing to share our story in the near future.
We have a great team here at HIIQ and I've been looking forward to reporting our fourth quarter and year-end 2016 results as well as laying out our plan for continued growth in 2017 and into the future. I'm very excited about the opportunities that are in front of us.

We're pleased with our performance. Record fourth quarter revenues grew by 53% year-over-year to $51.4 million. Additionally, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share increased both year-over-year and sequentially. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $8.9 million, up 246% year-over-year and 10% sequentially. Adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.35, up from $0.10 in the fourth quarter of 2015 and $0.33 in the third quarter of 2016.
For the full-year 2016, we reported $184.5 million in revenue, a 76% year-over-year increase that exceeded our revenue guidance of $173 million to $178 million. We ended the year with adjusted earnings per share of $1.12, also exceeding our guidance of $0.88 to $0.95.
During the fourth quarter, we had several one-time events occur, including the retirement of our former CEO and the release of our deferred tax asset that originally occurred during our IPO in 2013, and these resulted in a negative EBITDA and GAAP earnings per share for the quarter. Our CFO, Mike Hershberger, will provide more details on the impact of these one-off events.
This quarter's strong financial performance reflected robust selling trends, especially during the ACA open enrollment period that began on November 1. We had record policies in force at the end of 2016, 290,100 policies, which represents a 49% year-on-year increase. During the quarter, we also set a new record for submitted policies, 178,900, representing a 17% year-on-year increase. The enhancement of our distribution system, including our direct to consumer division AgileHealthInsurance.com, helped us to accelerate sales in the most recent open enrollment period.
Looking forward to 2017, we expect to continue to grow and achieve more scalability in our operations. Our full-year guidance for 2017 for revenue is between $210 million and $220 million, which is a 15% to 20% increase year-over-year. Our non-GAAP metric of adjusted EBITDA will grow 20% to 30% year-over-year, which is $33 million to $36 million, and adjusted earnings per share to grow 20% to 30%, which is $1.35 to $1.45.
Throughout 2016, we have exceeded our expectations and we are optimistic about the future. The core strength of our Company is our technology platform. The heart of our operating model is a highly scalable, technology-driven Quote-Buy-Print platform. It provides a 24/7 real-time transaction service. This platform drives our scalability as a virtual administrator, fulfilling the needs of the consumer, our agents and our carriers. It's a foundation of our differentiated distribution model, including call centers and our direct to consumer capability, specifically AgileHealthInsurance.com. By adding new products to our portfolio and leveraging our proven technology platform, we remain confident in our ability to continue driving profitable growth.
Increased communication of the benefits of our IFP plans to our consumers and distributors is another key initiative in 2017. We believe that our plans are the best solution for about 40% of the consumer seeking individual plans. That's a $35 billion market and growing. The team at HealthPocket is leading that initiative.
We also plan to expand our call center distribution and continue to invest in our technology platform, including AgileHealthInsurance.com. This will enhance the scalability and maintain our competitive advantage. In quarter four 2016, AgileHealthInsurance.com, powered by the team at HealthPocket, sold approximately 22,400 short-term medical policies. This represents 26% of the IFP policies sold during the quarter. Year-over-year, Agile nearly doubled their sales and grew to be our largest distributor.
We continued to focus on scalability during the quarter. Quarter four core SG&A was 16.5% of revenue, which is better than 18.1% in quarter three and significantly healthier than a year ago when core SG&A was at 25.6% of revenue. Our improved margins and our technology platform, allowing the consumer, insurance carriers and distributors to efficiently interact, drives our scalability.

During the quarter, we also continued our disciplined focus and solid execution on our key strategic levers, product innovation, distributor development, online sales and operating leverage. Working with our strong carriers, we continue to lead the industry in product innovation. We have a history of creating quality, affordable and efficiently administrated health insurance products to meet the needs of consumers. These products provide important solutions for consumers when they cannot obtain or afford the ACA and we have the solutions for them.
We believe that the current macro political environment is favorable to our ability to innovate affordable health insurance products. We continue to help support our third-party distributor sales grow in a number of ways, including supporting their regulatory compliance by providing a scalable platform that mitigates risk, as well as investing in resource and technology in our own customer service, compliance and call center quality teams.
We continue to focus on our direct to consumer online business, AgileHealthInsurance.com. Our Silicon Valley team of developers and marketers continue to demonstrate phenomenal growth, retention and customer satisfaction, while increasing their marketing efficiency. Although there is an upfront cost of acquisition that's included in our SG&A, we expect to continue to drive revenue and profitability.
We also continue to focus on our overall scalability and leverage. We have a sophisticated technology-driven platform with demonstrated operating leverage, limited risk, excellent customer service, strong agent support tools and processes to ensure not only compliance but transparency with our regulatory partners, and we expect to continue to lead our market throughout 2017.
Now I'd like to provide an update on the rule issued by the Department of Health and Human Services or HHS related to short-term medical insurance under the Obama administration. HHS issued a rule change in 2016 that limits STM policies to be no more than three months in duration and require that specific language be used to explain noncompliance with the ACA, as well as providing a three-month STM with allowing consumers to reapply.
While we are disappointed that HHS has decided to implement changes to this product, as it will further limit consumer options for affordable health insurance, we believe strong demand continues to exist for the STM product and other affordable health insurance options and we will continue to provide innovative and affordable health insurance products.
Our fixed indemnity product, which we refer to as hospital indemnity, has become more popular with consumers throughout 2016. We believe that hospital indemnity addresses many of the consumer needs previously filled through STM policies, but now with the HHS-imposed limitations on STM, the demand for hospital indemnity will likely increase and we believe the total market opportunity may be even greater than that of STM.
We are currently working with various states as they review our numerous carriers' and distributors' compliance with state insurance regulations. We are proactively communicating and cooperating with all applicable regulatory agencies and we have provided a detailed action plan to regulators that summarizes our Company's enhanced compliance and control mechanisms. It's too early to determine whether any of these regulatory examinations will have a material impact on the Company. We look forward to working with state and federal insurance regulators to ensure consumers continue to have access to health insurance products that meet their personal and financial needs.
Throughout 2016, we have exceeded expectations and we are optimistic about the future. With the proposed HHS rule as well as regulatory scrutiny in our industry, our strategy for 2017 has not changed. We are a consumer advocate. Our investment in technology and resource to provide market-leading customer service and compliance, along with our enhanced use of data and our continued ability to work with leading carriers, means we are well-positioned for future growth while succeeding in our mission of providing affordable and innovative health insurance and related products to the consumer.

Improved communication of the benefits of our IFP plans to our consumers and distributors is a key initiative. We believe that our plans are the best solution for about 40% of the consumers currently seeking a solution, a $35 billion market and growing. We'll continue to expand our distribution and continue to invest in our technology platform, including Agile, to enhance our scalability and maintain a competitive advantage.
We appreciate your time today. Thank you for your interest in our Company. And I'd like to turn the call over to Mike Hershberger, our Chief Financial Officer.
Michael Hershberger
Thanks, Gavin, and good morning everyone. As I review the financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016, I'd like to highlight a few key points. We are pleased with our revenue growth, policies in force and adjusted EBITDA during the quarter.
As Gavin mentioned, we have several strategic initiatives underway that contributed to the acceleration of sales and profit during the open enrollment period at the end of 2016 and should contribute to sustained growth through 2017 and beyond. We will continue to invest in what we consider to be attractive growth opportunities in 2017.
Our fourth quarter revenues were a record $51.4 million, increasing by 53% compared to last year and 11.5% sequentially. For the year, our revenues were $184.5 million, an increase of 76% over 2015, exceeding our latest guidance of $173 million to $178 million.
Our total policies in force increased to a record 290,100 at the end of the fourth quarter, up 48.7% year-over-year and 15.1% sequentially. We saw strong growth in our IFP plans as well as supplemental products. As a reminder, supplemental products are generally included as a bundle along with the IFP products as we continue to meet our members' health insurance needs. Our supplemental products generally have a longer lifespan than the corresponding IFPs. Total submitted policies for the fourth quarter were up 16.6% year-over-year and 41.6% sequentially, providing visibility of future revenue in the upcoming quarters.
We experienced strong growth from our existing distribution channels in both submitted policies and policies in force, sequentially and year-over-year. Our fastest growing distributor during the quarter continued to be our online direct to consumer division, AgileHealthInsurance.com. Agile began selling policies during the second quarter of 2015 and our sales through Agile continued to accelerate year-over-year as consumers sought affordable health insurance online. During the fourth quarter, Agile sold 22,400 short-term medical policies, nearly doubling the submitted policies from Q4 2015.
Throughout 2016, we continued to leverage and drive scalability in our operations, and Q4 was no exception. Our core SG&A for the quarter, that is total SG&A less marketing leads and advertising, stock compensation and non-recurring costs, as a percentage of revenue was 16.5% in Q4 2016 compared to 25.6% in Q4 2015 and 18.1% sequentially. Core SG&A for 2016 as a percentage of revenue improved year-over-year from 31.1% in 2015 to 18.5% in 2016. The driver of this metric continues to be our highly scalable technology platform, integrating carriers and distributors while allowing consumers to quote their policy, buy their policy, print their insurance card and electronically secure health insurance coverage.
EBITDA was negative $4.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to negative $300,000 in the same period in 2015. EBITDA was unfavorably impacted by several one-time events in the fourth quarter, including severance related to our former CEO and COO which had a cumulative impact of approximately $2.9 million. This expense was a combination of cash severance of $1.4 million and stock compensation of $1.5 million. Additionally, we had a one-time non-cash release of our valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets. The release was triggered in part by the Company's projections of future taxable income. Due to this release, we recognized a corresponding liability for our tax receivable agreement obligation, resulting in a one-time, non-cash unfavorable impact of $9.1 million to EBITDA. The cumulative negative impact of EBITDA of these events in the fourth quarter was approximately $12 million. For the year, EBITDA was $11.7 million in 2016 compared to $2.5 million in 2015.

Fourth quarter 2016 GAAP earnings per diluted share was a $0.03 loss compared to a $0.02 gain in Q4 of 2015 and a $0.25 gain sequentially. Full-year 2016 GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.57 compares favorably to $0.08 in 2015. GAAP earnings per diluted share was also impacted by the one-time events in Q4, including the severance of our former CEO and COO which had a cumulative negative impact of $0.12 per diluted share, and the release of our deferred tax asset which had a negative impact of $0.13 per diluted share. The cumulative unfavorable impact of these one-time events in the fourth quarter was approximately negative $0.25 per diluted share.
Turning now to our non-GAAP metrics, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share increased both year-over-year and sequentially. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $8.9 million, compared to $2.6 million in Q4 2015 and $8.1 million sequentially. Full-year 2016 adjusted EBITDA was $27.8 million, compared to $6.6 million in 2015. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue increased to 17.2% for Q4 compared to 7.6% in Q4 2015. The full-year 2016 adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue was 15% compared to 6.3% in 2015.
Adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.35, compared to $0.10 in Q4 2015 and $0.33 sequentially. Full-year adjusted EPS was $1.12 compared to $0.27 in 2015. We exceeded our full-year guidance of $0.88 to $0.95 for this metric.
We believe that our non-GAAP metrics of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share provide a meaningful measure of our financial performance. We've provided a reconciliation of our GAAP metrics to our non-GAAP metrics in our earnings press release that was published last night.
We continue to make secured short-term loans to our distributors based on actual sales, that we refer to as advanced commissions. These advanced commissions assist our distributors with their cost of acquisition and provide them with working capital. We recover the advanced commissions from future commissions earned by the distributor on premiums collected over the period in which the policies renew. In the fourth quarter, we experienced a $6.3 million increase in advanced commission loans that we provide to our distributors, for a total of $37 million outstanding at year-end.
Cash and short-term investments totaled $12.2 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2016, up $4.5 million from the prior year. In 2016, we generated greater than $20 million of cash, net of financing. In the fourth quarter, we paid off the remaining $5 million of our bank line of credit, ending the year with no debt.
Looking forward to 2017, we expect to generate between $210 million and $220 million in revenue for the full year, which is an expected growth rate of between 15% and 20% year-over-year. We expect to generate adjusted EBITDA, that's a new metric we're providing guidance on this year, of between $33 million and $36 million, and adjusted earnings per share of $1.35 to $1.45, both expanding faster than our revenue growth. Our earnings reflect continued strong operational results and improved scalability, offset by accelerated product development and implementation expenses and our upfront cost of acquisition at AgileHealthInsurance.com.
2016 was a very productive year for Health Insurance Innovations team. The addition of Gavin Southwell as our CEO has provided significant energy and momentum heading into 2017. We expect to deliver strong results through our continued expansion of innovative products, continued expansion of our distribution networks including both existing and new distributors, maximizing our e-Commerce opportunity, providing best-in-class customer service, and continued scalability driven by our technology.

Thank you for your time today, and now we'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Mike Grondahl, a private investor. Please proceed with your question.
Mike Grondahl
Congratulations on the quarter. First question is really just, could you talk a little bit about the competitive environment and what you're seeing as it relates to short-term medical and hospital indemnity or limited medical?
Gavin Southwell
It's a great opportunity for us in 2017. I think the way that we positioned our business at that affordable side of the market has proven to be a very wise move. I think that if you look at health insurance overall, a lot of people who perhaps chose to head a lot more down the ACA route and were perhaps expecting a different administration are now adjusting that position. And I think we are very well-positioned to have an opportunity to potentially partner with people who want to be more in our side of the market, and I think we are very well-positioned to take advantage of potential changes coming from this new administration.
We often get asked about if there will be new entrants to a market and if that will impact us, I am happy for there to be competition. I think we have always been an innovative business, I think we are ambitious in terms of what we want to achieve, and so competition is okay. But I think if people out there are making strategic decisions, a good way to do more in this market is to partner with a business like ourselves and I think that brings a great opportunity that hopefully we can execute on throughout 2017.
Mike Grondahl
Got it. In terms of your kind of outlook for margins, how are you thinking about driving further scale in the business, what does it need to do that, is it just revenue growth, policy growth?
Gavin Southwell
There are a couple of parts to that, and of course we are very satisfied with the progress we've made to date. The first thing is, we talk a lot about our scalable model. The investment we've made in technology here means for the growth that we've created, we haven't had to add a lot of additional people and additional resource in order to administrate those additional volumes. And so that scalability really just shined through.
And as we look through to 2017, the investments in resources have already been made. They were made in 2016. We added significantly to customer service and compliance because we want to lead the market in both functions. So that was a deliberate strategic choice. But in 2017, we don't need to add any cost in order to handle bigger volumes.
The second part is, as we continue to grow, our ability to work with our carriers and unlock some of the value that's within this business will also allow us to keep enhancing those margins, and that's very exciting. My background is, I've worked with carriers, and I've worked a lot in kind of delegated authority on both sides from an intermediary and from a carrier side. And so for us, enhancing our use of data will help us to work a lot better with our carriers and really try to unlock some of that value, and all of that will help our margins.
Mike Grondahl
Got you. And then last question, I believe with open enrollment recently here, that December 15th is kind of one of the strongest days in that 2016 period, just because that's the day you need to sign up to get coverage January 1st. So assuming the fourth quarter, the December quarter was pretty back-end loaded, in looking at your guidance for 2017, does it embed in there that the first quarter could be the strongest quarter of the year?
Gavin Southwell
Quarter four was a fantastic quarter for us as a business. I mean we used the word 'record' a lot in our release and we're very proud of what happened in that quarter and the year overall. Quarter one, historically if you look in previous years has been a big quarter for this business. I think with the change in administration going into December, there was a question as to will that impact consumer choice and consumer behavior, and ultimately it didn't and December was great.

I think what we've tried to do is, we were asked a lot in 2016 about regulatory change, the STM rule was a surprise to our market and everybody had to really, really work with that, and I think we've got a great answer, I think we're very well-positioned. So, aware that we see a real potential for tailwinds to our business and we see a lot of positive signs from the administration around regulatory change that will benefit our business. We are not baking that into our numbers until we've crossed the 't's and dotted the 'i's because we spent a long time talking about regulatory change in 2016, and I know we're going to be talking about it in 2017.
So I think we can show really good, solid growth, particularly around adjusted EBITDA. And I think we've got the potential for some real favorable tailwinds, but let's confirm that and let's get this quarter under our belt. And then if we need to adjust and provide more information, then of course we will. And to us having been through this in 2016 and it feels like we're coming to the end of it, it just feels like that was the right way to approach it.
Michael Hershberger
Sure. And I'd like to add maybe something. That was a good summary, Gavin. I'd like to add that you are exactly right, Mike, that the strong fourth quarter especially at the end does provide visibility into the future of our revenues, as we recognize the revenue as the consumer pays on their policy. So, it certainly provides us with a really strong visibility going into 2017. And what we have decided as a company is not to provide guidance by quarter, but certainly as a whole for 2017 we are very comfortable with our guidance numbers.
Mike Grondahl
Got it, okay. Thanks a lot, guys.

Your next question today is coming from Mark Argento from Lake Street Capital. Please proceed with your question.
Mark Argento
Couple of questions. First off, I know as you referred to, just given or referred to earlier, the shift in regulatory environment, now one of the things that you guys were contemplating last year was the addition of more products into the portfolio. How are you thinking about the product portfolio going into 2017? Have you launched or are you planning on launching some new products?
Gavin Southwell
Great question. So we worked very hard in 2016 with a number of new carriers, big globally recognized carriers, we are very happy to partner with, and we built out a number of new products, some of which launched towards the end of 2016 and one of which is launching in the next kind of 7 to 10 days.
Where it gets very exciting for us is, on kind of the hospital indemnity side we have some products which have broader coverages than these products have historically had over the last 20 years. And also for [all of] [ph] the business, because of a lot of the good work we have done around our use of data and the value proposition we can give to carriers, it means that on a per policy basis we are better off than we were with previous hospital indemnity products. And so, I think you put those things together, I think that's very useful for us.
We have a number of other kind of add-on products, ancillary products which we refer to. We now sell more ancillaries than we do core products and that's really been a phenomenon of 2016 and that will really prove out in 2017. And again, choosing the right ancillary products to match to the core product and being able to bundle that together using our proprietary technology is a real benefit to this business, and I think we'll see those benefits really coming through as we move through the year, because obviously as margins improve, the impact – as Hersh nicely described, if we do a lot of sales in Q4, that filters through throughout the year.
Mark Argento

Great. And then kind of dovetailing off of that, obviously again a lot of regulatory change, but in Trump's speech the other night to Congress, he talked about really opening the borders to healthcare across state lines. When you look at your platform, in particular the Agile platform, the online platform, and the technology there, is that flexible enough, could you pivot, could you go after even a bigger opportunity if it presented itself, given how quickly things are changing in the regulatory environment?
Gavin Southwell
Absolutely. I mean, if we – we've compared every proposal that's been put forward and we have tried to look for commonality, and if we pick potential changes that would be an advantage to us, that we think would provide a material benefit, we can kind of monetize. Opening up those borders is certainly very helpful and we'd find that a real tailwind.
The platform, the Agile platform, we want to talk about it in two ways. We are very pleased with its performance in 2016. It grew very quickly, it's doubled in size, but there is so much more we can do with that platform. We deliberately built that platform on very new and very modern technology to allow us to be able to add products and adjust products very quickly. And so, we are already looking at adding additional types of product, and I think you'll see that continuing as we go through 2017.
I mean, I have worked with bigger organizations and I've been happy with how quickly we could make IT changes, but in this business we can make same-day changes in terms of turning things in or off, and we can get entirely new products up and running and then we can have our distribution trained on it very, very nimbly. So, for us, as we kind of transition through this year, that's an exciting time for us. I'm happy to be sat in this seat as we go through any sort of transition that's out there. I hope I answered the question there.
Mark Argento
That's helpful. And then my last question in regards to I think you said in your prepared remarks that you have expanded or at least are investing in your third-party distribution platform, maybe you could talk a little bit about if you have added the number of seats or the number of parties that you are working with there and how big of a focus will that be here going forward?
Gavin Southwell
So we have both sides of the coin are kind of good news here. We worked with first of all our top 10 and then our top 20 distributors that we kind of picked up, up and coming, existing people, and we saw some really great organic growth. A lot of our distribution is exclusive to us. They use our proprietary system and they use our advanced commissions to really drive their own acquisition costs. And so it's a great partnership.
So, on the first side of it, we've had some great organic growth that we are very happy with and we see that continuing, because as we get a better understanding and a deeper understanding of our partners, we can kind of pick and choose where we want to focus our time, and that's very valuable to us.
And also, I think as we really invested in our customer service and our compliance along with our technology, and a lot of those compliance and customer servicings are technology-based in terms of the control point, that's a real value-add. And so we are able to add additional distribution and we have an opportunity this year where we have the potential to add additional distribution to our network. There are some great businesses out there who we don't currently partner with, who we'd look to do more with throughout the year, and if we can that's fantastic, and if not that's okay too.
But there is both sides of the coin, from an organic side and from adding new distribution, we've had good news on both sides in 2016 and we see that continuing through 2017.

Mark Argento
Great. Thanks guys. Congrats on a solid quarter.
Operator
Our next question is coming from Greg Peters from Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.
Gregory Peters
I just wanted to step back, Gavin. In your comments, you talked about the investment in compliance you made last year, and it seemed like you were suggesting you didn't have any incremental expense on a year-over-year basis that really needed to be made. Can you provide some color around the type of investment you made in compliance and why really there is no incremental need for that investment going forward?
Gavin Southwell
Yes. So part of my background is, I was a Chief Risk Officer on both a carrier side and on a broker side. So, throughout my career and in my previous role as a COO, I have always had risk management and compliance and operations, customer service, all kind of reporting to me. And so I really understand the importance of those functions, and I don't see it as just a cost of doing business.
I think if you're really good at this, especially in such a highly regulated market, I think that's a real value-add, I think that can really help with your sales. And I think that all of our partners, our carriers certainly appreciate that we're protecting their brand, and I think our distribution, the more we can support them with that, I think that's useful.
So from a compliance side, we brought in some very high-quality people. We are working with an ex-insurance commissioner since the beginning of 2017. We have added kind of a higher quality, more expensive type of staff to our team to really show the importance we see in that area. And now we have done that, we don't need to build on that further in 2017. 2017's cost will be consistent with what we did in 2016.
So, I think it's partly because I have been around for about a year and my view is that being able to say that our customer service has gone from 10 minutes to a couple of seconds in terms of answering the phone, I think that is an impressive thing and something that helps us from a commercial point of view, and also it's the right thing to do in this type of market. So, just from an investor point of view, there isn't going to be any significant additional costs in 2017. I think we made those in 2016 and we started up with a great result.
Gregory Peters
Excellent. And from your past experience, the multi-state examination, this isn't a multi-year process, they don't take very long, correct? I mean should we get resolution of that pretty quickly or am I misreading that?
Gavin Southwell
So in 2016, we did wanted this process to conclude. I mean it's a process that's focused on a carrier we used to deal with and who we no longer deal with, and our involvement is specifically relating to that carrier. The two meetings in 2017, one at the beginning of quarter two and one in quarter three, and we are anticipating that resolution will absolutely be within 2017, but it is taking longer than we had hoped.
From our side, we have a great story to tell and we have shared that, and we are working very closely with everybody to try and expedite the process as best we can. I think the fact that we have been able to attract a very well-known visible insurance commissioner to work with us and really represent our business shows how we think this is going to evolve and conclude.
And so, it's kind of, I kind of think it is what it is. We are in a very highly regulated industry and we are doing our best, but of course it's in everyone's interest to try and conclude this as quickly as we can. But you are right, it shouldn't be too much longer.
Gregory Peters
Right, perfect. And then just switching over, the revenue, when you talk about the new products, when we think about the commission revenue from the IFP products versus the supplemental products, can you talk about the balance of which has higher margins? And when you bring on these new products, is the commission revenue comparable with the existing or is it lower commission revenue? Just give us sort of a state of the union on the revenue mix.

Michael Hershberger
Sure. Mike Hershberger here, CFO. So a really good question, Greg. So as we look at our sales of our IFPs, and Gavin talked about this, that we bundle in a supplemental product that we believe is an advantage to the consumer. So what we are able to do really as a company, and this is really a competitive advantage, is go out and identify those best products for the consumers. So, what we try to do is come up with a whole plate of options for the consumers.
And generally, when you think about our IFPs, if you think about maybe our IFPs as our core products, it's about – the supplemental products are about a 1-to-4 or 1-to-3 ratio with respect to the premiums that we collect, in that ballpark. And certainly we have all different kinds of products and we are continually driving, continually trying to drive increased margins on them.
Gavin Southwell
Yes. I'd also add in that a big focus of 2016 as we have really drilled into our numbers is we are very much focused on trying to unlock the value in the products. So I'd say that I think the premium to the consumer is remaining pretty static in terms of what they're going to be paying in 2017 versus 2016, and I think that our business mix per policy is improving in 2017 versus in 2016.
And the way we do that is a combination of the IFP products having new deals at an enhanced rate versus prior years, and looking very closely at how we bundle these products together, because we have several options. If you take a dental product, we have several options for that.
And so if we can select, having done this for several years, a product that's better for the consumer and because of their larger volumes we can negotiate and we can unlock some value in there, then that's a win-win for everybody in the chain.
And some of this information we talk about and other is fairly commercially sensitive, because we are in a chain with our distribution and our carriers, but hopefully that gives some good insight into kind of how we've approach in 2016.
And throughout 2017, what I'd say is, the data analytics, we are investing one-off CapEx costs, small to moderate CapEx cost side at, in enhancing software to really continue that process and keep trying to unlock that value, which is where you see adjusted EBITDA growing faster than our revenue, and we think that's a trend we'll see in 2017 and 2018.
Gregory Peters
Great. Thanks for the color, guys.
Operator
Our next question today is coming from Frank Sparacino from First Analysis. Please proceed with your question.
Frank Sparacino
Maybe just following up on an earlier question as it relates to margins, given the Agile business model with the upfront expenses, I'm trying to get a sense of where that business is kind of relative to the overall business from an EBITDA margin standpoint. I assume it's much lower but just wanted to get some color there.
Gavin Southwell
So the way we present our numbers, we don't segment out the Agile business on that basis. What we did in 2016 is we focused on growing that business in a very kind of controlled manner, and I think in 2017 we anticipate that growth continuing and we're going to focus on the profitability of that business, because as it keeps growing, that's a logical strategic area to focus on.
The great thing about that business, and where we don't see a conflict with our other distribution, is the demographic of people who buy online versus the demographic of people who buy through our other distribution channels just differ. So that means we are getting access to a whole new group of people. And so for us, a huge opportunity in 2017 is getting to the consumer.
I often get asked, if people understand the price point of these products and the coverages to that, why aren't they buying them? And it's because they don't know about it. So, trying to educate the consumer through our HealthPocket brand, trying to reach the consumer through Agile – and you'll notice, on Agile there's significantly more carriers on there now than there was at the same time last year. That will continue to increase, the types of products I think will continue to increase.

And I think but as we go through 2017, we'll look internally at potentially if we need to give additional information on that and if that's something that's going to be helpful, but it's not something we currently provide. So I hope that color is useful. I'm trying to answer the question as best I can, but it isn't something that we currently split out.
Frank Sparacino
Thank you, Gavin. And maybe lastly, just coming back, I guess I want to better understand, you talked about this in terms of one of the proposed Republican ideas is to sell insurance across state lines, and just trying to figure out how that positively impacts the business and what really changes for you?
Gavin Southwell
So first of all, state-by-state insurance as a theme I think can make a lot of sense for a lot of good reasons. Somewhere like Oklahoma is very different to somewhere like New York. And I'm kind of stating the obvious, but I understand why there would be different approaches to such a giant dispersed place.
But along with that, the other side of it is that the big administrative burden in terms of the state-by-state approach, in terms of just the admin, the paperwork and kind of cost associated, and the over-different kind of one-off type changes in nuances you have to make. So any kind of simplification of that is certainly helpful. And so I think that it's a helpful change. Until that happens for us – look, we have got very powerful proprietary technology and right now it works just fine, but anything that simplifies that would be helpful.
Some of the other things coming out which are worth highlighting is, if you look at what is being talked around with tax, so currently there is a tax penalty for buying non-ACA products, and there is a lot of information out there and it looks very likely that that tax penalty is going away. But it isn't 100% certain exactly how that will work and exactly how that will impact our business, very similar to the state line piece.
So my view on this is, I see both of these as a potential benefit and a potential tailwind, but until we understand exactly what the impact is going to be and how much of a benefit it would be, because the state line thing could be, okay that makes our lives a little bit easier or actually that's something a bit more fundamental. So let's kind of bottom that out before we bake that into our numbers, and that's the approach that we took.
Our view is, whether this change occurs or not, we think that we have got a great opportunity to meet and hopefully exceed expectations, as we did through 2016. But you are absolutely right, it's a great example. We are watching all this stuff very closely, we have as much information on it as I think anybody can have, we have as many people advising us as I think is possible, and we just want to be sure of the impact before we kind of give a final answer. So I hope that's helpful.
Frank Sparacino
It certainly is. Thank you, guys. Great results.
Gavin Southwell
Thank you very much. Appreciate it.
Operator
Thank you. We have reached the end of our question and answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments.

I wanted to thank everybody for joining us. We are very happy to talk about quarter four and 2016 and our expectations for 2017. I think what we are creating here is very exciting, and we enjoy and we welcome the opportunity to share our story, and I look forward to working with you all and continuing this conversation throughout the year. So thanks for the time, we really appreciate it, and anything you need, let us know.

Health Insurance Innovations, Inc.  Appoints Gavin Southwell as Chief Executive Officer, Raises 2016 Guidance

Patrick McNamee Transitioning Out as Chief Executive Officer
/EIN News/ -- TAMPA, Fla., Nov.  15, 2016  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Health Insurance Innovations, Inc. (NASDAQ:HIIQ), a leading developer, distributor, and virtual administrator of affordable health plans, announced today that the Health Insurance Innovations, Inc. (HII) Board of Directors has appointed Gavin Southwell, President of the Company since July 2016, to the role of Chief Executive Officer and board member, effective immediately.  In connection with this appointment, Patrick McNamee is transitioning out as Chief Executive Officer.
About Gavin SouthwellA strategic visionary and proven leader, Mr. Southwell brings with him nearly 15 years of executive leadership experience and a strong track record of delivering enhanced performance with a customer focused approach in his prior positions with insurance and insurance brokerage companies.  Since joining HII in April 2016, Mr. Southwell has been instrumental in the Company’s success in driving growth and controlling costs.  "I am excited about the opportunity to work alongside the HII Board and management team as CEO as we continue to execute our strategic vision and build on our record of innovation and success," said Mr. Southwell. "HII is an industry leader, and I have great respect for the entire HII team and look forward to building on the accomplishments of Patrick.  Patrick joined the company with the short-term goal of helping to build a solid foundation for growth, and he accomplished this goal.  He will be available to help in the transition through year end. HII will continue to focus on industry leading growth while optimizing profitability and cash flow generation.   I believe that the Company is well-positioned for future growth and an exciting 2017.” Guidance RaisedBased on a strong start of the open enrollment period, HII is raising both its revenue and adjusted earnings per share guidance.   For the full year 2016, we now expect Revenue to grow between 65% and 70% year-over-year ($173 million to $178 million) and Adjusted EPS to grow between 230% and 250% ($0.88 to $0.95). Previously we guided Revenue of $170 million to $175 million and Adjusted EPS of $0.85 to $0.92. "The Open Enrollment Period that opened on 11/1/16 was favorable to our expectations, reflecting strong demand for our affordable health insurance products while continuing to execute on our plan," said Gavin Southwell, HII's newly appointed Chief Executive Officer. "Our strong distribution network, including our e-commerce division, AgileHealthInsurance.com, and our diverse product offerings continue to drive our sales growth." About Health Insurance Innovations, Inc. (HII) HII is a market leader in developing innovative health insurance products that are affordable and meet the needs of health insurance plan shoppers. HII develops insurance products through partnerships with best-in-class insurance companies and markets them via its broad distribution network of licensed insurance agents across the nation, its call center network and its unique online capability.  Additional information about HII can be found at HiiQuote.com. HII's Consumer Division includes AgileHealthInsurance.com, a website for researching, comparing and purchasing short-term health insurance products online and HealthPocket.com, a free website that compares and ranks all health insurance plans, and uses objective data to publish unbiased health insurance market analyses and other consumer advocacy research.  Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are statements other than historical fact, and may include statements relating to goals, plans and projections regarding new markets, products, services, growth strategies, anticipated trends in our business and anticipated changes and developments in the United States health insurance system and laws.

These and other risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements are discussed in HII's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as well as other documents that may be filed by HII from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available at www.sec.gov.

Controlled functions - previousControlled functions are the tasks that an individual (and some firms) must be approved for so they can perform them in an authorised firm.
 There  are 2 reasons an individual may be shown as ‘inactive’.  Either they are no longer approved by the FCA, or they may work for a firm subject to the new Senior Managers and Certification Regime, effective from 7 March 2016, which covers banks, building societies, credit unions and PRA designated investment firms.  In these firms only Senior Managers are pre-approved. Firms  now assess other functions such as Customer Functions (CF30s) (including retail investment advisers ). Individuals will show a current status of ‘Inactive’ on the register in these firms if they used to be approved by the FCA. 

If an adviser is not listed, or shown as ‘inactive’, and you would like to check their status, you should confirm this directly with the firm the adviser is currently working with.
