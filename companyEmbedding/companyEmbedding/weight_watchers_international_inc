            “One particular weekly Meeting topic was ‘Believe.’ The Leader told us, ‘Visualize yourself at your goal. What does it look like to you?’ I found an old photo of myself and I started picturing myself after my goal—and I started to believe.”

                      Why SmartPoints work

                       The Science of SmartPoints                     


		Calories set the baseline for how many SmartPoints a food is worth.
	

		We then factor in sugar and saturated fat (which raise the SmartPoints value)
	

		We also look at protein (which helps lower it)
	

		The goal: You'll start eating more fruits, veggies, and lean protein and less sugar and unhealthy fat.

	Service Revenues

	in Q1 2017 were $261.5 million. On a constant currency basis, these revenues increased 8.5% versus the prior year period. This increase was primarily driven by revenue growth in North America and

	Product Sales and Other

	in Q1 2017 were $67.6 million. On a constant currency basis, these revenues increased 9.3% versus the prior year period, primarily reflecting revenue gains in North America.




	 




	 


	


	 



	Operating Income

	in Q1 2017 was $30.2 million compared to $13.6 million in the prior year period. This increase was primarily driven by higher member volumes in the quarter versus the prior year period.




	 




	 


	


	 



	Income Tax

	in Q1 2017 was a benefit of $9.1 million, which reflected a one-time $11.9 million tax benefit related to the previously announced cessation of operations of the Companys Spanish subsidiary.




	 




	 


	


	 



	Net Income

	Earnings per fully diluted share (EPS)

	in Q1 2017 was $0.16 compared to a loss of $0.17 in the prior year period.





	Certain Items Affecting Year-Over-Year Comparability



	 




	 


	


	 


	Q1 2017 results include a tax benefit of $0.18 per fully diluted share that was offset by $0.01 per fully diluted share of expense, both related to the previously announced cessation of operations of the Companys
	Spanish subsidiary.






	Full Year Fiscal 2017 Earnings Guidance




	The Company is raising its full year fiscal 2017 earnings guidance to between $1.40 and $1.50 per fully diluted share.




	First Quarter 2017 Conference Call and Webcast




	The Company has scheduled a conference call today at 5:00 p.m. ET. During the conference call, the members of the Interim Office of the Chief Executive
	Officer will discuss the first quarter fiscal 2017 results and answer questions from the investment community. Live audio of the conference call will be simultaneously webcast over the Internet on the Companys corporate website,
	www.weightwatchersinternational.com. A replay of the webcast will be available on this site for approximately 90 days.



	Statement regarding
	Non-GAAP Financial Measures



	The following provides information regarding non-GAAP financial measures used in this earnings release:


	To supplement the Companys consolidated results presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), the
	Company has disclosed non-GAAP financial measures


	 


	3






	of operating results that exclude or adjust certain items. The Company presents in the attachments to this release the non-GAAP financial measure earnings before interest, taxes,
	depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation (EBITDAS). In addition, the Company presents certain of its financial results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results. Constant currency information compares results
	between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. In this release and any attachments, the Company calculates constant currency by calculating current-year results using prior-year foreign currency exchange rates.


	Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information for its and investors evaluation of the Companys
	business performance and are useful for period-over-period comparisons of the performance of the Companys business. While management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Companys business,
	this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures
	may not be the same as similarly entitled measures reported by other companies. See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures attached to this release and reconciliations, if any, included elsewhere in this release for a
	reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.

                       The Science of SmartPoints                     


		Calories set the baseline for how many SmartPoints a food is worth.
	

		We then factor in sugar and saturated fat (which raise the SmartPoints value)
	

		We also look at protein (which helps lower it)
	

		The goal: You'll start eating more fruits, veggies, and lean protein and less sugar and unhealthy fat.

                    1                  









    You'll say hello and weigh in  

    No, you don't weigh yourself in front of everyone! Most meetings have little booths with a private scale.
  

 
 



                    2                  









    Meetings are 30-40 minutes  

    Your meeting will cover a topic that's relevant to weight loss. You can talk as much (or as little) as you want.
  

 
 



                    3                  









    It’s ok to feel what you feel  

    Every person in the room has been in your shoes and has your back. That's the beauty of Weight Watchers!
  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
























	See why meetings work so well.

 























            “One particular weekly Meeting topic was ‘Believe.’ The Leader told us, ‘Visualize yourself at your goal. What does it look like to you?’ I found an old photo of myself and I started picturing myself after my goal—and I started to believe.”

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
