Business Continuity - Hutchinson Shockey Erley & Co
































 









    	 







Hutchinson Shockey Erley & Co















Business Continuity
This is a summary of the Business Continuity Plan (the “Plan”) of Hutchinson, Shockey, Erley & Co. (HSE). The Plan is designed to address a significant business disruption affecting HSE’s business operations conducted at its Chicago headquarters and sets forth HSE’s objectives of safeguarding employees, recovering and resuming operations, protecting books and records, and enabling communications with employees, investors, key service providers, and regulators. All of HSE’s mission critical systems and processes are conducted or located in Chicago, although the firm also has offices in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Phoenix, Arizona, Española, New Mexico, Denver, Colorado, Houston, Texas, St. Clair Shores, Michigan, and Los Angeles, California.
Whether you are a customer of HSE, an issuer of municipal securities, or a business partner, you should be aware that HSE is committed to planning for and being prepared for a significant business disruption. The Plan addresses two types of significant business disruptions – “internal” disruptions, such as a fire in HSE’s building, affecting only HSE’s ability to communicate and do business, and “external” disruptions, such as an event that might prevent the operation of the securities markets or a number of firms. In either event HSE’s goal will be to recover its critical business processes with minimal interruption, on the same day, if possible, although the length of the disruption is expected to be longer in the event of an external disruption, particularly one affecting the entire securities industry.
The Plan covers HSE’s critical business processes that are essential for HSE to continue to conduct business for a temporary period during a business interruption. Every important aspect of HSE’s securities business, including communications with customers and issuers of municipal securities, order entry and execution, order clearance and public finance is addressed in these processes.
Among the matters addressed in the Plan are the following: •Alternative Physical Location of Employees

Customers’ Access to Funds and Securities
Data Back-Up and Recovery
Financial and Operational Assessments
Mission Critical Systems
Alternate Communications Between the Firm and Customers, Employees and Regulators
Continuation of Business with Critical Business Constituents, Counter Parties and Banks
Communications with Regulator

Information technology is central to HSE’s operations. HSE has systems in place for the back-up and recovery of information needed to conduct its business. The Plan identifies the functions, processes and resources necessary to support the restoration and resumption of HSE’s business.
Customers of HSE should note that HSE does not have custody of customer securities, and has custody of funds for only a small minority of its customers. In the event of an internal or external significant business disruption, if telephone service is available, customers will continue to have access through normal channels to their investments and the ability to make purchases and sales despite HSE’s experiencing a significant business disruption, unless the disruption is industry wide in scope.
This summary is subject to modification from time to time as HSE reviews the Plan and its business operations. Customers may obtain a written copy of this summary by contacting Hutchinson, Shockey, Erley & Co., Chief Financial Officer, by mail at 222 West Adams St., Suite 1700, Chicago, IL 60606.
In conclusion, HSE’s Plan addresses the steps HSE will take to address a temporary business disruption in a systematic and organized fashion. The effects of a disaster are of course difficult to predict and the disruption of systems and processes on an industry-wide basis will pose great business continuity challenges for any firm in the securities industry. There can be no assurance that any plan can address such unforeseen contingencies.
Addendum
In the event of a pandemic, HSE’s Business Continuity Plan will be followed.

SIPC Notice - Hutchinson Shockey Erley & Co
































 









    	 







Hutchinson Shockey Erley & Co















SIPC Notice
SIPC Protection for Hutchinson, Shockey, Erley & Co. Brokerage Accounts
Hutchinson, Shockey, Erley & Co. is a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), which protects securities of its members up to $500,000 (including $200,000 for claims for cash). An explanatory brochure available upon request or at www.sipc.org or by calling 202.371.8300.
SIPC coverage is not the same as the insurance on bank accounts provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). It does not protect investors against a decline in the market value of securities. SIPC generally protects customers against the physical loss of securities if the broker/dealer holding the securities for the customer fails.

Public Finance
Milwaukee, Wisconsin
The Wisconsin Public Finance office provides financial services to cities, villages, towns, counties, sanitary districts and school districts throughout the State of Wisconsin. Since 1998 when the Wisconsin office of HSE opened, we have provided over $5.4 billion in financings, which represents nearly 1,000 debt issuances. The average tenure of the Public Finance professional in our Wisconsin office is over 30 years in the industry.
A solid, comprehensive plan of finance, incorporating the client’s goals, capital plan, outstanding debt and future needs is a required first step. The issuance of debt is the result of the consideration of financing alternatives, accurate projections and consensus among staff and elected officials as to the best way to proceed. Our reputation and success is built on client relationships. In many cases, we have worked with the same municipal governments for over 30 years.
