Community Bank System and Oneida Financial Announce a Change in the Anticipated Closing Date, the Extension of the Election Deadline for Electing the Form of Merger Consideration and the Settlement of Stockholder Litigation | Business Wire


























































Community Bank System and Oneida Financial Announce a Change in the 
      Anticipated Closing Date, the Extension of the Election Deadline for 
      Electing the Form of Merger Consideration and the Settlement of 
      Stockholder Litigation






June 10, 2015 04:40 PM Eastern Daylight Time



SYRACUSE, N.Y. & ONEIDA, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Community Bank System, Inc. (“Community Bank System”) (NYSE:CBU) and 
      Oneida Financial Corp. (“Oneida Financial”) (NASDAQ:ONFC) announced 
      today that they expect additional time will be required to obtain the 
      necessary regulatory approvals to complete their proposed merger 
      announced on February 24, 2015.
    

      Community Bank System and Oneida Financial believe that the anticipated 
      timeframe for closing the transaction will be extended beyond early 
      July, which was the timeframe that was previously communicated to 
      stockholders. Community Bank System and Oneida Financial intend to close 
      the merger as soon as possible following the receipt of all necessary 
      regulatory approvals, as well as the approval of Oneida Financial 
      stockholders and satisfaction of all other conditions to closing. At 
      this time, the parties anticipate the merger will close in the third or 
      fourth quarter this year, depending upon the receipt of all necessary 
      regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of all closing conditions.
    

      Oneida Financial will hold its Special Meeting of Stockholders on June 
      17, 2015, as scheduled, to permit stockholders to vote on the merger. 
      However, as a result of the change in the anticipated closing date, the 
      election process that is currently underway to permit the Oneida 
      Financial stockholders to elect the form of their merger consideration 
      is being extended. Oneida Financial stockholders who previously sent 
      election materials to the Exchange Agent may withdraw their election, in 
      which event any stock certificates that have already been sent to the 
      Exchange Agent will be returned promptly. Oneida Financial stockholders 
      will be receiving a letter with further information about the election 
      process, the new election deadline, and the procedures for withdrawing 
      any election previously submitted to the Exchange Agent and obtaining 
      the return of any Oneida Financial stock certificates. Oneida Financial 
      stockholders should not send their election materials and stock 
      certificates to the Exchange Agent until receiving this additional 
      information.
    

      Additionally, Oneida Financial, Community Bank System and the other 
      defendants have entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with the 
      plaintiffs regarding the settlement of the putative class action 
      lawsuits captioned Paul Parshall v. Richard B. Myers, et al (Index 
      No. CA2015-000577), John Solak v. Richard B. Myers, et al (Index No. 
      CA2015-000684), and Linda Colvin v. Oneida Financial Corp., et al. 
      Oneida Financial’s anticipated total out-of-pocket costs, including 
      legal fees, related to the settlement of the putative class action 
      lawsuits should not exceed $100,000.

Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Information


      This release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of 
      the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 giving Oneida 
      Financial’s and Community Bank System’s expectations or predictions of 
      future financial or business performance or conditions. Forward-looking 
      statements are typically identified by words such as “believe,” 
      “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “target,” “estimate,” “continue,” 
      “positions,” “prospects” or “potential,” by future conditional verbs 
      such as “will,” “would,” “should,” “could” or “may,” or by variations of 
      such words or by similar expressions. These forward-looking statements 
      are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which 
      change over time. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date 
      they are made and we assume no duty to update forward- looking 
      statements. Actual results may differ materially from current 
      projections.
    

      In addition to risk factors previously disclosed in Oneida Financial’s 
      and Community Bank System’s reports filed with the U.S. Securities and 
      Exchange Commission and those identified elsewhere in this release, the 
      following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ 
      materially from forward-looking statements or historical performance: 
      the ability to obtain, or delays in obtaining, regulatory approvals and 
      to meet other closing conditions to the merger, including approval by 
      Oneida Financial’s stockholders; delay in closing the merger; business 
      disruption following the merger; the inability to realize cost savings 
      or revenues or to implement integration plans and other consequences 
      associated with the proposed merger; changes in asset quality and credit 
      risk; changes in interest rates and capital markets; and changes in 
      legislation or regulatory requirements.

      on March 30, 2015 a Registration Statement on Form S-4 that includes a

      System (together with the Proxy Statement, as amended, the “Proxy
