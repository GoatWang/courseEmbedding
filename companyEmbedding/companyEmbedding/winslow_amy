Age: 45
Education: Bachelor’s degree, biology, Brown University, 1993; MBA, Harvard Business School, 1999

Professional challenge
"Since our acquisition by a global diagnostics firm, I can now tackle overseas expansion, where lead poisoning is a serious problem. However, this adds regulatory and commercial complexity as well as new cultural and business issues. I’m thinking a lot about navigating these challenges to find the fastest paths for growth."

Amy Winslow thinks the market for her company’s main products is tragically too big.




Not that Winslow, whose Magellan Diagnostics makes lead-diagnostics equipment for physicians and laboratories, isn’t prepared to tap into the growing national and international demand for products that can quickly identify whether patients, especially children, suffer from lead poisoning. It’s more about how so many people, and policymakers, still don’t appreciate how widespread, dangerous and preventable the threat is from lead-based products, whether the lead is found in paint, water pipes, brass light fixtures or even food.
“It’s shocking,” Winslow, head of Magellan Diagnostics since 2011, said of the extent of lead contamination across the county and world. “Apathy is our biggest rival. I feel passionate about this issue as both a professional and as a mother.” With its sale last year to Meridian Bioscience for $66 million, the North Billerica-based Magellan Diagnostics, with 62 employees and revenue of $16 million when it was sold in early 2016, now has the backing and opportunity to aggressively expand its market reach overseas, where demand is high for its products, especially it’s much-in-demand LeadCare II, a portable lead-diagnostics instrument that doctors can use in their own offices to test patients for lead poisoning.
For Winslow, her work at Magellan and the opportunities that lie ahead are the culmination of a career that combined her talents, interests and passions for both entrepreneurship and the sciences.
A native of the Midwest whose family moved to the Boston area when she was young, Winslow is the daughter of a tech entrepreneur father, an executive-search and venture capitalist mother and the granddaughter of a scientist and inventor who once taught at MIT’s Sloan School of Management.

“It runs in the family,” she says of the entrepreneurial and scientific interests she inherited.
After graduating from Brown University with a degree in biology, Winslow has worked over the years, usually on the business side, as a product manager at C.R. Bard, a marketing manager for Genzyme Transgenics, vice president for marketing for Athena Diagnostics and most recently as founder and owner of MW Advisory, a strategy and marketing consulting firm serving fast-growing companies in novel diagnostic and device markets.
Earlier this decade, she was recruited to run a then-small Magellan Diagnostics, a spinoff from Magellan Biosciences, and she was intrigued with its main product, now known as LeadCare II. Among Magellan’s other products today are LeadCare Plus and LeadCare Ultra, geared toward laboratory clients, but LeadCare II remains the backbone of its products line. “Our little system is loved by our clients,” she said.
After consolidating operations and expanding its sales, marketing and distribution teams, Winslow grew Magellan from a 20-person company to today’s 62 employees.
“Amy is very thoughtful and strategic, with a leadership style that is able to bring together people with disparate perspectives and backgrounds to work toward a common goal,” says Peter H. Glick, former executive chairman at Magellan Diagnostics. “She did a great job transforming a small product line into a fully integrated company, and then using that platform to maximize the number of kids we could help protect from lead poisoning.”
When not running her company, Winslow, the mother of two, has been involved in organizations such as the Boston Museum of Science and Women in Science and Engineering, which helps professional women in the sciences and pushes to increase interest among females in STEM-related fields. She also blogs on Huffington Post to raise awareness about lead poisoning and prevention.
“People are becoming more aware” of lead poisoning, she says. “(But) we still have a long way to go.”

Getting your Hardware Product into Retail with Amy Wenslow of Product to Profits

April 20, 2016 


Amy Wenslow is the CEO of Products to Profits, a consulting company that specializes in helping small businesses & hardware startups get their products onto the shelves of retail stores. There aren’t a lot of resources focused on how to grow a hardware startup into a business post crowdfunding.  A lot of attention has been given to developing a product and then crowdfunding the product. However, if you truly want grow into a hardware business you’re going to have to scale and get into retail to sell your product to more consumers.

So it is with great excitement that we were able to ask Amy some questions and have her share advice with our readers on getting products into retail.  This is your opportunity to get some free insider-information that can help you to take your business to the next level!
Questions and Answers
Greg: I have the pleasure of having Amy Winslow, founder of a great company called Products To Profits. Today, she is going to help us learn a little bit more about how to take products to market. Thanks Amy for joining us!
Amy: You are absolutely welcome Greg, I am really excited when I get a chance to talk with people that are launching new projects and putting something innovative out in the space.
Greg: One of the questions that come up often amongst hardware startups is how to get connected to buyers. What do you suggest startups can do to start reaching out and make that connection?
Amy: When you’re looking to connect with a buyer, one of the first things you want to do is try to work with the connections and contacts you have in your network. Number one thing to focus on is making sure you are talking to the right people. We see people make the mistake of finding a contact with a Walmart buyer or a Target buyer and when they call and first speak to them they go, “blaalalalalalalala” all about their products. Then it turns out it’s not even the right category buyer or it’s an assistant buyer! So you want pay attention to the categories that the buyers are working in because there are a host of buyers at every one of the large corporations that buy different categories of products.
Second, you want to make sure that your pitch is concise.  If you’re doing the pitch in email make sure to proof read it for grammar. Your pitch should be personable and friendly, but it has to put forth the case of why your product earns a place in their store. I really want to stress that the buyer is interested in how much money your product is going to generate per square foot in their location. Even with online sales, it’s how much of your product are you going to be able to sell. The more prepared you are in the beginning of the conversation, the more it sets you up to look like you’re going to be an amazing partner for them.
Greg: What are some of those key numbers or key points that you should make sure to address, you know, in that first phone call, or that first email?
Amy: The first thing you’ll want to address is if you have any sales history with them.  For example, if you are moving from selling with Target online to Target in-store they are going to be able to look at the online sales history. You’ll want to be able to address questions around any little glitches or things like being out of stock for a month or your sales tanking online. You’ll want that information prepared and ready to be addressed, but don’t lead with it and say, “Well, you know when you look at your sales history, you’re going to see there was a dip in February.”
Some other things you should be prepared to talk about are the sales numbers, the costs, delivery timelines and how long until the first order.  You want to have your data about the product lined up, which means having UPC codes that are right and descriptions that are right.  Have the back office of your product set up because if they like it, they’ll ask for forms pretty quickly and you want to make sure you’ve got those pieces in place.
Greg: Great information. Yeah, we have seen a number of startups go through that cycle and not be prepared for those next steps
Amy: It’s such a speed bump that takes emotional energy out of your sales and the pace can get a bit exhausting sometimes
Greg: What are some of the things that buyers are looking for in new products?
Amy: Well, IoT is obviously huge with buyers but one of the main things that they’re looking for is – how is this product driving sales? When you’re talking to a buyer the things they look at are: Is it relevant to their consumer? Meaning – Does this product work for the market they sell to? They are going to look for products and the see if they into the market that they are serving. You want to have good packaging in place with UPC’s that are set up properly for the area you want to sell into.
The buyer is also going to look at: Do you have good instructions? Do you have sales history?  When you send in your sell sheets, have them be clear, send some lifestyle images that show the story of the product and talk about the benefits, not the features. A lot of people making products will focus a lot on the features of their product, but people and buyers really want to know what the benefits are of using your product, who’s going to use it, and is it their market? Those are the really big pieces to cover.
Greg: Absolutely. How is it going to change their life in a unique way, right?
Amy: And are the benefits a positive thing? Does the buyer see that somebody is going to naturally understand your product and see that it’s for him or her? Packaging has to support that experience as well, so that you can get the best price on the product, which gives you and buyers store location the best profit margin you both can get.
Greg: Many of our startups haven’t developed sales yet, but they maybe had a great crowdfunding campaign with some numbers that can be pretty compelling. How do you see that fitting into the buyer relationship?
Amy: It fits really well. If you have done a great crowdfunding campaign you should hopefully have some data about what had people donate or what compelled people to click on an ad. If you ran ads and tested a bunch of different messages, that’ll tell you what features are most important about the product. By running Facebook or Twitter ads you can frequently get demographic information about who actually clicked on your ads.
This can be huge when you’re talking to buyers because you can say this product does really well with a certain demographic. You can also angle your sales presentation and say you found a certain feature of your product was popular and drove our sales. You can also mention you see the buyer’s customers purchase other products that have similar features.
Greg: So they’re looking for both marketing information to make sure that it’s the right fit for their demographic and their category?
Amy: Yeah, absolutely. Investors are always looking at crowdfunding platform statistics to see what’s driving the success with crowdfunding campaigns. One of the big points about crowdfunding is making sure products raise enough money to actually deliver on the gift that they get in exchange for the donation, because that’s really the right way to be talking about it. It’s much better for your business to say donation with gift, then to say pre-sales of product.
That’s a best practices nuance, but you have to raise enough money to actually deliver on the reward. Then the other part is to make sure the company stays in communication with the early adopters because they’ll spring gorge you and you can get testimonials that’ll help you with buyers, which in return can help you with other sales.
Greg: What do you see as some of the biggest mistakes among startups that are trying to develop those relationships?
Amy: The biggest mistake a startup business can make when trying to develop buyer relationships is to randomly go to every contact they can find. We always recommend that people separate the opportunities into three buckets or tiers. If you know that this product should be selling in a Nordstrom or Best Buy then you don’t go sell it to Costco first.  I see people take any opportunity that comes across as a good opportunity and they try to make it work, but that’s not the case! Some opportunities will kill the bigger strategies of your business. If you take Costco orders first and you set weird pricing, you may never get the high-end order. A very big piece of advice is to keep your opportunities in sequence.
Other challenges people face are putting off dealing with some of the infrastructure of their business. I would really recommend getting professional help with things like your accounting. It will save you time, effort and help build momentum a lot quicker than of you had done or learned it by yourself. My advice is to hire the expertise and learn alongside them.
Greg: We have certainly found besides just the knowledge and the experience of doing it, you also get those relationships, the network, all of those maybe good ideas that tried and failed, and all the understanding from that, that is a little bit under the surface that really goes a long way to moving quick and getting sales and early ramping up
Amy: I am a big fan of learning from other peoples mistakes so that I don’t have to make them all myself.
Greg: Yes, absolutely, it’s enough mistakes to make by yourself right?
Amy: Exactly, so, I love that question, thank you for asking it. I want to just finish up with one piece here, and I’d really encourage everybody to keep in mind that if you’re talking about your business as a small business, you actually are limiting it. I really encourage people to think about their business in terms of where it’s going and to get committed to that vision. The reality is that the majority of jobs and economic growth in this country comes from small businesses!
They come from innovation and somebody thinking creative and taking action. I just really want to make sure that everybody keeps that in mind – it’s not just a small business, you’re running a business.  You’re expanding and growing into it all the time, no matter where you are.
Greg: That vision goes a long way to really framing the kinds of questions, and how you answer those questions, I think certainly.
Amy: I’d really like to invite your community to come on to the live Q&A calls that I do every other Monday. They are on our website homepage – people can see more there. You can find that at www.productstoprofits.com. We specialize in working with hardware and consumer products that want to go to very large volume sales quickly, effectively, and in the smoothest way possible.
Conclusion
Well there you go! There’s certainly a lot of information to take away from that and hopefully you learned something from the discussion – we sure did.
While there is an awful lot to sift through there, a number of things really stand out. One is to make sure you do your research. If you’re approaching a buyer then know your numbers; especially if you’re already selling! Likewise, make sure that you’re collecting qualitative information from your backers and site visitors rather than just looking at the quantitative data. Don’t ask how many clicks your ad has – ask who has been clicking it!
Keep an eye on the internet of things if you’re looking for new hardware opportunities. And don’t take every opportunity that comes your way: stay focused on your bigger strategies.
We are very grateful to Amy for sharing all this information with us and if you’d like to hear more from her, then be sure to check out the website where she provides lots more free information in the form of videos and blog posts.

FAQ - Products To Profits

Frequently Asked Questions
 

Q: How long does it take to create product for retail stores?

					A: It can move as quickly as 17 days or take years depending on how involved the design of the product itself is.

				 
 
Q: How much inventory do I need to be able to meet with a big retail chain?

					A: Surprisingly, almost none. One of the most deadly mistakes of a new business is ordering inventory too early!

				 
 
Q: What is intellectual property?

					A: Intellectual property is a creation of thought. Legally protected types of intellectual property are patents, trademarks, trade secrets and copyrights.

				 
 
Q: Are you a patent attorney or an intellectual property attorney?

					A: No. We are not attorneys. We work with inventors to build successful product based businesses. Intellectual property attorneys do not generally get involved with the product development or distribution. They also do not usually advise people on the best ways to create revenue, or sales, from the idea.

				 
 
Q: I showed my product to a retail store and they aren’t calling me back. What happened?

					A: There are several possibilities. Most commonly, the information was incomplete or hard for the buyer to work with. Due to buyers’ busy schedules, information must be presented in the formats most commonly used for sales presentations. Also, incomplete information can disqualify you from serious buyer consideration. Secondly, your retail positioning or strategy might not have been a fit for that buyer’s goals / needs. You must understand the language and needs of retailers to be successful.

				 
 
Q: How does Products To Profits work with clients?

					A: We work alongside you, or your business team, using our discerning expertise mixed with engaging insights to create dynamic results.

				 
 
Q: How is Products To Profits different than an invention submission company?

					A: There are several major distinctions.
We listen to your goals and very precisely select the best, most likely, strategy for that particular goal to happen.
We work mostly with people that want to build product based businesses. Invention submission companies typically recommend licensing out a product.
We turn projects down where we don’t see how the project could make money for the creator.
We chose to only work on products that are good for people and the planet.
Our clients must want to have some fun along the way.
 
 
Q: What is your refund policy?

					A: We invest time getting to know you and your project before taking you on as a client. If we agree to work together, all sales are final.

				 
 
Q: Do you guarantee my product will be successful if I work with Products To Profits?

					A: The process of putting together a winning product has countless variables. Some involve decisions and choices that will not be in direct control by Products To Profits. So, no, we cannot guarantee you, or your product, will be successful. Even with our in depth knowledge and proven processes, sometimes businesses will fail. But hey, there is risk in everything human beings do. Starting a business, or working on a consumer product, is no different. It is a goal that will require commitment on your part, too.

How We Work
 
Clients and investors call us “the secret weapon of building product businesses.”
Simply put, after working for decades on hundreds and hundreds of products, we’ve come to understand the process from a very unique perspective.
In fact, our client Dan Hawkins, described what we do this way.
 


“Their direction for retail placement has included support with sourcing, packaging, supply chain, pricing and the thousand other details that are part of bringing a product to market. Amy Wenslow, and her staff, are very knowledgeable about this incredibly complex process. Products To Profits has been a huge help to our market introduction! We highly recommend their services to anyone bringing new products to market.”

Go faster and improve your results with expert input and support.
One client specifically hired us because we see inside so many businesses. His company was already doing $15 million a year in sales. However, they had lost $400,000 on a new product launch. He wisely said, “We are inside our own bubble. We’ll never be able to see as many things that work, and don’t work, as you do. That’s why we hired you. We have to restructure how we are launching products and we can’t see it.”
Another client hired us to fix a whole bunch of agonizing problems. They were about to lose an account that did over a $1 million a year in sales. With only 7 weeks to turn things around, we had to act fast. Working with our client we were able to fix the problems, soothe the buyer, improve our client’s operations and……. The account grew to over $2 MIILLION in sales in less than a year.

Testimonials
 




I refer my clients to Products to Profits because they understand the big picture, are very clever marketers, and are good at finding ways to make the payoff happen. Amy is a genius at marketing and at building systems so that her genius can be leveraged through her team and her clients. She also provides lots of free help so that people can get the basics down without having to pay anybody anything. She is a great supporter of the entrepreneur and understands their world from the inside. Most entrepreneurs lack the experience and perspective that Products to Profits brings to the team. I know that people who try and get that perspective themselves always learn through expensive bad experiences. It makes sense to skip those parts and jump straight into strategies customized for your business that will work.
Jason Webb

In my experience with Products to Profit I have been amazed by the direction I have been pointed in. Amy has opened my eyes to seeing all sides of my project from marketing, product testing and a very focused view of results I can achieve. My time with the program has been brief but I have a more focused direction thanks to all the sessions with Amy on Skype. She opened up herself to my idea and opened the door to success for myself.
I have accomplished more in one month than I had in 18 months on my own.

Amy Wenslow and Product to Profits provides one of the most engaging, streamlined and targeted product coaching programs I have received in the area of product development, business coaching and product strategy planning.
She engaged our whole team with her interactive style, from our VP of Sales and Production Manager, down to our designers. We all had newly inspired actions to take on after our Product Success Session.

Before finding Products To Profits I was selling other people’s cleaning products on my website. I just didn’t know how to even start making my own products. After working with Products To Profits we’ve launched our new cleaning product line, and since 2008 Sam’s Club has been selling our products online.
