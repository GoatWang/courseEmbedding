	B.S., Sheffield University
DAVID G. LILLEY is a Professor in the School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Oklahoma State University, responsible for teaching and research in the general area of aerothermochemistry, with the development of experimental and computational fluid dynamics being of prime concern, with application to combustion aerodynamic processes.
	He was born in England and obtained his education at Sheffield University, from which he received the Bachelor and Master degrees in Mathematics in 1966 and 1967, and the Ph.D. degree in Engineering in 1970. The "higher doctorate" D.Sc. degree was awarded in 1991 by Sheffield University for many years of successful research, publication of high quality original research work, international recognition, and standing as an authority in the field Combustion Aerodynamics. The "Energy Systems Award was given in 1992 by AIAA for distinguished contribution as a teacher, researcher and consultant in the areas of swirl flows in combustors and furnaces, mathematical modeling, fuels and fires. In 1993 he was elected to the grade of Fellow of the AIAA - an honor bestowed upon people of distinction who have made notable and valuable contributions to the arts, sciences, or technology of aeronautics or astronautics. In 2000 he was elected to the grade of Fellow of the ASME and awarded the "George Westinghouse Gold Medal" for notable contributions to the Power Field of Mechanical Engineering, specifically for distinguished contributions as a teacher, researcher and consultant in power engineering, including the publication of quality scholarly papers and studies on safety, energy efficiency and environmentally compliant power systems. In 2001 he received an AIAA Sustained Service Award for years of valuable service to AIAA. He received the extremely prestigious "Holley Medal" in 2008 from the ASME for engineering accomplishments to the betterment of society, specifically for exemplary contributions to the development of the science and engineering of fire research, advancing the knowledge of fires, their growth, fire accident prediction and practical aspects of fire investigation, that has resulted in greater public safety and reliability from a wide range of fuels use and application.
	His academic career includes two years lecturing in Mathematics and Computing at Sheffield Hallam University, three years as Senior Research Associate in Mechanical Engineering at Cranfield University, one year as Visiting Associate Professor in Chemical Engineering at the University of Arizona, and two years as Associate Professor in Mechanical Engineering at Concordia University, Montreal, prior to taking up his current appointment.
	During this time, his research contributions concentrated on the experimentation, modeling and prediction of swirling jets and flames with application to practical furnaces and combustors resulting in three co-authored textbooks (Heat Transfer Calculations Using Finite Difference Equations 1977, Swirl Flows 1984, Flowfield Modeling and Diagnostics 1985) and about 200 reviewed research papers. In addition, he teaches and consults widely in the area of Engineering Aspects of Fire Investigation, including having assembled a text on "Fire Dynamics 2004" which is used on his two-day short course.
	He is a registered Professional Engineer in Oklahoma, a member of several technical societies, Associate Editor of the ASME Journal of Fluids Engineering (1988-1991), Chairman of the AIAA Propellants and Combustion Technical Committee (1986-1988), Chairman of the IAAI Engineering Committee (1994+), and is one of the two founding co-editors of three textbook series: Abacus Press/Gordon and Breach Energy and Engineering Science (1980-89), Springer-Verlag Environmental and Energetics (1989-92), and CRC Energy Engineering and Environment (1992+).

	Current and Recent Projects
Fire Dynamics - Dynamics of fire behavior, structural and industrial fires, ignition, fire development and full-developed fires. Fuels, burning rates, flashover and backdraft phenomena, experimental studies, fire modeling and fire investigation.
Computational Fluid Dynamics - Development and application of CFD computer codes to 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D fluid dynamic problems. Boundary layer and recirculating flow simulations. Rapid progress in the quality of microcomputers (in terms of speed, memory and software) has led to the implementation of the simulations on stand-alone PCs with effective graphic displays of the results.
Combustion Aerodynamics - Simulation of fires, flames and combustion, with application of computational fluid dynamics to 2-D and 3-D simulations of chemically-reacting flows. Aerothermochemistry of laminar and turbulent flows, diffusion and premixed flames, pollutant formation and reduction, and equilibrium combustion calculations.
Swirling Flows - Swirling flows occur in a great variety of practical situations, with and without combustion. Investigations include application to boilers, furnaces, gas turbines, cyclonic mixing/separating devices, and internal combustion engines.
Swirling Flows in Typical Gas Turbine Combustor Geometries - Experimental studies include flow visualization, five-hole pitot probe time-mean velocity measurements, and single-wire and cross-wire hot-wire anemometry. Theoretical studies include axisymmetric turbulent swirling flowfield simulation, modeling and prediction.
Lateral Jet Injection into Typical Combustor Flowfields - One and two laterally-injected jets entering the main swirling cross-flow are investigated both experimentally and theoretically. Three-dimensional computer codes have been developed with appropriate turbulence models.
Heat Conduction - Analytical and numerical simulation and solution of multi-dimensional heat conduction problems with irregular domains and complex boundary conditions, including convective and radiative effects.
Numerical Methods – Development and application of computer methods in analysis and design, and the simulation and solution of engineering problems that may or may not have analytical exact mathematical solutions.  Emphasis currently is on the methods and applications, using Excel as the interface for data input and output, tables and figures, and Visual Basic for Applications VBA as the programming language for computations.

Overview
 
We live in catastrophic times. The world is reeling from the deepest economic crisis since the Great Depression, with the threat of further meltdowns ever-looming. Global warming and myriad dire ecological disasters worsen—with little if any action to halt them—their effects rippling across the planet in the shape of almost biblical floods, fires, droughts, and hurricanes. Governments warn that there is no alternative to the bitter medicine they prescribe—or risk devastating financial or social collapse. The right, whether religious or secular, views the present as catastrophic and wants to turn the clock back. The left fears for the worst, but hopes some good will emerge from the rubble. Visions of the apocalypse and predictions of impending doom abound. Across the political spectrum, a culture of fear reigns. 
Catastrophism explores the politics of apocalypse—on the left and right, in the environmental movement—and examines why the lens of catastrophe can distort our understanding of the dynamics at the heart of these numerous disasters—and fatally impede our ability to transform the world. Lilley, McNally, Yuen, and Davis probe the reasons why catastrophic thinking is so prevalent, and challenge the belief that it is only out of the ashes that a better society may be born. The authors argue that those who care about social justice and the environment should jettison doomsaying—even as it relates to indisputably apocalyptic climate change. Far from calling people to arms, they suggest, catastrophic fear often results in passivity and paralysis—and, at worst, reactionary politics. 
Praise:  
“Catastrophism comes at the right moment: 2012, the year of The End proclaimed across the political spectrum from deep ecologists to the Mayan Calendarists. Instead of concentrating on the merits of the claims of the various apocalypticians, Jim Davis, Sasha Lilley, David McNally, and Eddie Yuen examine the political function of these claims and find them to be deeply reactionary. This is a controversial book that challenges many of the unexamined assumptions on the left (as well as on the right). It is a warning not to abandon everyday anti-capitalist politics for a politics of absolute fear that inevitably leads to inaction.” 
—Silvia Federici, author of Revolution at Point Zero: Housework, Reproduction, and Feminist Struggle
"Bravo! This is the book that has been sorely needed for so long to reveal the dead-end that a politics founded on catastrophic predictions must lead to in terms of either preventing them or actually changing the world.  Essential reading for all those on the left who are concerned with the question of strategy today."
--Leo Panitch, coauthor of The Making of Global Capitalism
“I cannot overstate how critically important this volume is. Catastrophism captures a problem that few have seriously grappled with. Anyone who wishes, as I do, for a new kind of (occupied) politics will have to face this formidable array of theoretically-inspired reflections on the politics of apocalypse.”
—Andrej Grubacic, co-author of Wobblies and Zapatistas: Conversations on Anarchism, Marxism and Radical History
"In an age when even Mayan prophecies of the end of the long cycle are turned into prophecies of doom and destruction, this book offers a reasoned and lucid alternative understanding. Definitive and momentous, this book should be mandatory reading for everyone who wishes to comprehend the world we live in and change it for the better." —George Katsiaficas, author of Asia’s Unknown Uprisings
“This important book aims to end the politics of The End. The authors of Catastrophism claim that apocalyptic politics, though promising to motivate revolutionary transformation, all too often leads to a fear-induced paralysis and cynicism. This book provides a badly needed boost to our political immunity systems against the apocalyptic claims bombarding us in this purported terminal year for our planet.” 
—George Caffentzis author of In Letters of Blood and Fire
“This groundbreaking book examines a deep current—on both the left and right—of apocalyptical thought and action. The authors explore the origins, uses, and consequences of the idea that collapse might usher in a better world. Catastrophism is a crucial guide to understanding our tumultuous times, while steering us away from the pitfalls of the past.” 
—Barbara Epstein, author of Political Protest and Cultural Revolution: Nonviolent Direct Action in the 1970s and 1980s
