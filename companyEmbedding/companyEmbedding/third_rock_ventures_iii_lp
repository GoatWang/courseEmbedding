Third Rock Ventures Raises $516 Million Fund III






March 25, 2013 07:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



BOSTON & SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Third Rock Ventures, LLC, a venture capital firm focused on building 
      healthcare companies, today announced the final closing of Fund III, 
      raising $516 million in an oversubscribed fund. With Fund III, Third 
      Rock will continue to execute on its strategy of launching, building and 
      supporting transformative healthcare companies. Since its inception, 
      Third Rock has raised more than $1.3 billion, including Fund III, for 
      investments in healthcare companies, with a particular emphasis on 
      innovative product engines.
    


      “We are grateful for the strong support for our model and significant 
      interest from our existing and new investors,” said Kevin Starr, partner 
      at Third Rock Ventures. “Since 2007, it has been our mission to be the 
      preferred partner for entrepreneurs, investors, employees and industry 
      to build great companies that discover and develop breakthrough products 
      that make a difference for patients. Our funding to date has enabled us 
      to successfully seed, support or launch more than 31 important 
      healthcare companies. With Fund III we will continue on our mission, 
      launching up to 16 new companies focused on disruptive areas of science 
      and medicine.”
    

Collaborative Approach to Company Building


      Many of Third Rock’s portfolio companies have developed as part of 
      collaborations with industry partners. This collaborative company 
      building approach enables Third Rock to address the unprecedented demand 
      in the healthcare industry for innovative products.
    

      “Our approach has always been to seek out and explore unique 
      collaborative models that are aligned with our mission and vision,” said 
      Mark Levin, partner at Third Rock Ventures. “I am personally excited 
      about the continued interest from our industry partners in working with 
      Third Rock to identify new areas of exciting science and launch 
      companies together through high-value strategic partnerships.”
    

The Third Rock Team


      Since launching the firm, Third Rock has grown its team to more than 40 
      people ranging from recognized industry leaders to recent graduates from 
      many of the top science and medical institutions, bringing a wide range 
      of skills in science, business, strategy and medicine. In conjunction 
      with Fund III, Third Rock anticipates expanding the team and is 
      promoting Mark A. Goldsmith, M.D., Ph.D., to partner in the firm.
    

      “People are the single biggest asset at Third Rock,” said Robert Tepper, 
      M.D., partner at Third Rock Ventures. “Third Rock's unique company 
      building approach relies on the collective experience of our growing 
      family of collaborators, advisors and company operators. This depth and 
      breadth across commercial, business development, R&D, drug discovery and 
      product development allows us to partner with portfolio companies across 
      multiple functions to translate scientific innovation into the reality 
      of clinically meaningful medical products.”

Our Investment Strategy Third Rock Ventures






















Philosophy
We build great companies in order to make a dramatic difference for patients








Our Investment Strategy
Discover. Launch. Build.
Our Mission & Core Values



Our Investment Strategy
We discover, launch and build great companies based on bold ideas that meet at the intersection of science, strategy, business and medicine - where transformational science meets operational reality - providing the best opportunity to make a dramatic difference in patients' lives. 







The Third Rock Team
   Our team has a proven record of translating disruptive technologies into valuable business enterprises. We adhere to a “Third Rock Forever” philosophy, realizing that we have been phenomenally successful because of the contributions of the whole Third Rock team. People are our greatest asset, and we invest significant effort and resources to ensure we hire the best people at Third Rock and across the portfolio. Working closely with leading scientific and business visionaries, as well as industry partners, our team is focused on identifying opportunities to change the future of medicine and rigorously vets those ideas through our discovery process to develop the vision, strategy and plan needed to succeed. Learn About Our People | Download Third Rock Team Fact Sheet











A Formula for Innovation
We only invest in the best of those ideas. We are actively involved in the early stages of our companies' development, typically serving as members of the founding management teams, to build a strong foundation, put in place the right people and culture, and set the companies on a path to scientific and operational excellence. View Our Portfolio | Download Third Rock Company Fact Sheet
Then, we build on that foundation, transitioning out of our interim leadership roles as we put in place rock star management teams. We bring to bear the vast experience, expertise and network of our team and across our portfolio to help our companies succeed. Management teams can tap into our network of experts across disciplines, including science, medicine, business, healthcare economics and regulatory strategy. Our partner development team leverages our relationships with decision-makers in pharma to support business development efforts across our portfolio. Our strategy team serves as an advisory resource around critical business development, financial and operational decisions. Our Beyond Great leadership program provides our portfolio leaders with a peer-to-peer network, as well as tools and resources focused on shared elements of building transformational companies. We build great companies together, with our portfolio leaders, scientific founders, advisors and industry partners.









"We try never to forget that medicine is for the people. It is not for the profits. The profits follow, and if we have remembered that, they have never failed to appear. The better we have remembered it, the larger they have been."

PRESS RELEASE
Third Rock Ventures, LLC, a venture capital firm focused on building healthcare companies, today announced the final closing of Fund III, raising $516 million in an oversubscribed fund. With Fund III, Third Rock will continue to execute on its strategy of launching, building and supporting transformative healthcare companies. Since its inception, Third Rock has raised more than $1.3 billion, including Fund III, for investments in healthcare companies, with a particular emphasis on innovative product engines.
    “People are the single biggest asset at Third Rock”
“We are grateful for the strong support for our model and significant interest from our existing and new investors,” said Kevin Starr, partner at Third Rock Ventures. “Since 2007, it has been our mission to be the preferred partner for entrepreneurs, investors, employees and industry to build great companies that discover and develop breakthrough products that make a difference for patients. Our funding to date has enabled us to successfully seed, support or launch more than 31 important healthcare companies. With Fund III we will continue on our mission, launching up to 16 new companies focused on disruptive areas of science and medicine.”
Collaborative Approach to Company Building
Many of Third Rock’s portfolio companies have developed as part of collaborations with industry partners. This collaborative company building approach enables Third Rock to address the unprecedented demand in the healthcare industry for innovative products. 





“Our approach has always been to seek out and explore unique collaborative models that are aligned with our mission and vision,” said Mark Levin, partner at Third Rock Ventures. “I am personally excited about the continued interest from our industry partners in working with Third Rock to identify new areas of exciting science and launch companies together through high-value strategic partnerships.”
The Third Rock Team
Since launching the firm, Third Rock has grown its team to more than 40 people ranging from recognized industry leaders to recent graduates from many of the top science and medical institutions, bringing a wide range of skills in science, business, strategy and medicine. In conjunction with Fund III, Third Rock anticipates expanding the team and is promoting Mark A. Goldsmith, M.D., Ph.D., to partner in the firm.
“People are the single biggest asset at Third Rock,” said Robert Tepper, M.D., partner at Third Rock Ventures. “Third Rock’s unique company building approach relies on the collective experience of our growing family of collaborators, advisors and company operators. This depth and breadth across commercial, business development, R&D, drug discovery and product development allows us to partner with portfolio companies across multiple functions to translate scientific innovation into the reality of clinically meaningful medical products.”
