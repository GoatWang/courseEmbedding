Energy technologies[edit]
Rentech was initially formed in 1981 by Charles Benham and Mark Bohn to develop and commercialize synthetic fuel technologies.[2][3] In 1991, it incensed its Rentech Process to the Fuel Resources Development Company (Fuelco) to produce diesel fuel from landfill gas at the Synhytech facility in Pueblo, Colorado.[4] Rentech obtained ownership of the facility in 1993. This project failed and was closed at the same year due to lower than expected gas volumes.[5] In 2000, Rentech acquired a methanol plant at Commerce City, Colorado, which was converted to a gas-to-liquids plant.[6][7]
In mid 2000s Rentech planned building coal-to-liquids plants in Wyoming, Illinois, Kentucky, and Mississippi.[3] In 2009, it unveiled plan for construction of a synthetic fuels plant in Rialto, California, and together with ASIG it agreed with 13 airlines to provide synthetic diesel for ground services at Los Angeles International Airport.[8][9] In 2010 it made a memorandum of understanding with 14 airlines pto provide alternative jet fuel and diesel fuel from its planned biofuels production complex project in Natchez, Mississippi.[9] In 2011, Rentech agreed with the Government of Ontario to build a plant in White River, Ontario. to convert 1.3 million tons of provincial forests into jet fuel and naphtha.[10][11] At the same year it purchased the 55 MW biomass integrated gasification combined cycle power plant project in Port St. Joe, Florida.[12] This project was halted 2012.[13] In 2013, Rentech changed its focus from biofuels to wood pellets production.[14] It closed its product demonstration unit in Commerce City which was developing technology for conversion of cellulosic biomass into synthetic gas.[15][16] It also cancelled its biofuels production complex project in Natchez.[14][16]
Wood processing[edit]
In May 2013, Rentech acquired Georgia-based Fulghum Fibres, Inc.[14][17][18] As part of the acquisition of Fulghum Fibres, Rentech entered into a joint venture with Estonia-based pellet manufacturer Graanul Invest to develop pellet plants in Canada and the United States.[18][19] In 2013, it also acquired wood processing facilities in Atikokan and Wawa, Ontario, which it is converting into of pellet factories.[14][18] These facilities are contracted to supply Ontario Power Generation and Drax Power with pellets for power generation.[18][19] In May 2014, Rentech acquired New England Wood Pellets, considered to be the largest producer of wood pellets for the U.S. heating market. Established in 1992, New England Wood Pellet operates three wood pellet facilities, located in the U.S. Northeast, which is the largest domestic market for consumption of wood pellets for heating.[20]
Nitrogen fertilizers[edit]
Rentech entered into the nitrogen fertilizer business in 2006 when it acquired from Agrium an ammonia nitrogen fertilizer facility located in East Dubuque, Illinois.[2] In 2011, Rentech consolidated its nitrogen fertilizer business into subsidiary company Rentech Nitrogen Partners. At the same year Rentech Nitrogen was listed at the New York Stock Exchange.[21] In 2012, Rentech acquired Agrifos LLC, which owns a synthetic granulated ammonium sulfate fertilizer plant in Pasadena, Texas.[22]
Legal Troubles[edit]
As of Feb. 21, 2017, Rentech posted on their website that the board has decided to idle the Wawa facility due to equipment and operational issues that would require additional unbudgeted capital investment, also stated is the uncertainty of profitability of wood pellets for heating. Rentech stated in the announcement that idling the plant will allow Rentech to conserve liquidity as it formally explores strategic alternatives. [23] Subsequently, as a result of this announcement, Rentech stock (RTK) dropped 44%, initiating legal action of investors. Currently Rentech is being investigated by Levi & Korsinsky, LLP, Holzer and Holzer, LLC, Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC, Goldbert Law PC, Rosen Law Firm, and Pomerantz Law Firm [24]

In mid 2000s Rentech planned building coal-to-liquids plants in Wyoming, Illinois, Kentucky, and Mississippi.[3] In 2009, it unveiled plan for construction of a synthetic fuels plant in Rialto, California, and together with ASIG it agreed with 13 airlines to provide synthetic diesel for ground services at Los Angeles International Airport.[8][9] In 2010 it made a memorandum of understanding with 14 airlines pto provide alternative jet fuel and diesel fuel from its planned biofuels production complex project in Natchez, Mississippi.[9] In 2011, Rentech agreed with the Government of Ontario to build a plant in White River, Ontario. to convert 1.3 million tons of provincial forests into jet fuel and naphtha.[10][11] At the same year it purchased the 55 MW biomass integrated gasification combined cycle power plant project in Port St. Joe, Florida.[12] This project was halted 2012.[13] In 2013, Rentech changed its focus from biofuels to wood pellets production.[14] It closed its product demonstration unit in Commerce City which was developing technology for conversion of cellulosic biomass into synthetic gas.[15][16] It also cancelled its biofuels production complex project in Natchez.[14][16]
Wood processing[edit]
In May 2013, Rentech acquired Georgia-based Fulghum Fibres, Inc.[14][17][18] As part of the acquisition of Fulghum Fibres, Rentech entered into a joint venture with Estonia-based pellet manufacturer Graanul Invest to develop pellet plants in Canada and the United States.[18][19] In 2013, it also acquired wood processing facilities in Atikokan and Wawa, Ontario, which it is converting into of pellet factories.[14][18] These facilities are contracted to supply Ontario Power Generation and Drax Power with pellets for power generation.[18][19] In May 2014, Rentech acquired New England Wood Pellets, considered to be the largest producer of wood pellets for the U.S. heating market. Established in 1992, New England Wood Pellet operates three wood pellet facilities, located in the U.S. Northeast, which is the largest domestic market for consumption of wood pellets for heating.[20]
Nitrogen fertilizers[edit]
Rentech entered into the nitrogen fertilizer business in 2006 when it acquired from Agrium an ammonia nitrogen fertilizer facility located in East Dubuque, Illinois.[2] In 2011, Rentech consolidated its nitrogen fertilizer business into subsidiary company Rentech Nitrogen Partners. At the same year Rentech Nitrogen was listed at the New York Stock Exchange.[21] In 2012, Rentech acquired Agrifos LLC, which owns a synthetic granulated ammonium sulfate fertilizer plant in Pasadena, Texas.[22]
Legal Troubles[edit]
As of Feb. 21, 2017, Rentech posted on their website that the board has decided to idle the Wawa facility due to equipment and operational issues that would require additional unbudgeted capital investment, also stated is the uncertainty of profitability of wood pellets for heating. Rentech stated in the announcement that idling the plant will allow Rentech to conserve liquidity as it formally explores strategic alternatives. [23] Subsequently, as a result of this announcement, Rentech stock (RTK) dropped 44%, initiating legal action of investors. Currently Rentech is being investigated by Levi & Korsinsky, LLP, Holzer and Holzer, LLC, Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC, Goldbert Law PC, Rosen Law Firm, and Pomerantz Law Firm [24]

Rentech to close product demonstration unit 
By Rentech Inc.      | March 01, 2013

Rentech Inc. has announced plans to cease operations at, reduce staffing at, and mothball its research and development Product Demonstration Unit, in Commerce City, Colo., and to eliminate all related R&D activities. The company's strategy is focused on more immediate growth opportunities within the energy industry that do not rely on new technologies.
“We are grateful to our employees for their dedication and tremendous effort to successfully develop innovative and workable technologies for alternative energy production,” said D. Hunt Ramsbottom, president and CEO, of Rentech. “While our elimination of these positions is a difficult decision, today’s actions will further position Rentech to drive value for shareholders by cutting R&D spending and focusing on businesses that generate strong returns, with ready markets, and certainty of revenue. The investments we are considering have either immediate or near-term profitability, and will meet our disciplined investment criteria. Our success in growing Rentech Nitrogen and generating attractive returns from that business is the best example to date of the disciplined investment approach that we will follow as we consider additional investments.”
Expected Cost Savings
As a result of these changes, Rentech will eliminate 65 employee and contractor positions in the company’s alternative energy segment during the first half of 2013. In addition, Rentech will attempt to sell the PDU as well as approximately 450 acres of land in Natchez, Miss., it acquired for the development of an alternative energy facility. Rentech expects to incur a one-time non-cash impairment charge to intangible assets related to its technology of approximately $16 million, in its financial statements for the period ended December 31, 2012.
Due to the PDU closing, Rentech expects expenses related to its research activities and facilities and its technologies to decline from approximately $21 million in 2012 to approximately $10 million in 2013, which is consistent with the company’s previous guidance. The 2013 expenses will be for final R&D activities, including completion of the U.S. DOE Integrated Biorefinery (IBR) project grant requirements, winding down and de-commissioning the PDU, employee severance, site maintenance, insurance, preservation of patents and a small group of remaining employees.
Approximately $5 million of these 2013 expenses are anticipated to be classified as selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, beginning in the second quarter as the company cuts its R&D activities. The company has no plans to incur R&D expenses in 2014. SG&A expenses related to the Commerce City site, technology maintenance and personnel are expected to be at an annualized run rate of $2-3 million by the end of 2013. Any ongoing costs would be to protect patents covering Rentech’s alternative energy technologies, to maintain the Commerce City site if efforts to sell the site are unsuccessful or to continue low-cost efforts to seek partners who would provide funding to deploy its technologies.
Technology Accomplishments
Over the course of operating the PDU, Rentech has obtained sufficient data on its alternative energy technologies, which can be used for commercial application, and the company has created a portfolio of intellectual property rights to protect its technological advancements. The company’s technologies include the Rentech-ClearFuels and Rentech-SilvaGas biomass gasification technologies, as well as the Rentech Fischer-Tropsch process, all of which have been successfully demonstrated to produce synthetic and renewable fuels and renewable power. The company has operated its Fischer-Tropsch technology successfully for more than 13,000 hours, and produced certified, synthetic jet and diesel fuel. This month, Rentech concluded the IBR project at its PDU and obtained the necessary data that would support the scale-up and the deployment of the Rentech-ClearFuels and Rentech Fischer-Tropsch technologies. The company operated its Rentech-ClearFuels gasification technology at the PDU for over 2,200 hours, and it operated the integrated biomass-to-fuels IBR project for more than 1,000 hours. The Rentech-SilvaGas biomass gasification technology was previously demonstrated at commercial scale.
Focus on Profitable Growth Opportunities
The company’s focus on nearer-term profitable growth opportunities is a direct result of the high cost to develop new technologies relative to current energy prices and lack of government incentives and regulations supporting alternative energy, particularly within the United States, which have made it difficult for the company and other alternative energy companies to commercialize their technologies. While Rentech believes that its technologies have commercial value in the future as well as in different geographies, it believes that company resources are better directed at opportunities that will produce more immediate returns, as it does not expect the market opportunity for alternative energy to improve materially in the United States within the next several years.
As previously disclosed, Rentech intends to focus on new businesses that meet the following criteria: unlevered, after-tax returns in the mid-teens or higher; certainty of revenue with long-term contracts for off-take, providing stability of cash flows; reliance upon demonstrated technologies; and leverage Rentech’s expertise. Rentech expects to make an announcement setting forth its next steps within the coming months.
Today’s actions are the most recent in a series of steps Rentech has taken to rationalize its capital structure, reduce operating expenses and deliver value, including a special distribution of approximately $42 million to shareholders in December 2012 of which approximately 75% was a return of capital, the redemption of $57.5 million of convertible senior notes in 2012, and the successful formation and expansion of Rentech Nitrogen.

Product Demonstration Unit
We designed, built and have operated a fully-integrated biomass and natural gas-to-synthetic fuels demonstration facility in Commerce City, Colorado.  Over the course of operating this Product Demonstration Unit, or PDU, we have obtained sufficient data on our alternative energy technologies that can be used for commercial application.
The primary technologies integrated at the PDU are the Rentech-ClearFuels biomass gasifier, a natural gas steam methane reformer, the Rentech Fischer-Tropsch Process, and hydro-cracking and hydro-treating technologies.
At the PDU, the Rentech-ClearFuels gasifier has run for over 2,200 hours, the Rentech Fischer-Tropsch Process has operated for over 13,000 hours, and the integrated, end-to-end, biomass-to-fuels process has operated for more than 1,000 hours.
The PDU is located on approximately 17 acres in an industrial area in Colorado adjacent to a rail line and an interstate highway. Approximately six acres of the site are occupied by the PDU, and the remaining approximately 11 acres of the site are available for other uses. There is an approximately 12,000 square foot building on that site that is primarily used for laboratory and maintenance functions supporting the PDU. We also lease a 2 1/2 acre industrial site located adjacent to the site, which includes a single building of approximately 3,000 square feet and is used for the storage and maintenance of construction equipment. Rentech is currently seeking parties interested in purchasing the PDU and/or the site.

Other Products
Rentech Nitrogen produces and sells products other than nitrogen fertilizer at its facility:
DEF
We sell liquid urea, including DEF, primarily to industrial customers in the power, ethanol and diesel emissions markets through a marketing agreement with Yara. DEF is a urea-based chemical reactant that is intended to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions in the exhaust systems of certain diesel engines of trucks and off-road farm and construction equipment.
Nitric Acid
We produce nitric acid through two separate nitric acid plants at the facility. Nitric acid is either sold to third parties or used within the facility for the production of ammonium nitrate solution, as an intermediate from which UAN is produced.

CO2
CO2 is a gaseous product that is co-manufactured with ammonia, with approximately 1.1 tons of CO2 produced per ton of ammonia produced. Our East Dubuque Facility utilizes CO2 in its urea production and has developed a market for CO2 through conversion to a purified food grade liquid CO2. We have multiple CO2 sales agreements that allow for regular shipment of CO2 throughout the year to the food and beverage industry.

Energy technologies[edit]
Rentech was initially formed in 1981 by Charles Benham and Mark Bohn to develop and commercialize synthetic fuel technologies.[2][3] In 1991, it incensed its Rentech Process to the Fuel Resources Development Company (Fuelco) to produce diesel fuel from landfill gas at the Synhytech facility in Pueblo, Colorado.[4] Rentech obtained ownership of the facility in 1993. This project failed and was closed at the same year due to lower than expected gas volumes.[5] In 2000, Rentech acquired a methanol plant at Commerce City, Colorado, which was converted to a gas-to-liquids plant.[6][7]
In mid 2000s Rentech planned building coal-to-liquids plants in Wyoming, Illinois, Kentucky, and Mississippi.[3] In 2009, it unveiled plan for construction of a synthetic fuels plant in Rialto, California, and together with ASIG it agreed with 13 airlines to provide synthetic diesel for ground services at Los Angeles International Airport.[8][9] In 2010 it made a memorandum of understanding with 14 airlines pto provide alternative jet fuel and diesel fuel from its planned biofuels production complex project in Natchez, Mississippi.[9] In 2011, Rentech agreed with the Government of Ontario to build a plant in White River, Ontario. to convert 1.3 million tons of provincial forests into jet fuel and naphtha.[10][11] At the same year it purchased the 55 MW biomass integrated gasification combined cycle power plant project in Port St. Joe, Florida.[12] This project was halted 2012.[13] In 2013, Rentech changed its focus from biofuels to wood pellets production.[14] It closed its product demonstration unit in Commerce City which was developing technology for conversion of cellulosic biomass into synthetic gas.[15][16] It also cancelled its biofuels production complex project in Natchez.[14][16]
Wood processing[edit]
In May 2013, Rentech acquired Georgia-based Fulghum Fibres, Inc.[14][17][18] As part of the acquisition of Fulghum Fibres, Rentech entered into a joint venture with Estonia-based pellet manufacturer Graanul Invest to develop pellet plants in Canada and the United States.[18][19] In 2013, it also acquired wood processing facilities in Atikokan and Wawa, Ontario, which it is converting into of pellet factories.[14][18] These facilities are contracted to supply Ontario Power Generation and Drax Power with pellets for power generation.[18][19] In May 2014, Rentech acquired New England Wood Pellets, considered to be the largest producer of wood pellets for the U.S. heating market. Established in 1992, New England Wood Pellet operates three wood pellet facilities, located in the U.S. Northeast, which is the largest domestic market for consumption of wood pellets for heating.[20]
Nitrogen fertilizers[edit]
Rentech entered into the nitrogen fertilizer business in 2006 when it acquired from Agrium an ammonia nitrogen fertilizer facility located in East Dubuque, Illinois.[2] In 2011, Rentech consolidated its nitrogen fertilizer business into subsidiary company Rentech Nitrogen Partners. At the same year Rentech Nitrogen was listed at the New York Stock Exchange.[21] In 2012, Rentech acquired Agrifos LLC, which owns a synthetic granulated ammonium sulfate fertilizer plant in Pasadena, Texas.[22]
Legal Troubles[edit]
As of Feb. 21, 2017, Rentech posted on their website that the board has decided to idle the Wawa facility due to equipment and operational issues that would require additional unbudgeted capital investment, also stated is the uncertainty of profitability of wood pellets for heating. Rentech stated in the announcement that idling the plant will allow Rentech to conserve liquidity as it formally explores strategic alternatives. [23] Subsequently, as a result of this announcement, Rentech stock (RTK) dropped 44%, initiating legal action of investors. Currently Rentech is being investigated by Levi & Korsinsky, LLP, Holzer and Holzer, LLC, Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC, Goldbert Law PC, Rosen Law Firm, and Pomerantz Law Firm [24]

In mid 2000s Rentech planned building coal-to-liquids plants in Wyoming, Illinois, Kentucky, and Mississippi.[3] In 2009, it unveiled plan for construction of a synthetic fuels plant in Rialto, California, and together with ASIG it agreed with 13 airlines to provide synthetic diesel for ground services at Los Angeles International Airport.[8][9] In 2010 it made a memorandum of understanding with 14 airlines pto provide alternative jet fuel and diesel fuel from its planned biofuels production complex project in Natchez, Mississippi.[9] In 2011, Rentech agreed with the Government of Ontario to build a plant in White River, Ontario. to convert 1.3 million tons of provincial forests into jet fuel and naphtha.[10][11] At the same year it purchased the 55 MW biomass integrated gasification combined cycle power plant project in Port St. Joe, Florida.[12] This project was halted 2012.[13] In 2013, Rentech changed its focus from biofuels to wood pellets production.[14] It closed its product demonstration unit in Commerce City which was developing technology for conversion of cellulosic biomass into synthetic gas.[15][16] It also cancelled its biofuels production complex project in Natchez.[14][16]
Wood processing[edit]
In May 2013, Rentech acquired Georgia-based Fulghum Fibres, Inc.[14][17][18] As part of the acquisition of Fulghum Fibres, Rentech entered into a joint venture with Estonia-based pellet manufacturer Graanul Invest to develop pellet plants in Canada and the United States.[18][19] In 2013, it also acquired wood processing facilities in Atikokan and Wawa, Ontario, which it is converting into of pellet factories.[14][18] These facilities are contracted to supply Ontario Power Generation and Drax Power with pellets for power generation.[18][19] In May 2014, Rentech acquired New England Wood Pellets, considered to be the largest producer of wood pellets for the U.S. heating market. Established in 1992, New England Wood Pellet operates three wood pellet facilities, located in the U.S. Northeast, which is the largest domestic market for consumption of wood pellets for heating.[20]
Nitrogen fertilizers[edit]
Rentech entered into the nitrogen fertilizer business in 2006 when it acquired from Agrium an ammonia nitrogen fertilizer facility located in East Dubuque, Illinois.[2] In 2011, Rentech consolidated its nitrogen fertilizer business into subsidiary company Rentech Nitrogen Partners. At the same year Rentech Nitrogen was listed at the New York Stock Exchange.[21] In 2012, Rentech acquired Agrifos LLC, which owns a synthetic granulated ammonium sulfate fertilizer plant in Pasadena, Texas.[22]
Legal Troubles[edit]
As of Feb. 21, 2017, Rentech posted on their website that the board has decided to idle the Wawa facility due to equipment and operational issues that would require additional unbudgeted capital investment, also stated is the uncertainty of profitability of wood pellets for heating. Rentech stated in the announcement that idling the plant will allow Rentech to conserve liquidity as it formally explores strategic alternatives. [23] Subsequently, as a result of this announcement, Rentech stock (RTK) dropped 44%, initiating legal action of investors. Currently Rentech is being investigated by Levi & Korsinsky, LLP, Holzer and Holzer, LLC, Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC, Goldbert Law PC, Rosen Law Firm, and Pomerantz Law Firm [24]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Energy technologies[edit]
Rentech was initially formed in 1981 by Charles Benham and Mark Bohn to develop and commercialize synthetic fuel technologies.[2][3] In 1991, it incensed its Rentech Process to the Fuel Resources Development Company (Fuelco) to produce diesel fuel from landfill gas at the Synhytech facility in Pueblo, Colorado.[4] Rentech obtained ownership of the facility in 1993. This project failed and was closed at the same year due to lower than expected gas volumes.[5] In 2000, Rentech acquired a methanol plant at Commerce City, Colorado, which was converted to a gas-to-liquids plant.[6][7]
In mid 2000s Rentech planned building coal-to-liquids plants in Wyoming, Illinois, Kentucky, and Mississippi.[3] In 2009, it unveiled plan for construction of a synthetic fuels plant in Rialto, California, and together with ASIG it agreed with 13 airlines to provide synthetic diesel for ground services at Los Angeles International Airport.[8][9] In 2010 it made a memorandum of understanding with 14 airlines pto provide alternative jet fuel and diesel fuel from its planned biofuels production complex project in Natchez, Mississippi.[9] In 2011, Rentech agreed with the Government of Ontario to build a plant in White River, Ontario. to convert 1.3 million tons of provincial forests into jet fuel and naphtha.[10][11] At the same year it purchased the 55 MW biomass integrated gasification combined cycle power plant project in Port St. Joe, Florida.[12] This project was halted 2012.[13] In 2013, Rentech changed its focus from biofuels to wood pellets production.[14] It closed its product demonstration unit in Commerce City which was developing technology for conversion of cellulosic biomass into synthetic gas.[15][16] It also cancelled its biofuels production complex project in Natchez.[14][16]
Wood processing[edit]
In May 2013, Rentech acquired Georgia-based Fulghum Fibres, Inc.[14][17][18] As part of the acquisition of Fulghum Fibres, Rentech entered into a joint venture with Estonia-based pellet manufacturer Graanul Invest to develop pellet plants in Canada and the United States.[18][19] In 2013, it also acquired wood processing facilities in Atikokan and Wawa, Ontario, which it is converting into of pellet factories.[14][18] These facilities are contracted to supply Ontario Power Generation and Drax Power with pellets for power generation.[18][19] In May 2014, Rentech acquired New England Wood Pellets, considered to be the largest producer of wood pellets for the U.S. heating market. Established in 1992, New England Wood Pellet operates three wood pellet facilities, located in the U.S. Northeast, which is the largest domestic market for consumption of wood pellets for heating.[20]
Nitrogen fertilizers[edit]
Rentech entered into the nitrogen fertilizer business in 2006 when it acquired from Agrium an ammonia nitrogen fertilizer facility located in East Dubuque, Illinois.[2] In 2011, Rentech consolidated its nitrogen fertilizer business into subsidiary company Rentech Nitrogen Partners. At the same year Rentech Nitrogen was listed at the New York Stock Exchange.[21] In 2012, Rentech acquired Agrifos LLC, which owns a synthetic granulated ammonium sulfate fertilizer plant in Pasadena, Texas.[22]
Legal Troubles[edit]
As of Feb. 21, 2017, Rentech posted on their website that the board has decided to idle the Wawa facility due to equipment and operational issues that would require additional unbudgeted capital investment, also stated is the uncertainty of profitability of wood pellets for heating. Rentech stated in the announcement that idling the plant will allow Rentech to conserve liquidity as it formally explores strategic alternatives. [23] Subsequently, as a result of this announcement, Rentech stock (RTK) dropped 44%, initiating legal action of investors. Currently Rentech is being investigated by Levi & Korsinsky, LLP, Holzer and Holzer, LLC, Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC, Goldbert Law PC, Rosen Law Firm, and Pomerantz Law Firm [24]

We process approximately 15 million tonnes of wood and bark annually into high quality wood chips and residual fuels.
Rentech’s New England Wood Pellet subsidiary is the largest producer of bagged pellets for the growing U.S. heating market. Known for its high quality products, New England Wood Pellet commands an approximate 15% share of the market for heating pellets in the U.S. Northeast. The company is one of the largest suppliers of wood pellets to major retailers including Home Depot, Lowe’s, and Tractor Supply.
Rentech is developing pellet facilities in Eastern Canada to supply pellets to utilities in Canada and Europe under long-term contracts. In conjunction with these projects, Rentech secured a long-term arrangement for exclusive priority access at the Port of Quebec for handling, loading and storage of over 1 million tons of pellets annually.
Together, these businesses provide a complementary and strategic platform for diversified growth and leadership in the expanding global wood fibre industry.
Fertilizer Production
Rentech manufactures nitrogen fertilizer products through its publicly-traded subsidiary, Rentech Nitrogen Partners. Rentech Nitrogen operates two strategically located fertilizer facilities in the U.S. The company’s fertilizer production facility in East Dubuque, IL primarily produces ammonia and UAN for farmers in the U.S. Corn Belt. Its facility in Pasadena, TX is the largest producer of synthetic ammonium sulfate in North America.

On March 5, 2014, we announced a definitive agreement with Sunshine Kaidi New Energy Group Co., Ltd. to sell our alternative energy technologies and decommissioned Product Demonstration Unit. The sale is expected to close in mid-2014. The transaction is subject to customary regulatory review.

Rentech to Close Product Demonstration Unit

Business Wirevia The Motley Fool, AOL.com
Feb 28th 2013 7:16AM




Rentech to Close Product Demonstration UnitLOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Rentech, Inc. (NYSE MKT: RTK) announced today plans to cease operations at, reduce staffing at, and mothball its research and development (R&D) Product Demonstration Unit (PDU), in Commerce City, CO, and to eliminate all related R&D activities. The Company's strategy is focused on more immediate growth opportunities within the energy industry that do not rely on new technologies."We are grateful to our employees for their dedication and tremendous effort to successfully develop innovative and workable technologies for alternative energy production," said D. Hunt Ramsbottom, President and CEO, of Rentech. "While our elimination of these positions is a difficult decision, today's actions will further position Rentech to drive value for shareholders by cutting R&D spending and focusing on businesses that generate strong returns, with ready markets, and certainty of revenue. The investments we are considering have either immediate or near-term profitability, and will meet our disciplined investment criteria. Our success in growing Rentech Nitrogen and generating attractive returns from that business is the best example to date of the disciplined investment approach that we will follow as we consider additional investments."Expected Cost SavingsAs a result of these changes, Rentech will eliminate 65 employee and contractor positions in the Company's alternative energy segment during the first half of 2013. In addition, Rentech will attempt to sell the PDU as well as approximately 450 acres of land in Natchez, MS it acquired for the development of an alternative energy facility. Rentech expects to incur a one-time non-cash impairment charge to intangible assets related to its technology of approximately $16 million, in its financial statements for the period ended December 31, 2012.Due to the PDU closing, Rentech expects expenses related to its research activities and facilities and its technologies to decline from approximately $21 million in 2012 to approximately $10 million in 2013, which is consistent with the Company's previous guidance. The 2013 expenses will be for final R&D activities, including completion of the U.S. Department of Energy Integrated Biorefinery (IBR) project grant requirements, winding down and de-commissioning the PDU, employee severance, site maintenance, insurance, preservation of patents and a small group of remaining employees.Approximately $5 million of these 2013 expenses are anticipated to be classified as selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, beginning in the second quarter as the Company cuts its R&D activities. The Company has no plans to incur R&D expenses in 2014. SG&A expenses related to the Commerce City site, technology maintenance and personnel are expected to be at an annualized run rate of $2-3 million by the end of 2013. Any ongoing costs would be to protect patents covering Rentech's alternative energy technologies, to maintain the Commerce City site if efforts to sell the site are unsuccessful or to continue low-cost efforts to seek partners who would provide funding to deploy its technologies.Technology AccomplishmentsOver the course of operating the PDU, Rentech has obtained sufficient data on its alternative energy technologies, which can be used for commercial application, and the Company has created a portfolio of intellectual property rights to protect its technological advancements. The Company's technologies include the Rentech-ClearFuels and Rentech-SilvaGas biomass gasification technologies, as well as the Rentech Fischer-Tropsch process, all of which have been successfully demonstrated to produce synthetic and renewable fuels and renewable power. The Company has operated its Fischer-Tropsch technology successfully for more than 13,000 hours, and produced certified, synthetic jet and diesel fuel. This month, Rentech concluded the IBR project at its PDU and obtained the necessary data that would support the scale-up and the deployment of the Rentech-ClearFuels and Rentech Fischer-Tropsch technologies. The Company operated its Rentech-ClearFuels gasification technology at the PDU for over 2,200 hours, and it operated the integrated biomass-to-fuels IBR project for more than 1,000 hours. The Rentech-SilvaGas biomass gasification technology was previously demonstrated at commercial scale.Focus on Profitable Growth OpportunitiesThe Company's focus on nearer-term profitable growth opportunities is a direct result of the high cost to develop new technologies relative to current energy prices and lack of government incentives and regulations supporting alternative energy, particularly within the United States, which have made it difficult for the Company and other alternative energy companies to commercialize their technologies. While Rentech believes that its technologies have commercial value in the future as well as in different geographies, it believes that Company resources are better directed at opportunities that will produce more immediate returns, as it does not expect the market opportunity for alternative energy to improve materially in the United States within the next several years.As previously disclosed, Rentech intends to focus on new businesses that meet the following criteria: unlevered, after-tax returns in the mid-teens or higher; certainty of revenue with long-term contracts for off-take, providing stability of cash flows; reliance upon demonstrated technologies; and leverage Rentech's expertise. Rentech expects to make an announcement setting forth its next steps within the coming months.Today's actions are the most recent in a series of steps Rentech has taken to rationalize its capital structure, reduce operating expenses and deliver value, including a special distribution of approximately $42 million to shareholders in December 2012 of which approximately 75% was a return of capital, the redemption of $57.5 million of convertible senior notes in 2012, and the successful formation and expansion of Rentech Nitrogen.About Rentech, Inc.Rentech, Inc. (www.rentechinc.com) owns the general partner and approximately 60% of the common units representing limited partner interests in Rentech Nitrogen Partners, L.P. (www.rentechnitrogen.com), a limited partnership traded publicly under the symbol RNF. Rentech Nitrogen Partners, L.P. manufactures and sells nitrogen fertilizer products. Rentech also owns the intellectual property including patents, pilot and demonstration data, and engineering designs for a number of clean energy technologies designed to produce certified synthetic fuels and renewable power when integrated with third-party technologies.Safe Harbor StatementThis press release contains forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 about matters such as the Company's confidence in the its financial future; whether and the extent to which the Company will realize profitability on its alternative energy business assets; anticipated spending levels; the ability of the Company to grow its business; and the return profile of potential businesses the Company may enter into. These statements are based on management's current expectations and actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties. Other factors that could cause actual results to differ from those reflected in the forward-looking statements are set forth in the Company's prior press releases and periodic public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available via Rentech's website at www.rentechinc.com. The forward-looking statements in this press release are made as of the date of this press release and Rentech does not undertake to revise or update these forward-looking statements, except to the extent that it is required to do so under applicable law.Rentech, Inc.Julie Dawoodjee CafarellaVice President of Investor Relations and Communications310-571-9800ir@rentk.comKEYWORDS:   United States  North America  California  ColoradoINDUSTRY KEYWORDS:
