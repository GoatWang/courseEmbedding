Station Casinos is a gaming company based in the Las Vegas suburb of Summerlin, Nevada, founded by Frank Fertitta, Jr.[4][5] Station Casinos, along with Affinity Gaming, Boyd Gaming, Cannery Casino Resorts, and American Casino & Entertainment Properties, dominate the locals casino market in Las Vegas. The company purchased several sites that were gaming-entitled, meaning that major casinos can be built at that location without additional approvals. There are only a limited number of such sites available in the Las Vegas area. Station has also branched out into managing casinos that they do not own. Red Rock Resorts, Inc. (NASDAQ: RRR) is a publicly traded holding company that owns a portion of Station Casinos.

History[edit]
The company started out as a locals casino operator on July 1, 1976, opening the Bingo Palace. This establishment was later renamed Palace Station. The company went public with an IPO in 1993.
On December 4, 2006, Frank Fertitta III, Lorenzo Fertitta, and Colony Capital LLC, operating as Fertitta Colony Partners, made a highly leveraged offer to purchase all existing shares at $82 per share and take the company private.[6] The Fertitta brothers, their sister Delise Sartini, and Blake L. Sartini, her husband, with a combined investment of $870.1 million, purchased a 25% stake in Fertitta Colony Partners. Colony Capital contributed $2.6 billion for a 75% share.[7] As of November 7, 2007, the company's stock (old symbol STN) was no longer listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
In March 2008, both Frank and Lorenzo Fertitta were listed as billionaires in Forbes' annual list of the world's billionaires, but the purchase loaded the company with billions in debt. As of May 2011, Frank was ranked 1057th on the list of world's billionaires, and Lorenzo was ranked at 1140th. Both were tied for these rankings with several others.
On July 28, 2009, Station Casinos filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy. Station Casinos' filing listed $5.7 billion in assets against $6.5 billion in debt. The filing said the company had 510 holders of unsecured and subordinate debt totaling $4.4 billion.[8]
On August 21, 2009, Frank Fertitta Jr., the founder of Station Casinos and father of the Fertitta brothers, died from complications of a heart condition.
Station Casinos exited bankruptcy in June 2011 with $4 billion less in debt and with creditors putting the company's 18 casinos back in the hands of the Fertitta family and their partners. The Fertitta brothers agreed to put nearly $200 million in the reassembled company and now own 45 percent of its shares. The other new equity owners include the company's main lenders, Deutsche Bank AG, which holds 25 percent; JPMorgan Chase with a 15 percent stake; and former bondholders with an additional 15 percent, according to lawyers on the deal.[9]
Station announced in October 2015 that it would return to the stock market with an initial public offering.[10] On April 26, 2016, Red Rock Resorts, Inc., a new holding company owning a portion of Station Casinos, went public on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange.[11]
In May 2016, Station agreed to purchase the Palms Casino Resort for $313 million.[12][13]

Station Casinos is a gaming company based in the Las Vegas suburb of Summerlin, Nevada, founded by Frank Fertitta, Jr.[4][5] Station Casinos, along with Affinity Gaming, Boyd Gaming, Cannery Casino Resorts, and American Casino & Entertainment Properties, dominate the locals casino market in Las Vegas. The company purchased several sites that were gaming-entitled, meaning that major casinos can be built at that location without additional approvals. There are only a limited number of such sites available in the Las Vegas area. Station has also branched out into managing casinos that they do not own. Red Rock Resorts, Inc. (NASDAQ: RRR) is a publicly traded holding company that owns a portion of Station Casinos.

History[edit]
The company started out as a locals casino operator on July 1, 1976, opening the Bingo Palace. This establishment was later renamed Palace Station. The company went public with an IPO in 1993.
On December 4, 2006, Frank Fertitta III, Lorenzo Fertitta, and Colony Capital LLC, operating as Fertitta Colony Partners, made a highly leveraged offer to purchase all existing shares at $82 per share and take the company private.[6] The Fertitta brothers, their sister Delise Sartini, and Blake L. Sartini, her husband, with a combined investment of $870.1 million, purchased a 25% stake in Fertitta Colony Partners. Colony Capital contributed $2.6 billion for a 75% share.[7] As of November 7, 2007, the company's stock (old symbol STN) was no longer listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
In March 2008, both Frank and Lorenzo Fertitta were listed as billionaires in Forbes' annual list of the world's billionaires, but the purchase loaded the company with billions in debt. As of May 2011, Frank was ranked 1057th on the list of world's billionaires, and Lorenzo was ranked at 1140th. Both were tied for these rankings with several others.
On July 28, 2009, Station Casinos filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy. Station Casinos' filing listed $5.7 billion in assets against $6.5 billion in debt. The filing said the company had 510 holders of unsecured and subordinate debt totaling $4.4 billion.[8]
On August 21, 2009, Frank Fertitta Jr., the founder of Station Casinos and father of the Fertitta brothers, died from complications of a heart condition.
Station Casinos exited bankruptcy in June 2011 with $4 billion less in debt and with creditors putting the company's 18 casinos back in the hands of the Fertitta family and their partners. The Fertitta brothers agreed to put nearly $200 million in the reassembled company and now own 45 percent of its shares. The other new equity owners include the company's main lenders, Deutsche Bank AG, which holds 25 percent; JPMorgan Chase with a 15 percent stake; and former bondholders with an additional 15 percent, according to lawyers on the deal.[9]
Station announced in October 2015 that it would return to the stock market with an initial public offering.[10] On April 26, 2016, Red Rock Resorts, Inc., a new holding company owning a portion of Station Casinos, went public on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange.[11]
In May 2016, Station agreed to purchase the Palms Casino Resort for $313 million.[12][13]

History[edit]
The company started out as a locals casino operator on July 1, 1976, opening the Bingo Palace. This establishment was later renamed Palace Station. The company went public with an IPO in 1993.
On December 4, 2006, Frank Fertitta III, Lorenzo Fertitta, and Colony Capital LLC, operating as Fertitta Colony Partners, made a highly leveraged offer to purchase all existing shares at $82 per share and take the company private.[6] The Fertitta brothers, their sister Delise Sartini, and Blake L. Sartini, her husband, with a combined investment of $870.1 million, purchased a 25% stake in Fertitta Colony Partners. Colony Capital contributed $2.6 billion for a 75% share.[7] As of November 7, 2007, the company's stock (old symbol STN) was no longer listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
In March 2008, both Frank and Lorenzo Fertitta were listed as billionaires in Forbes' annual list of the world's billionaires, but the purchase loaded the company with billions in debt. As of May 2011, Frank was ranked 1057th on the list of world's billionaires, and Lorenzo was ranked at 1140th. Both were tied for these rankings with several others.
On July 28, 2009, Station Casinos filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy. Station Casinos' filing listed $5.7 billion in assets against $6.5 billion in debt. The filing said the company had 510 holders of unsecured and subordinate debt totaling $4.4 billion.[8]
On August 21, 2009, Frank Fertitta Jr., the founder of Station Casinos and father of the Fertitta brothers, died from complications of a heart condition.
Station Casinos exited bankruptcy in June 2011 with $4 billion less in debt and with creditors putting the company's 18 casinos back in the hands of the Fertitta family and their partners. The Fertitta brothers agreed to put nearly $200 million in the reassembled company and now own 45 percent of its shares. The other new equity owners include the company's main lenders, Deutsche Bank AG, which holds 25 percent; JPMorgan Chase with a 15 percent stake; and former bondholders with an additional 15 percent, according to lawyers on the deal.[9]
Station announced in October 2015 that it would return to the stock market with an initial public offering.[10] On April 26, 2016, Red Rock Resorts, Inc., a new holding company owning a portion of Station Casinos, went public on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange.[11]
In May 2016, Station agreed to purchase the Palms Casino Resort for $313 million.[12][13]

Flamingo Road – At Clark County 215 and Town Center Drive in Summerlin South.
Durango Station – On South Durango Drive at Clark County 215 in Spring Valley near the Rhodes Ranch planned community. Announced plans for a bowling alley and movie theater at this location. The design is shown to be similar to that of the Red Rock Resort.[14]
Siena – Across from the Siena age-restricted community on Town Center Drive in Summerlin.
Wild Wild West – At the intersection of Dean Martin Drive and West Tropicana Avenue in Paradise. Due to the special proximity of this site to the Las Vegas Strip, Station intends to build a tourist-oriented megaresort on this site.

Station Casinos is a gaming company based in the Las Vegas suburb of Summerlin, Nevada, founded by Frank Fertitta, Jr.[4][5] Station Casinos, along with Affinity Gaming, Boyd Gaming, Cannery Casino Resorts, and American Casino & Entertainment Properties, dominate the locals casino market in Las Vegas. The company purchased several sites that were gaming-entitled, meaning that major casinos can be built at that location without additional approvals. There are only a limited number of such sites available in the Las Vegas area. Station has also branched out into managing casinos that they do not own. Red Rock Resorts, Inc. (NASDAQ: RRR) is a publicly traded holding company that owns a portion of Station Casinos.

History[edit]
The company started out as a locals casino operator on July 1, 1976, opening the Bingo Palace. This establishment was later renamed Palace Station. The company went public with an IPO in 1993.
On December 4, 2006, Frank Fertitta III, Lorenzo Fertitta, and Colony Capital LLC, operating as Fertitta Colony Partners, made a highly leveraged offer to purchase all existing shares at $82 per share and take the company private.[6] The Fertitta brothers, their sister Delise Sartini, and Blake L. Sartini, her husband, with a combined investment of $870.1 million, purchased a 25% stake in Fertitta Colony Partners. Colony Capital contributed $2.6 billion for a 75% share.[7] As of November 7, 2007, the company's stock (old symbol STN) was no longer listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
In March 2008, both Frank and Lorenzo Fertitta were listed as billionaires in Forbes' annual list of the world's billionaires, but the purchase loaded the company with billions in debt. As of May 2011, Frank was ranked 1057th on the list of world's billionaires, and Lorenzo was ranked at 1140th. Both were tied for these rankings with several others.
On July 28, 2009, Station Casinos filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy. Station Casinos' filing listed $5.7 billion in assets against $6.5 billion in debt. The filing said the company had 510 holders of unsecured and subordinate debt totaling $4.4 billion.[8]
On August 21, 2009, Frank Fertitta Jr., the founder of Station Casinos and father of the Fertitta brothers, died from complications of a heart condition.
Station Casinos exited bankruptcy in June 2011 with $4 billion less in debt and with creditors putting the company's 18 casinos back in the hands of the Fertitta family and their partners. The Fertitta brothers agreed to put nearly $200 million in the reassembled company and now own 45 percent of its shares. The other new equity owners include the company's main lenders, Deutsche Bank AG, which holds 25 percent; JPMorgan Chase with a 15 percent stake; and former bondholders with an additional 15 percent, according to lawyers on the deal.[9]
Station announced in October 2015 that it would return to the stock market with an initial public offering.[10] On April 26, 2016, Red Rock Resorts, Inc., a new holding company owning a portion of Station Casinos, went public on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange.[11]
In May 2016, Station agreed to purchase the Palms Casino Resort for $313 million.[12][13]

Station Casinos is a gaming company based in the Las Vegas suburb of Summerlin, Nevada, founded by Frank Fertitta, Jr.[4][5] Station Casinos, along with Affinity Gaming, Boyd Gaming, Cannery Casino Resorts, and American Casino & Entertainment Properties, dominate the locals casino market in Las Vegas. The company purchased several sites that were gaming-entitled, meaning that major casinos can be built at that location without additional approvals. There are only a limited number of such sites available in the Las Vegas area. Station has also branched out into managing casinos that they do not own. Red Rock Resorts, Inc. (NASDAQ: RRR) is a publicly traded holding company that owns a portion of Station Casinos.

History[edit]
The company started out as a locals casino operator on July 1, 1976, opening the Bingo Palace. This establishment was later renamed Palace Station. The company went public with an IPO in 1993.
On December 4, 2006, Frank Fertitta III, Lorenzo Fertitta, and Colony Capital LLC, operating as Fertitta Colony Partners, made a highly leveraged offer to purchase all existing shares at $82 per share and take the company private.[6] The Fertitta brothers, their sister Delise Sartini, and Blake L. Sartini, her husband, with a combined investment of $870.1 million, purchased a 25% stake in Fertitta Colony Partners. Colony Capital contributed $2.6 billion for a 75% share.[7] As of November 7, 2007, the company's stock (old symbol STN) was no longer listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
In March 2008, both Frank and Lorenzo Fertitta were listed as billionaires in Forbes' annual list of the world's billionaires, but the purchase loaded the company with billions in debt. As of May 2011, Frank was ranked 1057th on the list of world's billionaires, and Lorenzo was ranked at 1140th. Both were tied for these rankings with several others.
On July 28, 2009, Station Casinos filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy. Station Casinos' filing listed $5.7 billion in assets against $6.5 billion in debt. The filing said the company had 510 holders of unsecured and subordinate debt totaling $4.4 billion.[8]
On August 21, 2009, Frank Fertitta Jr., the founder of Station Casinos and father of the Fertitta brothers, died from complications of a heart condition.
Station Casinos exited bankruptcy in June 2011 with $4 billion less in debt and with creditors putting the company's 18 casinos back in the hands of the Fertitta family and their partners. The Fertitta brothers agreed to put nearly $200 million in the reassembled company and now own 45 percent of its shares. The other new equity owners include the company's main lenders, Deutsche Bank AG, which holds 25 percent; JPMorgan Chase with a 15 percent stake; and former bondholders with an additional 15 percent, according to lawyers on the deal.[9]
Station announced in October 2015 that it would return to the stock market with an initial public offering.[10] On April 26, 2016, Red Rock Resorts, Inc., a new holding company owning a portion of Station Casinos, went public on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange.[11]
In May 2016, Station agreed to purchase the Palms Casino Resort for $313 million.[12][13]

Station Casinos is a gaming company based in the Las Vegas suburb of Summerlin, Nevada, founded by Frank Fertitta, Jr.[4][5] Station Casinos, along with Affinity Gaming, Boyd Gaming, Cannery Casino Resorts, and American Casino & Entertainment Properties, dominate the locals casino market in Las Vegas. The company purchased several sites that were gaming-entitled, meaning that major casinos can be built at that location without additional approvals. There are only a limited number of such sites available in the Las Vegas area. Station has also branched out into managing casinos that they do not own. Red Rock Resorts, Inc. (NASDAQ: RRR) is a publicly traded holding company that owns a portion of Station Casinos.

History[edit]
The company started out as a locals casino operator on July 1, 1976, opening the Bingo Palace. This establishment was later renamed Palace Station. The company went public with an IPO in 1993.
On December 4, 2006, Frank Fertitta III, Lorenzo Fertitta, and Colony Capital LLC, operating as Fertitta Colony Partners, made a highly leveraged offer to purchase all existing shares at $82 per share and take the company private.[6] The Fertitta brothers, their sister Delise Sartini, and Blake L. Sartini, her husband, with a combined investment of $870.1 million, purchased a 25% stake in Fertitta Colony Partners. Colony Capital contributed $2.6 billion for a 75% share.[7] As of November 7, 2007, the company's stock (old symbol STN) was no longer listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
In March 2008, both Frank and Lorenzo Fertitta were listed as billionaires in Forbes' annual list of the world's billionaires, but the purchase loaded the company with billions in debt. As of May 2011, Frank was ranked 1057th on the list of world's billionaires, and Lorenzo was ranked at 1140th. Both were tied for these rankings with several others.
On July 28, 2009, Station Casinos filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy. Station Casinos' filing listed $5.7 billion in assets against $6.5 billion in debt. The filing said the company had 510 holders of unsecured and subordinate debt totaling $4.4 billion.[8]
On August 21, 2009, Frank Fertitta Jr., the founder of Station Casinos and father of the Fertitta brothers, died from complications of a heart condition.
Station Casinos exited bankruptcy in June 2011 with $4 billion less in debt and with creditors putting the company's 18 casinos back in the hands of the Fertitta family and their partners. The Fertitta brothers agreed to put nearly $200 million in the reassembled company and now own 45 percent of its shares. The other new equity owners include the company's main lenders, Deutsche Bank AG, which holds 25 percent; JPMorgan Chase with a 15 percent stake; and former bondholders with an additional 15 percent, according to lawyers on the deal.[9]
Station announced in October 2015 that it would return to the stock market with an initial public offering.[10] On April 26, 2016, Red Rock Resorts, Inc., a new holding company owning a portion of Station Casinos, went public on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange.[11]
In May 2016, Station agreed to purchase the Palms Casino Resort for $313 million.[12][13]

Development sites[edit]
All the Nevada sites below are gaming-entitled, unless otherwise noted. Gaming-entitled means that a casino can be built on that location without special approvals.

Las Vegas area

Flamingo Road – At Clark County 215 and Town Center Drive in Summerlin South.
Durango Station – On South Durango Drive at Clark County 215 in Spring Valley near the Rhodes Ranch planned community. Announced plans for a bowling alley and movie theater at this location. The design is shown to be similar to that of the Red Rock Resort.[14]
Siena – Across from the Siena age-restricted community on Town Center Drive in Summerlin.
Wild Wild West – At the intersection of Dean Martin Drive and West Tropicana Avenue in Paradise. Due to the special proximity of this site to the Las Vegas Strip, Station intends to build a tourist-oriented megaresort on this site.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

We estimate that the net proceeds to us from the sale of our Class A Common
Stock in this Offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions
but before expenses, will be approximately $495.9 million ($570.8 million if the
underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares). We
intend to use such net proceeds as follows:

        • $424.4 million to acquire newly-issued LLC Units in Station Holdco. In
          turn, Station Holdco intends to:

        • Contribute $417.5 million of the proceeds it receives from us to pay a
          portion of the purchase price for the Fertitta Entertainment
          Acquisition. The balance of the purchase price for the Fertitta
          Entertainment Acquisition will be funded by debt incurred by
          Station LLC. The purchase price for the Fertitta Entertainment
          Acquisition, including the offering proceeds that are contributed to
          Station LLC to fund a portion of the purchase price for the Fertitta
          Entertainment Acquisition, will be paid by Station LLC to entities
          that are affiliated with Frank J. Fertitta III and Lorenzo J.
          Fertitta, which are the owners of a majority of the outstanding
          membership interests of Fertitta Entertainment, and an entity that is
          owned by certain current and former employees of Fertitta
          Entertainment, which holds the remaining membership interests in
          Fertitta Entertainment. 

        • Apply the balance of the proceeds it receives from us to pay expenses
          incurred in connection with this Offering.

        • $67.4 million (or $142.4 million if the underwriters exercise their
          option to purchase additional shares in full), to purchase LLC Units
          from certain of our existing owners, at a per-LLC Unit price equal to
          the price paid by the underwriters for shares of our Class A Common
          Stock in this Offering. Accordingly, we will not retain any of these
          proceeds.

        • $4.1 million to pay withholding tax obligations with respect to
          certain members of the Merging Blockers.

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of Class A Common Stock
by the selling stockholders.

The purchase price for the Fertitta Entertainment Acquisition will be paid to 
Fertitta Business Management LLC, a Nevada limited liability company, LNA
Investments, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company, KVF Investments, LLC, a
Nevada limited liability company, and FE Employeeco LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company, which are all owned or were formed for the benefit of
Frank J. Fertitta III and Lorenzo J. Fertitta or their children or are owned by
the executive officers of the Company and other current and former employees of
Fertitta Entertainment. See "Certain Relationships and Related Party
Transactions—Acquisition of Fertitta Entertainment." The terms of the Fertitta
Entertainment Acquisition were negotiated by the members of Fertitta
Entertainment, on the one hand, and on the other hand by both GACC (as the
holder of certain approval rights under the existing equityholders agreement for
Station Holdco and its subsidiaries) and by a special committee of the board of
managers of Station LLC (comprised of Dr. James E. Nave and Mr. Robert E. Lewis,
each of whom was determined to be disinterested in the Fertitta Entertainment
Acquisition). The special committee unanimously approved the terms of the
Fertitta Entertainment Acquisition, and had the assistance and counsel of
independent legal and financial advisors retained by such special committee in
the negotiation and approval of such terms.


Our casino properties face competition from all other casinos and hotels in
the Las Vegas area, including to some degree, from each other. We compete with
other nonrestricted casino/hotels, as well as restricted gaming locations, by
focusing on repeat customers and attracting these customers through innovative
marketing programs. Our value-oriented, high-quality approach is designed to
generate repeat business. Additionally, our casino properties are strategically
located and designed to permit convenient access and ample parking, which are
critical factors in attracting local visitors and repeat patrons.

Currently, there are approximately 40 major gaming properties located on or near
the Las Vegas Strip, 17 located in the downtown area and several located in 
other areas of Las Vegas. We also face competition from 146 nonrestricted gaming
locations in the Clark County area primarily targeted to the local and repeat
visitor markets. In addition, our casino properties face competition from
restricted gaming locations (sites with 15 or fewer slot machines) in the
greater Las Vegas area. As of December 31, 2015, there were approximately 1,400
restricted gaming locations in the Las Vegas area with approximately 13,800 slot
machines. Major additions, expansions or enhancements of existing properties or
the construction of new properties by competitors could have a material adverse
effect on our business.

The Nevada legislature enacted SB 208 in 1997. This legislation identified
certain gaming enterprise districts wherein casino gaming development would be
permitted throughout the Las Vegas valley and established more restrictive 
criteria for the establishment of new gaming enterprise districts. We believe
the growth in gaming supply in the Las Vegas locals market has been, and will 
continue to be, limited by the provisions of SB 208.

To a lesser extent, we compete with gaming operations in other parts of the 
state of Nevada, such as Reno, Laughlin and Lake Tahoe, and other gaming markets
throughout the United States and in other parts of the world, and with state
sponsored lotteries, on-and-off-track wagering on horse and other races, card
rooms, online gaming and other forms of legalized gambling. The gaming industry
also includes land-based casinos, dockside casinos, riverboat casinos,
racetracks with slots and casinos located on Native American land. There is
intense competition among companies in the gaming industry, some of which have
significantly greater resources than we do. Several states are currently
considering legalizing casino gaming in designated areas. Legalized casino
gaming in such states and on Native American land could result in additional
competition and could adversely affect our operations, particularly to the
extent that such gaming is conducted in areas close to our operations. We also
face competition from internet poker operators in Nevada. In addition,
legislation approving internet gaming has been proposed by the federal
government and other states. Expansion of internet gaming and legalized casino
gaming in new or existing jurisdictions and on Native American land could result
in additional competition for our Nevada operations and for the gaming
facilities that we manage for Native American tribes.

Native American gaming in California, as it currently exists, has had little, if 
any, impact on our Nevada operations to date, although there are no assurances 
as to the future impact it may have. In total, the State of California has 
signed and ratified Tribal-State Compacts with 72 Native American tribes. 
Currently there are 60 Native American gaming facilities in operation in the 
State of California. These Native American tribes are allowed to operate slot 
machines, lottery games, and banked and percentage games (including "21") on 
Native American lands. A banked game is one in which players compete against the
licensed gaming establishment rather than against one another. A percentage game
is one in which the house does not directly participate in the game, but 
collects a percentage of the amount of bets made, winnings collected, or the
amount of money changing hands. It is not certain whether any expansion of
Native American gaming in California will affect our Nevada operations given
that visitors from California make up Nevada's largest visitor market. Increased
competition from Native American gaming in California may result in a decline in
our revenues and may have a material adverse effect on our business.


Company Description
We are a leading gaming, development and management company operating 21
strategically-located casino and entertainment properties. We have developed
over $5 billion of regional gaming and entertainment destinations in multiple
jurisdictions. In addition, we are an established leader in Native


 American
gaming, managing facilities in northern California and western Michigan. We
began operations in 1976 with a 5,000 square foot casino featuring 100 slot
machines and have grown through development and acquisitions to become a premier
provider of gaming and entertainment for residents of the Las Vegas regional
market and visitors. Our Las Vegas portfolio includes nine major gaming and
entertainment facilities and ten smaller casinos (three of which are 50% owned),
offering approximately 19,300 slot machines, 300 table games and 4,000 hotel
rooms. Our Las Vegas properties are broadly distributed throughout the market
and easily accessible, with over 90% of the Las Vegas population located within
five miles of one of our gaming facilities. We offer convenience and a wide
variety of gaming and non-gaming entertainment options to attract guests to our
properties. We also provide friendly service and exceptional value in a
comfortable environment. Most of our major properties are master-planned for
expansion, enabling us to incrementally expand our facilities as demand
dictates. We also control seven highly desirable gaming-entitled development
sites consisting of approximately 398 acres in Las Vegas and Reno, Nevada.

We believe that the Las Vegas regional market is one of the most attractive
gaming markets in the United States due to favorable economic and market
fundamentals, a number of which drive demand for our products. The following
metrics, for the most recent period available, indicate that an economic
recovery is underway in the Las Vegas regional market:

        • Population growth was approximately 2.7 times the national average
          in 2015;

        • Las Vegas year-over-year employment growth was 2.4%, based on
          December 2015 data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics ("BLS"),
          which marks the fifth consecutive year of positive growth;

        • Home value appreciation of 9.3%, compared to the national average of
          5.6% during the year ended December 31, 2015;

        • Las Vegas welcomed a record 42.3 million visitors for the year ended
          December 31, 2015; and

        • Approximately $13.9 billion in new investments are either in the
          planning stages or actively under development in Las Vegas, based on
          public announcements.

In addition to these favorable demand drivers, the Las Vegas regional market
provides a stable and highly attractive tax structure, as well as legal
limitations that restrict the development of additional off-Strip gaming
properties. In particular:

        • Nevada offers the lowest maximum statutory gaming tax rate in the
          United States at 6.75%, and has only raised gaming taxes once in the
          last 28 years;

        • Nevada State Senate Bill 208 ("SB 208"), enacted in 1997, 
          significantly limits the construction of casinos in the Las Vegas
          valley; and

        • No new major gaming facilities have opened in the Las Vegas regional
          market that cater predominantly to Las Vegas residents since 2009 and
          no new development of such facilities has been announced.

We are intensely focused on providing the best possible guest experience and
creating guest loyalty. Our "Boarding Pass" loyalty program, which allows
members to earn and redeem rewards at any of our properties, has achieved high
levels of guest use with a significant majority of our gaming revenue generated
by Boarding Pass members. In addition, nearly half of the adult population of
the Las Vegas metropolitan area are members of our Boarding Pass program and
have visited one or more of our properties during the year ended December 31,
2015. The Boarding Pass also has significant brand recognition and guest value,
as evidenced by being selected "Best Players Club" for each of the last 15 years
by the Las Vegas Review Journal.

We became a publicly traded company in 1993 and, following a significant period
of development and expansion between 1993 and 2007, were taken private in 2007 
in a management-led buyout. Impacted by the financial crisis between 2008 and 
2011, we completed a restructuring in June 2011. Since that time, we have:

        • Further strengthened our capital structure by:

        • Reducing total debt by $440 million to $2.0 billion as of December 31,
          2015 (excluding a $114.6 million non-recourse land loan) from 
          approximately $2.45 billion; and

        • Significantly reducing the ratio of total debt to Adjusted EBITDA.

        • Invested $380 million in capital improvements to maintain and enhance
          our properties, including:

        • Adding and renovating numerous non-gaming amenities across our
          portfolio;

        • Continuing to refresh our gaming floors with the latest products and 
          technology;

        • Creating innovative technology products such as mobile sports betting
          applications and interactive marketing kiosks; and

        • Investing in information technology to improve our systems and protect
          our and our guests' proprietary data.

        • Improved our profitability:

        • For the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended
          December 31, 2014, Adjusted EBITDA increased 13.1% and Adjusted EBITDA
          margin improved by 250 basis points to 33.4% while income from 
          continuing operations increased by 9.4%.

We believe that our high-quality assets, market-wide distribution and 
award-winning Boarding Pass loyalty program will allow us to achieve significant
benefits from improving economic conditions in Las Vegas. Further, our refined
cost structure will help maximize the flow-through of net revenue to Adjusted
EBITDA, as additional economic growth drives incremental revenue at our
properties. These factors position us well for future growth, including
expanding our existing properties, developing our strategic real estate
portfolio, pursuing new management contracts, and opportunistically acquiring
existing properties and pursuing new developments in other markets.
