United Development Funding III (“UDF III”) L.P.
(Please note that UDF III is closed to new subscriptions.)
OVERVIEW
Historically available to large institutional investors, UDF III offers the individual investor the opportunity to participate in an attractive alternative to traditional real estate investments. Our investment approach for UDF III is based on an established business model, extensive real estate finance experience and strategic, long-standing relationships in the housing industry. Our flexible financing structure enables us to respond quickly in an industry with significant capital needs and limited resources to meet those needs.

OFFERING HIGHLIGHTS

Our investment strategy is based on financing the acquisition and development of land for median-priced residential housing.
Our investment strategy is based on financing the acquisition and development of land for median-priced residential housing. Land acquisition is the critical first step in the launching of any neighborhood development. While most traditional real estate investments focus on the end product, UDF III takes advantage of the opportunity to offer solutions to homebuilders and developers long before the sale of the individual home lots.
Our intended portfolio of loans will predominately consist of short-term land acquisition and development loans, generally 24 to 36 months in length. Our interest income will be scheduled monthly with principal repaid upon sale of the single family lot and will not be contingent upon the construction and sale of individual homes. Through extensive market research and analysis, UDF III will target markets with strong local economies and sustainable growth. In many cases, the single family lot developments we plan to finance will have been pre-sold to national homebuilders. We believe this investment strategy will deliver risk-adjusted returns.
Investment Highlights:



Loans for the acquisition and development of single-family residential lots


Strategic alliances with national and large regional residential homebuilders and developers


Select geographic markets with moderate to strong growth trends




Investment Goals
UDF III is committed to offering innovative, forward-thinking solutions with the goal of:

Providing attractive income with immediate cash flow
Preserving, protecting and returning capital contributions
Delivering earnings stability through monthly distributions

 
Risk Factors
There can be no assurance the investment objectives described herein will be achieved. An investment is subject to substantial risks. These risks include absence of a public market for these securities, lack of an operating history, absence of loans identified for acquisition, limited transferability and lack of liquidity, possibility of substantial delay before distributions are made, reliance on the fund’s general partner, payment of significant fees to the general partner and its affiliates, potential conflicts of interest, and lack of diversification in mortgage loans until significant funds have been raised.

PROSPECTUS








Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry’s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum

	Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers


	.






	 






	On April 10, 2017,
	the general partner of United Development Funding III, L.P. (the “Partnership”) appointed Stuart Ducote, age 71, as
	its chief financial officer. In such capacity, Mr. Ducote will serve as the principal financial officer of the Partnership.


	 


	Mr. Ducote has served
	as the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of numerous public and privately held companies. Since July 2009, Mr.
	Ducote has served as president and chief financial officer of United Mortgage Trust, an affiliate of the Partnership’s general
	partner. Since July 2016, Mr. Ducote has also served as a managing director of BlackBriar Advisors, LLC, a financial services company.
	He was chief financial officer of E2 Energy Services, LLC, which is in the business of building, owning, and operating natural
	gas compressor stations and related equipment, from March 2012 until May 2016 and a partner at Tatum, LLC, which provides chief
	financial officers to companies in transition on a contract basis, from 2008 until March 2012. From 2006 until 2008, he was the
	co-owner of Ultra Realty, a privately held company involved with the acquisition, rehabilitation and development of residential
	properties and residential/commercial brokerage. From 2003 until 2006, he served as chief financial officer for Humitech International
	Group, Inc., an international franchise operation

	.

	From 2001 until 2003, he served as chief financial
	officer of People Solutions, Inc., where he structured the company in preparation for a capital raise and merger activity. From
	1997 until 2000, he was chief financial officer of Jobs.com, an Internet-based recruiting and on-line job marketing company, where
	he raised over $110 million in venture capital, built national brand recognition and positioned the company for an initial public
	offering. From 1994 until 1997, he served as a trustee, chief executive officer and chief financial officer for a private family
	trust and related operating companies, where he had oversight responsibilities for operating companies in the oil and gas, manufacturing,
	real estate acquisition and development, and power generation industries. From 1980 until 1994, he served as chief executive officer
	and chief financial officer of Provident Bancorp of Texas, Inc., where he directed the formation, acquisition, and operation of
	numerous financial institutions, and successfully merged banks into a multi-bank holding company. Prior to 1984, Mr. Ducote worked
	in public accounting for approximately twelve years. He is a graduate of the University of Texas.


	 


	Mr. Ducote replaces
	Cara D. Obert as the Partnership’s principal financial officer and principal accounting officer. Ms. Obert resigned as the
	principal financial officer and principal accounting officer of the Partnership effective as of April 10, 2017 in order to concentrate
	on her services as chief financial officer and treasurer of United Development Funding IV and United Development Funding Income
	Fund V. Ms. Obert also will continue to serve as chief financial officer of the Partnership’s general partner.


	 



	Effective
	as of April 10, 2017, the Partnership entered into an Independent Contractor Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Mr. Ducote
	in connection with Mr. Ducote’s appointment as chief financial officer of the Partnership. The Agreement provides for compensation
	to Mr. Ducote at a monthly rate of $7,500. The Agreement shall continue in effect until terminated by either party upon 60 days’
	written notice. While Mr. Ducote serves as chief financial officer of the Partnership and for one year following the termination
	of the Agreement, Mr. Ducote will be subject to non-hire provisions that prohibit him from soliciting for hire or hiring any employee
	of the Partnership or its affiliates. In addition, during the term of the Agreement and at all times thereafter, Mr. Ducote is
	subject to certain confidentiality and non-disparagement provisions.

	This description of the Agreement does not purport
	to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Agreement, which is attached as Exhibit 10.1
	hereto and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.


	 


	Mr. Ducote has
	not had any direct or indirect material interests in any transaction with the Partnership or to which the Partnership is a party
	or in any currently proposed transaction with the Partnership or to which the Partnership is a party.

	EXHIBIT 10.1




	 







	INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR AGREEMENT


	 


	This Independent Contractor
	Agreement (this “


	Agreement


	”) is entered into as of the 10th day of April, 2017 (the “


	Effective
	Date


	”), between United Development Funding III, L.P. (“


	Company


	”), and Stuart Ducote (“


	Contractor


	”).
	The Company desires to retain Contractor as an independent contractor to perform services for the Company and Contractor is willing
	to perform such services, on the terms set forth more fully below. In consideration of the mutual promises contained herein, the
	parties agree as follows:


	 


	1.       


	Contractor’s
	Services


	. Contractor agrees to provide Company with the services described on the attached

	Exhibit “A”

	and such other related services that may be requested by Company from time to time (collectively, the “


	Services


	”).
	Contractor and Company agree that the Services are to be directed by the Company’s General Partner. Contractor will make
	regular reports to the Company’s General Partner regarding the status of Contractor’s Services to Company. Company
	is under no obligation to use Contractor’s Services for any specific number of hours per week.


	 


	2.       


	Contractor’s
	Obligations


	. Contractor will devote the necessary time and attention to perform the Services and shall use Contractor’s
	best efforts and judgment in performing such Services. In performing the Services under this Agreement, Contractor will act in
	good faith and in the best interest of Company, perform Contractor’s duties in accordance with the standards set by Company,
	and comply with all applicable Company policies and procedures and applicable laws. Contractor will perform all Services directly
	and will not subcontract or employ others to perform any aspect of the Services.


	 


	3.       


	Independent Contractor Relationship


	.


	 


	(a)       Contractor
	and Company agree that Contractor is an independent contractor and is not an employee of Company for any purpose. Company will
	not provide any employment-related benefits to Contractor such as, but not limited to, workers compensation insurance, unemployment
	compensation insurance, vacation or sick pay, pension or profit sharing benefits, or any type of health or disability insurance.
	Company will not treat Contractor as its employee for federal, state, or local tax purposes. Contractor will have no power or authority
	to incur or create any liability for or in the name of Company without the prior written consent of Company. Contractor has no
	authority to direct, hire or fire any employees of Company.


	 


	(b)       The
	Company will provide Contractor with written evidence that the Company maintains directors’ and officers’ insurance
	covering Contractor in his capacity as an officer of the Company. Such insurance shall be in an amount that is equal to or greater
	than the amount of insurance in place as of the Effective Date of this agreement. Furthermore, the Company will maintain such insurance
	coverage with respect to occurrences arising during the term of this agreement for at least five years following the termination
	or expiration of this agreement or will purchase a directors’ and officers’ extended reporting period or “tail”
	policy to cover Contractor for such five year time period. Contractor will have loan approval rights for all future UDF III loans.


	 






	 





	 




	 




	4.       


	Term


	.
	The term of this Agreement shall begin on the Effective Date and continue until terminated by the parties in accordance with the
	provisions of this

	Section 4

	. Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time upon sixty (60) days prior written notice
	to the other party; provided, however, that upon receiving a notice of intent to terminate from the terminating party, the non-terminating
	party may terminate this Agreement immediately by giving notice to the terminating party of the non-terminating party’s exercise
	of its right to immediate termination of this Agreement and in such case, the sixty (60) day notice period will be deemed to be
	automatically waived by both parties.


	 


	5.       


	Work
	Product


	. Contractor agrees that Company is the exclusive owner of all right, title and interest in all works of whatever
	nature, finished or unfinished, developed or created by Contractor, or paid for by Company, in the course of Contractor performing
	the Services under this Independent Contractor Agreement, or related to the Services (the “Work Product”). Contractor
	agrees that all intellectual property rights of whatever nature in the Work Product, in any stage of development, that Contractor
	conceives, develops, or reduces to practice in connection with performing the Services shall be owned by the Company. “Intellectual
	Property” includes (without limitation) all designs, concepts, documents, formulae, ideas and inventions (whether or not
	patentable or reduced to practice), know-how, materials, plans, marks (including brand names, product names, logos and slogans),
	methods, network configurations, and architectures, procedures, processes, protocols, schematics, analyses, and reports. Contractor
	will deliver all Work Product to the Company (or any person designated by the Company in writing) in the form specified or as otherwise
	designated by the Company.


	 


	5.       


	Confidential
	Information


	. As used in this Agreement, the term “Confidential Information” shall mean all trade secrets or
	confidential or proprietary information of the Company, and proprietary information of third parties provided to the Company in
	confidence. By way of illustration and not limitation, “Confidential Information” shall include the Company’s
	data and reports; computer materials such as programs, instructions, source and object code, and printouts; graphic designs, and
	artwork; data compilations; development databases;, business improvements; business plans (whether pursued or not); ideas; designs;
	drawings; budgets; unpublished financial statements; licenses; pricing strategies or cost data; information regarding the skills
	and compensation of the employees of the Company; strategies’ forecasts, know-how and other marketing techniques; and the
	identities of the Company’s suppliers and customers, and all information about those supplier and customer relationships
	of the Company such as contact person(s), pricing, and other terms. Information received by Contractor will not be considered Confidential
	Information if Contractor can prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that (1) Contractor lawfully knew such information prior
	to the Company’s first disclosure to Contractor, (2) a third party rightfully disclosed such information to Contractor free
	from any confidentiality duties or obligations, or (3) such information is, or through no fault of Contractor has become, generally
	available to the public.


	 


	6.       


	Non-Use
	and Non-Disclosure of Confidential Information


	. During the term of this agreement and at all times thereafter, Contractor
	agrees that, except as required by judicial order or governmental laws or regulations, Contractor will not, during or subsequent
	to the term of this Agreement, (i) use or permit other to use the Company’s Confidential Information for any purpose whatsoever
	other than the performance of Contractor’s Services, or (ii) disclose or permit others to disclose the Company’s Confidential
	Information to any third party without first obtaining the Company’s express written consent.


	 






	 





	 




	 


	7.

	.
	As consideration for entering into this Agreement and for providing the Services, Company will pay Contractor at a rate described
