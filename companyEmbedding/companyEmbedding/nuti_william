The NCR Corporation (originally National Cash Register) is an American computer hardware, software and electronics company that makes self-service kiosks, point-of-sale terminals, automated teller machines, check processing systems, barcode scanners, and business consumables. They also provide IT maintenance support services. NCR had been based in Dayton, Ohio, starting in 1884, but in June 2009 the company sold most of the Dayton properties and moved its headquarters to Metro Atlanta. Currently the headquarters are in unincorporated Gwinnett County, Georgia near Duluth and Alpharetta, Georgia[4][5] Future headquarters are planned for the end of 2016 at Technology Square (adjacent to Georgia Institute of Technology) located in Atlanta, Georgia.
NCR was founded in 1884 and acquired by AT&T in 1991. A restructuring of AT&T in 1996 led to NCR's re-establishment January 1,1997 as a separate company and involved the spin-off of Lucent Technologies from AT&T.[citation needed] NCR is the only AT&T spin-off company that has retained its original name—all the others have either been purchased or renamed following subsequent mergers.[citation needed]

History[edit]
Early years[edit]

The company began as the National Manufacturing Company of Dayton, Ohio, was established to manufacture and sell the first mechanical cash register invented in 1879 by James Ritty. In 1884, the company and patents were bought by John Henry Patterson and his brother Frank Jefferson Patterson, and the firm was renamed the National Cash Register Company. Patterson formed NCR into one of the first modern American companies by introducing new, aggressive sales methods and business techniques. He established the first sales training school in 1893 and introduced a comprehensive social welfare program for his factory workers.
Other significant figures in the early history of the company were Charles F. Kettering, Thomas J. Watson, Sr. and Edward A. Deeds. Deeds and Kettering went on to found Dayton Engineering Laboratories Company which later became Delco Products Division of General Motors. Watson eventually worked his way up to general sales manager. At an uninspiring sales meeting, Watson interrupted, saying The trouble with every one of us is that we don't think enough. We don't get paid for working with our feet — we get paid for working with our heads. Watson then wrote THINK on the easel.[6] Signs with this motto were erected in factory buildings, sales offices and club rooms during the mid-1890s. "THINK" later became a widely known symbol of IBM. Patterson fired Watson in 1914.[7] Kettering designed the first cash register powered by an electric motor in 1906. Within a few years he developed the Class 1000 register which was in production for 40 years, and the O.K. Telephone Credit Authorization system for verifying credit in department stores.[citation needed]
American Selling Force[edit]
When John H. Patterson and his brother took over the company, cash registers were expensive ($50 USD) and only about a dozen of "Ritty's Incorruptible Cashier" machines were in use. There was little demand for the expensive device, but Patterson believed the product would sell once shopkeepers understood it would drastically decrease theft by salesclerks. He created a sales team known as the "American Selling Force" which worked on commissions and followed a standard sales script, the "N.C.R. Primer." The philosophy was to sell a business function rather than just a piece of machinery. Sales demonstrations were set up in hotels (away from the distractions of the buyer's business) depicting a store interior complete with real merchandise and real cash. The sale prospect was described as the "P.P." or "Probable Purchaser." Once initial objections were swept aside and the P.P. admitted to internal theft losses, the product was demonstrated along with large business charts and diagrams. The deal was sealed with a 25 cent cigar.[8]
Expansion[edit]
NCR expanded quickly and became multi-national in 1888. Between 1893 and 1906 it acquired a number of smaller cash register companies.[9]
By 1911 it had sold one million machines and grown to almost 6,000 employees. Combined with rigorous legal attacks, Patterson's methods enabled the company to fight off bankruptcy, buy-out over 80 of its early competitors, and achieve control of 95% of the U.S. market.
In 1912 the company was found guilty of violating the Sherman Antitrust Act. Patterson, Deeds, Watson and 25 other NCR executives and managers were convicted of illegal anti-competitive sales practices and were sentenced to one year of imprisonment. Their convictions were unpopular with the public due to the efforts of Patterson and Watson to help those affected by the Dayton, Ohio floods of 1913, but efforts to have them pardoned by President Woodrow Wilson were unsuccessful. However, their convictions were overturned on appeal in 1915 on the grounds that important defense evidence should have been admitted.

Two million units were sold by 1922, the year John Patterson died. In 1925 NCR went public with an issue of $55 million in stock, at that time the largest public offering in United States history. During the first World War NCR manufactured fuses and aircraft instrumentation, and during World War II built aero-engines, bomb sights and code-breaking machines, including the American bombe designed by Joseph Desch.
Post-war[edit]




NCR 304 Computer


Building on its wartime experience with secret communication systems, high speed counters and cryptanalytic equipment,[10] NCR became a major post-war force in developing new computing and communications technology.
In 1953 chemists Barrett K. Green and Lowell Schleicher of NCR in Dayton submitted a patent "Pressure responsive record materials" for a carbon-less copy paper. This became US Patent 2,730,457 and was commercialized as "NCR Paper."
In February 1953, the company acquired the Computer Research Corporation (CRC),[11] after which it created a specialized electronics division. In 1956, NCR introduced its first electronic device, the Class 29 Post-Tronic, a bank machine using magnetic stripe technology. With the General Electric Company (known now just as GE ), the company manufactured its first transistor-based computer in 1957, the NCR 304. Also in the 1950s NCR introduced MICR (magnetic ink character recognition)[12] and the NCR 3100 accounting machines.[13]
In 1962, NCR introduced the NCR-315 Electronic Data Processing System which included the CRAM storage device, the first automated mass storage alternative to magnetic tape libraries accessed manually by computer operators. The NCR 390 and 500 computers were also offered to customers who did not need the full power of the 315. The NCR 390 accepted four types of input: magnetic ledger cards, punched cards, punched tape, and keyboard entry, with a tape read speed of 400 characters a second.[13] The company's first all-integrated circuit computer was the Century 100 of 1968. The Century 200 was added in 1970. The line was extended through the Century 300.[14] The Century series was followed by the Criterion series in 1976, NCR's first virtual machine system.
During this period, NCR also produced the 605 minicomputer for in-house use. It was the compute engine for the 399 and 499 accounting machines, several generations of in-store and in-bank controllers, and the 82xx/90xx IMOS COBOL systems. The 605 also powered peripheral controllers, including the 658 disk subsystem and the 721 communications processor.
By 1986, the number of mainframe makers had dropped from 8 (IBM and the "seven dwarfs") to 6 (IBM and the "BUNCH") to 4: IBM, Unisys, NCR, and Control Data Corporation.
The company adopted the name NCR Corporation in 1974.
Small computers[edit]
In 1982, NCR became involved in open systems architecture. Its first such system was the UNIX-powered TOWER 16/32, the success of which (approximately 100,000 were sold) established NCR as a pioneer in bringing industry standards and open systems architecture to the computer market. These 5000-series systems were based on Motorola 68k CPUs and supported NCR's proprietary transaction processing system TMX, which was mainly used by financial institutions. This product line also saw the first time NCR had offered its products through other than its own direct sales channels since the early 1900s. Formally added to its company structure in March 1984, NCR's OEM System's Division spearheaded the design, sales revenue and market awareness and acceptance of NCR's Tower family. Part of the cause of this success was the decision by NCR senior management to hire reseller industry veterans for key positions within the fledgling operation and have that unit work with, but not answerable to, NCR's traditional management structure. The industry shift from minicomputers brought personnel with minicomputer and reseller backgrounds such as the division head, Dan Kiegler (ex-Datapoint marketing), marketing manager and later Director of Field Sales, Dave Lang (ex-DEC reseller marketing director and salesperson) and other critical contributors at corporate levels; who then hired a complementary field sales organization primarily made up of proven people from DEC, Wang and other faltering minicomputer firms.

In the 1980s, NCR sold various PC compatible AT-class computers, like the small NCR-3390 (called an "intelligent terminal"). They proposed a customized version of MS-DOS named NCR-DOS, which for example offered support for switching the CPU between 6, 8 or 10 MHz speeds. The computers featured an improved CGA adapter, the NGA, which had a 640×400 text mode more suitable for business uses than the original 640×200 mode, with characters drawn using single-pixel-wide lines, giving an appearance similar to that of classic IBM 3270 terminals. The additional four-color 640×400 graphical mode was identical to CGA's 320×200 mode from a programming point of view.
NCR also manufactured two proprietary series of mini-to-midrange computers:
I-Series: 9010 (IDPS Operating System), 9020 and 9100 (IMOS Operating System), 9040 and 9050 (IRX Operating System), 9200 / 9300 / 9300IP / 9400 / 9400IP / 9500 / System 1000 models 35 / 55 / 65 / 75 (ITX Operating System). These were "I" (Interactive) computers allowing TTY terminals to be connected. Later models supported all industry-standard communication protocols.
V-Series: 8500 (VRX Operating System) and 9800 (VRX/E Operating System). These were "V" series, comparable to mainframes, supporting "Page mode" terminals. The hardware did have similarities with the I-Series while the operating system and user interface was totally different.
In 1990, NCR introduced the System 3000, a seven-level family of computers based on Intel's 386 and 486 CPUs. The majority of the System 3000 range utilised IBM's Micro Channel architecture rather than the more prevalent ISA architecture, and utilised SCSI peripherals as well as the more popular parallel and serial port interfaces, resulting in a premium product with premium pricing. The 3600, through NCR subsidiary Applied Digital Data Systems supported both the Pick Operating System and Prime Information.[15]
The 1970s saw the widespread installations of the Model 770 in National Westminster and Barclays banks throughout the UK, but it was not until the Model 5070, developed at its Dundee plant in Scotland and introduced in 1983 that the company began to make more serious inroads into the ATM market. Subsequent models included the 5084, and 58xx (Personas) series. In early 2008 the company launched its new generation of ATMs—the 662x/663x SelfServ series. NCR currently commands over a third of the entire ATM market, with an estimated $18 trillion being withdrawn from NCR ATMs every year. In addition, NCR's expertise in this field led the company to contract with the U.S. Military to support the Eagle Cash program with customized ATMs.[16]
NCR 5xxx series[edit]
The NCR 5xxx-series is the range of (ATM's) produced by NCR from the early 1980s. Most models were designed and initially manufactured at its Dundee factory in Scotland, but later produced at several other locations around the world.
There have been several distinct generations:

50xx-series; The initial models introduced in 1983 were the 5070 (interior vestibule) and 5080 (Through The Wall or TTW) introduced a number of features which have become standard among ATM's—chiefly the individual functions of the ATM are divided among discrete modules which can be easily removed and replaced for repair or replenishment. The 5080 featured the standard anti-vandal smoked perspex screen which covered the keypad and screen until the cardholder inserted their card. The enhanced 5084 TTW model appeared in 1987, and had an improved anti-vandal fascia and was the first ATM to dispense with the need for the retracting perspex screen. The 5085 offered the first crude deposit function; with the machine supplying the deposit envelopes which were subsequently stored in the machine's safe for subsequent back office processing.
56xx-series; produced from 1991 to 1997. Enhanced functions such as colour displays and improved security and usability functions became available. The introduction of Media Entry Indicators (MEI) which highlight the card entry slot to the customer was also a part of this series. Some 56xx machines produced between 1994–1996 were badged as "AT&T" rather than "NCR", mirroring the company's brief ownership under the telecoms giant in the mid-1990s. 56xx models have included the 5670 (interior lobby cash dispense only), 5675 (interior lobby multifunction—dispense & deposit), 5684 (exterior TTW dispense only), 5688 (exterior TTW drive-up multifunction) and 5685 (exterior TTW multifunction).
58xx-series marketed as Personas from 1998 to the present. These models were characterised by the gradual move towards greater ATM functionality including intelligent, envelopeless deposit by means of automated cheque recognition modules, coin dispense, and electronic cash recognition functions which allows bank customers to deposit cash and cheques with instant processing of the transaction. The 58xx series has also been characterised by the gradual introduction of LCD displays instead of the traditional CRT monitor. Models have included the 5870 (compact interior lobby dispense only), 5873 (interior lobby with cash accept & deposit only), 5874 (Exterior TTW cash dispense), 5875 (Multifunction TTW). The latest TTW versions of the Personas line, introduced in 2000 and marketed as M-Series added functions such as cash recycling, coin dispense, barcode reading, a larger 12" LCD display with touchscreen option, and for the first time, a common wall footprint for both the Multifunction (5886) or single function (5887).

NCR 66XX series[edit]
NCR's 6th generation of ATMs have been noted for the further move towards intelligent deposit and the expansion of secondary functions such as barcode reading.

667x-series marketed under the Personas M-Series brand were introduced in 2005 to the present. These models consist of the 6676 (interior lobby multifunction) and 6674 (through-the-wall multifunction). The outlook design is very different from the Personas model; on the front-access 6676s the front cover is opened upwards which claim to be saving the services area.

NCR Self-Serv 20 & 30 series[edit]
NCR's latest ATM services, introduced in 2008.
This series is a complete redesign of both outlook and technological contents. It is also a cost down product.
Self-Serv 20 series are single-function (e.g. cash-out) ATMs, while Self-Serv 30 series are full-function (cash-out and intelligent deposit) machines.
AT&T[edit]
NCR was acquired September 19, 1991 by AT&T Corporation for $7.4 billion and was joined with Teradata Corporation on February 28, 1992. As an AT&T subsidiary, its 1992 year-end headcount was 53,800 employees and contractors.[17] By 1993, the subsidiary produced a year-end $1.287 billion net loss on $7.265 billion in revenue. The net losses continued in 1994 and 1995, losses that required repeated subsidies from the parent company and resulted in a 1995 year-end headcount of 41,100.[17] During these three years, AT&T was the former NCR's largest customer, accounting for over $1.5 billion in revenue.[17]
On February 15, 1995, the company sold its microelectronics division and storage systems division to Hyundai which named it Symbios Logic. At the time it was the largest purchase of an American company by a Korean company.
For a while, starting in 1994, the subsidiary was renamed AT&T Global Information Solutions, but in 1995, AT&T decided to spin off the company, and in 1996, changed its name back to NCR in preparation for the spin-off. The company outlined its reasons for the spin-off in an Information Statement sent to its stockholders, which cited, in addition to "changes in customer needs" and "need for focused management time and attention", the following:

...[A]dvantages of vertical integration [which had motivated ATT's earlier acquisition of NCR] are outweighed by its costs and disadvantages....[T]o varying degrees, many of the actual and potential customers of Lucent and NCR are or will be competitors of AT&T's communications services businesses. NCR believes that its efforts to target the communications industry have been hindered by the reluctance of AT&T's communications services competitors to make purchases from an AT&T subsidiary.

NCR re-emerged as a stand-alone company on January 1, 1997.
Independence[edit]
One of NCR's first significant acquisitions after becoming independent from AT&T came in July 1997 when it purchased Compris Technologies, a privately held company in Kennesaw, Georgia that produced software for restaurant chains.[18] In November 1997, NCR purchased Dataworks Inc., a 60-person privately held company in San Antonio, Texas.[19]
The Montgomery County Historical Society and NCR Corporation joined in 1998 into an innovative partnership committed to preserving the voluminous NCR Archive. For more than three months in late 1999, trucks traveled between NCR's Building 28 and the Historical Society's Research Center, taking three million pieces of an extraordinary collection to their new home.
In 1998, NCR sold its computer hardware manufacturing assets to Solectron and ceased to produce general-purpose computer systems, focusing instead on the retail and financial industries. In 2000, NCR acquired customer relationship management provider Ceres Integrated Solutions and services company 4Front Technologies. Recent acquisitions include self-service companies Kinetics, InfoAmerica and Galvanon, and software company DecisionPoint.
In April 2003, NCR purchased Copient Technologies, an Indiana-based retail marketing software company.
Under Bill Nuti's management[edit]

In 2006, NCR acquired software company IDVelocity and the ATM manufacturing division of Tidel, a cash security equipment manufacturer specializing in retail markets.
On January 8, 2007, NCR announced its intention to separate into two independent companies by spinning off Teradata to shareholders. Bill Nuti would continue his role as president and CEO of NCR, while Teradata Senior VP Mike Koehler would assume leadership of Teradata.[20] On October 1, 2007, NCR Corporation and Teradata jointly announced the Teradata business unit spin-off was complete, with Michael Koehler as the first CEO of Teradata.[21]
On January 11, 2007, NCR announced plans to restructure its entire ATM manufacturing operations, with 650 jobs at its Dundee plant being cut.[22] A further 450 jobs were cut in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. In 2009, the Dundee manufacturing facility was closed, along with plants in São Paulo and Bucharest, citing global economic conditions as the reason.
NCR extended its self-service portfolio into the digital media market with the January 2007 announcement of NCR Xpress Entertainment, a multichannel entertainment kiosk. NCR’s acquisition of Touch Automation LLC was announced on December 31, 2007.[23]
On October 15, 2008, NCR announced a global reseller partnership with Experticity, a Seattle-based software company.[24]
In 2009, NCR relocated its corporate headquarters from Dayton, Ohio to Duluth, Georgia. This news was shocking as Dayton served as NCR's home for 125 years.[25]
In 2009, NCR became the second largest DVD Kiosk operator in North America with the acquisitions of The New Release and DVD Play. In 2010, NCR completed the acquisition of digital signage company, Netkey.
In August 2011, NCR purchased Radiant Systems, a hospitality and retail systems company, for US$1.2 billion.[26] Radiant's hospitality division turned into a new Hospitality Line of Business within NCR. Radiant's petroleum and convenience retail business became part of its retail line of business. Several Radiant executives remained on board, including Scott Kingsfield, who was a general manager of NCR's Retail Line of Business and left NCR in 2014, and Andy Heyman, who became general manager of NCR's Financial Services line of business.
In August 2012, the company was hit with charges of avoiding U.S. economic sanctions against Syria, greatly affecting its stock price.[27]
In February 2013, NCR completed its acquisition of Retalix (NASDAQ: RTLX), a provider of retail software and services, for approximately $650 million in cash.[28]
In January 2014, NCR completed its acquisition of Digital Insight Corporation, a provider of online and mobile banking to mid-market financial institutions, from equity firm Thoma Bravo, LLC for $1.65 billion in cash.[29]
In September 2016, Mark Benjamin was named president and chief operating officer of NCR. Benjamin is a 24-year veteran of human resources management and will report directly to Bill Nuti.[30]
Products and services[edit]
NCR's R&D activity is split between its three major centres in Atlanta USA (Retail), Dundee, Scotland (Financial Industry), and Waterloo, Ontario. It also has R&D centres in Beijing, Cebu, Philippines, Belgrade / Serbia, Puducherry and Hyderabad in India.[31] NCR also has manufacturing facility in Beijing, Budapest, and also the Indian territory of Puducherry, which is a regional manufacturing and export hub.

The NCR Corporation (originally National Cash Register) is an American computer hardware, software and electronics company that makes self-service kiosks, point-of-sale terminals, automated teller machines, check processing systems, barcode scanners, and business consumables. They also provide IT maintenance support services. NCR had been based in Dayton, Ohio, starting in 1884, but in June 2009 the company sold most of the Dayton properties and moved its headquarters to Metro Atlanta. Currently the headquarters are in unincorporated Gwinnett County, Georgia near Duluth and Alpharetta, Georgia[4][5] Future headquarters are planned for the end of 2016 at Technology Square (adjacent to Georgia Institute of Technology) located in Atlanta, Georgia.
NCR was founded in 1884 and acquired by AT&T in 1991. A restructuring of AT&T in 1996 led to NCR's re-establishment January 1,1997 as a separate company and involved the spin-off of Lucent Technologies from AT&T.[citation needed] NCR is the only AT&T spin-off company that has retained its original name—all the others have either been purchased or renamed following subsequent mergers.[citation needed]

History[edit]
Early years[edit]




Antique three-column full-keyboard cash register






Old National Cash Register on display at the Museo de la Secretaría de Hacienda y Crédito Público in Mexico City


The company began as the National Manufacturing Company of Dayton, Ohio, was established to manufacture and sell the first mechanical cash register invented in 1879 by James Ritty. In 1884, the company and patents were bought by John Henry Patterson and his brother Frank Jefferson Patterson, and the firm was renamed the National Cash Register Company. Patterson formed NCR into one of the first modern American companies by introducing new, aggressive sales methods and business techniques. He established the first sales training school in 1893 and introduced a comprehensive social welfare program for his factory workers.
Other significant figures in the early history of the company were Charles F. Kettering, Thomas J. Watson, Sr. and Edward A. Deeds. Deeds and Kettering went on to found Dayton Engineering Laboratories Company which later became Delco Products Division of General Motors. Watson eventually worked his way up to general sales manager. At an uninspiring sales meeting, Watson interrupted, saying The trouble with every one of us is that we don't think enough. We don't get paid for working with our feet — we get paid for working with our heads. Watson then wrote THINK on the easel.[6] Signs with this motto were erected in factory buildings, sales offices and club rooms during the mid-1890s. "THINK" later became a widely known symbol of IBM. Patterson fired Watson in 1914.[7] Kettering designed the first cash register powered by an electric motor in 1906. Within a few years he developed the Class 1000 register which was in production for 40 years, and the O.K. Telephone Credit Authorization system for verifying credit in department stores.[citation needed]
American Selling Force[edit]
When John H. Patterson and his brother took over the company, cash registers were expensive ($50 USD) and only about a dozen of "Ritty's Incorruptible Cashier" machines were in use. There was little demand for the expensive device, but Patterson believed the product would sell once shopkeepers understood it would drastically decrease theft by salesclerks. He created a sales team known as the "American Selling Force" which worked on commissions and followed a standard sales script, the "N.C.R. Primer." The philosophy was to sell a business function rather than just a piece of machinery. Sales demonstrations were set up in hotels (away from the distractions of the buyer's business) depicting a store interior complete with real merchandise and real cash. The sale prospect was described as the "P.P." or "Probable Purchaser." Once initial objections were swept aside and the P.P. admitted to internal theft losses, the product was demonstrated along with large business charts and diagrams. The deal was sealed with a 25 cent cigar.[8]
Expansion[edit]
NCR expanded quickly and became multi-national in 1888. Between 1893 and 1906 it acquired a number of smaller cash register companies.[9]
By 1911 it had sold one million machines and grown to almost 6,000 employees. Combined with rigorous legal attacks, Patterson's methods enabled the company to fight off bankruptcy, buy-out over 80 of its early competitors, and achieve control of 95% of the U.S. market.
In 1912 the company was found guilty of violating the Sherman Antitrust Act. Patterson, Deeds, Watson and 25 other NCR executives and managers were convicted of illegal anti-competitive sales practices and were sentenced to one year of imprisonment. Their convictions were unpopular with the public due to the efforts of Patterson and Watson to help those affected by the Dayton, Ohio floods of 1913, but efforts to have them pardoned by President Woodrow Wilson were unsuccessful. However, their convictions were overturned on appeal in 1915 on the grounds that important defense evidence should have been admitted.

Two million units were sold by 1922, the year John Patterson died. In 1925 NCR went public with an issue of $55 million in stock, at that time the largest public offering in United States history. During the first World War NCR manufactured fuses and aircraft instrumentation, and during World War II built aero-engines, bomb sights and code-breaking machines, including the American bombe designed by Joseph Desch.
Post-war[edit]




NCR 304 Computer


Building on its wartime experience with secret communication systems, high speed counters and cryptanalytic equipment,[10] NCR became a major post-war force in developing new computing and communications technology.
In 1953 chemists Barrett K. Green and Lowell Schleicher of NCR in Dayton submitted a patent "Pressure responsive record materials" for a carbon-less copy paper. This became US Patent 2,730,457 and was commercialized as "NCR Paper."
In February 1953, the company acquired the Computer Research Corporation (CRC),[11] after which it created a specialized electronics division. In 1956, NCR introduced its first electronic device, the Class 29 Post-Tronic, a bank machine using magnetic stripe technology. With the General Electric Company (known now just as GE ), the company manufactured its first transistor-based computer in 1957, the NCR 304. Also in the 1950s NCR introduced MICR (magnetic ink character recognition)[12] and the NCR 3100 accounting machines.[13]
In 1962, NCR introduced the NCR-315 Electronic Data Processing System which included the CRAM storage device, the first automated mass storage alternative to magnetic tape libraries accessed manually by computer operators. The NCR 390 and 500 computers were also offered to customers who did not need the full power of the 315. The NCR 390 accepted four types of input: magnetic ledger cards, punched cards, punched tape, and keyboard entry, with a tape read speed of 400 characters a second.[13] The company's first all-integrated circuit computer was the Century 100 of 1968. The Century 200 was added in 1970. The line was extended through the Century 300.[14] The Century series was followed by the Criterion series in 1976, NCR's first virtual machine system.
During this period, NCR also produced the 605 minicomputer for in-house use. It was the compute engine for the 399 and 499 accounting machines, several generations of in-store and in-bank controllers, and the 82xx/90xx IMOS COBOL systems. The 605 also powered peripheral controllers, including the 658 disk subsystem and the 721 communications processor.
By 1986, the number of mainframe makers had dropped from 8 (IBM and the "seven dwarfs") to 6 (IBM and the "BUNCH") to 4: IBM, Unisys, NCR, and Control Data Corporation.
The company adopted the name NCR Corporation in 1974.
Small computers[edit]
In 1982, NCR became involved in open systems architecture. Its first such system was the UNIX-powered TOWER 16/32, the success of which (approximately 100,000 were sold) established NCR as a pioneer in bringing industry standards and open systems architecture to the computer market. These 5000-series systems were based on Motorola 68k CPUs and supported NCR's proprietary transaction processing system TMX, which was mainly used by financial institutions. This product line also saw the first time NCR had offered its products through other than its own direct sales channels since the early 1900s. Formally added to its company structure in March 1984, NCR's OEM System's Division spearheaded the design, sales revenue and market awareness and acceptance of NCR's Tower family. Part of the cause of this success was the decision by NCR senior management to hire reseller industry veterans for key positions within the fledgling operation and have that unit work with, but not answerable to, NCR's traditional management structure. The industry shift from minicomputers brought personnel with minicomputer and reseller backgrounds such as the division head, Dan Kiegler (ex-Datapoint marketing), marketing manager and later Director of Field Sales, Dave Lang (ex-DEC reseller marketing director and salesperson) and other critical contributors at corporate levels; who then hired a complementary field sales organization primarily made up of proven people from DEC, Wang and other faltering minicomputer firms.

In the 1980s, NCR sold various PC compatible AT-class computers, like the small NCR-3390 (called an "intelligent terminal"). They proposed a customized version of MS-DOS named NCR-DOS, which for example offered support for switching the CPU between 6, 8 or 10 MHz speeds. The computers featured an improved CGA adapter, the NGA, which had a 640×400 text mode more suitable for business uses than the original 640×200 mode, with characters drawn using single-pixel-wide lines, giving an appearance similar to that of classic IBM 3270 terminals. The additional four-color 640×400 graphical mode was identical to CGA's 320×200 mode from a programming point of view.
NCR also manufactured two proprietary series of mini-to-midrange computers:
I-Series: 9010 (IDPS Operating System), 9020 and 9100 (IMOS Operating System), 9040 and 9050 (IRX Operating System), 9200 / 9300 / 9300IP / 9400 / 9400IP / 9500 / System 1000 models 35 / 55 / 65 / 75 (ITX Operating System). These were "I" (Interactive) computers allowing TTY terminals to be connected. Later models supported all industry-standard communication protocols.
V-Series: 8500 (VRX Operating System) and 9800 (VRX/E Operating System). These were "V" series, comparable to mainframes, supporting "Page mode" terminals. The hardware did have similarities with the I-Series while the operating system and user interface was totally different.
In 1990, NCR introduced the System 3000, a seven-level family of computers based on Intel's 386 and 486 CPUs. The majority of the System 3000 range utilised IBM's Micro Channel architecture rather than the more prevalent ISA architecture, and utilised SCSI peripherals as well as the more popular parallel and serial port interfaces, resulting in a premium product with premium pricing. The 3600, through NCR subsidiary Applied Digital Data Systems supported both the Pick Operating System and Prime Information.[15]
The 1970s saw the widespread installations of the Model 770 in National Westminster and Barclays banks throughout the UK, but it was not until the Model 5070, developed at its Dundee plant in Scotland and introduced in 1983 that the company began to make more serious inroads into the ATM market. Subsequent models included the 5084, and 58xx (Personas) series. In early 2008 the company launched its new generation of ATMs—the 662x/663x SelfServ series. NCR currently commands over a third of the entire ATM market, with an estimated $18 trillion being withdrawn from NCR ATMs every year. In addition, NCR's expertise in this field led the company to contract with the U.S. Military to support the Eagle Cash program with customized ATMs.[16]
NCR 5xxx series[edit]
The NCR 5xxx-series is the range of (ATM's) produced by NCR from the early 1980s. Most models were designed and initially manufactured at its Dundee factory in Scotland, but later produced at several other locations around the world.
There have been several distinct generations:

50xx-series; The initial models introduced in 1983 were the 5070 (interior vestibule) and 5080 (Through The Wall or TTW) introduced a number of features which have become standard among ATM's—chiefly the individual functions of the ATM are divided among discrete modules which can be easily removed and replaced for repair or replenishment. The 5080 featured the standard anti-vandal smoked perspex screen which covered the keypad and screen until the cardholder inserted their card. The enhanced 5084 TTW model appeared in 1987, and had an improved anti-vandal fascia and was the first ATM to dispense with the need for the retracting perspex screen. The 5085 offered the first crude deposit function; with the machine supplying the deposit envelopes which were subsequently stored in the machine's safe for subsequent back office processing.
56xx-series; produced from 1991 to 1997. Enhanced functions such as colour displays and improved security and usability functions became available. The introduction of Media Entry Indicators (MEI) which highlight the card entry slot to the customer was also a part of this series. Some 56xx machines produced between 1994–1996 were badged as "AT&T" rather than "NCR", mirroring the company's brief ownership under the telecoms giant in the mid-1990s. 56xx models have included the 5670 (interior lobby cash dispense only), 5675 (interior lobby multifunction—dispense & deposit), 5684 (exterior TTW dispense only), 5688 (exterior TTW drive-up multifunction) and 5685 (exterior TTW multifunction).
58xx-series marketed as Personas from 1998 to the present. These models were characterised by the gradual move towards greater ATM functionality including intelligent, envelopeless deposit by means of automated cheque recognition modules, coin dispense, and electronic cash recognition functions which allows bank customers to deposit cash and cheques with instant processing of the transaction. The 58xx series has also been characterised by the gradual introduction of LCD displays instead of the traditional CRT monitor. Models have included the 5870 (compact interior lobby dispense only), 5873 (interior lobby with cash accept & deposit only), 5874 (Exterior TTW cash dispense), 5875 (Multifunction TTW). The latest TTW versions of the Personas line, introduced in 2000 and marketed as M-Series added functions such as cash recycling, coin dispense, barcode reading, a larger 12" LCD display with touchscreen option, and for the first time, a common wall footprint for both the Multifunction (5886) or single function (5887).

NCR 66XX series[edit]
NCR's 6th generation of ATMs have been noted for the further move towards intelligent deposit and the expansion of secondary functions such as barcode reading.

667x-series marketed under the Personas M-Series brand were introduced in 2005 to the present. These models consist of the 6676 (interior lobby multifunction) and 6674 (through-the-wall multifunction). The outlook design is very different from the Personas model; on the front-access 6676s the front cover is opened upwards which claim to be saving the services area.

NCR Self-Serv 20 & 30 series[edit]
NCR's latest ATM services, introduced in 2008.
This series is a complete redesign of both outlook and technological contents. It is also a cost down product.
Self-Serv 20 series are single-function (e.g. cash-out) ATMs, while Self-Serv 30 series are full-function (cash-out and intelligent deposit) machines.
AT&T[edit]
NCR was acquired September 19, 1991 by AT&T Corporation for $7.4 billion and was joined with Teradata Corporation on February 28, 1992. As an AT&T subsidiary, its 1992 year-end headcount was 53,800 employees and contractors.[17] By 1993, the subsidiary produced a year-end $1.287 billion net loss on $7.265 billion in revenue. The net losses continued in 1994 and 1995, losses that required repeated subsidies from the parent company and resulted in a 1995 year-end headcount of 41,100.[17] During these three years, AT&T was the former NCR's largest customer, accounting for over $1.5 billion in revenue.[17]
On February 15, 1995, the company sold its microelectronics division and storage systems division to Hyundai which named it Symbios Logic. At the time it was the largest purchase of an American company by a Korean company.
For a while, starting in 1994, the subsidiary was renamed AT&T Global Information Solutions, but in 1995, AT&T decided to spin off the company, and in 1996, changed its name back to NCR in preparation for the spin-off. The company outlined its reasons for the spin-off in an Information Statement sent to its stockholders, which cited, in addition to "changes in customer needs" and "need for focused management time and attention", the following:

...[A]dvantages of vertical integration [which had motivated ATT's earlier acquisition of NCR] are outweighed by its costs and disadvantages....[T]o varying degrees, many of the actual and potential customers of Lucent and NCR are or will be competitors of AT&T's communications services businesses. NCR believes that its efforts to target the communications industry have been hindered by the reluctance of AT&T's communications services competitors to make purchases from an AT&T subsidiary.

NCR re-emerged as a stand-alone company on January 1, 1997.
Independence[edit]
One of NCR's first significant acquisitions after becoming independent from AT&T came in July 1997 when it purchased Compris Technologies, a privately held company in Kennesaw, Georgia that produced software for restaurant chains.[18] In November 1997, NCR purchased Dataworks Inc., a 60-person privately held company in San Antonio, Texas.[19]
The Montgomery County Historical Society and NCR Corporation joined in 1998 into an innovative partnership committed to preserving the voluminous NCR Archive. For more than three months in late 1999, trucks traveled between NCR's Building 28 and the Historical Society's Research Center, taking three million pieces of an extraordinary collection to their new home.
In 1998, NCR sold its computer hardware manufacturing assets to Solectron and ceased to produce general-purpose computer systems, focusing instead on the retail and financial industries. In 2000, NCR acquired customer relationship management provider Ceres Integrated Solutions and services company 4Front Technologies. Recent acquisitions include self-service companies Kinetics, InfoAmerica and Galvanon, and software company DecisionPoint.
In April 2003, NCR purchased Copient Technologies, an Indiana-based retail marketing software company.
Under Bill Nuti's management[edit]

In 2006, NCR acquired software company IDVelocity and the ATM manufacturing division of Tidel, a cash security equipment manufacturer specializing in retail markets.
On January 8, 2007, NCR announced its intention to separate into two independent companies by spinning off Teradata to shareholders. Bill Nuti would continue his role as president and CEO of NCR, while Teradata Senior VP Mike Koehler would assume leadership of Teradata.[20] On October 1, 2007, NCR Corporation and Teradata jointly announced the Teradata business unit spin-off was complete, with Michael Koehler as the first CEO of Teradata.[21]
On January 11, 2007, NCR announced plans to restructure its entire ATM manufacturing operations, with 650 jobs at its Dundee plant being cut.[22] A further 450 jobs were cut in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. In 2009, the Dundee manufacturing facility was closed, along with plants in São Paulo and Bucharest, citing global economic conditions as the reason.
NCR extended its self-service portfolio into the digital media market with the January 2007 announcement of NCR Xpress Entertainment, a multichannel entertainment kiosk. NCR’s acquisition of Touch Automation LLC was announced on December 31, 2007.[23]
On October 15, 2008, NCR announced a global reseller partnership with Experticity, a Seattle-based software company.[24]
In 2009, NCR relocated its corporate headquarters from Dayton, Ohio to Duluth, Georgia. This news was shocking as Dayton served as NCR's home for 125 years.[25]
In 2009, NCR became the second largest DVD Kiosk operator in North America with the acquisitions of The New Release and DVD Play. In 2010, NCR completed the acquisition of digital signage company, Netkey.
In August 2011, NCR purchased Radiant Systems, a hospitality and retail systems company, for US$1.2 billion.[26] Radiant's hospitality division turned into a new Hospitality Line of Business within NCR. Radiant's petroleum and convenience retail business became part of its retail line of business. Several Radiant executives remained on board, including Scott Kingsfield, who was a general manager of NCR's Retail Line of Business and left NCR in 2014, and Andy Heyman, who became general manager of NCR's Financial Services line of business.
In August 2012, the company was hit with charges of avoiding U.S. economic sanctions against Syria, greatly affecting its stock price.[27]
In February 2013, NCR completed its acquisition of Retalix (NASDAQ: RTLX), a provider of retail software and services, for approximately $650 million in cash.[28]
In January 2014, NCR completed its acquisition of Digital Insight Corporation, a provider of online and mobile banking to mid-market financial institutions, from equity firm Thoma Bravo, LLC for $1.65 billion in cash.[29]
In September 2016, Mark Benjamin was named president and chief operating officer of NCR. Benjamin is a 24-year veteran of human resources management and will report directly to Bill Nuti.[30]
Products and services[edit]
NCR's R&D activity is split between its three major centres in Atlanta USA (Retail), Dundee, Scotland (Financial Industry), and Waterloo, Ontario. It also has R&D centres in Beijing, Cebu, Philippines, Belgrade / Serbia, Puducherry and Hyderabad in India.[31] NCR also has manufacturing facility in Beijing, Budapest, and also the Indian territory of Puducherry, which is a regional manufacturing and export hub.

The NCR Corporation (originally National Cash Register) is an American computer hardware, software and electronics company that makes self-service kiosks, point-of-sale terminals, automated teller machines, check processing systems, barcode scanners, and business consumables. They also provide IT maintenance support services. NCR had been based in Dayton, Ohio, starting in 1884, but in June 2009 the company sold most of the Dayton properties and moved its headquarters to Metro Atlanta. Currently the headquarters are in unincorporated Gwinnett County, Georgia near Duluth and Alpharetta, Georgia[4][5] Future headquarters are planned for the end of 2016 at Technology Square (adjacent to Georgia Institute of Technology) located in Atlanta, Georgia.
NCR was founded in 1884 and acquired by AT&T in 1991. A restructuring of AT&T in 1996 led to NCR's re-establishment January 1,1997 as a separate company and involved the spin-off of Lucent Technologies from AT&T.[citation needed] NCR is the only AT&T spin-off company that has retained its original name—all the others have either been purchased or renamed following subsequent mergers.[citation needed]

History[edit]
Early years[edit]




Antique three-column full-keyboard cash register






Old National Cash Register on display at the Museo de la Secretaría de Hacienda y Crédito Público in Mexico City


The company began as the National Manufacturing Company of Dayton, Ohio, was established to manufacture and sell the first mechanical cash register invented in 1879 by James Ritty. In 1884, the company and patents were bought by John Henry Patterson and his brother Frank Jefferson Patterson, and the firm was renamed the National Cash Register Company. Patterson formed NCR into one of the first modern American companies by introducing new, aggressive sales methods and business techniques. He established the first sales training school in 1893 and introduced a comprehensive social welfare program for his factory workers.
Other significant figures in the early history of the company were Charles F. Kettering, Thomas J. Watson, Sr. and Edward A. Deeds. Deeds and Kettering went on to found Dayton Engineering Laboratories Company which later became Delco Products Division of General Motors. Watson eventually worked his way up to general sales manager. At an uninspiring sales meeting, Watson interrupted, saying The trouble with every one of us is that we don't think enough. We don't get paid for working with our feet — we get paid for working with our heads. Watson then wrote THINK on the easel.[6] Signs with this motto were erected in factory buildings, sales offices and club rooms during the mid-1890s. "THINK" later became a widely known symbol of IBM. Patterson fired Watson in 1914.[7] Kettering designed the first cash register powered by an electric motor in 1906. Within a few years he developed the Class 1000 register which was in production for 40 years, and the O.K. Telephone Credit Authorization system for verifying credit in department stores.[citation needed]
American Selling Force[edit]
When John H. Patterson and his brother took over the company, cash registers were expensive ($50 USD) and only about a dozen of "Ritty's Incorruptible Cashier" machines were in use. There was little demand for the expensive device, but Patterson believed the product would sell once shopkeepers understood it would drastically decrease theft by salesclerks. He created a sales team known as the "American Selling Force" which worked on commissions and followed a standard sales script, the "N.C.R. Primer." The philosophy was to sell a business function rather than just a piece of machinery. Sales demonstrations were set up in hotels (away from the distractions of the buyer's business) depicting a store interior complete with real merchandise and real cash. The sale prospect was described as the "P.P." or "Probable Purchaser." Once initial objections were swept aside and the P.P. admitted to internal theft losses, the product was demonstrated along with large business charts and diagrams. The deal was sealed with a 25 cent cigar.[8]
Expansion[edit]
NCR expanded quickly and became multi-national in 1888. Between 1893 and 1906 it acquired a number of smaller cash register companies.[9]
By 1911 it had sold one million machines and grown to almost 6,000 employees. Combined with rigorous legal attacks, Patterson's methods enabled the company to fight off bankruptcy, buy-out over 80 of its early competitors, and achieve control of 95% of the U.S. market.
In 1912 the company was found guilty of violating the Sherman Antitrust Act. Patterson, Deeds, Watson and 25 other NCR executives and managers were convicted of illegal anti-competitive sales practices and were sentenced to one year of imprisonment. Their convictions were unpopular with the public due to the efforts of Patterson and Watson to help those affected by the Dayton, Ohio floods of 1913, but efforts to have them pardoned by President Woodrow Wilson were unsuccessful. However, their convictions were overturned on appeal in 1915 on the grounds that important defense evidence should have been admitted.




WWII NCR poster


Two million units were sold by 1922, the year John Patterson died. In 1925 NCR went public with an issue of $55 million in stock, at that time the largest public offering in United States history. During the first World War NCR manufactured fuses and aircraft instrumentation, and during World War II built aero-engines, bomb sights and code-breaking machines, including the American bombe designed by Joseph Desch.
Post-war[edit]




NCR 304 Computer


Building on its wartime experience with secret communication systems, high speed counters and cryptanalytic equipment,[10] NCR became a major post-war force in developing new computing and communications technology.
In 1953 chemists Barrett K. Green and Lowell Schleicher of NCR in Dayton submitted a patent "Pressure responsive record materials" for a carbon-less copy paper. This became US Patent 2,730,457 and was commercialized as "NCR Paper."
In February 1953, the company acquired the Computer Research Corporation (CRC),[11] after which it created a specialized electronics division. In 1956, NCR introduced its first electronic device, the Class 29 Post-Tronic, a bank machine using magnetic stripe technology. With the General Electric Company (known now just as GE ), the company manufactured its first transistor-based computer in 1957, the NCR 304. Also in the 1950s NCR introduced MICR (magnetic ink character recognition)[12] and the NCR 3100 accounting machines.[13]
In 1962, NCR introduced the NCR-315 Electronic Data Processing System which included the CRAM storage device, the first automated mass storage alternative to magnetic tape libraries accessed manually by computer operators. The NCR 390 and 500 computers were also offered to customers who did not need the full power of the 315. The NCR 390 accepted four types of input: magnetic ledger cards, punched cards, punched tape, and keyboard entry, with a tape read speed of 400 characters a second.[13] The company's first all-integrated circuit computer was the Century 100 of 1968. The Century 200 was added in 1970. The line was extended through the Century 300.[14] The Century series was followed by the Criterion series in 1976, NCR's first virtual machine system.
During this period, NCR also produced the 605 minicomputer for in-house use. It was the compute engine for the 399 and 499 accounting machines, several generations of in-store and in-bank controllers, and the 82xx/90xx IMOS COBOL systems. The 605 also powered peripheral controllers, including the 658 disk subsystem and the 721 communications processor.
By 1986, the number of mainframe makers had dropped from 8 (IBM and the "seven dwarfs") to 6 (IBM and the "BUNCH") to 4: IBM, Unisys, NCR, and Control Data Corporation.
The company adopted the name NCR Corporation in 1974.
Small computers[edit]
In 1982, NCR became involved in open systems architecture. Its first such system was the UNIX-powered TOWER 16/32, the success of which (approximately 100,000 were sold) established NCR as a pioneer in bringing industry standards and open systems architecture to the computer market. These 5000-series systems were based on Motorola 68k CPUs and supported NCR's proprietary transaction processing system TMX, which was mainly used by financial institutions. This product line also saw the first time NCR had offered its products through other than its own direct sales channels since the early 1900s. Formally added to its company structure in March 1984, NCR's OEM System's Division spearheaded the design, sales revenue and market awareness and acceptance of NCR's Tower family. Part of the cause of this success was the decision by NCR senior management to hire reseller industry veterans for key positions within the fledgling operation and have that unit work with, but not answerable to, NCR's traditional management structure. The industry shift from minicomputers brought personnel with minicomputer and reseller backgrounds such as the division head, Dan Kiegler (ex-Datapoint marketing), marketing manager and later Director of Field Sales, Dave Lang (ex-DEC reseller marketing director and salesperson) and other critical contributors at corporate levels; who then hired a complementary field sales organization primarily made up of proven people from DEC, Wang and other faltering minicomputer firms.

In the 1980s, NCR sold various PC compatible AT-class computers, like the small NCR-3390 (called an "intelligent terminal"). They proposed a customized version of MS-DOS named NCR-DOS, which for example offered support for switching the CPU between 6, 8 or 10 MHz speeds. The computers featured an improved CGA adapter, the NGA, which had a 640×400 text mode more suitable for business uses than the original 640×200 mode, with characters drawn using single-pixel-wide lines, giving an appearance similar to that of classic IBM 3270 terminals. The additional four-color 640×400 graphical mode was identical to CGA's 320×200 mode from a programming point of view.
NCR also manufactured two proprietary series of mini-to-midrange computers:
I-Series: 9010 (IDPS Operating System), 9020 and 9100 (IMOS Operating System), 9040 and 9050 (IRX Operating System), 9200 / 9300 / 9300IP / 9400 / 9400IP / 9500 / System 1000 models 35 / 55 / 65 / 75 (ITX Operating System). These were "I" (Interactive) computers allowing TTY terminals to be connected. Later models supported all industry-standard communication protocols.
V-Series: 8500 (VRX Operating System) and 9800 (VRX/E Operating System). These were "V" series, comparable to mainframes, supporting "Page mode" terminals. The hardware did have similarities with the I-Series while the operating system and user interface was totally different.
In 1990, NCR introduced the System 3000, a seven-level family of computers based on Intel's 386 and 486 CPUs. The majority of the System 3000 range utilised IBM's Micro Channel architecture rather than the more prevalent ISA architecture, and utilised SCSI peripherals as well as the more popular parallel and serial port interfaces, resulting in a premium product with premium pricing. The 3600, through NCR subsidiary Applied Digital Data Systems supported both the Pick Operating System and Prime Information.[15]
The 1970s saw the widespread installations of the Model 770 in National Westminster and Barclays banks throughout the UK, but it was not until the Model 5070, developed at its Dundee plant in Scotland and introduced in 1983 that the company began to make more serious inroads into the ATM market. Subsequent models included the 5084, and 58xx (Personas) series. In early 2008 the company launched its new generation of ATMs—the 662x/663x SelfServ series. NCR currently commands over a third of the entire ATM market, with an estimated $18 trillion being withdrawn from NCR ATMs every year. In addition, NCR's expertise in this field led the company to contract with the U.S. Military to support the Eagle Cash program with customized ATMs.[16]
NCR 5xxx series[edit]
The NCR 5xxx-series is the range of (ATM's) produced by NCR from the early 1980s. Most models were designed and initially manufactured at its Dundee factory in Scotland, but later produced at several other locations around the world.
There have been several distinct generations:

50xx-series; The initial models introduced in 1983 were the 5070 (interior vestibule) and 5080 (Through The Wall or TTW) introduced a number of features which have become standard among ATM's—chiefly the individual functions of the ATM are divided among discrete modules which can be easily removed and replaced for repair or replenishment. The 5080 featured the standard anti-vandal smoked perspex screen which covered the keypad and screen until the cardholder inserted their card. The enhanced 5084 TTW model appeared in 1987, and had an improved anti-vandal fascia and was the first ATM to dispense with the need for the retracting perspex screen. The 5085 offered the first crude deposit function; with the machine supplying the deposit envelopes which were subsequently stored in the machine's safe for subsequent back office processing.
56xx-series; produced from 1991 to 1997. Enhanced functions such as colour displays and improved security and usability functions became available. The introduction of Media Entry Indicators (MEI) which highlight the card entry slot to the customer was also a part of this series. Some 56xx machines produced between 1994–1996 were badged as "AT&T" rather than "NCR", mirroring the company's brief ownership under the telecoms giant in the mid-1990s. 56xx models have included the 5670 (interior lobby cash dispense only), 5675 (interior lobby multifunction—dispense & deposit), 5684 (exterior TTW dispense only), 5688 (exterior TTW drive-up multifunction) and 5685 (exterior TTW multifunction).
58xx-series marketed as Personas from 1998 to the present. These models were characterised by the gradual move towards greater ATM functionality including intelligent, envelopeless deposit by means of automated cheque recognition modules, coin dispense, and electronic cash recognition functions which allows bank customers to deposit cash and cheques with instant processing of the transaction. The 58xx series has also been characterised by the gradual introduction of LCD displays instead of the traditional CRT monitor. Models have included the 5870 (compact interior lobby dispense only), 5873 (interior lobby with cash accept & deposit only), 5874 (Exterior TTW cash dispense), 5875 (Multifunction TTW). The latest TTW versions of the Personas line, introduced in 2000 and marketed as M-Series added functions such as cash recycling, coin dispense, barcode reading, a larger 12" LCD display with touchscreen option, and for the first time, a common wall footprint for both the Multifunction (5886) or single function (5887).

NCR 66XX series[edit]
NCR's 6th generation of ATMs have been noted for the further move towards intelligent deposit and the expansion of secondary functions such as barcode reading.

667x-series marketed under the Personas M-Series brand were introduced in 2005 to the present. These models consist of the 6676 (interior lobby multifunction) and 6674 (through-the-wall multifunction). The outlook design is very different from the Personas model; on the front-access 6676s the front cover is opened upwards which claim to be saving the services area.

NCR Self-Serv 20 & 30 series[edit]
NCR's latest ATM services, introduced in 2008.
This series is a complete redesign of both outlook and technological contents. It is also a cost down product.
Self-Serv 20 series are single-function (e.g. cash-out) ATMs, while Self-Serv 30 series are full-function (cash-out and intelligent deposit) machines.
AT&T[edit]
NCR was acquired September 19, 1991 by AT&T Corporation for $7.4 billion and was joined with Teradata Corporation on February 28, 1992. As an AT&T subsidiary, its 1992 year-end headcount was 53,800 employees and contractors.[17] By 1993, the subsidiary produced a year-end $1.287 billion net loss on $7.265 billion in revenue. The net losses continued in 1994 and 1995, losses that required repeated subsidies from the parent company and resulted in a 1995 year-end headcount of 41,100.[17] During these three years, AT&T was the former NCR's largest customer, accounting for over $1.5 billion in revenue.[17]
On February 15, 1995, the company sold its microelectronics division and storage systems division to Hyundai which named it Symbios Logic. At the time it was the largest purchase of an American company by a Korean company.
For a while, starting in 1994, the subsidiary was renamed AT&T Global Information Solutions, but in 1995, AT&T decided to spin off the company, and in 1996, changed its name back to NCR in preparation for the spin-off. The company outlined its reasons for the spin-off in an Information Statement sent to its stockholders, which cited, in addition to "changes in customer needs" and "need for focused management time and attention", the following:

...[A]dvantages of vertical integration [which had motivated ATT's earlier acquisition of NCR] are outweighed by its costs and disadvantages....[T]o varying degrees, many of the actual and potential customers of Lucent and NCR are or will be competitors of AT&T's communications services businesses. NCR believes that its efforts to target the communications industry have been hindered by the reluctance of AT&T's communications services competitors to make purchases from an AT&T subsidiary.

NCR re-emerged as a stand-alone company on January 1, 1997.
Independence[edit]
One of NCR's first significant acquisitions after becoming independent from AT&T came in July 1997 when it purchased Compris Technologies, a privately held company in Kennesaw, Georgia that produced software for restaurant chains.[18] In November 1997, NCR purchased Dataworks Inc., a 60-person privately held company in San Antonio, Texas.[19]
The Montgomery County Historical Society and NCR Corporation joined in 1998 into an innovative partnership committed to preserving the voluminous NCR Archive. For more than three months in late 1999, trucks traveled between NCR's Building 28 and the Historical Society's Research Center, taking three million pieces of an extraordinary collection to their new home.
In 1998, NCR sold its computer hardware manufacturing assets to Solectron and ceased to produce general-purpose computer systems, focusing instead on the retail and financial industries. In 2000, NCR acquired customer relationship management provider Ceres Integrated Solutions and services company 4Front Technologies. Recent acquisitions include self-service companies Kinetics, InfoAmerica and Galvanon, and software company DecisionPoint.
In April 2003, NCR purchased Copient Technologies, an Indiana-based retail marketing software company.
Under Bill Nuti's management[edit]

In 2006, NCR acquired software company IDVelocity and the ATM manufacturing division of Tidel, a cash security equipment manufacturer specializing in retail markets.
On January 8, 2007, NCR announced its intention to separate into two independent companies by spinning off Teradata to shareholders. Bill Nuti would continue his role as president and CEO of NCR, while Teradata Senior VP Mike Koehler would assume leadership of Teradata.[20] On October 1, 2007, NCR Corporation and Teradata jointly announced the Teradata business unit spin-off was complete, with Michael Koehler as the first CEO of Teradata.[21]
On January 11, 2007, NCR announced plans to restructure its entire ATM manufacturing operations, with 650 jobs at its Dundee plant being cut.[22] A further 450 jobs were cut in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. In 2009, the Dundee manufacturing facility was closed, along with plants in São Paulo and Bucharest, citing global economic conditions as the reason.
NCR extended its self-service portfolio into the digital media market with the January 2007 announcement of NCR Xpress Entertainment, a multichannel entertainment kiosk. NCR’s acquisition of Touch Automation LLC was announced on December 31, 2007.[23]
On October 15, 2008, NCR announced a global reseller partnership with Experticity, a Seattle-based software company.[24]
In 2009, NCR relocated its corporate headquarters from Dayton, Ohio to Duluth, Georgia. This news was shocking as Dayton served as NCR's home for 125 years.[25]
In 2009, NCR became the second largest DVD Kiosk operator in North America with the acquisitions of The New Release and DVD Play. In 2010, NCR completed the acquisition of digital signage company, Netkey.
In August 2011, NCR purchased Radiant Systems, a hospitality and retail systems company, for US$1.2 billion.[26] Radiant's hospitality division turned into a new Hospitality Line of Business within NCR. Radiant's petroleum and convenience retail business became part of its retail line of business. Several Radiant executives remained on board, including Scott Kingsfield, who was a general manager of NCR's Retail Line of Business and left NCR in 2014, and Andy Heyman, who became general manager of NCR's Financial Services line of business.
In August 2012, the company was hit with charges of avoiding U.S. economic sanctions against Syria, greatly affecting its stock price.[27]
In February 2013, NCR completed its acquisition of Retalix (NASDAQ: RTLX), a provider of retail software and services, for approximately $650 million in cash.[28]
In January 2014, NCR completed its acquisition of Digital Insight Corporation, a provider of online and mobile banking to mid-market financial institutions, from equity firm Thoma Bravo, LLC for $1.65 billion in cash.[29]
In September 2016, Mark Benjamin was named president and chief operating officer of NCR. Benjamin is a 24-year veteran of human resources management and will report directly to Bill Nuti.[30]
Products and services[edit]
NCR's R&D activity is split between its three major centres in Atlanta USA (Retail), Dundee, Scotland (Financial Industry), and Waterloo, Ontario. It also has R&D centres in Beijing, Cebu, Philippines, Belgrade / Serbia, Puducherry and Hyderabad in India.[31] NCR also has manufacturing facility in Beijing, Budapest, and also the Indian territory of Puducherry, which is a regional manufacturing and export hub.

The NCR Corporation (originally National Cash Register) is an American computer hardware, software and electronics company that makes self-service kiosks, point-of-sale terminals, automated teller machines, check processing systems, barcode scanners, and business consumables. They also provide IT maintenance support services. NCR had been based in Dayton, Ohio, starting in 1884, but in June 2009 the company sold most of the Dayton properties and moved its headquarters to Metro Atlanta. Currently the headquarters are in unincorporated Gwinnett County, Georgia near Duluth and Alpharetta, Georgia[4][5] Future headquarters are planned for the end of 2016 at Technology Square (adjacent to Georgia Institute of Technology) located in Atlanta, Georgia.
NCR was founded in 1884 and acquired by AT&T in 1991. A restructuring of AT&T in 1996 led to NCR's re-establishment January 1,1997 as a separate company and involved the spin-off of Lucent Technologies from AT&T.[citation needed] NCR is the only AT&T spin-off company that has retained its original name—all the others have either been purchased or renamed following subsequent mergers.[citation needed]

History[edit]
Early years[edit]




Antique three-column full-keyboard cash register






Old National Cash Register on display at the Museo de la Secretaría de Hacienda y Crédito Público in Mexico City


The company began as the National Manufacturing Company of Dayton, Ohio, was established to manufacture and sell the first mechanical cash register invented in 1879 by James Ritty. In 1884, the company and patents were bought by John Henry Patterson and his brother Frank Jefferson Patterson, and the firm was renamed the National Cash Register Company. Patterson formed NCR into one of the first modern American companies by introducing new, aggressive sales methods and business techniques. He established the first sales training school in 1893 and introduced a comprehensive social welfare program for his factory workers.
Other significant figures in the early history of the company were Charles F. Kettering, Thomas J. Watson, Sr. and Edward A. Deeds. Deeds and Kettering went on to found Dayton Engineering Laboratories Company which later became Delco Products Division of General Motors. Watson eventually worked his way up to general sales manager. At an uninspiring sales meeting, Watson interrupted, saying The trouble with every one of us is that we don't think enough. We don't get paid for working with our feet — we get paid for working with our heads. Watson then wrote THINK on the easel.[6] Signs with this motto were erected in factory buildings, sales offices and club rooms during the mid-1890s. "THINK" later became a widely known symbol of IBM. Patterson fired Watson in 1914.[7] Kettering designed the first cash register powered by an electric motor in 1906. Within a few years he developed the Class 1000 register which was in production for 40 years, and the O.K. Telephone Credit Authorization system for verifying credit in department stores.[citation needed]
American Selling Force[edit]
When John H. Patterson and his brother took over the company, cash registers were expensive ($50 USD) and only about a dozen of "Ritty's Incorruptible Cashier" machines were in use. There was little demand for the expensive device, but Patterson believed the product would sell once shopkeepers understood it would drastically decrease theft by salesclerks. He created a sales team known as the "American Selling Force" which worked on commissions and followed a standard sales script, the "N.C.R. Primer." The philosophy was to sell a business function rather than just a piece of machinery. Sales demonstrations were set up in hotels (away from the distractions of the buyer's business) depicting a store interior complete with real merchandise and real cash. The sale prospect was described as the "P.P." or "Probable Purchaser." Once initial objections were swept aside and the P.P. admitted to internal theft losses, the product was demonstrated along with large business charts and diagrams. The deal was sealed with a 25 cent cigar.[8]
Expansion[edit]
NCR expanded quickly and became multi-national in 1888. Between 1893 and 1906 it acquired a number of smaller cash register companies.[9]
By 1911 it had sold one million machines and grown to almost 6,000 employees. Combined with rigorous legal attacks, Patterson's methods enabled the company to fight off bankruptcy, buy-out over 80 of its early competitors, and achieve control of 95% of the U.S. market.
In 1912 the company was found guilty of violating the Sherman Antitrust Act. Patterson, Deeds, Watson and 25 other NCR executives and managers were convicted of illegal anti-competitive sales practices and were sentenced to one year of imprisonment. Their convictions were unpopular with the public due to the efforts of Patterson and Watson to help those affected by the Dayton, Ohio floods of 1913, but efforts to have them pardoned by President Woodrow Wilson were unsuccessful. However, their convictions were overturned on appeal in 1915 on the grounds that important defense evidence should have been admitted.

Two million units were sold by 1922, the year John Patterson died. In 1925 NCR went public with an issue of $55 million in stock, at that time the largest public offering in United States history. During the first World War NCR manufactured fuses and aircraft instrumentation, and during World War II built aero-engines, bomb sights and code-breaking machines, including the American bombe designed by Joseph Desch.
Post-war[edit]




NCR 304 Computer


Building on its wartime experience with secret communication systems, high speed counters and cryptanalytic equipment,[10] NCR became a major post-war force in developing new computing and communications technology.
In 1953 chemists Barrett K. Green and Lowell Schleicher of NCR in Dayton submitted a patent "Pressure responsive record materials" for a carbon-less copy paper. This became US Patent 2,730,457 and was commercialized as "NCR Paper."
In February 1953, the company acquired the Computer Research Corporation (CRC),[11] after which it created a specialized electronics division. In 1956, NCR introduced its first electronic device, the Class 29 Post-Tronic, a bank machine using magnetic stripe technology. With the General Electric Company (known now just as GE ), the company manufactured its first transistor-based computer in 1957, the NCR 304. Also in the 1950s NCR introduced MICR (magnetic ink character recognition)[12] and the NCR 3100 accounting machines.[13]
In 1962, NCR introduced the NCR-315 Electronic Data Processing System which included the CRAM storage device, the first automated mass storage alternative to magnetic tape libraries accessed manually by computer operators. The NCR 390 and 500 computers were also offered to customers who did not need the full power of the 315. The NCR 390 accepted four types of input: magnetic ledger cards, punched cards, punched tape, and keyboard entry, with a tape read speed of 400 characters a second.[13] The company's first all-integrated circuit computer was the Century 100 of 1968. The Century 200 was added in 1970. The line was extended through the Century 300.[14] The Century series was followed by the Criterion series in 1976, NCR's first virtual machine system.
During this period, NCR also produced the 605 minicomputer for in-house use. It was the compute engine for the 399 and 499 accounting machines, several generations of in-store and in-bank controllers, and the 82xx/90xx IMOS COBOL systems. The 605 also powered peripheral controllers, including the 658 disk subsystem and the 721 communications processor.
By 1986, the number of mainframe makers had dropped from 8 (IBM and the "seven dwarfs") to 6 (IBM and the "BUNCH") to 4: IBM, Unisys, NCR, and Control Data Corporation.
The company adopted the name NCR Corporation in 1974.
Small computers[edit]
In 1982, NCR became involved in open systems architecture. Its first such system was the UNIX-powered TOWER 16/32, the success of which (approximately 100,000 were sold) established NCR as a pioneer in bringing industry standards and open systems architecture to the computer market. These 5000-series systems were based on Motorola 68k CPUs and supported NCR's proprietary transaction processing system TMX, which was mainly used by financial institutions. This product line also saw the first time NCR had offered its products through other than its own direct sales channels since the early 1900s. Formally added to its company structure in March 1984, NCR's OEM System's Division spearheaded the design, sales revenue and market awareness and acceptance of NCR's Tower family. Part of the cause of this success was the decision by NCR senior management to hire reseller industry veterans for key positions within the fledgling operation and have that unit work with, but not answerable to, NCR's traditional management structure. The industry shift from minicomputers brought personnel with minicomputer and reseller backgrounds such as the division head, Dan Kiegler (ex-Datapoint marketing), marketing manager and later Director of Field Sales, Dave Lang (ex-DEC reseller marketing director and salesperson) and other critical contributors at corporate levels; who then hired a complementary field sales organization primarily made up of proven people from DEC, Wang and other faltering minicomputer firms.

In the 1980s, NCR sold various PC compatible AT-class computers, like the small NCR-3390 (called an "intelligent terminal"). They proposed a customized version of MS-DOS named NCR-DOS, which for example offered support for switching the CPU between 6, 8 or 10 MHz speeds. The computers featured an improved CGA adapter, the NGA, which had a 640×400 text mode more suitable for business uses than the original 640×200 mode, with characters drawn using single-pixel-wide lines, giving an appearance similar to that of classic IBM 3270 terminals. The additional four-color 640×400 graphical mode was identical to CGA's 320×200 mode from a programming point of view.
NCR also manufactured two proprietary series of mini-to-midrange computers:
I-Series: 9010 (IDPS Operating System), 9020 and 9100 (IMOS Operating System), 9040 and 9050 (IRX Operating System), 9200 / 9300 / 9300IP / 9400 / 9400IP / 9500 / System 1000 models 35 / 55 / 65 / 75 (ITX Operating System). These were "I" (Interactive) computers allowing TTY terminals to be connected. Later models supported all industry-standard communication protocols.
V-Series: 8500 (VRX Operating System) and 9800 (VRX/E Operating System). These were "V" series, comparable to mainframes, supporting "Page mode" terminals. The hardware did have similarities with the I-Series while the operating system and user interface was totally different.
In 1990, NCR introduced the System 3000, a seven-level family of computers based on Intel's 386 and 486 CPUs. The majority of the System 3000 range utilised IBM's Micro Channel architecture rather than the more prevalent ISA architecture, and utilised SCSI peripherals as well as the more popular parallel and serial port interfaces, resulting in a premium product with premium pricing. The 3600, through NCR subsidiary Applied Digital Data Systems supported both the Pick Operating System and Prime Information.[15]
The 1970s saw the widespread installations of the Model 770 in National Westminster and Barclays banks throughout the UK, but it was not until the Model 5070, developed at its Dundee plant in Scotland and introduced in 1983 that the company began to make more serious inroads into the ATM market. Subsequent models included the 5084, and 58xx (Personas) series. In early 2008 the company launched its new generation of ATMs—the 662x/663x SelfServ series. NCR currently commands over a third of the entire ATM market, with an estimated $18 trillion being withdrawn from NCR ATMs every year. In addition, NCR's expertise in this field led the company to contract with the U.S. Military to support the Eagle Cash program with customized ATMs.[16]
NCR 5xxx series[edit]
The NCR 5xxx-series is the range of (ATM's) produced by NCR from the early 1980s. Most models were designed and initially manufactured at its Dundee factory in Scotland, but later produced at several other locations around the world.
There have been several distinct generations:

50xx-series; The initial models introduced in 1983 were the 5070 (interior vestibule) and 5080 (Through The Wall or TTW) introduced a number of features which have become standard among ATM's—chiefly the individual functions of the ATM are divided among discrete modules which can be easily removed and replaced for repair or replenishment. The 5080 featured the standard anti-vandal smoked perspex screen which covered the keypad and screen until the cardholder inserted their card. The enhanced 5084 TTW model appeared in 1987, and had an improved anti-vandal fascia and was the first ATM to dispense with the need for the retracting perspex screen. The 5085 offered the first crude deposit function; with the machine supplying the deposit envelopes which were subsequently stored in the machine's safe for subsequent back office processing.
56xx-series; produced from 1991 to 1997. Enhanced functions such as colour displays and improved security and usability functions became available. The introduction of Media Entry Indicators (MEI) which highlight the card entry slot to the customer was also a part of this series. Some 56xx machines produced between 1994–1996 were badged as "AT&T" rather than "NCR", mirroring the company's brief ownership under the telecoms giant in the mid-1990s. 56xx models have included the 5670 (interior lobby cash dispense only), 5675 (interior lobby multifunction—dispense & deposit), 5684 (exterior TTW dispense only), 5688 (exterior TTW drive-up multifunction) and 5685 (exterior TTW multifunction).
58xx-series marketed as Personas from 1998 to the present. These models were characterised by the gradual move towards greater ATM functionality including intelligent, envelopeless deposit by means of automated cheque recognition modules, coin dispense, and electronic cash recognition functions which allows bank customers to deposit cash and cheques with instant processing of the transaction. The 58xx series has also been characterised by the gradual introduction of LCD displays instead of the traditional CRT monitor. Models have included the 5870 (compact interior lobby dispense only), 5873 (interior lobby with cash accept & deposit only), 5874 (Exterior TTW cash dispense), 5875 (Multifunction TTW). The latest TTW versions of the Personas line, introduced in 2000 and marketed as M-Series added functions such as cash recycling, coin dispense, barcode reading, a larger 12" LCD display with touchscreen option, and for the first time, a common wall footprint for both the Multifunction (5886) or single function (5887).

NCR 66XX series[edit]
NCR's 6th generation of ATMs have been noted for the further move towards intelligent deposit and the expansion of secondary functions such as barcode reading.

667x-series marketed under the Personas M-Series brand were introduced in 2005 to the present. These models consist of the 6676 (interior lobby multifunction) and 6674 (through-the-wall multifunction). The outlook design is very different from the Personas model; on the front-access 6676s the front cover is opened upwards which claim to be saving the services area.

NCR Self-Serv 20 & 30 series[edit]
NCR's latest ATM services, introduced in 2008.
This series is a complete redesign of both outlook and technological contents. It is also a cost down product.
Self-Serv 20 series are single-function (e.g. cash-out) ATMs, while Self-Serv 30 series are full-function (cash-out and intelligent deposit) machines.
AT&T[edit]
NCR was acquired September 19, 1991 by AT&T Corporation for $7.4 billion and was joined with Teradata Corporation on February 28, 1992. As an AT&T subsidiary, its 1992 year-end headcount was 53,800 employees and contractors.[17] By 1993, the subsidiary produced a year-end $1.287 billion net loss on $7.265 billion in revenue. The net losses continued in 1994 and 1995, losses that required repeated subsidies from the parent company and resulted in a 1995 year-end headcount of 41,100.[17] During these three years, AT&T was the former NCR's largest customer, accounting for over $1.5 billion in revenue.[17]
On February 15, 1995, the company sold its microelectronics division and storage systems division to Hyundai which named it Symbios Logic. At the time it was the largest purchase of an American company by a Korean company.
For a while, starting in 1994, the subsidiary was renamed AT&T Global Information Solutions, but in 1995, AT&T decided to spin off the company, and in 1996, changed its name back to NCR in preparation for the spin-off. The company outlined its reasons for the spin-off in an Information Statement sent to its stockholders, which cited, in addition to "changes in customer needs" and "need for focused management time and attention", the following:

...[A]dvantages of vertical integration [which had motivated ATT's earlier acquisition of NCR] are outweighed by its costs and disadvantages....[T]o varying degrees, many of the actual and potential customers of Lucent and NCR are or will be competitors of AT&T's communications services businesses. NCR believes that its efforts to target the communications industry have been hindered by the reluctance of AT&T's communications services competitors to make purchases from an AT&T subsidiary.

NCR re-emerged as a stand-alone company on January 1, 1997.
Independence[edit]
One of NCR's first significant acquisitions after becoming independent from AT&T came in July 1997 when it purchased Compris Technologies, a privately held company in Kennesaw, Georgia that produced software for restaurant chains.[18] In November 1997, NCR purchased Dataworks Inc., a 60-person privately held company in San Antonio, Texas.[19]
The Montgomery County Historical Society and NCR Corporation joined in 1998 into an innovative partnership committed to preserving the voluminous NCR Archive. For more than three months in late 1999, trucks traveled between NCR's Building 28 and the Historical Society's Research Center, taking three million pieces of an extraordinary collection to their new home.
In 1998, NCR sold its computer hardware manufacturing assets to Solectron and ceased to produce general-purpose computer systems, focusing instead on the retail and financial industries. In 2000, NCR acquired customer relationship management provider Ceres Integrated Solutions and services company 4Front Technologies. Recent acquisitions include self-service companies Kinetics, InfoAmerica and Galvanon, and software company DecisionPoint.
In April 2003, NCR purchased Copient Technologies, an Indiana-based retail marketing software company.
Under Bill Nuti's management[edit]

In 2006, NCR acquired software company IDVelocity and the ATM manufacturing division of Tidel, a cash security equipment manufacturer specializing in retail markets.
On January 8, 2007, NCR announced its intention to separate into two independent companies by spinning off Teradata to shareholders. Bill Nuti would continue his role as president and CEO of NCR, while Teradata Senior VP Mike Koehler would assume leadership of Teradata.[20] On October 1, 2007, NCR Corporation and Teradata jointly announced the Teradata business unit spin-off was complete, with Michael Koehler as the first CEO of Teradata.[21]
On January 11, 2007, NCR announced plans to restructure its entire ATM manufacturing operations, with 650 jobs at its Dundee plant being cut.[22] A further 450 jobs were cut in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. In 2009, the Dundee manufacturing facility was closed, along with plants in São Paulo and Bucharest, citing global economic conditions as the reason.
NCR extended its self-service portfolio into the digital media market with the January 2007 announcement of NCR Xpress Entertainment, a multichannel entertainment kiosk. NCR’s acquisition of Touch Automation LLC was announced on December 31, 2007.[23]
On October 15, 2008, NCR announced a global reseller partnership with Experticity, a Seattle-based software company.[24]
In 2009, NCR relocated its corporate headquarters from Dayton, Ohio to Duluth, Georgia. This news was shocking as Dayton served as NCR's home for 125 years.[25]
In 2009, NCR became the second largest DVD Kiosk operator in North America with the acquisitions of The New Release and DVD Play. In 2010, NCR completed the acquisition of digital signage company, Netkey.
In August 2011, NCR purchased Radiant Systems, a hospitality and retail systems company, for US$1.2 billion.[26] Radiant's hospitality division turned into a new Hospitality Line of Business within NCR. Radiant's petroleum and convenience retail business became part of its retail line of business. Several Radiant executives remained on board, including Scott Kingsfield, who was a general manager of NCR's Retail Line of Business and left NCR in 2014, and Andy Heyman, who became general manager of NCR's Financial Services line of business.
In August 2012, the company was hit with charges of avoiding U.S. economic sanctions against Syria, greatly affecting its stock price.[27]
In February 2013, NCR completed its acquisition of Retalix (NASDAQ: RTLX), a provider of retail software and services, for approximately $650 million in cash.[28]
In January 2014, NCR completed its acquisition of Digital Insight Corporation, a provider of online and mobile banking to mid-market financial institutions, from equity firm Thoma Bravo, LLC for $1.65 billion in cash.[29]
In September 2016, Mark Benjamin was named president and chief operating officer of NCR. Benjamin is a 24-year veteran of human resources management and will report directly to Bill Nuti.[30]
Products and services[edit]
NCR's R&D activity is split between its three major centres in Atlanta USA (Retail), Dundee, Scotland (Financial Industry), and Waterloo, Ontario. It also has R&D centres in Beijing, Cebu, Philippines, Belgrade / Serbia, Puducherry and Hyderabad in India.[31] NCR also has manufacturing facility in Beijing, Budapest, and also the Indian territory of Puducherry, which is a regional manufacturing and export hub.

Bill Nuti

Chairman and CEO 


















Vision 2020By 2020, we will all live in a connected economy. According to Gartner, 75% of all global businesses will have in-depth digital transformations underway, largely involving channel transformation and integration - but - only 30% will be successful. Most companies are unprepared for the future.Bill Nuti has transformed NCR to help businesses address these challenges. As experts in digital transformation, channel integration and transformation, and the overall omni-channel movement, learn how NCR is helping increase the odds of success for businesses across multiple industries and around the globe.Bill is highly respected for his leadership skills and acclaimed for his vision and expertise in transforming and reinventing companies for sustainable and profitable growth. Since joining NCR in 2005, Bill orchestrated one of the most successful business reinventions in recent history, while transforming the way consumers connect, interact and transact with business. With over a century of legacy and culture at its back, Bill made critical decisions to reinvent NCR over the long term, including shifting the core business model of NCR from hardware to more software and SaaS, acquiring several high-growth companies, and expanding into new markets, adjacencies and underpenetrated emerging geographies.As the architect of NCR's visionary strategy to lead the omni-channel revolution, Bill is driving strategic investments in mobile, cloud, big data, and the Internet of Things in order to provide solutions that help today's enterprises respond to disruptive changes in globalization, digitization, consumerism, and technology. NCR enables nearly 700 million transactions per day and is a market-leader across all industries they serve.Bill's vision to build a best-in-class global organization has not gone unnoticed. He has been heralded by government officials and news organizations for creating STEM jobs across the globe and is currently in the process of creating a world-class corporate headquarters and innovation hub that is becoming the Silicon Valley of the east. Throughout his tenure, NCR has been recognized for its humanitarian contributions with the Red Cross Good Neighbor Award and its commitment to employee training and development with the American Society for Training and Development (ASTD) BEST Award. And in 2016 Forbes Magazine named NCR one of America's Best Employers.Prior to joining NCR as CEO in 2005, Bill served as president and CEO of Symbol Technologies. He led a challenging and highly successful turnaround of Symbol, returning the company to profitability for the first time in five years, and increasing revenue growth by 24% from 2002 to 2004. In 2005, he was recognized as the "Best Turnaround Executive" by the American Business Awards. Bill joined Symbol following more than 10 years at Cisco Systems.Bill is a frequent speaker at high-profile business and technology events. He also is an established enterprise and business policy leader in Washington, D.C., where he founded a CEO policy forum on tax reform and competitiveness. He also spoke at the White House Forum on "Strategy for American Innovation."Bill is a member of the Georgia Institute of Technology advisory board, a Long Island University trustee and serves on the board of directors for United Continental Holdings and Coach, Inc. In 2015, he was named Atlanta Business Chronicle's Most Admired CEO.Omni-channel is becoming a horizontal opportunity across all industries, in every geography, and for all tiers of customers - including small business. As a pioneer in the channel integration and transformation space - both physical and digital - NCR is helping businesses evolve their legacy processes and effectively engage digital consumers at every touchpoint in the consumer journey. - Bill Nuti

We will also be discussing certain non-GAAP financial information such as free cash flow and results excluding the impact of pension and other items. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures, and other information concerning such measures are included in the presentation materials and in our earnings release. These are also available on the Investor Relations section of NCR's website. A replay of the call will be available later today on our website, ncr.com.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Nuti.
William R. Nuti - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Gavin. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We had a solid third quarter, as consistent execution by the NCR team generated results in line with the outlook we provided in July. We achieved these results in the face of a worsening currency environment, continued challenges in China and Russia, and more volatile capital markets. Despite these headwinds, we drove solid performance across our businesses, and remain on target to achieve our full year goals for earnings and free cash flow.
Our growing $1.8 billion software and cloud business, global diversity of industries and markets, along with great employees and partners are the keys to NCR's success.
Turning now to slide number three. Q3 revenue was down 2% on an as-reported basis. This was lower than the revenue guidance we provided on our Q2 call due to an additional $30 million of negative FX headwinds during August and September. On a constant-currency basis, revenue was up 5%. And at the end of Q3, recurring revenue represented 42% of total revenue, up 8% constant currency. Operational gross margin was 29.4% in Q3. This was up 50 basis points compared to last year, primarily due to higher software revenue. Q3 NPOI was $218 million, up 7% on an as-reported basis and up 15% on a constant-currency basis.

Non-GAAP EPS was $0.78, up 16% as reported and up 25% constant currency. Free cash flow, an area where our investors have been looking for continued progress has been a great success year-to-date. And we are on track to achieve our updated full-year guidance. Free cash flow, excluding $93 million in recoveries related to the Fox River in Q3 2014, was up $67 million compared to last year. We have generated $225 million in free cash flow year-to-date, which is an increase of $141 million compared to the first nine months of last year.
I am now on slide number four, where I'll review our Q3 and year-to-date software-related revenues. Software-related revenue was up 5% on a constant-currency basis year-over-year and continues to grow faster than our other revenue streams, especially our cloud business. Our growth in cloud remains a high point in our overall results, where constant-currency revenue is up 7% in Q3 and now up 12% year-to-date constant currency. Growing our software related revenue streams remains a top area of strategic focus as we look to improve our overall margins in a rapidly expanding available market for software and cloud solutions.
Finally, on slide number five, I'll spend a few moments running through some of the key highlights for Q3. Our results for the quarter were driven by our global leadership in our verticals, along with solid execution across NCR. This includes operating margin expansion in each of our businesses. Currency volatility along with China and Russia continue to be our primary challenges, but we are navigating through them. Our Q3 earnings were in line with our outlook, and we've remained on track to achieve our full-year goals.
Other key highlights include the performance of the each of our businesses, which were generally balanced with the exception of Financial Services who was taking the brunt of FX and the China-Russia impact. That being said, we don't want to mask the solid performance of this division when you exclude China and Russia, where Financial Services delivered 3% year-over-year constant-currency growth.
Our Financial Services business continues to generate strong demand in important strategic areas such as software, cloud, branch transformation, and security application offers. In retail, we are encouraged by the moderate improvement in the industry dynamics, in particular, retail spending and how those dollars are being allocated. Growth in Q3 was promising, with revenues up 14% on a constant-currency basis.
I am generally pleased with Retail's performance to-date this year and we'll continue to innovate and provide solutions to our Retail customers and enable them to run their businesses more efficiently, to enhance flexibility and omni-channel solutions. In Hospitality, higher software and cloud revenues once again drove year-over-year operating margin expansion and 8% constant-currency revenue growth. This business has made significant progress over the past several quarters, and we are pleased with the trajectory going forward.
Another important highlight is our total software revenue, which was up 5% on a constant-currency basis during the quarter with continued strong growth in cloud and important wins across our verticals.
We've made additional progress executing our transformation to a hardware-enabled, software-driven company. We also continue to build a better NCR through sales and services transformation and our company-wide restructuring efforts while benefiting these initiatives. Finally, strong year-to-date free cash flow places us well ahead of last year.
In summary, we had another important and solid quarter and are on track to achieve our full-year targets. I am pleased with the execution of the NCR team. We are driving growth across all of our businesses and are focused on finishing the year strong.

Finally, with regard to recent industry consolidation, we believe the merging of legacy hardware businesses is a good thing for our industry and an important validation of the business strategy we embarked upon five years ago. NCR is a highly diversified global business, providing a suite of omni-channel solutions and services to customers in a variety of industries, including financial services, retail, and hospitality.
As a true omni-channel solutions provider in financial services, NCR, unlike its ATM competitors, bridges all banking channels and is actively helping top financial institutions around the globe transform their businesses into asset-light, technology-heavy enterprises that engage with their customers both physically and digitally. In short, we feel extremely well-positioned, and we'll continue to stay laser-focused on our customers and strategic execution.
Now, I will like to turn the call over to Bob to review our performance by segment and our financials. Bob?
Robert P. Fishman - SVP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer
Thank you, Bill. I'll start on slide six, which shows our Q3 operational results on an as-reported and constant-currency basis, which Bill previously discussed. We experienced unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations during Q3 with impacts of approximately $120 million in revenue, $17 million in NPOI, and $0.06 in EPS.
FX impact on revenue came in higher than originally expected with an additional $30 million of headwinds from our guidance at the beginning of the quarter. Revenue was higher by 5%, NPOI was higher by 15%, and non-GAAP EPS was higher by 25%, all on a constant-currency basis.
The next slide shows our Q3 GAAP results. The increase in GAAP results is primarily related to the impact of the restructuring program recorded in Q3 2014 as compared to Q3 2015. The restructuring plan charge included in income from operations was $12 million in Q3 2015 and $127 million in Q3 2014.
On slide eight, you will see our Financial Services Q3 results. On a constant-currency basis, revenue was flat due to improvements in the Americas, South Pacific, and Middle East Africa, offset by declines in China and Russia. Excluding China and Russia, revenue was up 3% on a constant-currency basis.
Operating margin was up 50 basis points at 16.5%. The improvement was due to a favorable mix of revenue and expense management. We remain focused on profitability through our transformation initiatives, mix shifts, and operating margin expansion. We continued to see an increase in our branch transformation revenue, which grew 94% year-over-year led by North America.
Constant-currency backlog position grew double digits, driven by branch transformation and CxBanking, but along with this, inherently slower conversion rates are affecting short-term revenue. And finally, industry consolidation, as Bill mentioned, is signaling positive indicators for future demand.
The next slide shows our Retail Solutions Q3 results. Revenue was up 7% as reported and up 14% on a constant-currency basis due to improvements in all regions. Operating margin was 8.2% and increased 330 basis points. Retail operating income increased from the prior year due to higher revenue, including more software-related revenue and expense management.
The retail market continues to show signs of improvement, with some regions experiencing slower growth and additional FX headwinds. We are having success gaining new competitive key accounts globally, and we received the Supplier of the Year award for outstanding service from the Australian supermarket Coles.
Lastly, we are pleased with the positive reaction our Retail ONE omni-commerce platform is continuing to receive from the market and our customers.
Turning to the next slide, Hospitality revenue was up 8% on a constant-currency basis, driven by improvements in the higher-margin revenue streams. Operating margin performance was 16.9%, up 80 basis points, due to this higher software related revenue, including cloud and professional services revenue. We continued to see success in the SMB market with 4% revenue growth and 8% software-related revenue growth.

We are pleased to report that we have deployed 40,000 application sites in the managed SaaS application family, which includes 9,000 Pulse Real-Time application sites. Software-related revenues continue to drive growth for our Hospitality business, which are up 20% on a constant-currency basis in Q3 2015, which includes cloud revenue up 25% on a constant-currency basis.
Next, looking at our Emerging Industry business on slide number 11, revenue was up 2% year-over-year and up 11% on a constant-currency basis, driven by an increase in telecom and technology constant-currency revenue. Operating margin was 10.8%, up 90 basis points, driven by higher services margins.
On slide 12, you can see the solid growth in cloud revenue on an as-reported basis. On a constant-currency basis, cloud was up 7% and software-related revenue grew 5%. Hardware was down 5% as reported, up 4% on a constant-currency basis, and other services, which includes our traditional break/fix business, was down by 1% as reported, up 7% on a constant-currency basis.
On slide 13, you can see free cash flow for the quarter. Free cash flow for Q3 2015 was $106 million, compared to $132 million in the prior quarter. Excluding $93 million in recoveries related to the Fox River in Q3 2014, the increase was mainly due to higher operating cash inflows. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow was $225 million, compared to a free cash flow of $84 million in the prior year. We are maintaining our full year 2015 free cash flow guidance range of $350 million to $400 million.
Slide 14 is an update on the restructuring plan. We incurred a pre-tax charge of $36 million in the first nine months of 2015 and expect to incur an additional pre-tax charge of $20 million to $28 million in Q4 2015. The cash impact was $51 million in the first nine months of 2015 and we expect to pay an additional $20 million to $35 million in Q4 2015.
As far as savings generated, we achieved $18 million in 2014 and estimate approximately $70 million in 2015 and approximately $105 million 2016. As previously communicated, we expect approximately 50% of the savings to benefit NPOI with the remainder reinvested in the business. We continue to evaluate additional opportunities in connection with this restructuring plan and we'll consider implementing initiatives that would generate incremental savings for the company.
Slide 15 shows our net debt to EBITDA metric, where we closed Q3 with a leverage ratio of 2.9 times. This was benefited from our free cash flow generation in the quarter, which has allowed us to achieve our year-end goal of under three times leverage one quarter earlier than expected.
Slide 16 shows our full year 2015 guidance. FX headwinds continue. Full year revenue headwinds of approximately $420 million are now expected, higher by $65 million from guidance in July and $120 million from beginning of the year guidance.
NPOI's FX headwinds are still expected to be $70 million to $75 million, up $20 million from the beginning of the year guidance; and EPS FX headwinds are $0.10 higher than the beginning of the year guidance. We are decreasing our constant-currency revenue guidance to 3% to 4% due to continued challenges in certain developing markets and slower backlog rollouts pushing into 2016.
We are narrowing our NPOI range to $830 million to $840 million, at the lower end of our previous range, primarily due to the lower revenue and the additional $20 million of negative foreign currency impact from our beginning of the year guidance. Additionally, we are narrowing our non-GAAP EPS range to $2.70 to $2.80, which is at the high end of our previous range due to other expense, effective tax rate, and share count being lower than previously expected. This guidance now includes an expected OIE of $204 million, a tax rate of 24% to 25%, and a share count of 173 million.

Slide 17 shows our updated 2015 full year revenue guidance by segment. We now expect Financial Services to grow 1% to 2% on a constant-currency basis, down from prior guidance due to continued challenges in China and Russia and slower backlog rollouts. We now expect Retail Solutions to grow 5% to 6%, Hospitality to grow 5% to 7%, and Emerging Industries to grow 5% to 7%, all on a constant-currency basis.
On slide 18 you will find our Q4 2015 guidance. I expect as-reported revenue will be in the range of $1.687 billion to $1.717 billion, which includes a negative FX impact of roughly 5% compared to the prior year.
Revenue is expected to be flat to up 2% on a constant-currency basis. I expect NPOI to be negatively impacted by roughly $19 million of FX. Based on the midpoint of the range, NPOI growth is expected to be up 7% on an as-reported basis and up 15% on a constant-currency basis.
Now, I'll open up the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you very much. We'll take our first question from Paul Coster from JPMorgan.
Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Well, first of all, it's nice to see another decent quarter, but of course the question which everyone will be asking is what about the strategic review; what can you say about that please, Bill?
William R. Nuti - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Paul. First of all, I appreciate the kind opening. On the strategic review, Paul, that is ongoing. We continue to comprehensively look at all of the alternatives we have as a board. We are balancing both running the business responsibly and, to your point, making our commitments, while also, again, with a lot of rigor looking at every single alternative we have and really giving it enough time for analysis and review. So, it is ongoing; I anticipate it will be ongoing now for the next few months, and we'll see where it lands. But right now, there's been no change in that particular analysis.
Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Bill, does it have to come to a point of completion or are there items that may fall out of the strategic review that can be executed upon along the way, and I'm particularly interested in Bob's comments about restructuring and how there may be some additional restructuring opportunities ahead, which didn't sound like they were part of the strategic review, but I suspect there's some relationship there?
William R. Nuti - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yes, Paul. You will likely see some aspects of the strategic review fall out into our near-term actions, and we can't get into that on the phone today, but certainly if there is a smart thing for us to do, we're going to do it. Is there an official ending to the process? I think the answer is yes. But, again, I would tell you my learnings out of this is the following: one, when you take on that kind of a project, it's a 15-hour workday and a lot of weekends so that you can responsibly run the business.
And secondarily, the depth to which one needs to go for each alternative to give your board a thorough view is a lot of analysis. It will not stop our board, however, from taking immediate action on areas that make sense, and one of them, Paul, may be some amount of additional restructuring.
One of the benefits for Bob and I of going through the process has been we've had access to a number of exceptional resources that have looked inside of our company, at a level of depth that would normally cost us millions of dollars of consulting fees that, I think fortunately for us, we didn't have to bear; and we're going to take their advice in some circumstances but make sure it makes sense for the business. And we may decide to extend the restructuring initiative in Q4 and Q1, but we're not quite there yet.

Robert P. Fishman - SVP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer
Ian, I would say to that point is we are definitely focused on fast-payback opportunities that are attractive to investors. As we continue to focus on higher margin, higher growth opportunities, end-of-lifing products, as an example, those continue to be areas – how do we become more efficient. That's all work that continues to be done, and we wanted to leave open the opportunity that if we did see some attractive fast payback opportunities, that would be available to us.
Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay, great. Thanks. I'll hop back on the queue.
Operator
We'll go next to Ian Zaffino from Oppenheimer.
Ian A. Zaffino - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Hi, great. Thank you very much. Question will be on the pushout of the backlogs. Is that just an emerging markets phenomenon or are you seeing that in the developed markets and maybe what areas of the business are you seeing that in? Thanks.
William R. Nuti - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Ian. It really is primarily in the Financial Services area, so I'll ask Andy Heyman to comment. Andy?
Andrew S. Heyman - Senior Vice President, VP-NCR Financial Services
Yeah. Hi, Ian. In terms of where the backlog right now is a little slower than normal. And just to give you some statistics on this, we had earlier in the year anticipated some reduction in the typical backlog conversions based on our contracts were increasingly in the areas of higher branch transformation commitments, higher enterprise software commitments, and higher areas in terms of our refreshed ATM fleet, called the 80 series.
And we had planned in the back half of the year for about a 50-basis-point reduction – I'm sorry, a 500-basis-point reduction in a typical backlog conversion. So think of that as, entering a quarter, if you've got $800 million of backlog where there is 50% conversion, we had planned it for about 500 basis points less. What we're seeing is about a 1,000-basis-point less conversion because of those three areas.
There is a higher percentage of more innovative products in the queue right now. The customers continue to try to get ready for, if you will, as they come out of R&D into the implementation cycles, and those go through typical certifications that can have delays; there could be some R&D areas where we're tightening up, et cetera. So that's what's led to slower conversions. And as we look into next year, we think we'll start to revert to the mean, but that is what's causing the backlog delays that you're seeing right now.
Ian A. Zaffino - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay. Thank you. And then, next question maybe be more...
Robert P. Fishman - SVP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer
I would add just to that point. Sorry, Ian, I would add to that point, Andy, that the backlog growth – constant currency is up double digits going into Q4, and I expect it will continue to be strong going into 2016, so while it's rolling out more slowly because of the focus on these more innovative solutions, the backlog growth is there.
William R. Nuti - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. It's a great point, Bob. Thanks.
Ian A. Zaffino - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay. And then, I guess the follow-up question will be – maybe this is a semantic question. But when you talk about strategic alternatives, and maybe where we're heading towards, it seems maybe like a restructuring is most likely. So given the advanced stages of this process, is it still appropriate to call it strategic alternatives. Because like I said, it would stimulate something probably larger than just a restructuring. And, again, maybe we're talking semantics, but I guess my definition, or I think most people's definition of strategic alternatives would be greater than just a restructuring of what's just a cost cuts or a realignment of some product offerings. Maybe if you could help us understand that a little bit better or what your definition might be?

William R. Nuti - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I apologize. And – if it came off where we were giving you the impression that the ongoing review would only result in additional restructuring. If that were the case, we would shut it down and move in that direction. That is not the case. All of the – the areas that I have previously gone over with you are still under review, and possible outcomes well beyond just restructuring.
Ian A. Zaffino - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay. All right. That's great. Thank you for the clarification. I appreciate this and...
William R. Nuti - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. No worries.
Ian A. Zaffino - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay. Thank you very much.

We'll go next to Meghna Ladha from Susquehanna International Group.
Hamza Fodderwala - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
Hi. This is Hamza Fodderwala in for Meghna Ladha. I wanted to get a sense of – you had cited headwinds from Russia and China of, roughly, I think, 200 bps earlier this year in your guidance. What exactly accelerated the weakness here?
William R. Nuti - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Andy, can you take that please?
Andrew S. Heyman - Senior Vice President, VP-NCR Financial Services
Yeah. The – in terms of Russia and China, they each have unique situations in terms – if you're referring to what's causing those headwinds. In China, what we've seen is a significant tightening under the government's secure-and-control mandate to reduce spending the banks are allowed to invest in with companies that build systems outside of China, that have R&D that are not indigenous to Chinese companies. So that has caused banks to significantly reduce spending with companies that are not Chinese companies and instead point it towards local companies. So that's really accelerated the headwind in China.
In Russia, a very different story. First of all, the macroeconomic conditions in Russia have been very challenged for local financial institutions there, and then second of all, we have a lot of contracts in U.S. dollar in Russia. And when you have a contract in U.S. dollar, as the dollar has strengthened significantly over the last 18 months, it's made it much more difficult for a financial institution in Russia to be able to afford our solution. So it's a bit of a double whammy that's going on in Russia right now.
Hamza Fodderwala - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
Okay. And then just to follow up, I know you mentioned obviously a potential merger between a couple of your competitors. Just wanted to get your sense on the landscape should this transaction go through, and do you think it could help stabilize the pricing environment in Europe?
William R. Nuti - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
I'll make a couple of comments and then ask Andy to give his point of view. First of all, I think on the surface, the strategic rationale of two legacy ATM providers coming together actually makes very good sense, especially given that there really isn't a lot of geographic overlap for their market presence, so on the surface I think it makes sense.
Now, both of their CEOs have talked about the importance they place on investing in software, in cloud, in digital banking, and using the combination perhaps to build a balance sheet to be able to invest in where customers in the market that they serve and we serve are going.
Now, of course, we've been through that process for the last five years, so we have a unique point of view on that. I think the challenge for them, if there are challenges, are obvious to all of us in that a merger of that size is extremely difficult to pull off, and I don't envy the geographic proximity issues, the cultural differences between the two companies, the product overlap issues that they'll inevitably have to face, in choosing which product lives and which product does not. The services infrastructure issues that they'll have to face. Clearly, the issue around where they decide to make cost cuts in terms of employees and R&D, and there's a lot of fundamental issues that could, if they do not execute well, slow them down in a market that's moving very, very fast.

So, again, on the surface I think it's a good thing. Relative to the challenges for us, of course, we are now with many of our acquisitions and the assets we have behind us, where they want to go, laser-focused on innovation, moving forward in a rapid fashion, and I think putting ourselves into a great position in the market. Andy, any other comments?
Andrew S. Heyman - Senior Vice President, VP-NCR Financial Services
Yeah. Let me say a couple of things in – at an enterprise level, obviously one of the companies has a retail business. So I want Michael Bayer to also get a chance to say a couple of words, but it's largely about Financial Services with this merger possibility.
First of all, we were not surprised by this news at all. It had been something that we felt might make sense for a number of years for all the reasons Bill outlined. What our customers are telling us right now – and, by the way, there's been no shortage of communication between customers and us based on the recent news – but what they're saying to us right now is a couple of things.
First of all is they've congratulated us. Just looking at our value proposition, how we've been so focused on a transformation for a number of years, becoming much more software-driven. So much of our revenue streams today in Financial Services do not come from ATMs anymore. We have a very large and growing enterprise software business that in the recent quarter made up about 40% of our software revenues. So we've been doing a lot of things to change the value proposition, and for us it's changed our operating margins quite substantially based on that innovation.
The second thing that they're telling us is keep doing exactly what you're doing, which makes a lot of sense to us. We feel like the strategy that we've put in place has really changed the game in the industry. It's not just about physical channels. It's not just about digital channels. We're the ones that they look to to integrate channels seamlessly to help financial institutions control costs and improve revenues.
So it's really been working for us. In terms of your question about pricing, you can never predict what's going to happen out there on pricing, but there's a lot of competition. There always has been in the Financial Services space. There's a lot of spending and a lot of competition. We don't expect that to change over the course of time, but I would say, just as we're looking at recent activity, that we do think that pricing is probably more stable right now than it was six months ago. That's not to say that that's a new trend, either. It's a highly competitive market.
Hamza Fodderwala - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP

We'll go next to Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research.
Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC
Good afternoon, Bill. Bill, I don't know if this is a question for you or maybe Andy. I was just wondering if either one of you could comment on Digital Insight, and the growth you're witnessing now as it's part of NCR and maybe some of the leverage you were able to get because of the ATM business.
William R. Nuti - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, sure. First of all, I'll let Andy do most of the talking, Kartik. But we are very pleased so far with the progress we're making in DI. Andy, any other further comments from you?
Andrew S. Heyman - Senior Vice President, VP-NCR Financial Services
Well, yeah, a couple of things. First of all, it's been the backbone for us of our whole community financial institution segment play that we've been making for a couple of years now. That business will perform extremely well this year for us.
The Digital Insight component, which is a subset of how we go to market in the community financial institution space, continues to be growing this year in kind of the mid-single digits. The key thing to know that we've been talking about is that we believe this is a business that can grow high-single digits, low-double digits long-term, like our Hospitality SaaS business, and what we've been working on so hard is getting the customer satisfaction model extremely high; and our team has done an exceptional job of that.

We've grown the net promoter score from negative numbers to very positive numbers in about 12 months. We're still – if you look at the business, there's a lot of growth in end users, which is great. We have a new module coming to market right now. We went live with it last week: business banking.
We see a lot of growth ahead for the business and we just have to work through the erosion of some of the complaints in contracts from prior owners that should be behind us by the first half of next year, so that's been the only headwind in the business. That will be behind us soon enough, so it's been a fantastic acquisition thus far.
Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC
So, Andy, would that imply – if DI is growing mid-single digits and if I look at financials of service numbers on a constant-currency basis, would that imply that overall ATM business was down, and if so, what would you attribute that to?
Andrew S. Heyman - Senior Vice President, VP-NCR Financial Services
Well, yeah, the ATM business is – when we look at it right now, it goes a little bit back to the backlog story there. I would say the ATM business, generally speaking, if you think about our business, as the ATM business versus the branch business versus DI? The ATM business is – right now, there is a softness to the point you mentioned, but you've got to look at the Russia, China syndrome that's going on because that is causing a – depending on the quarter – a 300 basis point or 400 basis point impact.
So when you normalize it for that, it's a growth business still; and the backlog position, because of the points I made about slower backlog conversion, is the cause of why it's not even a faster growing business than that. But it's still a low single-digit growth business without Russia, China. Once the backlog starts to revert to the mean in the outer quarters here as we look into 2016, then we're back to what I would call a normal level of growth for the business.
Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC
So you're just having two geographies negatively impact you.
Andrew S. Heyman - Senior Vice President, VP-NCR Financial Services
Two geographies negatively impacting us along with slower conversion of other markets due to the percentage of contracts that are in these more innovative areas.
Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC
And, Bill, just one last question – obviously a lot of questions on the strategic review. As you look at it today, has it taken longer than you thought, and if so, as you look back, why do you think so?
William R. Nuti - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Oh, for sure, Kartik. It's taken a lot longer than we initially thought and the reason is twofold. I mentioned these earlier. One is when you're a public company and you need to focus on running the business and running it responsibly, there is only so many hours in the day; and if you devote all of your time to a strategic review, you could take your eye off the ball, and we will not let that happen; that's number one.
Number two, the depth of the analysis, by alternative, has been very comprehensive, more comprehensive than I initially thought, meaning we're going deeper, wider; we're viewing every alternative at a very comprehensive level, and I think in the end that is the most responsible thing to do. So I would say yes and for those reasons.
Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC
Thank you very much. I appreciate it.

We'll go next to Gil Luria from Wedbush Securities.
Gil B. Luria - Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Yes, thanks for taking my question. Excluding Russia and China, what other countries do you feel have gotten worse over the last few months, and what currencies have been the incremental weight since you reported last time?

William R. Nuti - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Hey, Gil. It's Bill. First of all, I saw you in my office today on CNBC. You looked very handsome. How about it, Andy?
Gil B. Luria - Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Thank you. I appreciate that.
William R. Nuti - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
And on this question, I'll ask Andy to answer that. Andy?
Andrew S. Heyman - Senior Vice President, VP-NCR Financial Services
Yeah. I think, let me say a couple of things. First of all, the African nations in general have – we've started to see some softness there. And I don't know if you caught my comments related to Russia and the fact that there's a lot of contracts we have in Russia on U.S. dollar. It's the same thing with Africa, where you might see anywhere from a 5% to 12% FX impact there that – if a distributor is buying a product from us in U.S. dollars, all of a sudden that same product costs 5% to 12% more, makes it more difficult for them to do business.
So African nations, we've seen softness there this year relative to prior year. And that's been the big one. And I'd say, as we look out, while it's not been a material impact yet, we do believe there could be a little bit of softness ahead with a couple of the other BRICs as well down the road. But right now, I would say it's limited to more in Africa, maybe to a smaller extent other parts of Asia.
Robert P. Fishman - SVP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer
And then, Gil, this is Bob. On the kind of currency question, we saw for the full year $65 million more revenue headwind. About two-thirds came from three currencies, in Brazil, Canada, and Australia. Brazil changed by roughly 24% from when we gave guidance in July. And then there were probably 40 currencies that all weakened versus the U.S. dollar. So those were the three big ones, but then it was across the board on the remaining piece.
William R. Nuti - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
The interesting thing, Gil, is when you take out Russia and China and you look at Andy's business, he actually grew orders in Q3 ex-China and Russia by 5% FX-neutral and grew revenue by 3% FX-neutral, so it gives you a sense of the impact of China and Russia this year so far.
Gil B. Luria - Wedbush Securities, Inc.
So let me – first, I wanted to ask Bob another question, just again for modeling. Below the line, you changed three of the assumptions for the annual guidance: the share count, the interest expense, and the tax rate. Can you go through what are the changes that have happened in those lines to reduce them?
Robert P. Fishman - SVP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer
Yeah, so previously for other income and expense we had guided to $215 million to $220 million. We now think that number will be closer to $204 million. Interest expense is down. We also started the year, from an OIE perspective, building in a little bit more FX volatility on that particular line, and then we saw some favorability in just a couple of other areas, around bank fees as an example. So that's why we were able to bring the other income and expense down to that $204 million number.
On taxes, we continued to do a good job. We had guided originally to 25%. We now think we'll be closer to 24% to 25% in terms of the tax rate. And then on the share count, you make assumptions at the beginning of the year: we said 175 million; it's looking like it's closer to 173 million, and, again, that includes a number of assumptions around forfeitures, et cetera.
So those three all help.
Gil B. Luria - Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Got it. I just want to circle back into the BRICs and ask, because you guys have so many feet on the street in all these different countries, a little bit of the really high level perspective about what your prospect is for those markets, for the emerging markets, especially the big ones? Is this – are we looking at a multi-year slowdown after a few decades of growth or is this just some hesitation or contagion from the Chinese stock market? How do you guys view the macro backdrop for the emerging market businesses that you have, given the specific insight that you have there?

William R. Nuti - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, I think it is a little different by market. In China, to be successful long-term, we're going to have to go in a direction that helps us to become more of a local player in the market. So if the regulatory environment does not change in China, and it could, we're going to have to figure out what our long-term strategic plan is around going local. And there are a variety of interesting alternatives there for us, but our goal, by the way, there would be certainly to become more software-focused than hardware.
In Russia, it really is a macro and currency headwind that should over time abate. Now, of course, they're very sensitive to the oil markets in terms of the impact on their economic growth. And clearly, relative to their relationship with the U.S., that can also feature prominently in our success. However, my thinking there is that that market will see more stability over time for us than not.
Brazil has certainly been more challenged, given their macroeconomic situation. I think for Brazil, we'll have to wait and see, environment, but they have experienced more of a slowdown there.
And India is a different market altogether. I think all-in for us is very market-dependent. I do not expect, by the way, 2016 to see as much of a drag on our revenue from Russia and China, simply because we begin to lap difficult compares by the middle of next year. So, Andy, you may want to give some more commentary on that point.
Andrew S. Heyman - Senior Vice President, VP-NCR Financial Services
Yeah. Let me also just add one thing, and we think it's really important. When you look at the BRICs right now for us, they're largely not the places that we have driven the transformation agenda, and where that really shows up is on the gross margin and operating income line of each of the four regions. This year in 2015, we will see a hit from an operating income perspective for those headwinds, but those should really abate next year and beyond to Bill's point, even though the revenues may still have some challenges. I'd say most of the margin dollars there of where the risks would be, the risk there is much lower on the margin dollar perspective than where the future revenue softness may land with each of the four markets. So that's the other thing I would add that I think is really important as we assess the impact on operating income in the outer years here.
Gil B. Luria - Wedbush Securities, Inc.

Matt Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors
Hey, can you guys hear me okay?
William R. Nuti - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah.
Matt Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors
Perfect. I want to talk just one more minute on the ATM business. If you look at going from kind of up 4% to 6% constant currency to up 1% to 2% constant currency and you bear in mind that roughly half-ish of the business should be annuity-like services, that's a really big reduction in the final quarter of the year, if you will, or the final half of the year relative to your 2Q guidance, and then the whole China and Russia thing is not necessarily "new" in my view. And then you talk about an industry that's sort of pushing stuff out because it's (54:28) moving fast, so I'm just trying to square all those (54:33). I know there's a lot of moving pieces but if you can help me make sense of all of that, it would be extremely helpful.
Andrew S. Heyman - Senior Vice President, VP-NCR Financial Services
Bill, can I get that?
William R. Nuti - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, please, go ahead.
Andrew S. Heyman - Senior Vice President, VP-NCR Financial Services
Okay, yeah, good, good. So, Matt, good question. Just so you know, Matt, you did garble up a little bit at the end of the question, but I think I got the gist of it, which is I think you're saying in the fourth quarter how did you have a 300-basis-point to 400-basis-point drop in revenue, especially given that you got a reasonable annuity stream.

It's really the backlog conversion. I'd say, when we looked at it, we planned in Q3 and Q4 for backlog conversion rates that were 500 basis points less than last year in both of the quarters, roughly, and where we're landing now is 1,000-basis-point reduction over prior year.
So just to use some real math, and I'll just use rough numbers here, in the third quarter we – in the fourth quarter where we're now landing has cost 50% to 55% of backlog conversions, a little lower in the third quarter, a little higher in fourth quarter. So that 50% to 55% compares to last year's 60% to 65%. We had planned on being a 500-basis-point drop from last year, not 1,000-basis-point drop, and 500 basis points called on roughly $800 million of backlog is in the $40 million-plus range per quarter. That's the drop.
We, frankly, did not do a good job with the modeling there. This outlook here is much more conservative and much more responsible, and we've planned expenses accordingly.
Matt Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors
Got it. I appreciate the color. And then just one follow-up, getting back to the whole strategic side of things. I guess at some point you have to be able to kind of put a check in the box and say, this is a viable, this isn't viable, this is viable, this isn't viable, and so on and so forth. And I feel like we're right back where NCR was six to nine months ago when some of this stuff started getting discussed, rumored, what have you. I guess – so what boxes have been checked or not checked or what opportunities actually appear viable from a strategic standpoint from here going forward?
William R. Nuti - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Matt, I think it's just too early to give you a check-the-box view. I think we've seen all of the options remain viable, and the Board of Directors is looking at them in concert with one another, and the optionality of one versus another in terms of what's best for our shareholders in NCR.
Matt Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors
Is there a timeframe, Bill, I mean, you guys talked about having an Analyst Meeting in September. That sort of got canceled – I'm not going to call it last minute, but not all that far in advance of the actual meeting, at least officially. I mean, when can we expect, and I think there's a lot of folks sort of waiting for this – when can we expect to hear something more definitive about where this company goes from here – from an inflection standpoint, strategically, et cetera?
William R. Nuti - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, I think, once the strategic process has completed and we have something of note to say other than continuing to execute to our plan and execute to our guidance, we will not have an Investor Meeting. But I would tell you that, right now, it will either be in Q4 or Q1 is my estimation right now, Matt.
Matt Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors
Great. Thanks a lot, guys.

We'll take our next question from Prasad Borra with Goldman Sachs.
S.K.Prasad Borra - Goldman Sachs International
Hi. Thanks for taking my questions, couple, if I may. Probably just focus on the free cash flow generation now you're talking about incremental restructuring measures. Given what you have gone through in terms of the process and probably you have a better view on which are the elements of the business which can be improved. Would you say that there are some additional tailwinds or benefits you can see from a free cash flow perspective, which could offset some of the impacts on additional restructuring costs?
Andrew S. Heyman - Senior Vice President, VP-NCR Financial Services
Yes, without a doubt. I mean we're very focused on the savings that those additional restructuring initiatives would drive, so my view is that I would not expect a negative impact in 2016. If anything, we'll see incremental free cash flow associated with the restructuring.

S.K.Prasad Borra - Goldman Sachs International
Okay. And, Bill, you had mentioned that there's a lot of new learnings which you had from probably reading the data a lot more, and probably getting the consulting experience which you would have probably not have explored before. What are the key takings from it? Operationally, what can you do better, and also, in terms of probably setting the guidance, are there any lessons to take? Would you be more willing to be conservative in terms of giving guidance, and, yeah, anything you can say from that perspective?
William R. Nuti - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, I think what we've learned is that we can be a bit more focused on resource allocation, and a bit more aggressive on resource allocation where we see higher growth and higher margin expansion. That would be point one.
Point two, that we have some amount of inefficiency and a level of under-productiveness in certain aspects of the company that we can go to work on, and overall that our cost structure can be a bit more competitive going forward, but while driving the kind of growth and bottom-line expansion and cash flow that we think we can drive.
In terms of guidance, we're meeting our guidance. This year, I think we've done a good job in terms of setting guidance. On that point, I might add one of the things Bob and I are proud of is the fact that since we gave NPOI guidance in February, we've seen about $20 million to $25 million more of NPOI headwinds as a result of FX and we did not take guidance down to $805 million to $845 million, in that range, to reflect the additional headwinds of FX. We stuck with our guidance and we're proud of the fact that we can navigate through those headwinds and make our guidance.
S.K.Prasad Borra - Goldman Sachs International
Okay. That's pretty much from my end. Thank you.
Operator
And at this time I would like to turn the call back over to Bill Nuti for any additional or closing remarks.
William R. Nuti - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, thank you, all, for joining us, and we appreciate the questions. As always, we look forward to being in contact you. If something were to change within the quarter, we'll certainly be in contact you, but otherwise we look forward to talking to you again in Q1. Good night.

Total compensation for each chief executive includes the following: salary and bonuses; other compensation, such as vested restricted stock grants, LTIP payouts and perks; and stock gains, the value realized by exercising stock options. Efficiency rank is based on our chief executive's performance/pay score. Ranks are given only to chief executives who have a six-year tenure and six-year compensation history.  The most efficient rank is 1 and least efficient is 189. Compensation rank is based on total compensation for latest fiscal year.
