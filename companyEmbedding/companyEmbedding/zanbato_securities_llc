MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., May 6, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Zanbato, Inc., a financial technology company whose platform facilitates private placement workflows and connectivity in private securities markets, today announced that it has raised $8 million in Series B funding led by AITV (Accelerate-IT Ventures), with participation from existing investor Formation 8 and several prominent families and venture capitalists. Zanbato will use the proceeds to further develop its data and technology practice and to expand its footprint in private financial markets. 
"Given the importance of private capital flows in today's financial landscape, it is remarkable that private placement processes remain largely untouched by technological advancement. At Zanbato we see a path towards remedying that," said Nico Sand, Zanbato Chief Executive Officer. "Our mission lies at the intersection of building elegant, intuitive technology and supporting the world's largest and most sophisticated investors. With our global network of partners and clients, we feel that we are well positioned to provide efficiency gains and reduce fragmentation in private market operations."
Zanbato has taken a user-centric approach to developing workflow management tools for private placement professionals. The company's private label platforms are used by Broker-Dealers, Fund Managers, Private Wealth Managers, and Co-Investment Networks to manage the distribution and placement of private offerings to their clients, who include large institutional allocators such as Sovereign Wealth Funds, Foundation/Endowments, and Pensions, as well as Family Offices and High Net Worth Individuals.  
"Zanbato is applying new Silicon Valley insights to private markets and institutional investing.  By focusing on technology to enable data-driven insights and aligning with long-standing, influential players in the market, Zanbato platforms and the networks they enable have the potential to dramatically improve private financial markets - and help global finance become more data-driven," said Joe Lonsdale, Zanbato Chairman. "Creating efficiencies in private markets is a huge win for the economy. I'm proud to be part of the mission."
"With our deep experience with family offices within AITV, we've encountered firsthand the complexities and difficulties surrounding private placements," said Bill Malloy, founding general partner at AITV. "Zanbato's platform brings the entire private placement process into the 21st century, we use it adamantly at the firm; it's quite literally the best experience for private investing." AITV plans to utilize its extensive network in Europe and the Middle East to support Zanbato's international expansion and commercialization into additional private financial markets.

Zanbato: Zanbato Sutter ATS Subscriber AgreementZanbato Sutter ATS Subscriber Agreement
ZANBATO SUTTER ATS SUBSCRIBER AGREEMENT


This ZANBATO SUTTER ATS SUBSCRIBER AGREEMENT (the "Agreement"), is entered into by and among the organization specified in the ATS Client Form and its affiliates, (collectively the "Subscribers" and each a "Subscriber") and Sutter Securities Incorporated ("Sutter"). By clicking the ACCEPT button at the end of this Subscriber Agreement, you accept this agreement and agree to be bound by it.
WHEREAS, the Subscribers wish to engage Sutter to assist in providing the services specified herein in connection with one or more transactions as either the buyer or seller of securities as such term is defined under applicable state and federal law.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and the mutual covenants contained herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereby agree as follows:
SECTION 1. Engagement of Sutter. Subscriber, being duly authorized to do so, hereby engages Sutter's services during the Term (as defined below) solely through the auspices of the Platform to facilitate the Subscribers from time to time in the sale or purchase (each such purchase or sale hereafter referred to as a "Transaction") of securities representing interests in energy, and other real assets in the form of interests in limited partnerships, limited liability companies or corporations (individually and collectively referred to herein as the "Securities") through the provision of an electronic platform known as the Zanbato Sutter ATS (the "Platform").
SECTION 2. Sales Fees. (a) Subscriber hereby agrees to pay Sutter in respect of each Transaction a percentage, specified in basis points, of the face value of all of the Securities being conveyed via an escrow or directly from the issuer collectively to the counterparty to the Transaction in such Transaction (the "Sales Fee"). The size of the sales fee shall be determined on a negotiated basis between Sutter and the selling Subscriber for each opportunity prior to posting the same on the Platform. Sutter shall enter on the Platform the agreed terms, including any calculation methodology based on the type of capital (equity, debt, or otherwise), and Subscriber shall accept those terms prior to posting the opportunity, either on the Platform or by separate email communication.


(b) All Sales Fees shall be payable by Subscriber to Sutter within two (2) business days after receipt by the counterparty of the Securities in each Transaction.
SECTION 3. Termination. The term of this Agreement shall commence on the date hereof and shall continue until terminated, as provided herein (the "Term"). Either party may terminate this Agreement upon fifteen days' prior notice (the "Notice Period"), given as set forth in Section 28, with such termination effective on the date of the expiration of such Notice Period. In the event of a material default, the defaulting party shall have up to three business days following notice from the other party to cure any such breach. Should the defaulting party fail to cure within such period, this Agreement may be terminated immediately thereafter upon notice by the non-breaching party. Upon any termination, Sutter shall be entitled to the Sales Fees as set forth in Section 2 with respect to any and all Transactions executed, delivered into escrow or contractually committed to be executed or delivered to a subscriber or their agent prior to the date of such termination.
SECTION 4. Connectivity. User is solely responsible for providing and maintaining all necessary electronic communications with Sutter, including, wiring, computer hardware, software, communication line access, and networking devices.
SECTION 5. No Partnership, No Fiduciary. Sutter is acting as an independent contractor hereunder, solely in the capacity of a finder, and not as a broker. Sutter has made no investigation of the merits of any Transaction posted on the Site, and Subscribers are obligated to make their own investigation of any Transaction prior to subscribing or delivering any funds to a seller or issuer. Sutter is not acting a fiduciary of any Subscriber, whether such Subscriber is acting as buyer or seller in respect of any Transaction. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to create or shall be deemed or construed as creating, an employment relationship or a partnership or joint venture, or agency, or taxable entity between the parties, to authorize either party to act as an agent of, or to otherwise enter into binding agreements for or on behalf of the other or to confer or grant to either party any proprietary interest in, or to subject either party to any liability for or in respect of the business, assets, profits or obligations of the other on account of the relationship provided for in this Agreement, except to the extent expressly set forth herein.
SECTION 6. No Restrictions. Each of the parties represents and warrants that it is not a party to any agreement restricting or affecting in any manner such party's ability to enter into and perform this Agreement.
SECTION 7. Appropriate Purchase Agreement. Subscriber represents that it will enter into the agreement to effectuate transfer of such securities between the parties as posted on the Site for the specified Transaction. Subscriber agrees to provide Sutter with copies of all amended Transaction documents as provided to the counterparty and with executed copies of all final Transaction documents. All Transaction documents shall provide for the payment of Sutter’s fees from an escrow account at closing.
SECTION 8. Terms of Service. Subscriber agrees that, in connection with the services provided hereunder, it will at all times abide by the Terms of Service for the Platform.
SECTION 9. Market Data. Subscriber hereby grants to Sutter a non-exclusive, non-assignable, non-transferable, worldwide, irrevocable license to receive and use information and data that Subscriber or Subscriber's agent enters into the Platform or into a data room established by the Sutter for a Transaction ("Subscriber's Data") for the following purposes: within data aggregated through the Platform ("Platform Data") for performing self-regulatory functions; for internal commercial purposes (i.e., purposes that do not include disclosing, publishing, or distributing outside of the Platform); and for use within the Platform market data products (i.e., products that include disclosure, publication, or distribution to third parties), provided that: (i)such market data products are provided in an aggregate manner that does not directly or indirectly identify Subscriber as the source of the information and, (ii) fees for any such market data product are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") in accordance with the requirements of Section 19 of the Act. Subject to the foregoing license, as between Sutter and Subscriber, Subscriber retains all ownership and other rights associated with Subscriber's Data. No provision in this Agreement shall impair any right, interest, or use of Subscriber's Data granted by operation of SEC rules or any other rule or law. Subscriber represents and warrants that, with respect to Subscriber's Data (i) Subscriber owns or has sufficient rights in and to Subscriber's Data to authorize Sutter and the Platform to use Subscriber's Data to perform all obligations under this Agreement with respect thereto; (ii) use or delivery of Subscriber's Data by Subscriber or Sutter will not violate the proprietary rights (including, without limitation, any privacy rights) of any party or third party; and (iii) use or delivery of Subscriber's Data by Subscriber or Sutter will not violate any applicable law or regulation.
SECTION 10. Restrictions on Use. Unless otherwise required by law, Subscriber may not sell, lease, furnish or otherwise permit or provide access to the Platform or other data room or any information or data made available therein ("Data"), with the exception of Subscriber's Data, to any other entity or to any individual that is not Subscriber's employee, customer, agent or authorized designee. Subscriber accepts full responsibility for its employees', customers', agents' and authorized designees' use of the Platform, which use must comply with the Subscriber's obligations under this Agreement and the Terms of Use. Subscriber will take reasonable security precautions to prevent unauthorized use of or access to the Platform, including unauthorized entry of information into the Platform, or the information and data made available therein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Subscriber shall insure that all internal use of Platform Data: (i) clearly and prominently identifies the information as originating from the Platform where applicable; (ii) is adequately protected to prevent unauthorized access; and (iii) is not altered by Subscriber in any way. Subscriber may not convey, retransmit, republish or rebroadcast any Platform Data to any outside party unless it signs and complies with a separate agreement with Sutter regarding data usage.
SECTION 11. Confidentiality. (a) Both parties acknowledge that: (i) the Platform and the information and data made available therein, incorporate confidential and proprietary information developed, acquired by or licensed to Sutter; and (ii) each party may receive or have access to other proprietary or confidential information disclosed and reasonably understood as confidential by the disclosing party (collectively, the "Information"). The receiving party will use the disclosing party's Information solely to perform its obligations under this Agreement. The receiving party will take all precautions necessary to safeguard the confidentiality of the disclosing party's Information, including without limitation: (i) those taken by the receiving party to protect its own confidential information; and (ii) those which the disclosing party may reasonably request from time to time.


(b) The receiving party will not disclose, in whole or in part, the disclosing party's Information to any person, except as specifically authorized under this Agreement. Subscriber may not disclose any data or compilations of data made available to Subscriber by Sutter without the express, prior written authorization of Sutter. The receiving party may also disclose Information in accordance with its regulatory obligations.


(c) The parties acknowledge that any unauthorized use or disclosure of the disclosing party's Information may cause irreparable damage to the disclosing party. If an unauthorized use or disclosure occurs, the receiving party will immediately notify the disclosing party and take at its expense all steps necessary to recover the disclosing party's Information and to prevent its subsequent unauthorized use or dissemination, including availing itself of actions for seizure and injunctive relief. If the receiving party fails to take these steps in a timely and adequate manner, the disclosing party may take them at the receiving party's expense, and the receiving party will provide the disclosing party with its reasonable cooperation in such actions that the disclosing party may request.


(d) The receiving party will have no confidentiality obligation with respect to any portion of the disclosing party's Information that: (i) the receiving party independently developed before receiving the Information from the disclosing party; (ii) the receiving party lawfully obtained from a third party under no obligation of confidentiality; (iii) is or becomes available to the public other than as a result of an act or omission of the receiving party or any of its employees; or (iv) the receiving party is compelled to disclose by law, regulation or legal process provided. If the receiving party received notice compelling it to disclose confidential information, it will immediately notify disclosing party of this request.
SECTION 12. Ownership of Transaction Data. Subscriber acknowledges and agrees that Sutter hereby owns all transaction data generated from the performance of this Agreement and arising out of each Transaction and all rights therein.
SECTION 13. Disclaimer of Warranty. THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED AS-IS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED CONDITIONS OR WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR USE OR PURPOSE, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY ARISING FROM TRADE USAGE, COURSE OF DEALING OR COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, AND OF ANY OTHER WARRANTY OR OBLIGATION WITH RESPECT TO THE SYSTEM OR ANY SOFTWARE OR OTHER MATERIALS MADE AVAILABLE TO SUBSCRIBER AND ALL SUCH OTHER WARRANTIES ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED. THERE IS NO GUARANTY THAT THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY SUTTER WILL MEET THE SUBSCRIBER'S REQUIREMENTS, BE ERROR FREE, OR OPERATE WITHOUT INTERRUPTION. SUTTER GIVES NO WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND AS TO THE FITNESS, CAPACITY, OR CONDUCT OF ANY OTHER PERSON HAVING ACCESS TO THE PLATFORM AND SHALL NOT BE HELD LIABLE TO OR THROUGH SUBSCRIBER OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY USE OR ABUSE WHATSOEVER OF THE PLATFORM BY ANOTHER PERSON HAVING ACCESS TO THE PLATFORM, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY FAILURE TO CONCLUDE TRANSACTIONS OR OBSERVE APPLICABLE MARKET REGULATIONS OR CONVENTIONS OR TO PAY REQUISITE TAXES OR OTHER CHARGES ON ANY TRANSACTIONS OR TO OTHERWISE ACT LAWFULLY.
SECTION 14. Limitation on Liability. (a) Subscriber shall have no liability to Sutter arising from its use of the Services contemplated by this Agreement (other than to pay the fees agreed to in connection with a particular Transaction), with the exception of such liability resulting from Subscriber's gross negligence or willful misconduct.


(b) ABSENT FRAUD OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT BY SUTTER OR A CLAIM ARISING OUT OF SUTTER'S INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATION, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL SUTTER OR ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS, DAMAGE, CLAIM OR EXPENSE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY DIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES OR LOST PROFITS, WHETHER FORESEEABLE OR UNFORESEEABLE, BASED ON SUBSCRIBER'S CLAIMS OR THE CLAIMS OF ITS CUSTOMERS, EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, CLAIMS FOR LOSS OF DATA, GOODWILL, USE OF MONEY OR USE OF SUTTER, INTERRUPTION IN USE OR AVAILABILITY OF THE PLATFORM, STOPPAGE OF OTHER WORK OR IMPAIRMENT OF OTHER ASSETS), ARISING OUT OF BREACH OR FAILURE OF EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY, BREACH OF CONTRACT, MISREPRESENTATION, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY IN TORT OR OTHERWISE. THIS SECTION WILL NOT APPLY ONLY WHEN AND TO THE EXTENT THAT APPLICABLE LAW SPECIFICALLY REQUIRES LIABILITY, DESPITE THE FOREGOING EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION.
SECTION 15. Indemnification. Subscriber shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Sutter (and its respective affiliates, directors, officers, employees, successors and assigns) from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses based upon, arising out of or otherwise in respect of this Agreement.
SECTION 16. Acknowledgement of SRO Obligations. Sutter represents: (i) that Sutter is registered with the SEC as a broker-dealer and the Platform is registered as an alternative trading system; and (ii) that Sutter has a statutory obligation to protect investors and the public interest, and to ensure that quotation information supplied to investors and the public is fair and informative, and not discriminatory, fictitious or misleading. Accordingly, Subscriber agrees that Sutter, when required to do so in fulfillment of its statutory obligations, may, temporarily or permanently, unilaterally condition, modify or terminate the right of any or all individuals or entities, including Subscriber, to receive or use the Platform. Sutter shall undertake reasonable efforts to notify Subscriber of any such condition, modification or termination, and Subscriber shall promptly comply with any requirement that may be contained in such notice within such period of time as may be determined in good faith by Sutter to be necessary and consistent with its statutory obligations. Any individual or entity that receives such a notice shall have available to it such procedural protections as are provided to it by the Act and the applicable rules thereunder.
SECTION 17. Force Majeure. Neither party to this Agreement will be liable for delay or failure to perform its obligations hereunder (other than a failure to pay amounts when due) caused by an event that is beyond the party's control; provided, however, that such party will not have contributed in any way to such event.
SECTION 18. Governing Law; Jurisdiction. (a) This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to conflict of laws principles.


(b) Each party agrees that any controversy arising out of or relating to this contract, or the breach thereof, and if said dispute cannot be settled through negotiation, will be resolved and settled by arbitration under the auspices of FINRA Dispute Resolution or in accordance with such other rules and procedures as are agreed to by the parties. The arbitration proceeding shall be conducted in San Francisco, California, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. Judgment upon arbitration may be entered in any court, state or federal, having jurisdiction; provided, however, that nothing herein will prevent either party from: (i) petitioning a regulatory body regarding a matter in question over which the regulatory body has administrative jurisdiction; or (ii) pursuing injunctions before any administrative or judicial forum provided that all monetary and other relief is submitted for arbitration.


(c) In connection with the foregoing agreement to arbitrate, each party understands that: (i) arbitration is final and binding on the parties; (ii) the parties are waiving their right to seek remedies in court, including the right to jury trial; (iii) pre-arbitration discovery is generally more limited than and different from court proceedings; (iv) the arbitrators' award is not required to include factual findings or legal reasoning, and any party's right to appeal or seek modification of rulings by the arbitrators is strictly limited; and (v) the panel of arbitrators will typically include a minority of arbitrators who were or are affiliated with the securities industry.
SECTION 19. Amendments. Except as may be specifically provided herein, no change, modification, amendment, addition or termination of this Agreement or any part thereof shall be valid unless in writing and signed by both parties.
SECTION 20. Expenses. Subscriber and Sutter shall each bear its own expenses in entering into and carrying out this Agreement.
SECTION 21. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable in any respect, the validity and enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby and the parties will attempt to agree upon a valid and enforceable provision that is a reasonable substitute therefor, and upon so agreeing, shall incorporate such substitute provision in this Agreement.
SECTION 22. Headings; Captions. The headings or captions under Sections of this Agreement are for convenience and reference only and do not in any way modify, interpret or construe the intent of the parties or affect any of the provisions of this Agreement.
SECTION 23. Assignment. The rights and obligations of either party under this Agreement may not be assigned without the prior written consent of the other party hereto and any other purported assignment shall be null and void without force and effect; provided that the Sutter may assign this Agreement to any of its affiliates or successors.
SECTION 24. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding on and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors, heirs, personal representatives, and permitted assigns.
SECTION 25. Entire Agreement; Waivers. This Agreement, together with the Terms of Use and Privacy Policies, contains the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. No waiver of the provisions hereof shall be effective unless in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver. No waiver shall be deemed a continuing waiver or waiver in respect of any subsequent breach or default, either of similar or different nature, unless expressly so stated in writing. Should any clause, section or part of this Agreement be held or declared to be void or illegal for any reason, all other clauses, sections or parts of this Agreement which can be effected without such illegal clause, section or part shall nevertheless continue in full force and effect.
SECTION 26. Non-Solicitation.  The parties agree that there will be a non-solicitation period (the “Non-Solicitation Period”) as of the date of this Agreement until twelve (12) months following the termination of Subscriber’s having access to the Platform. During the Non-Solicitation Period neither party to this Agreement shall hire or solicit to hire or cause to leave the other party's employment any employees of the other party. The foregoing shall exclude employees who approach the Subscriber or Sutter on an unsolicited basis or employees no longer employed by the parties.
SECTION 27. Non-Circumvention. The Subscriber agrees that there shall be a non-circumvention period (the “Non-circumvention Period”) from the date of this Agreement until twelve (12) months following the termination of Subscriber’s having access to the Zanbato Sutter ATS. During the Non-circumvention Period the Subscriber for itself and its affiliates hereby agrees not to, directly or indirectly solicit, contact, negotiate with, or form any financing agreements outside of the terms and workflows of the Platform with any of the companies or projects that were on the Platform when the Subscriber had access to the Platform. In particular, Subscriber will not attempt to solicit or accept investment opportunities with companies and projects on the Platform outside of the Platform during the Non-Circumvention Period. The foregoing shall exclude any sellers, companies or projects with whom the Subscriber had an investment relationship prior to the date of this Agreement.
SECTION 28. Notices. All notices, requests and other communications to a party ("Notice") under this Agreement must be in writing (which includes email so long as a receipt of such email transmission is requested and received) and sent to the addresses set forth below. All Notices must be delivered by (a) personal delivery, (b) reputable overnight delivery service (including Federal Express, UPS and DHL) or (c) email, in each case to the respective address listed below or later provided by a party pursuant to this Section 26. A notice will be deemed to have been made on the date (i) of delivery with respect to (a), (ii) of delivery or the date on which delivery was refused as indicated on the delivery service's record of delivery with respect to (b), and (iii) indicated in the confirmation of transmission or receipt if transmitted during business hours, or the next business day if transmitted after business hours, with respect to (c).
