Data include LIDAR and satellite imagery,  financial, weather, demographic, psychographic, real estate and smart meter data.  These data are run through machine learning algorithms to identify existing customers, upon which predictive propensity models are built.  PowerScout translates those data-driven insights into advanced energy purchasing recommendations through an online marketplace, which allows consumers to execute contracts for advanced energy products in a simple, intuitive way. PowerScout has also built proprietary tools to access utility smart meter interval data and retains data rights to the generation meter of all customers through the solar inverter.  This allows PowerScout to integrate real-time energy optimization at the whole whole-home level to maximize the value of advanced energy solutions to consumers.

PowerScout accelerates the adoption of advanced energy resources using two core competencies: machine learning-based data science and an unmatched online customer experience.  PowerScout analyzes large amounts of data stored in a normalized image in Amazon private cloud.  The platform quantifies the combined impact of multiple advanced energy technologies on the consumer’s savings, real estate value, and carbon footprint, and provides a simple eCommerce portal that allows consumers to execute a contract with the ideal hardware, installer services, and specialty finance solutions.  Once these technologies reach critical deployment levels, PowerScout will offer real-time optimization services that will unify Distributed Energy Resources and Electrified Transportation Networks at the household level, allowing the value of each electron to be maximized.

                                    I am writing in support of PowerScout, an innovative startup making significant strides to address the high customer acquisition costs of residential solar.  Having seen demonstrations of the PowerScout platform, I was impressed by the depth of the data platform and the intuitive way that the data is presented to consumers.  The ability to move the solar prospecting and sales process online will be absolutely critical to the next phase of market growth, and PowerScout’s technology is substantially ahead of the competition.  I am also familiar with the founding team, and have previously worked with them in a professional capacity.  I have seen their vision and execution ability first hand, and have no doubt that they will develop PowerScout into the preeminent customer acquisition engine for clean energy.  On this basis, I strongly recommend PowerScout to the Dubai Future Accelerator program and encourage the program administrators to review their application carefully.                                












Jan P. Rohde
 Managing Director at Xcentio Consulting


                                    I have known the founder, Attila Toth, for >15 years, and can attest to his vision, impeccable drive to get things done, and ability to deliver a high quality technology product. He has assembled a team with deep expertise in the residential solar market, with an excellent understanding of the key pain points facing the industry.  

PowerScout is the first company I have seen using big data/AI to understand the customer and provide value propositions custom tailored to them. It would arm consumers like myself with powerful home energy analytics during the buying process to ensure an informed decision is made.

Having led strategy formulation at semi-Government level to make Dubai a better place I strongly believing in putting the customer first. I reckon that PowerScout’s approach focusing on data driven marketing/eCommerce will be able to disrupt a highly inefficient status quo. I believe that they would be a strong addition to the 2017 class of the Dubai Future Accelerator program.
