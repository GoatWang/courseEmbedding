Shows you everything outside your door, day or night
Vivint Doorbell Camera brings elegant design, understated form, and high-tech function to your entryway. More useful than a doorbell, more subtle than a security camera, with a 180-degree lens, HD resolution, and infrared night vision to see everything outside your door at all hours.











Minimalist design that blends seamlessly into your doorway
An ominous surveillance camera overlooking a welcome mat might send visitors a mixed message. The minimalist design mimics a regular doorbell. It blends seamlessly with your home exterior to keep your entryway feeling like a meeting place instead of a TSA checkpoint.











Two-way talk lets you answer your door from anywhere
With its built-in two-way talk, Vivint Doorbell Camera lets you talk to visitors even when you’re away. That way you can get package deliveries stored someplace safe, not left out in the open. And when a surprise visitor shows up, you can make other arrangements.












Smart alerts that give advance notice of surprise visitors
You can’t predict who might show up unannounced, or when. With a discreet camera built into your doorbell, it won’t matter. Smart motion detection notifies you when someone approaches so you’ll know they’re outside before they ever ring. You’ll know even if they knock.















Smart home controls that extend the reach of your hospitality
With Vivint Doorbell Camera’s integration into the Vivint Smart Home platform, you can talk to visitors, unlock doors, and turn on lights from within a single app. That means you won’t need to leave dinner guests waiting on your doorstep when you get delayed.












Smart motion detection knows what to record and what to ignore
Vivint Doorbell Camera’s visitor detection distinguishes people from passing cars, dancing shadows, or waving branches. Real visitors activate 30-second, Smart Clips recordings that get saved for 45 days to give you time to catch up on what you’ve missed.












Save all the important moments with Vivint Playback
Vivint Playback upgrade adds 24/7 recording to the experience. Recordings upload wirelessly to the Playback storage device, so WiFi networks won't crash. And since it all integrates into one smart home system, you can view recordings from the Vivint mobile app.











Professional Installation with Vivint Smart Home Pros
Qualified and licensed Smart Home Pros handle installation so you can focus on your life. Our installation teams will make sure your doorbell camera blends with your home exterior, links up seamlessly with your Vivint Smart Home system and works the way you want it too.

Frequently Asked Questions


What is a smart home?
+


 A smart home is a home that is equipped with technology to remotely control and automate household systems like lighting, doors, thermostats, entertainment systems, security alarms, surveillance cameras and other connected appliances. But it’s more than just remote controls. Smart home introduces artificial intelligence to transcend the remote controls and programmable settings that have been standard home features for the past several decades, to create a centralized, self-regulating home monitoring, control, and energy conservation ecosystem. Learn more about smart home here.

What is home automation?
+


 Home automation refers to technology installed in homes to remotely control and automate household systems like lighting, doors, heating & air conditioning, entertainment systems, security alarms, surveillance cameras and other connected appliances. The programmable thermostats, sprinkler systems, coffee makers, and entertainment systems that have been standard home features for decades can be considered home automation. But by today’s technological standards, the term home automation typically refers to a more advanced and complex set of components. To learn more about home automation, click here.

How to make your home smart
+


 To make your home smart, all you need to do is combine smart components like doorbell cameras, security cameras, smart thermostats, door & window sensors, smoke detectors, and other home control devices into a unified network with a central control dashboard and an artificial intelligence algorithm. When you install a smart home platform like Vivint Smart Home Cloud, for example, managing your home gets significantly more convenient. With Vivint Smart Home Cloud, you’ll no longer need to switch between different home control apps or walk through the house flipping switches by hand.

Where all your home controls come together
No more wandering the house flipping switches and punching keypads before bed. Vivint SkyControl Panel is a smart home hub that bundles all your smart home controls in one place, giving you control of lights, locks, garage doors, thermostats, and security systems from one spot.






A panic button to call for immediate help
If you notice someone prowling your property, SkyControl lets you watch through your security cameras from a safe location. For situations that turn dangerous, SkyControl comes with a  panic button to sound the alarm and open instant communication with security monitoring teams.

Easy and intuitive navigation
Centralizing home controls onto one dashboard creates seamless smart home experiences that you might not notice until you remember them later. With its high-definition touch-screen, SkyControl gives you easy access to your smart home, convenient notifications, and a place to review all your home security video.










Encrypted network



Backup battery



Wireless signal



Secure signal. Secure home. 
It takes a secure wireless network to create complete home security. Vivint SkyControl encrypts smart home signals to secure both video and smart home devices. And the bright, HD display shows you a glowing signal of your home’s status from across the room.


Stay protected when the power goes out
Sometimes a storm might knock out power. Other times, it's a motivated burglar with insulated wire cutters. In either case, SkyControl's backup battery keeps your smart home controls, your security system, and your notifications working long enough to keep your home safe.


Leave the wires for the birds
The centerpiece of Vivint Smart Home systems, SkyControl moderates all wireless communications between you and and the Vivint Smart Home cloud. Wireless functionality gives you better protection. And a dedicated cellular connection means more reliable communication and no solid lines for burglars to cut.

Our Mission:The mission of NetTalon is to provide a comprehensive and integrated solution to school safety.  The goal is to have the safest environment possible and to avoid the mass injuries and killings that have occurred in previous shootings, all while giving law enforcement the command and control necessary to make a successful rescue. All parties, the teachers, students, school personnel and law enforcement have a role to play in making this possibility a reality.  Our “Best Practice Solution” for school safety is called VIRTUAL COMMAND. 







What is Virtual Command?VIRTUAL COMMAND is an integrated system of hardware and software that connects a school to law enforcement for actionable intelligence. VIRTUAL COMMAND was designed specifically to protect schools in the event that an Active Shooter situation were to arise. No other system known today is capable of providing the real-time information to law enforcement that VIRTUAL COMMAND can provide. In short, VIRTUAL COMMAND saves lives.







What Virtual Command Provides:VIRTUAL COMMAND was created by experienced professionals in the security industry who had been trained in the world of “intelligence gathering."  The process included seeking out the help and support of the men and women who are on the front line providing protection every day; the First Responders.  Their knowledge and experience was indispensable in creating this revolutionary solution to school safety. VIRTUAL COMMAND provides an instant ALERT to local dispatch centers, PROTECTION for all those trapped in a school, the ability to LOCATE/IDENTIFY THE THREAT, the ability to TRACK THE THREAT, RESTRICT THE THREAT'S MOVEMENT, DISRUPT THE THREAT'S ATTACK and the overall ability to NEUTRALIZE THE THREAT. No other system today can boast of such abilities. Contact Information:NetTalon Security Systems, Inc.3304 Bourbon StreetFredericksburg, Va 22408Office: 877-638-8256Fax: 540-368-5294General Questions: rdubois@nettalon.com

President's Message"MY GOAL IN LIFE IS TO ENSURE THAT EVERY SCHOOL, EVERY TEACHER AND EVERY CHILD ARE EQUALLY PROTECTED..."







Donald R. Jones Jr.After graduating from The Virginia Military Institute, Don Jones chose to begin his professional life as an Army Ranger and 2nd Lieutenant in the United States Army in June of 1967. After the completion of his training he was sent to Vietnam to serve during the two bloodiest years of the war. Almost immediately, he was introduced to the world of intelligence. His mission was to lead his men in the effort to gather information about the enemy, their movements and capabilities and report back to his superiors. Very quickly, he learned the value of actionable intelligence.It was during one of these missions that Don was to distinguish himself and gain the knowledge that would serve him well after his Army career. Finding himself and his men surrounded by North Vietnamese Regulars, he continued to direct and encourage them.  Without regard for his personal safety, Don repeatedly exposed himself to enemy fire and retrieved wounded soldiers while carrying them to safety. For this action he was nominated for and receivedThe Silver Star for gallantry in action.Following his honorable discharge from the Army, he worked for a government contractor where he gained invaluable experience in developing and managing large training activities.  In 1999 Don became one of the founders of NetTalon Security Systems, INC. He has served as Director of Operations, Executive Vice-President, and Director of Marketing & Sales. Today he serves as company President. In this role he has championed the cause of public safety. He has worked tirelessly to empower first responders with the technology necessary to perform their duties in safest and most efficient environment possible.Don is a husband, father, grandfather, industry expert and a friend and mentor to many. President's Message:"Every child, teacher and school staff member deserves to be safe in their educational setting. No teacher should have to stand in front of their children and be forced to plead for their life and the lives of their students. No one should be trapped and be made a target in the confines of their own classroom. No student or teacher should be forced to perform supreme acts of heroism because their educational environment was not a safe location for them to be in. My goal in life is to ensure that every school, every child and every teacher are equally protected with the highest level of safety possible in the event of an active shooter attack. Virtual Command was created out of this vision and for this purpose."- Donald R. Jones Jr. Contact Information:NetTalon Security Systems, Inc.3304 Bourbon StreetFredericksburg, Va 22408Office: 877-638-8256Fax: 540-368-5294General Questions: rdubois@nettalon.comContact President: djones@nettalon.com

The Solution:VIRTUAL COMMAND is the solution you are searching for in order to protect your children and your family members within a school environment. VIRTUAL COMMAND provides protection throughout the entire school for students and teachers, while providing real-time intelligence to local Law Enforcement groups who would respond to an incident so that any pending threat can be neutralized with minimal risk to those involved.







You Deserve Safety:Your children deserve to be safe in their schools. No teacher should have to hold a door closed while a shooter tries to break through. No parent should have to experience the horror of their child not returning home safe from school. No one should have to suffer the life trauma that comes along with experiencing such a heinous crime. REQUEST FOR INFORMATION:

Question #1: ARE YOU IN A SAFE PLACE?


August 22, 2014
Mason Wooldridge




ARE YOU IN A SAFE PLACE?- We would like to start by saying "thank you" to the men and women of dispatch centers all across America. The work you do takes guts and a large heart. It’s time to give you better tools to do your jobs more efficiently. It’s time to bring your abilities in life threat situations into the 21st century. It’s time you’re empowered beyond what’s the standard today so you can be more ready to combat the rising threats that our facing our schools. "ARE YOU IN A SAFE PLACE?" is the first question in our "911 Questions" series that we will discuss, and it is the first question that should bring the hairs on the back of your neck to a standing position.Put yourself in the shoes of someone stuck in an active shooter incident for a moment and think about how foolish the answer to this question would be if you were making the 911 call. Keep in mind that you could quite possibly have a shooter in your classroom, a classroom nearby or within an ear shot from where you are located. You would have no protection and no recourse for combating a shooter from targeting you next. “Are you in a safe place?” Are you kidding me? This is the best intel gathering tactic there is to find out what’s happening in a life threat situation? Are we seriously expecting the victims who are under attack to pull out their cell phones and call 911 when they are trying to just stay alive? Not to mention the fact that some schools are now prohibiting children from carrying their cell phones, or in the case of an elementary school attack, the kids would be too young to have phones. Furthermore, a lot of rural schools have poor cell coverage and a call would not be able get out from certain parts of a building.Lastly, what's talked about even less frequently is how bad the intel is from someone inside of an active shooter incident. Law Enforcement are only as capable as their intel. If there is a lack of information about an incident or bad information, time is lost sorting through the fractured data. Time is precious in a life threat situation and needs to be of a clear, concise and usable manner or those responding will be wasting time when they get to the scene. Wasted time equals lives lost.  - Virtual Command changes the scenario entirely and makes it not necessary for a student inside of a school to make a call or even worry about passing along information. With the Virtual Command technology a school is directly networked to the local law enforcement entities and sends out an emergency notification as soon as a shooter is even spotted. No longer will a call need to go out of a school for law enforcement to have the information they need to start to mitigate the incident. Children are no longer the ones who have the responsibility of informing law enforcement that there is a shooter in their school. Virtual Command gives the tools necessary for dispatch operators to take the command and control of an active shooter incident away from the shooter and puts it back into the hands of those arriving to the scene. Virtual Command empowers first responders by providing them the real-time, actionable intelligence they need to do their jobs in a more safe and effective manner. 













"We believed we were safe. That was the big fantasy."                       -John Marsden



"The purpose of this blog is not to make victims relive the horrors that are associated with one of these life altering events, but to educate readers to the real life scenarios that an individual will face if he or she is trapped in the middle of an active shooter incident. The second part of this blog is to show you as the reader how Virtual Command combats the life threats that plague a environment not protected by its technology." “Children are our most valuable resource.”              - Herbert Hoover, 31st President."The design and hope for our readers is that you will have enough information to be educated to the truth that surrounds a subject that school officials are choosing to keep you in the dark about, mainly because until now there has been no solution to these heinous crimes."

Virtual CommandSETTLE FOR NOTHING LESS!







Our Mission:The mission of NetTalon is to provide a comprehensive and integrated solution to school safety.  The goal is to have the safest environment possible and to avoid the mass injuries and killings that have occurred in previous shootings, all while giving law enforcement the command and control necessary to make a successful rescue. All parties, the teachers, students, school personnel and law enforcement have a role to play in making this possibility a reality.  Our “Best Practice Solution” for school safety is called VIRTUAL COMMAND. 







What is Virtual Command?VIRTUAL COMMAND is an integrated system of hardware and software that connects a school to law enforcement for actionable intelligence. VIRTUAL COMMAND was designed specifically to protect schools in the event that an Active Shooter situation were to arise. No other system known today is capable of providing the real-time information to law enforcement that VIRTUAL COMMAND can provide. In short, VIRTUAL COMMAND saves lives.







What Virtual Command Provides:VIRTUAL COMMAND was created by experienced professionals in the security industry who had been trained in the world of “intelligence gathering."  The process included seeking out the help and support of the men and women who are on the front line providing protection every day; the First Responders.  Their knowledge and experience was indispensable in creating this revolutionary solution to school safety. VIRTUAL COMMAND provides an instant ALERT to local dispatch centers, PROTECTION for all those trapped in a school, the ability to LOCATE/IDENTIFY THE THREAT, the ability to TRACK THE THREAT, RESTRICT THE THREAT'S MOVEMENT, DISRUPT THE THREAT'S ATTACK and the overall ability to NEUTRALIZE THE THREAT. No other system today can boast of such abilities. Contact Information:NetTalon Security Systems, Inc.3304 Bourbon StreetFredericksburg, Va 22408Office: 877-638-8256Fax: 540-368-5294General Questions: rdubois@nettalon.com

Outsmart Burglars  the Moment You Plug It In





“I built SimpliSafe to make home security simpler and smarter. It uses advanced wireless technology, there’s no annual contracts, and it saves you hundreds. I’m proud of that.”
Chad Laurans, CEO & Chief Engineer

After his friends were robbed, Chad Laurans discovered a serious problem in the home security industry. You want your home to be safe, but alarm companies charge huge fees of $45 a month and lock you in long-term contracts. The demands are just too high.
So Chad Built Something New.
Relying on his electrical engineering degree from Yale and an MBA from Harvard, he designed an advanced home security system. He called it SimpliSafe.
Now it’s the fastest growing home security company in the nation. SimpliSafe won’t lock you in a long-term contract and 24/7 professional monitoring is only $14.99 a month.
Protect your home—the smart way. 










Award-Winning Home Security
Winner of CNET Editor’s Choice Award, Angie’s List Super Service Award, and A+ Rated by the Better Business Bureau.








Dave Ramsey, Personal Finance Expert:
“Protecting your family is important, but don’t ever sign a long-term contract. Do it the right way with SimpliSafe. These are the good guys!”





Joe Balog, Police Chief:
"My force used SimpliSafe to stop a serial burglary ring. It still helps us catch other criminals in the act today."





Unlike SimpliSafe, most burglar alarms are far too expensive, here’s why...



With so many people making a profit, they need to use sneaky tactics to extract money from you

They bait you with a “$99” offer though there’s typically $1,500 of hidden fees beneath the hood.
They lock you into 2-3 year contracts that contain fine print such as auto-renewal clauses. (Click to find out why the Government is considering making them illegal).
Their alarms use old wired technology and they’re hard to use (so you need to pay a service engineer for even the most straightforward task).




At SimpliSafe, There Are No Middlemen.
SimpliSafe has sliced out shady annual contracts, intrusive installations, and costly middlemen. We designed our system from scratch to give you everything you need in a security system plus some exciting bells and whistles. We sell direct to you, online. Our system is easy to self-install, and we pass the savings onto you with excellent equipment pricing and monthly monitoring for just $14.99/month.

 describes SimpliSafe alarms as

Many alarm companies have absolutely huge sneaky hidden fees. They advertise their alarms as being “from $99”, then they get you to sign a contract for over $1,000—and you can’t leave them for at least 3 years. But SimpliSafe alarms have no hidden charges.
We’re so confident you’ll love your SimpliSafe alarm that we’ll let you try it RISK-FREE with an incredible no-risk 60-day money back guarantee. SimpliSafe alarms are reliable, easy to use, have no annual contracts and
                no hidden costs.

9 Things to Avoid When Choosing A Traditional Alarm Company
We listened to all the things you dislike about traditional burglar alarm companies... then fixed them.




Traditional Alarm Company
SimpliSafe: a Better Way






                        Old wired technology. Traditional alarm companies 
                        want to put wires in your walls, because they know 
                        that ripping their wires out is hard and expensive.
                        



                        State-of-the-art 100% wireless technology. We 
                        took micro-chip technology and 
                        developed smarter software to offer you a robust 
                        and reliable security system. With wireless, there 
                        are no holes in your walls.
                        






                        Monitoring is $42.99 a month.
                        



                        Ours is just $14.99 a month. SimpliSafe protects your home 
                        with COPS Monitoring - named BEST MONITORING in the 
                        Industry by the Central Station Alarm Association.
                        





                        The moment you let them put a system into your home, you’re 
                        typically locked into a $1,547 contract with no way out.
                        



                        No annual contracts! Our customers stay with us because of 
                        our excellent product quality and helpful customer support.
                        





                        Auto-renewal clauses grab another $1,547 from you if you don’t 
                        cancel them within 90 days of the end of your three-year term. 
                        Forget to cancel? You’re legally trapped—there’s no way out.
                        




                        No hidden charges, no 
                        commitments, no sneaky tricks.
                        





                        Many frustrated customers (just google “alarm system 
                        complaints” or “alarm contract complaints” and see 
                        for yourself).
                    



                        Growing by word of mouth. See our Facebook fan page.
                        





                        Uses a phone line to connect to the monitoring center. 
                        Burglars sometimes cut phone lines.
                        



                        Uses its built-in and independent cellular connection, which is 
                        5-10 seconds faster, and is uncuttable. No phone line required.
                        





                        Prices are kept high because there are so many 
                        middlemen and salespeople involved.
                        



                        We don’t have expensive salespeople or middlemen. That’s 
                        how we can afford to keep our prices so low.
                        





                        Installation typically costs between $99 and $500. You’ll 
                        need to take a day off of work, while the installer drills 
                        holes in your walls.
                        



                        Set-up is easier than you could ever imagine. No tools 
                        needed, just adhesive pads. The unit actually talks to you 
                        while you’re setting it up. One of our customers purchased a 
                        second system for his daughter’s home and was “looking 
                        forward to the joy of installing it for her.” Watch our

                        easy installation video to see what he means.
                        

                        Does easy set-up mean the system is flimsy or less secure?  
                        No! Quite the opposite. No wires means there’s nothing for 
                        burglars to cut.
                        




                        As soon as you sign up, there’s no going back: 
                        you cannot cancel even if you try.

Nearly One Million Americans TrustSimpliSafe to Protect Them. Here’s Why:



Dennis R.
Amarillo, TX



This morning at 6:45 AM, my phone rang. It was the SimpliSafe operator, telling me that my alarm was going off. I had them call the police and they were there within minutes. The glass in the back door had been broken but the system worked perfectly and the intruders ran away. We only had to replace a small pane of glass.







Greg W.
Clarksville, TN



Our home was burglarized two weeks ago. I purchased a system that night and installed it within the week. Today, the thieves returned and the alarm scared them off. The officers were at my home within minutes. Nothing was taken.  SimpliSafe works.







Lauren B.
Tacoma, WA



We installed our system and within one week, the water sensor placed at our water heater set off the alarm. Sure enough, the T/P valve had opened on our water heater. The monitoring service alerted us in under 60 seconds. No water damage whatsoever! Way to go Simplisafe! Our system paid for itself that day.







Stephanie T.
Toledo, OH



I love my system. It saved us from thousands of dollars in damage when the power went out in our house in Northern Ohio on the coldest day in February (-17°!). The monitoring center alerted us in Florida that the power was out and the temperature in the house was dropping fast. We were able to contact an electrician to repair the problem. Without the system we never would have known and would have had major freeze damage.






SimpliSafe is recommended by ABC, Fox News, NBC & more!





















“No installation, no annual contracts, very smart.”






“Everything is included, and it’s portable so if you change apartments, you can just bring it with you.”






“David vs Goliath, SimpliSafe vs ADT: 
                SimpliSafe aims to upstage their larger 
                rivals by giving consumers what they really
                 want. Even without fancy marketing, word 
                 is spreading.”  see review

You have a HUGE home: If your home is larger than 20,000 
            square feet (about the size of a football field)—or if it has more 
            than 50 windows on the first floor—you would probably benefit 
            from a system that can handle a huge number of sensors. Our 
            advice would be to go to a traditional contract security company
            —and keep in mind the things we’ve warned you about.


2
You run a large commercial property such as a 
            shopping mall—you would probably benefit from a 
            system that has CCTV or security guards, in which 
            case you should probably go to one of the traditional 
            contract security companies—and keep in mind the 
            things we’ve warned you about.



However, if you’re one of the 95% of people who don’t run a large commercial property, then SimpliSafe is probably the best
            choice for you. If you’re in any doubt, contact one of our security consultants at 1-888-957-4675 for free friendly advice.

“I have had my system for about 6 weeks now my wife and I love it. We just lost power for four days, I took the base to my in-laws and recharged it twice. It worked great during the power outage. I spoke to some neighbors who have also recently got alarms with other companies, they were very upset because their system died pretty quickly and were not able to recharge it.”

Homeowners with big pets love this trick

What is an “auto-renewal clause” anyway?
Most alarm companies have an automatic renewal clause in their monitoring and service contract (and use teeny tiny font). This means that your contract will be renewed for anywhere from 12 months to three years, unless you cancel by mail within 30 days before the end of your contract. Many of the nationwide and local alarm companies use this tactic. Cancelling early usually involves a penalty of 75% to 100% of the value of the contract. 

SimpliSafe offers monthly alarm monitoring. There are no contracts to sign, so there’s no fear of getting tricked by fine print and hidden fees. You can cancel your SimpliSafe alarm monitoring anytime by simply giving us a call.

Buying Guide for Home Security Systems
Introduction to Home Security Systems
There is no greater priority at home than your own safety and the safety of your family. Regardless of the size of your home, you and your family should be able to retire for the night knowing you will be safe when morning comes.
Having a home security alarm system is like having a guard on duty whose sole job is to protect you and your loved ones - and to keep your home safe and secure when you are all away from home.
As well, today's research shows that most thieves look for the easy, quick score, opting for homes with no alarm systems whenever possible. And in 65% of cases where thieves do burgle a protected home, the alarm system prevents them from carrying out the robbery.
Best of all, home security systems today are more feature-rich than at any other time in history. Present systems often include motion sensors, temperature change sensors and the ability to send auto-alerts to friends and neighbors if the system is tripped or tampered with.
This website will give you the information you need to make informed choices about the best home security system to keep your family and belongings safe.
Features & Add-Ons
You are likely familiar with the basic function of a home security system. But as mentioned previously, present systems are more integrated and feature-rich than ever before to ensure your safety and protection.
New standard features include these:

Two-way monitoring.With this feature, you can communicate back and forth with the central site that is monitoring your system. Your home system has a built-in intercom feature in the security keypad for verifying identity and real-time communication.
A failsafe backup system.This feature ensures that no matter what, your system will be able to continue doing its job of monitoring your home. Today's systems often have multi-tiered backup features, including a battery backup and radio/cell backup so even if you have no phone service your system still runs.
Remote control. You can use a small device to turn your system on or off from several feet away without needing your passcode.

Add-on features include these:

A monitored smoke alarm.By tying your smoke alarm into your security system your home is monitored for fire as well as theft.
A panic button.This remote-operated button can be carried with you and used to set off your alarm from a distance of up to 75 feet.
Pet immunity.This feature exempts pets (up to 65 lbs.) from tripping your alarm system via a pet door or in other ways.
Video Surveillance.With this feature, you can incorporate television and video feeds for enhanced monitoring.

Comparing Alarm Companies
There are only about 10 alarm system manufacturers in the United States. However, there are many more independent resellers who are eager for your business.
Here, what you don't want is as important as what you do want. You do want to select a reseller that offers fast, reliable monitoring and response times. You do want a system that is easy to install and operate. You do want options for extra features. What you don't want is a proprietary system that would not work if you ever decide to leave the home security company because you are dissatisfied with their service!
How to choose a reseller:

Look for positive customer testimonials online.
 Get at least 3-4 quotes so you have a very good idea of what your options are and a price range to use for negotiating.
 Only consider companies that want to meet you at your home to do a risk assessment before generating your quote.
 Get all quotes in writing and be sure your quote includes everything.
 Talk to current customers to see how happy they are (a reputable reseller should be happy to provide you with references).
 Be sure you read all the fine print before signing anything.

Pricing
In most cases, you will pay once to purchase the equipment and installation, and then you will pay monthly for maintenance and monitoring. There may be additional fees and charges as well depending on what add-on features you choose.
In general, here is what you can expect to spend:

 Equipment and installation: $100 to $1,500.
 Basic monitoring: $25 to $50 per month.
Adding fire protection: $60 more for setup and $5 more per month.
 Adding dual tech sensors: $50 to $200 more per year.
 Adding backup: $5 to $10 more per month.
 Adding remote control(s): $25 to $200 more per year (wired systems only).
 Police permit (where needed): $5 to $40 more per year.

Buying Tips
Your family will also have an adjustment after you have the new home security system installed.
These tips will help:

Never program your system to call 911.This is illegal and also renders the monitoring service pointless.
Be sure to get your insurance discount.You may save up to 20 percent just for having your system installed.
Always set the system before you leave.If you don't always set the system, the money you spend nets you nothing.
Consider a duress code. Just in case you are ever forced to disable your system, you will have that option.
Keep contact with your vendor and neighbors.Be sure you notify your vendor and neighbors about any changes you make to your system.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
