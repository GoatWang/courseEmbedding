Ellen DeGeneres' Oscar Selfie Part of Samsung Phone Product Placement: Report

        By
        
         Rachel McRady

March 7, 2014










            
            The "impromptu" Oscars selfie with A-List stars could have actually been Samsung phone placement.

Endearing, spontaneous moment or basic product placement? Host Ellen DeGeneres helped bring in record-breaking numbers on Sunday, March 2 with the live telecast of the 86th annual Academy Awards, which was watched by 43 million viewers according to the Hollywood Reporter. And one of her biggest moments of the night was when she rounded up 10 of Hollywood's elite for an "impromptu" selfie -- which in turn birthed the most retweeted item ever. 

PHOTOS: Best-dressed men at the Oscars

It began, of course, with DeGeneres asking Oscar winner Meryl Streep to participate in a selfie with her and then other winners and nominees like Jared Leto, Jennifer Lawrence, Channing Tatum, Julia Roberts, Bradley Cooper, Kevin Spacey, Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie, and Lupita Nyong'o quickly jumped in. 
But in plan view was the large white Samsung Galaxy Note 3 phone Cooper used to take the photo. The Wall Street Journal doesn't think this was a coincidence. 

PHOTOS: Oscars after parties

"As part of its sponsorship and ad pact for the Oscars  with ABC, the TV network airing the show, Samsung and its media buying firm Starcom MediaVest negotiated to have its Galaxy smartphone integrated into the show, according to two people familiar with the matter," the Journal reports. 
The site also reported that Samsung executives trained DeGeneres to use the Galaxy phone prior to the show.

"It was a great plug for the Samsung brand," Allen Adamson, managing director at Landor Associates, a branding firm owned by WPP PLC told the Journal. "Ellen's selfie is going to be more impactful than their commercials. You can't buy that magic of going viral."

Love. Loss. Humorous disenchantment. SAT Vocabulary. In this book, Ellen Cooper shares her nonsense utilizing various literary formats such as short stories, play scripts, lists, emails, poetry, and image captions.
 
You will hear the worst pick up line ever, play a round of D&D, spend some time with immortals, and even discover a lost Disney princess.

Some of it may be profound. But most of it is probably malarkey.

Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Form
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.

We help people distribute information and art spanning a wide range of subject matter while providing a safe, friendly, respectful, and serious site for all content creators. Since our community serves a broad range of ages, we do not encourage content that could make a majority of our users uncomfortable."

Lulu abides by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), which governs how we are to treat claims of copyright infringement. If someone believes in good faith that a Lulu Account Holder has infringed their copyright, they can request that we take down the infringing material by filing a DMCA Notice. To file a DMCA Notice with Lulu, click on the button "Continue".
We reserve the right to ignore a Notice that is not in compliance with the DMCA. When a clear and valid Notice is received pursuant to the guidelines, we will respond by either taking down the allegedly infringing content or blocking access to it, and we may also contact you for more information.
If you are not the copyright holder or its agent and if the content is clearly infringing the copyright of a well-known work, please select "Infringes a well-known work" from the dropdown menu.

			Red Hat recipes. Filled with over 1,000 recipes from the world's most divine ladies, "The Red Hat Society Cookbook" adds special spice to your life. Sue Ellen Cooper, exalted Queen Mother of the Red Hat Society, says "Life is Short, eat dessert first," and that is why this book begins with 250 dessert recipes. The book also includes stories and pictures submitted by members from all over the world.  The Red Hat Society began when founder Sue Ellen Cooper--inspired by a poem--presented a friend with a red hat as a gift. It started a nationwide craze that doesn't stop with red hats!  596 pages.  Printed in USA.

 F00970 - &quot;The Red Hat Society Cookbook&quot; Introduced by SueEllen Cooper

 A great cookbook and Society, too!
 I am an avid Red Hatter and most of us have the "eat out and play more" thing going these days, but I love this cookbook. If I am going to HAVE to cook, I trust recipes from my Red Hat Sisters to be tried and true.
I also know that a huge number of recipes were submitted and passed on, so these are the best of the best.
Red Hatters do love dessert [we eat it first when we can!] so there are some wonderful dessert items, plust great dishes for family dinners and potluck with the girls.
If you haven't worn a purple outfit, put a beautiful red hat on your head that would make the most famous of haberdashers green with envy, set out your finest china, and presented your most delicious culinery specialty to your friends assembled, then you haven't tasted all that life has to offer.
Goog food, good friends, good times, they say. Well, add some purple and red, a lot of laughter, and wonderful recipes, and try it the Red Hat way. You won't be disappointed.

 Wonderful Recipes!
 The book is full of wonderful recipes and some long forgotten recipes I have not seen since my grandmother's time. The Black Russian Cake is to die for, easy, moist and flavorful. I made that one for Christmas dinner. A favorite in my cookbook collection!

 Great! Great! Great!
 I am a cookbook collector. I admit there are lots of books that I don't use too often. Not this one!! I have made dozens of recipes out of this book. The Strawberry YaYa cake being one that I have made several times. It is delicious. I am planning on giving this cookbook to several people for Christmas. I know they'll enjoy it as much as I do. There are loads of recipes that I am still planning on making. All of them look delicious.Try it, you'll like it!

Ellen and Bradley Cooper Take On Twitter's 'Nugget Boy' | Time.comEntertainmentSearchSearchSign InrussiaRussia Orders a Reduction in U.S. Diplomats in Response to Fresh SanctionsSpainA Commuter Train Accident in Barcelona Has Injured About 50 PeopleCOMPARECARDSSPONSOREDPakistanPakistan's Top Court Disqualifies Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif From OfficeHost Ellen DeGeneres shares a laugh with Oscar nominees after taking a group "selfie" during the 86th Annual Academy Awards. Robert Gauthier—Getty/LA TimescelebritiesEllen and Bradley Cooper Refuse to Let Nugget Boy Come for Their Retweet RecordLisa Marie SegarraApr 14, 2017Ellen DeGeneres and Bradley Cooper are campaigning to retain their retweet record as Twitter's 'Nugget Boy' inches closer to surpassing them.Carter Wilkerson, 16, asked Wendy's on Twitter how many retweets he would need to get a year's worth of free chicken nuggets.Their response of "18 Million" sparked a mission for the Nevada teenager. Wilkerson's tweet is now at over 2.8 million retweets, falling short of his goal but gaining on DeGeneres's Oscar selfie tweet with 3.3 million retweets.Not trying to keep a teenager from his chicken nuggets, DeGeneres asked that people simply retweet both Wilkerson's and her tweets."If you think I'm going to lose that record to some chicken nugget kid, you are out of your cluckin' mind," DeGeneres said on her show.She and Bradley Cooper created a public service announcement asking that people retweet her photo. The two appealed to the audience noting that Cooper had to hold up his arms for "35 to 40 seconds," and DeGeneres "was sitting in Meryl Streep's lap for an uncomfortably long time."Wendy's has pledged to donate $100,000 to adoption non-profit Dave Thomas Foundation if and when Wilkerson breaks DeGeneres's retweet record.Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers© 2017 Time Inc.

                    Since the enactment of the gender equality laws in the USA in the mid 1970s, scholars and policy makers have placed much focus on the situation of women within management. In this authoritative collection, the editors have brought together seminal articles by leading academics to demonstrate that there continues to be differences between equal opportunities policies and work place practices. Areas covered in this excellent two-volume set include career breaks and the gender pay gap, women and work-life integration, the glass ceiling, and gender and diversity. This topical reference collection will be of immense value to scholars researching women in management and gender in management for many years to come.
