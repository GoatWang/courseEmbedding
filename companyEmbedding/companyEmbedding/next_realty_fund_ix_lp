 The Next Perspective in Real Estate®
 













 













Case Studies












Since 2000, Next Realty has made over 60 investments on behalf of its affiliates and sponsored funds.  The investments exceed $500,000,000 in gross asset value, totaling nearly 2,000,000 square feet of retail space and over 3,500 parking spaces nationwide. 
Our investor base is made up of both high net worth individuals and institutional joint-venture partners.





Currently, Next Realty is investing capital on behalf of Next Realty Fund VIII, LP and will shortly launch its next investment vehicle, Next Realty Fund IX, LP.
Next Realty focuses on the acquisition and management of retail properties and parking facilities throughout the United States.  The assets shown below are examples of prior Next Realty investments.





Institutional Parking Joint-Venture:
Philadelphia Parking Portfolio
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania











In November 2004, Next Realty together with an institutional joint-venture partner, acquired a parking portfolio consisting of two garages totaling 700 spaces in Center City Philadelphia.
Shortly thereafter, in April 2006, Next Realty was successful in selling one of the assets and returning all of the equity to the investors.
With the remaining asset, Next Realty re-negotiated a parking lease and repositioned the retail component by upgrading the tenant mix.
In May 2015, Next Realty secured what is believed to be an attractive offer and successfully completed the sale.  The sale resulted in a Net Internal Rate of Return of approximately 54% and a Net Return Multiple of approximately 3.2x to the investors during the 10.5 year hold period.  





Redevelopment Opportunity:
350 South Waukegan Road
Deerfield, Illinois
In September 2011, Next Realty acquired four nonperforming cross-collateralized loans secured by a restaurant building and other collateral.  Subsequently, Next Realty took title to the property and sold the other collateral, which helped reduce the basis.  
The original business plan involved converting the former restaurant into a multi-tenant retail building.  Ultimately, Next Realty was successful at identify a higher and better use for the property and entered into a long-term lease with Northwestern Memorial Hospital (“NWMH”). During the following 12 months, Next Realty obtained the necessary municipal approvals and redeveloped the property into a two-story medical office building.  NWMH opened for business in April 2013.
Upon completion, the property was listed for sale at what was believed to be an aggressive asking price, and received numerous offers.  The property was sold in July 2013, within 2% of the asking price. The sale resulted in a Net Internal Rate of Return of approximately 57% and a Net Return Multiple of approximately 2.2x to the investors during the 22 month hold period.  





Before:





After:






Parking Privatization:
Fountain Alley Parking Lot
San Jose, California
In October 2011, Next Realty Fund VII, LP (“NRF VII”) acquired a 54,000 square foot, 160-space parking lot in the historic district of downtown San Jose. The property was being auctioned-off by the San Jose Redevelopment Agency and presented what was believed to be a prime opportunity to privatize the operations.
Prior ownership was not maximizing the operation, charging significantly below market rates and subsidizing parking for many of the local businesses. Furthermore, there was significant slippage in revenue due to lack of automated controls.
After acquiring the property, NRF VII hired a new management company, installed state-of-the-art parking access and revenue control system (PARCS) and overhauled the operation. Cashiers were eliminated and new ticket dispensers, gates, exit verifiers and pay-on-foot machines were installed.  At the same time, rates were realigned and the average ticket price increased substantially.  As a result, the net operating income increased by more than 250 percent.
In December 2014, NRF VII sold the Fountain Alley Parking Lot to a local developer, generating what is believed to be an attractive return for the investors.  Because this investment was part of NRF VII, returns are only reported on a fund-level.  Fund VII continues to own and operate several remaining properties.























Asset Repositioning:
Oak Lawn Promenade
Oak Lawn, Illinois
Oak Lawn Promenade is a 32,000 square foot neighborhood shopping center located in a busy intersection across from the Chicago Ridge Mall.
In December 2013, Next Realty Fund VII, LP (“NRF VII”) acquired the property from a distressed owner.  The transaction was completed within 17 days of the date that NRF VII reached an agreement with the seller, and it was acquired all-cash.
Upon acquisition, NRF VII implemented an extensive capital improvement plan.  The façade was replaced in its entirety and extensive repairs were made to the roof, parking lot and sidewalks.  Furthermore, a new pylon sign was installed.  Due to the physical improvements to the center, and the active asset management as compared to the previous owner, NRF VII was able to reposition the property and upgrade the tenant mix.
The property was refinanced in July 2014, and NRF VII investors received a significant portion of their initial invested equity. The property is currently 100 percent leased and continues to generate what is believed to be an attractive cash flow stream. 











Next Equity Program (NEP) Joint-Venture:
Evergreen Square Shopping Center
Peoria, Illinois
Evergreen Square is a 110,000 square-foot community shopping center featuring a diverse mix of national tenants including T.J. Maxx, Petco, Party City and Dollar Tree.  
In January 2014, Next Realty Fund VIII, LP (“NRF III”) and an operating partner acquired the property from a lender who had previously foreclosed on the property.  Despite the tertiary nature of the market, NRF VIII purchased the property at what is believed to be an attractive basis, and was successful at expanding several key tenants and securing long-term occupancy for the asset.
Given the strong demand for income producing assets and availability of attractive financing, in August 2015, Evergreen Square was sold to a private investor.  NRF VIII was able to achieve what is believed to be a profit on this property in a short period of time. Because this investment was part of NRF VIII, returns are only reported on a fund-level.   NRF VIII continues to own and operate a diversified portfolio of properties.























Institutional Retail Join-Venture:
Lincolnshire Commons
Lincolnshire, Illinois
Lincolnshire Commons is a 130,000 square foot destination shopping center with a strong mix of high-end restaurants, fashion-oriented shops and convenience-based retail.  The property was built in 2006 by General Growth Properties.  Major tenants at the property include The Cheesecake Factory, Fleming’s and Kona Grill.  
In September 2014, after a year of negotiations, Next Realty Fund VIII, LP (“NRF VIIV”) and an institutional joint-venture partner completed the acquisition of Lincolnshire Commons.  At that time, the anchor tenant building was occupied by Barnes & Noble at significantly below market rent.  The business plan for this asset involves re-tenanting the anchor building with a stronger national tenant at market terms.
To that end, NRF VIII successfully identified a suitable replacement tenant and negotiated a long-term lease with NorthShore University HealthSystem.  The building has been turned over to NorthShore and they have commenced their build-out.  The tenant is projected to begin occupancy by the end of 2016.
In order to maintain the high image of Lincolnshire Commons and continue to attract additional tenants to the shopping center, NRF VIII has been making capital improvements to the property including landscaping, lighting and parking lot repairs. Furthermore, NRF VIII is in the process of obtaining approvals from the Village of Lincolnshire for three new pylon signs.  This is expected to improve the visibility of the tenants from the road and contribute to the image and intrinsic value of the property on a long-term basis.
















Asset Repositioning:
4600 Plaza
Harwood Heights, Illinois
4600 Plaza is a 32,000 square foot neighborhood shopping center in an infill location along a major retail corridor in Harwood Heights, Illinois.  The trade area surrounding 4600 Plaza has enjoyed historically high occupancy of approximately 99 percent.
In February 2015, Next Realty Fund VIII, LP (“NRF VIII”) completed the acquisition of 4600 Plaza from a local owner who primarily operates office properties.  4600 Plaza was the only retail property in the seller’s portfolio and its value was not being maximized.  The business plan for this asset involves upgrading the physical condition of the building, improving the tenant mix and raising rental rates over time.
In less than a year, NRF VIII relocated several tenants, renegotiated some of the leases, and finalized a lease with American Mattress for the entire end-cap space at a substantially higher rent than what was paid by the former tenants.  As a result, the net operating income increased by more than 100 percent.  4600 Plaza is currently 100 percent leased and continues to generate what is believed to be an attractive cash flow stream.
In order to be able to continue to improve the tenant mix and further increase rents, NRF VIII is commencing a façade renovation project. This project is expected to contribute to the intrinsic value of the property long-term.

In its second large property disposition this spring, TA Realty LLC sold a six-property, 2,514-unit multifamily portfolio to Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust for $430 million. TA Realty sold the portfolio on behalf of The Realty Associates Fund IX LP. Earlier this month, TA Realty sold a 45-property industrial and office portfolio from the fund to Brookfield-managed real estate funds for $854.5 million. Realty Associates Fund IX was formed in 2007 and has hit a 10-year investment cycle. "We believe the outcome of this transaction represents compelling value for Fund IX investors,” said Tom Landry, managing partner at TA Realty. “The price we were able to command for this well-located portfolio of apartment communities reflects the significant value created through strategic operational and capital improvements over the ownership period.” The apartment communities that comprise the portfolio are located across four states in such major markets as Dallas, Chicago and Orlando.  Though TA did not identify the individual properties, the deal includes a 461-unit complex in Orlando that sold for $105 million ($227,765/unit) last week, according to CoStar (See Sales COMP #3882359). Blackstone REIT is also accquring the following properties.The Preserve at Osprey, Gurnee, IL, 483 units;San Merano at Mirasol, Palm Beach Gardens, FL, 479 units;Estates at Park Avenue, Orlando, FL, 432 units;Keller Springs Apartments, Dallas, TX, 353 units; andWest End at City Center, Lenexa, KS, 309 units. [Editor's Note: This story was updated April 20 to include the full list of properties purchased.] The TA Realty team members involved in the transactions include partners Nicole Dutra Grinnell, Michael Haggerty, Jim Raisides and dispositions officer Luke Marchand. JLL represented TA Realty in the sale.  TA Realty Sells Industrial, Office Portfolio to Brookfield for $854.5 MillionApril 4, 2017 Blackstone Acquires Grocery-Anchored Center for $52.4 MillionApril 18, 2017

Our funds generally take an opportunistic approach to global real estate investing. While operating amid widely disparate economic environments over the past 25 years, our funds have shared a focus on acquiring assets with strong potential fundamentals at a significant discount to replacement cost.




Opportunistic
STARWOOD GLOBAL OPPORTUNITY FUND X (SOF X)
Starwood Capital closed its 10th global opportunistic real estate fund in March 2015, with capital commitments from more than 100 investors globally totaling $5.6 billion—the Firm’s largest fund to date. SOF X continues the successful approach of its predecessor funds, with a focus on acquiring, developing and repositioning high-quality assets in nearly every major real estate asset class with strong fundamentals. At the same time, the Fund seeks investments that can generate consistent and growing cash-on-cash returns either sourced directly, in partnerships, or joint ventures. The major change with SOF X’s investment strategy is an increased focus on Europe, as we expect a growing number of opportunities to emerge from the region. Leveraging its robust pipeline, Starwood Capital through SOF X is well-positioned to invest opportunistically in compelling properties around the world, while continuing to be patient and thus avoid rushing to compete for overpriced transactions.
Starwood Distressed Opportunity Fund IX (SOF IX)
Starwood Capital closed its ninth global opportunistic real estate fund in April 2013, with $4.2 billion of total capital commitments from more than 100 investors around the world. The portfolio is diversified by both geography and product type, and has been constructed to focus on strong cash returns during the investment period. SOF IX has continued the successful strategy of predecessor fund SOF VIII, but with an increased focus on Europe. The Fund’s primary investment themes are centered on distressed debt (loan-to-own), value-add income assets (inflation hedge), corporate transactions and land/development opportunities.
Starwood Global Opportunity Fund VIII (SOF VIII)
Starwood Capital closed its eighth global opportunistic real estate fund in March 2010, with total equity commitments of $1.83 billion. Due to global uncertainty and volatility during our investment period, we focused on “margin of safety.” One clear measure of this approach is overall leverage that is extremely low for any type of fund, but especially for a real estate opportunity fund. We also sought investments that provided downside protection, asymmetric risk/reward profiles and hedges against inflation. The Fund pursued five major investment themes: land/residential, value-add income assets, distressed debt, corporate transactions and global hospitality. Our transaction sourcing is a key advantage for the Firm—and the vast majority of SOF VIII was sourced off-market in noncompetitive, privately negotiated transactions or through the bankruptcy process.
Starwood Global Opportunity Fund VII (SOF VII)
Starwood Capital closed its seventh global opportunistic fund in December 2005, with total equity commitments of $1.48 billion. SOF VII sought to construct a diversified portfolio by investing in undervalued real estate and real estate-related assets and operating companies globally across all property types, including hotel and leisure, multifamily and residential, office, senior housing and mixed-use developments. In numerous cases, we pursued a strategy that leveraged our best-in-class asset management team to invest capital and create incremental value within the properties.
Starwood Global Opportunity Fund VI (SOF VI)
Starwood Capital closed its sixth global opportunistic fund in February 2002, with total equity commitments of $567 million. SOF VI targeted both corporate opportunities and a variety of niche strategies. The Firm utilized its strong joint-venture platforms to expand its international investments in France, the U.K. and Germany, and to grow its senior housing and residential land investments in the U.S. We also combined the discipline of fundamental real estate investing with our knowledge of operating businesses to pursue compelling investments in the hotel and golf sectors.
Starwood Global Opportunity Fund V (SOF V)
Starwood Capital closed its fifth global opportunistic fund in April 1999, with total equity commitments of $516 million. We pursued a diversified strategy with an emphasis on the residential and retail markets, and constructed and/or redeveloped condominium projects in major cities. We also formed a series of joint ventures to acquire and redevelop retail properties. SOF V also featured the Firm’s first investment in the senior housing sector. A major initiative was the formation of investment platforms in Asia and Europe. With these efforts, Starwood Capital established a global presence that continues to expand to this day.
Starwood Opportunity Fund IV (SOF IV)
Starwood Capital closed its fourth global opportunistic fund in February 1997, with total equity commitments of $830 million. Our goal with the Fund was to combine Starwood Capital’s successful equity investment strategies with its expertise in high-yielding mezzanine investments. The result was a balanced portfolio with investments across mezzanine debt, hotel debt, mixed-use complexes, residential land development, retail and leisure-related assets. In March 1998, the Firm contributed SOF IV’s debt investments, combined with those of Starwood Mezzanine, to form iStar Financial, Inc., providing investors with increased liquidity in one of the nation’s leading commercial real estate finance companies.
Starwood Opportunity Fund II (SOF II)
Starwood Capital closed its second fund in November 1993, with $102 million of equity commitments. Utilizing its growing local partner network, the Firm sought to capitalize on opportunities resulting from distressed sellers, over-leveraged or mismanaged assets and the shortage of entrepreneurial capital in the market. The diversified portfolio consisted of hotel, office, land and multifamily assets across the United States. All of these investments were purchased at substantial discounts to replacement cost.
Starwood Opportunity Funds I and IA (SOF I)
Starwood Capital created its first opportunity funds in February 1991 and March 1993, respectively, with $52 million of equity commitments, to take advantage of capital dislocations in the real estate markets. After extensive bottom-up research, the Firm focused on acquiring multifamily units in domestic markets with improving fundamentals and limited competition. Starwood Capital purchased approximately 6,400 multifamily properties through an aggressive acquisition program that included equity and distressed debt from the Resolution Trust Corp., FDIC, savings & loan associations, over-leveraged partnerships and tax-exempt bondholders. Just 18 months after their organization, the Funds contributed the majority of their multifamily portfolio to an operating partnership controlled by Equity Residential Properties Trust (NYSE: EQR), a newly formed real estate investment trust, in exchange for operating partnership units convertible to shares of EQR stock. EQR went on to become the largest publicly traded apartment owner in the country. This transaction marked the first of numerous leading real estate platforms or companies that Starwood Capital would help create throughout its history.


Hotel
Starwood Capital Global Hospitality Fund II (Hotel II)
Starwood Capital closed its second dedicated hospitality fund in March 2010, with total equity commitments of $965 million. Utilizing low leverage, Hotel II focused on four core investment themes: superior cash flow-generating assets, major rebranding/repositioning opportunities, iconic assets and development/redevelopment opportunities in New York City, one of the nation’s strongest hotel markets. Nearly 90% of investments were sourced in noncompetitive, privately negotiated transactions or through the bankruptcy process—and most were purchased at prices significantly below replacement cost.
Starwood Capital Global Hospitality Fund I (Hotel I)
Following Barry Sternlicht’s departure from Starwood Hotels & Resorts, Starwood Capital raised its first dedicated hospitality fund in November 2005, with total equity commitments of $900 million. Through Hotel I, Starwood Capital continued its acquisition program in the hotel and leisure sector, with investments in luxury and budget hotels, extended-stay hotels, resorts, restaurants, leisure/entertainment properties, and island and hotel development opportunities.


Debt
Starwood Debt Fund II (Debt II)
Starwood Capital closed its second debt fund in January 2009, with total equity commitments of $378 million. Operating amid an exceedingly challenging recessionary environment, Debt II sought to capitalize on dislocations in the U.S. and global credit markets. The Fund focused on a full range of performing debt investments, including first mortgages, junior notes, commercial mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds and mezzanine debt.
Starwood Mezzanine Investors (Starwood Mezzanine)
Convinced that equity pricing of real estate markets was reaching full value, we were one of the first equity investment firms to shift into the mezzanine market. We closed our third fund in November 1994, with total equity commitments of $220 million. The goal of the Fund was to create a portfolio of high-yielding mezzanine investments with significant current cash flow and positions in the capital structure that were at substantial discounts to replacement cost. Starwood Mezzanine invested across a range of multifamily, hotel, resort, office and land development assets. As a result, Starwood Capital attained a leading position in the developing mezzanine market by combining the Firm’s underwriting strength with its ability to creatively structure custom-tailored financing.
