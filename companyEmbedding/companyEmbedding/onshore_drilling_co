BP U.S.


What we do


Exploration and Production



Exploration and Production






BP’s oil and gas exploration and production division is one of its core businesses, globally and in the United States. Teams in the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska and onshore areas of the lower 48 states are responsible for finding and safely extracting the energy resources America needs.
Gulf of Mexico
Nearly three decades after BP began exploring the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the company remains one of the region’s leading oil and gas producers, with lease blocks covering an area more than twice the size of Delaware. In fact, BP has been the largest energy investor in the deepwater Gulf over the past decade.
Between 2013 and 2015, its average daily production in the region increased from 189,000 barrels of oil equivalent to 249,000. This reflects BP’s continued investment at its four massive Gulf of Mexico production platforms: Atlantis, Na Kika, Thunder Horse and Mad Dog. Elsewhere in the gulf, the company holds interests in four hubs that other companies operate: Mars, Olympus, Ursa and Great White.
Alaska
BP has spent more than half a century exploring and developing Alaska’s oil and gas resources, and its operations in and around the giant Prudhoe Bay field, located on the North Slope, account for around 55 percent of the state’s oil and gas production.
Since Prudhoe Bay began production in 1977, it has generated more than 12 billion barrels of oil — far exceeding initial projections — thanks in part to enhanced oil recovery technologies that BP pioneered. Four decades after starting up, Prudhoe Bay remains one of North America’s largest oil fields.
Lower 48
In the lower 48 states, BP’s onshore business now is independently operated but still wholly owned. BP chose to separate its lower 48 operations so they could be more flexible and agile, and thus more competitive, in a rapidly changing environment.
Headquartered in Houston, its operations span five states — Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming — and seven oil and gas basins, covering an area (5.7 million net acres) roughly the size of New Jersey. In 2015, BP’s average daily oil and gas production in the Lower 48 was about 284,000 barrels of oil equivalent.













Alaska
Alaska remains one of BP’s leading resource basins. After more than 36 years of production, the North Slope still has a large amount of the discovered oil and gas remaining.














Gulf of Mexico
BP and its heritage companies have been at work in the Gulf of Mexico since the 1950s, and it has been exploring in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico (depths greater than 1,200 feet) for more than a quarter century.














U.S. Lower 48
The U.S. Lower 48 business has significant activities producing natural gas, NGLs and condensate across seven states, including production from unconventional gas, coalbed methane (CBM) and shale gas assets.

Meet the men and women who continuously improve safety across BP’s operations.









DAVID McZEAL
From engineers to team leads to field techs, we’re always passing knowledge down the line. We share a common meeting table where we openly discuss the details of our daily events. These discussions allow us to see various ways to safely approach work scenarios. More than any job I’ve had in this industry, I feel incredibly safe knowing there’s always someone to go to for an answer, no matter the question. I’m proud to work for such a goal-driven company that’s as committed to safety as BP.









ELIZABETH CHIRAYIL
Safety at BP’s wind farms starts with observation. My team’s job is to be deeply aware of what’s happening in our surroundings. My team may not be climbing turbines, but we still have an intense obligation to foster BP’s safety culture. We want each employee to get home safe. Back to their families. Back to their lives. We want everyone to feel protected, because they are. It’s an attitude that affects you even if you’re not turning the crank.









JESSICA LAMBERT
As an engineer, I look at ways to build efficient systems. At BP, “efficient” always means “safe” first. I’m encouraged to look beyond the system to consider our colleagues who will actually carry out the job and think about the impact of the work on them. The workers are key to any system’s efficiency — so their safety needs to be paramount. I am not going to ask them to do anything I would not be willing to do myself. If it isn’t safe enough for me, it’s not efficient for anyone.









MAX DAVIES
An outsider to the industry may expect the emphasis on safety to be made along the front lines offshore. As a drilling engineer, I support rig site personnel from behind the scenes to deliver a safe and compliant operation. Even though I only visit the rigs a few times a year, I’m just as focused on safe operations as those on the platform.

Onshore Drilling

        Application Onshore or land base drilling is defined as drilling with rigs that are moved in by ground transportation and the drilling site is not over water.  Many of these wells are now being drilled using a technique called pad drilling where multiple wells are drilled from the same site in very close proximity of each other by shifting the rig slightly.  Typically, these are mature fields, pushing the drilling envelope farther to more challenging well formations like new shale fields or very deep wells. Onshore drilling profiles vary from: Shallow to deep wellsExtended reach to ultra-extended reach wellsVertical to deviated wells. Challenges  Onshore drilling has many different challenges related to industry economics, equipment used, location of the field, well profile and formations.Rig day rates make running a rig expensive, which means that the speed of rigging down, moving and rigging up is crucial to guarantee project success. Drilling equipment has to be reliable and easy to handle on the rig floor.The physical location of the well site sets limits on the size and type of drilling equipment and sometimes the drill string. Well sites in Arctic areas, for example, have surface equipment and downhole equipment that are exposed to surface temperatures for long periods before use, which can impact their performance.Well profiles and formations determine drill string requirements:H2S wells require use of special steels to avoid Sulfide Stress            Cracking.Wells with drilled depths >30,000 ft require the drill pipe in the          upper part of the string will need to have high tensile strength.Extended reach wells and ultra-extended reach wells can be                   difficult to drill because they can be limited by the increased torque                   and drag of the drill string in the cutting bed and by the complex          profiles.Small clearance wells will drive ECD's higher, put additional           stress on formations and increase circulation pressures. Products & Solutions  Vallourec Drilling Products offers custom drill strings to meet onshore challenges head-on:High performance connections that can be matched with ODs     and IDs to provide the optimized torque, and tensile and hydraulic    impact for the particular program.Multiple grades and weights (wall thickness):High strength grade thin wall drill pipe can be used to produce light weight strong drill strings for extended reach wells.High strength grade thick wall drill pipe can be used to produce high strength drill strings for deep wells requiring high tensile capacity.Special sized drill pipe can be optimized for hydraulics, clearance, and collapse for extended reach wells.Special drill pipe chemistry and heat treat processes for exposure      to low temperatures.Drill string products for H2S environmentsHydroclean products for continuous well bore cleaning during drilling.  Find Out MoreClick here to learn more about our proprietary VAM® Express™ ConnectionClick here to learn more about our proprietary VAM EIS® ConnectionClick here to learn more about our proprietary VAM® CDS™ ConnectionClick here to learn more about our proprietary Sour Service GradesClick here to learn more about our proprietary Arctic GradesClick here to learn more about our proprietary High Strength GradesClick here to learn more about our proprietary Hydroclean® product line

Onshore Drilling

Drilling into the Earth in the hopes of uncovering valuable resources is nothing new. In fact, the digging of water and irrigation wells dates back to the beginning of recorded history. At first, these wells were primarily dug by hand, then by crude stone or wood tools. Metallurgy brought about the use of iron and bronze tools to delve beneath the Earth’s surface, and innovations led to more efficient ways of removing debris from the newly dug hole. The first recorded instance of the practice of ‘drilling’ holes in the ground came about around 600 B.C., when the Chinese developed a technique of repeatedly pounding bamboo shoots capped with metal bits into the ground. This crude technology was the first appearance of what is known today as ‘percussion drilling,’ a method of drilling that is still in use. Much advancement has been made since these first bamboo drilling implements. This section will cover the basics of modern onshore natural gas drilling practices.
There are two main types of onshore drilling. Percussion, or ‘cable tool’ drilling, consists of raising and dropping a heavy metal bit into the ground, effectively punching a hole down through the earth. Cable tool drilling is usually used for shallow, low pressure formations. The second drilling method is known as rotary drilling, and consists of a sharp, rotating metal bit used to drill through the Earth’s crust. This type of drilling is used primarily for deeper wells, which may be under high pressure.
Cable Tool Drilling
Cable tool, or percussion drilling, is recognized by many as the first drilling method employed to dig wells into the earth for the purpose of reaching petroleum deposits and water. This method is still in use in some of the shallow wells in the Appalachian Basin, although rotary drilling has taken over the bulk of modern drilling activities.
The basic concept for cable tool drilling consists of repeatedly dropping a heavy metal bit into the ground, eventually breaking through rock and punching a hole through to the desired depth. The bit, usually a blunt, chisel shaped instrument, can vary with the type of rock that is being drilled. Water is used in the well hole to combine with all of the drill cuttings, and is periodically bailed out of the well when this ‘mud’ interferes with the effectiveness of the drill bit.






Early Percussion Rigs in Pennsylvania – Late 1800’s


Source: Office of Fossil Energy, DOE



Cable tool drilling has historically taken many forms. In the early days of percussion drilling, equipment was very crude compared to today’s technology. The ‘springpole’ technique, used in the early 1800s, consisted of a flexible pole (usually a tree trunk) anchored at one end, and laying across a fulcrum, much like a diving board. The flexible pole, or springpole, would have a heavy bit attached at the loose end. In order to get the bit to strike the ground, workers would use their own body weight to bend the pole toward the ground, allowing the bit to strike rock. The tension in the pole would spring the bit free, in case it became stuck in the ground.
Many improvements have been made since these early percussion rigs. In fact, it was from cable tool drilling that one of the most important drilling advancements was made. In 1806, David and Joseph Ruffner were using the springpole technique to drill a well in West Virginia. In order to prevent their well from collapsing, they used hollow tree trunks to reinforce the sides of the well, and to keep water and mud from entering the well as they dug. They are credited as the first drillers to use a casing in their well – an advancement that made drilling much more efficient and easily accomplished. It is believed by many that ‘Colonel’ Drake’s 1856 well achieved success due to the use of steel casing to reinforce the well. Drake’s well was drilled using steam powered cable tool drilling methods. For more information on well casings, and well completion, click here.






A Modern, Mobile Cable Tool Drilling Rig

Innovations, such as the use of steam power in cable tool drilling, greatly increased the efficiency and range of percussion drilling. Conventional man-powered cable tool rigs were generally used to drill wells 200 feet or less, while steam powered cable tool rigs, consisting of the familiar derrick design, had an average drilling depth of 400 to 500 feet. The deepest known well dug with cable tool drilling was completed in 1953, when the New York Natural Gas Corporation drilled a well to a depth of 11,145 feet.
Despite the historical significance of cable tool drilling, modern drilling activity has shifted mainly toward rotary drilling methods. However, the foundation of knowledge laid by years of cable tool drilling is, in many cases, directly transferable to the practice of rotary drilling.
 
Horizontal Drilling
Horizontal drilling is flexible in that it allows for the extraction of natural gas that had previously not been feasible.  Although on the surface it resembles a vertical well, beneath the surface, the well inclines so that it runs parallel to the natural gas formation. These legs can go in different directions at different depths and can be more than one mile long horizontally, in addition to the vertical well that can be thousands of feet below the surface.  Horizontal drilling allows one surface well to branch out underground and tap many different natural gas resources.  It also allows the well to make contact with larger areas within productive formations.






Horizontal Well and Drill

As of result of advances in horizontal drilling natural gas resources in shale basins has been more accessible leading to more diversified sources of natural gas.  Combining this with other technologies such as seismic imaging has contributed to lower marginal operating and capital costs, which in turn allow natural gas producers to more economically extract natural gas from resources.
Horizontal drilling also permits the development of natural resources with minimal aboveground disturbance, reducing the environmental footprint of natural gas operations and the cost and potential disturbance of existing roads or other infrastructure.  Directional drilling and horizontal drilling terms are often used interchangeably.  Directional drilling refers to drilling at a slant or angle to increase contact with the resource.  Horizontal drilling is a type of directional drilling.  Horizontal drilling uses a technique known as hydraulic fracturing in order to extract natural gas from geologic formations.

BP U.S.


What we do


Exploration and Production



Exploration and Production






BP’s oil and gas exploration and production division is one of its core businesses, globally and in the United States. Teams in the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska and onshore areas of the lower 48 states are responsible for finding and safely extracting the energy resources America needs.
Gulf of Mexico
Nearly three decades after BP began exploring the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the company remains one of the region’s leading oil and gas producers, with lease blocks covering an area more than twice the size of Delaware. In fact, BP has been the largest energy investor in the deepwater Gulf over the past decade.
Between 2013 and 2015, its average daily production in the region increased from 189,000 barrels of oil equivalent to 249,000. This reflects BP’s continued investment at its four massive Gulf of Mexico production platforms: Atlantis, Na Kika, Thunder Horse and Mad Dog. Elsewhere in the gulf, the company holds interests in four hubs that other companies operate: Mars, Olympus, Ursa and Great White.
Alaska
BP has spent more than half a century exploring and developing Alaska’s oil and gas resources, and its operations in and around the giant Prudhoe Bay field, located on the North Slope, account for around 55 percent of the state’s oil and gas production.
Since Prudhoe Bay began production in 1977, it has generated more than 12 billion barrels of oil — far exceeding initial projections — thanks in part to enhanced oil recovery technologies that BP pioneered. Four decades after starting up, Prudhoe Bay remains one of North America’s largest oil fields.
Lower 48
In the lower 48 states, BP’s onshore business now is independently operated but still wholly owned. BP chose to separate its lower 48 operations so they could be more flexible and agile, and thus more competitive, in a rapidly changing environment.
Headquartered in Houston, its operations span five states — Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming — and seven oil and gas basins, covering an area (5.7 million net acres) roughly the size of New Jersey. In 2015, BP’s average daily oil and gas production in the Lower 48 was about 284,000 barrels of oil equivalent.













Alaska
Alaska remains one of BP’s leading resource basins. After more than 36 years of production, the North Slope still has a large amount of the discovered oil and gas remaining.














Gulf of Mexico
BP and its heritage companies have been at work in the Gulf of Mexico since the 1950s, and it has been exploring in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico (depths greater than 1,200 feet) for more than a quarter century.














U.S. Lower 48
The U.S. Lower 48 business has significant activities producing natural gas, NGLs and condensate across seven states, including production from unconventional gas, coalbed methane (CBM) and shale gas assets.

Meet the men and women who continuously improve safety across BP’s operations.









DAVID McZEAL
From engineers to team leads to field techs, we’re always passing knowledge down the line. We share a common meeting table where we openly discuss the details of our daily events. These discussions allow us to see various ways to safely approach work scenarios. More than any job I’ve had in this industry, I feel incredibly safe knowing there’s always someone to go to for an answer, no matter the question. I’m proud to work for such a goal-driven company that’s as committed to safety as BP.









ELIZABETH CHIRAYIL
Safety at BP’s wind farms starts with observation. My team’s job is to be deeply aware of what’s happening in our surroundings. My team may not be climbing turbines, but we still have an intense obligation to foster BP’s safety culture. We want each employee to get home safe. Back to their families. Back to their lives. We want everyone to feel protected, because they are. It’s an attitude that affects you even if you’re not turning the crank.









JESSICA LAMBERT
As an engineer, I look at ways to build efficient systems. At BP, “efficient” always means “safe” first. I’m encouraged to look beyond the system to consider our colleagues who will actually carry out the job and think about the impact of the work on them. The workers are key to any system’s efficiency — so their safety needs to be paramount. I am not going to ask them to do anything I would not be willing to do myself. If it isn’t safe enough for me, it’s not efficient for anyone.









MAX DAVIES
An outsider to the industry may expect the emphasis on safety to be made along the front lines offshore. As a drilling engineer, I support rig site personnel from behind the scenes to deliver a safe and compliant operation. Even though I only visit the rigs a few times a year, I’m just as focused on safe operations as those on the platform.

					  America's express pass to mobility
				





City light rail and metros together with inter-city passenger rail is giving a boost to regional economies, making it easier for people to move around, expand access to opportunity and improve quality of life. Rail and road solutions are also helping to reduce traffic congestion on roads and highways.












					
                    Siemens is working with cities and people to help move America forward
				








To modernize and revitalize cities, we make transportation more efficient, intelligent, and safe - while lowering environmental impact and creating a better traveler experience. We deliver cloud-based traffic management systems, locomotives, light rail and metros, rail signaling and electrification solutions. One in every 3 light rail cars operating in the U.S. was built by Siemens. Along with our rail electrification and rail signaling systems in the U.S., we bring advanced technologies that improve operator performance and passenger quality of life. For example:
 

 Communications-Based Train Control systems for New York’s Metropolitan Transit Authority
 Light rail vehicles for the Twin Cities that reduce gas emissions by more than 70% vs. cars
 Traffic management systems that shorten commute times by 20% along routes in San Antonio, Texas

 
We live and work in the communities where we create Ingenuity for life, with 2,000 employees across North America and full-scale transportation manufacturing facilities in five U.S. locations.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
