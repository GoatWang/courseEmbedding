As of March 31, 2011, Revel Entertainment held 48.7% ownership interest and maintains control of Aesop Pictures, LLC. Revel's business plan is to produce on average 2 feature length independent films a year, on budget, with a good chance that 1 out of 10 may have a major theatrical release. A major theatrical film would gross between $50M and $100M.  Films that don't obtain major theatrical release would seek licenses for distribution in both domestic and foreign markets. Think BlockBuster, RedBox, Netflix, Vudu, DVD sales at WalMart, Target, plus TV and Cable dissimenation on a global basis.  Revel's managing member, Ben Gourley, has played a role in producing independent films such as "Moving McAllister", "REPO" and "The Kane Files", a high-intensity action movie filmed in Utah. Mr. Gourley is emerging as a genuine multi-talented force in Hollywood with writing, producing, acting and directing all on his resume. Gourley made his directorial debut, as well as writing and starring in his film "REPO", and was the creative giant behind Magnolia Pictures' "Moving McAllister", which he wrote, produced and starred in with Mila Kunis, Jon Heder and Rutger Hauer.  "The Kane Files" is the first film under Nexia's Entertainment Division that was completed from beginning to end. However the team Nexia assembled has completed two other successsful feature length films including "Moving McAllister" and "REPO". It's critical to understand that it's no small feat for a small group of individuals with no major studio backing to complete a feature length film, but it's virtually unheard of to complete 3 feature length films that display the qualities that "The Kane Files", "REPO" and "Moving McAllister" do.   Revel Entertainment has formed a wholly owned subsidiary named Redline Entertainment, Inc. that will seek to license the foreign distribution rights of films produced by Revel Entertainment and assist other filmakers in securing distribution for their independant films. Redline has signed a total of six contracts for the license rights to the foreign distribution of the following feature length films: "The Kane Files", "Dr. Limptooth", "Love and Mary", "Pirates of the Great Salt Lake", "Paladin: Dawn of the Dragon Slayer" and "The Virgin and the Warrior".  Each sales agency agreement Redline signs should mean revenue streams on a regular basis over the term of each agreement, which ranges from 3 to 10 years. Redline will continue its efforts at upcoming markets, festivals and with worldwide distribution companies to contract for the best distribution possible for the films it is currently marketing. If Redline can market and license multiple films, it should produce multiple steady revenue streams.  "The Kane Files" Movie WebSite: http://www.thekanefiles.com/ Trailer -  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLMr7NeLuwg Watch "The Kane Files" - http://videobam.com/widget/NYtTY/3  News - "The Kane Files" Actor Drew Fuller Wins Best Actor Award at the San Diego Film Festival - ih.advfn.com/p.php Highland Film Group Showcases "The Kane Files" at the American Film Market - ih.advfn.com/p.php    "The Kane Files" screen shots  "REPO" Trailer - http://youtu.be/_J_dJlCR_OA Movie WebSite - http://www.therepomovie.com/ IMDb - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0887161/                                                                                                                                                                                      "Moving McAllister" Trailer - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxVrc-57LFY Rovi - http://www.allrovi.com/movies/movie/v408652 IMDb - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0444672/                                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  NXHD Subsidiary: Landis Lifestyle Salons -           Sack Lunch Productions through its majority owned subsidiary Green Endeavors, Inc.

The Co owns seven small parcels of undeveloped raw land in Utah and Kansas. Nexia's subsidiary, Wasatch Capital has expanded its portfolio in the area of residential properties. Its residential interests include two residential properties in central SLC. These residential properties were acquired through Nexia's Real Estate Acquisition Strategy.   We've put our money into the purchase of underperforming properties, and through the repair and upgrade of those properties we hope to increase their value and cash flow potential. Our objective is to acquire properties that will need only limited improvements in order to increas their occupancy, improve cash flow, and enhance potential resale value. From time-to-time we will sell our properties when market conditions are favorable. The goal is to maximize profits and not necessarily to be landlords.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     Sack Lunch Productions Inc.     59 West 100 South, 2nd Floor 			Salt Lake City, Utah 84101         Phone: 801-575-8073     Fax: 801-575-8092                     SAKL Current Share Structure (4/11/2016) * 990M Authorized * 143,351,556 Outstanding  * 82,291,572 Restricted * 61,059,984 Float   * Standard Register & Transfer (801) 571-8844   -   Sack Lunch Productions TEAM    Richard Surber - CEO, CFO, Sack Lunch Productions **CEO Richard Surber's in-depth interview on "Money TV" (10/23) - http://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=1558681659110&ref=mf Pamela Hyde - Executive Assistant Guy R.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed.

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Composite Score:





                        Sack Lunch Productions, Inc. has received 1 out of 5 stars based on 2 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of F.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.
