FIDELITY NEW JERSEY MUNICIPAL MONEY MARKET FUND
TO BE HELD ON DECEMBER 17, 1997


This Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with a solicitation
of proxies made by, and on behalf of, the Board of Trustees of
Fidelity Court Street Trust II (the trust) to be used at the Special
Meeting of Shareholders of Fidelity Connecticut Municipal Money Market
Fund, Spartan Connecticut Municipal Money Market Fund, Spartan Florida

Market Fund (the funds) and at any adjournments thereof (the Meeting),
to be held on December 17, 1997 at 12:00 p.m. at 82 Devonshire Street,
Boston, Massachusetts 02109, the principal executive office of the
trust and Fidelity Management & Research Company (FMR), the funds'
investment adviser.

The purpose of the Meeting is set forth in the accompanying Notice.
The solicitation is made primarily by the mailing of this Proxy
Statement and the accompanying proxy card on or about October 20,
1997. Supplementary solicitations may be made by mail, telephone,
telegraph, facsimile,    electronic m    eans, or by personal
interview by representatives of the trust. In addition, Management
Information Services Corp. (MIS) and D.F. King & Co. may be paid on a
per-call basis to solicit shareholders on behalf of the funds at an
anticipated cost of approximately $6,000 (Fidelity Connecticut
Municipal Money Market Fund), $3,000 (Spartan Connecticut Municipal
Money Market Fund), $4,000 (Spartan Florida Municipal Money Market
Fund), and $7,000 (Fidelity New Jersey Municipal Money Market Fund),
respectively. The expenses in connection with preparing this Proxy
Statement and its enclosures and of all solicitations will be paid by
the funds (except for Spartan Connecticut Municipal Money Market Fund
and Spartan Florida Municipal Money Market Fund, whose expenses will
be borne by FMR). The funds (FMR for Spartan Connecticut Municipal
Money Market Fund and Spartan Florida Municipal Money Market Fund)
will reimburse brokerage firms and others for their reasonable
expenses in forwarding solicitation material to the beneficial owners
of shares. The principal business address of Fidelity Distributors
Corporation (FDC) the funds' principal underwriter and distribution
agent is 82 Devonshire Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02109. The
principal business address of FMR Texas, Inc. (FMR Texas), subadviser
to the funds, is 400 East Las Colinas Boulevard, Irving, Texas 75039.

If the enclosed proxy card is executed and returned, it may
nevertheless be revoked at any time prior to its use by written
notification received by the trust, by the execution of a later-dated
proxy card, or by attending the Meeting and voting in person.

All proxy cards solicited by the Board of Trustees that are properly
executed and received by the Secretary prior to the Meeting, and which
are not revoked, will be voted at the Meeting. Shares represented by
such proxies will be voted in accordance with the instructions
thereon. If no specification is made on a proxy card, it will be voted
FOR the matters specified on the proxy card. Only proxies that are
voted will be counted towards establishing a quorum. Broker non-votes
are not considered voted for this purpose. Shareholders should note
that while votes to ABSTAIN will count toward establishing a quorum,
passage of any proposal being considered at the Meeting will occur
only if a sufficient number of votes are cast FOR the proposal.
Accordingly, votes to ABSTAIN and votes AGAINST will have the same
effect in determining whether the proposal is approved.

The funds may also arrange to have votes recorded by telephone. D.F.
King & Co. may be paid on a per call basis for vote-by-phone
solicitations on behalf of the funds at an anticipated cost of
approximately $5,000, (Fidelity Connecticut Municipal Money Market
Fund), $2,000 (Spartan Connecticut Municipal Money Market Fund),
$3,000 (Spartan Florida Municipal Money Market Fund) and $6,000
(Fidelity New Jersey Municipal Money Market Fund). The expenses in
connection with telephone voting will be paid by the funds (except for
Spartan Connecticut Municipal Money Market Fund and Spartan Florida
Municipal Money Market Fund, whose expenses will be borne by FMR). If
the funds record votes by telephone, they will use procedures designed
to authenticate shareholders' identities, to allow shareholders to
authorize the voting of their shares in accordance with their
instructions, and to confirm that their instructions have been
properly recorded. Proxies voted by telephone may be revoked at any
time before they are voted in the same manner that proxies voted by
mail may be revoked.

If a quorum is not present at the Meeting, or if a quorum is present
at the Meeting, but sufficient votes to approve one or more of the
proposed items are not received, or if other matters arise requiring
shareholder attention, the persons named as proxy agents may propose
one or more adjournments of the Meeting to permit further solicitation
of proxies. Any such adjournment will require the affirmative vote of
a majority of those shares present at the Meeting or represented by
proxy. When voting on a proposed adjournment, the persons named as
proxy agents will vote FOR the proposed adjournment all shares that
they are entitled to vote with respect to each item, unless directed
to vote AGAINST the item, in which case such shares will be voted
AGAINST the proposed adjournment with respect to that item. A
shareholder vote may be taken on one or more of the items in this
Proxy Statement prior to such adjournment if sufficient votes have
been received and it is otherwise appropriate.

** Except as otherwise indicated, each individual has held the office
shown or other offices in the same company for the last five years.

As of August 31, 1997, the no   minees, Trustees, and officers of the
trust owned, in the aggregate, less than 1%     of each fund's
outstanding shares.

If elected, the Trustees will hold office without limit in time
except that (a) any Trustee may resign; (b) any Trustee may be removed
by written instrument, signed by at least two-thirds of the number of
Trustees prior to such removal; (c) any Trustee who requests to be
retired or who has become incapacitated by illness or injury may be
retired by written instrument signed by a majority of the other
Trustees; and (d) a Trustee may be removed at any Special Meeting of
shareholders by a two-thirds vote of the outstanding voting securities
of the trust. In case a vacancy shall for any reason exist, the
remaining Trustees will fill such vacancy by appointing another
Trustee, so long as, immediately after such appointment, at least
two-thirds of the Trustees have been elected by shareholders. If, at
any time, less than a majority of the Trustees holding office has been
elected by the shareholders, the Trustees then in office will promptly
call a shareholders' meeting for the purpose of electing a Board of
Trustees. Otherwise, there will normally be no meeting of shareholders
for the purpose of electing Trustees.

The trust's Board, which is currently composed of two interested and
seven non-interested Trustees, met eleven times during the twelve
months ended November 30, 1996. It is expected that the Trustees will
meet at least ten times a year at regularly scheduled meetings.

The trust's Audit Committee is composed entirely of Trustees who are
not interested persons of the trust, FMR or its affiliates and
normally meets four times a year, or as required, prior to meetings of
the Board of Trustees. Currently, Mr. Kirk (Chairman) and Mrs. Davis
are members of the Committee. If elected, it is anticipated that Mr.
McCoy and Mr. Gates will be members of the committee. The committee
oversees and monitors the trust's internal control structure, its
auditing function and its financial reporting process, including the
resolution of material reporting issues. The committee recommends to
the Board of Trustees the appointment of auditors for the trust. It
reviews audit plans, fees and other material arrangements in respect
of the engagement of auditors, including non-audit services to be
performed. It reviews the qualifications of key personnel involved in
the foregoing activities. The committee plays an oversight role in
respect of the trust's investment compliance procedures and the code
of ethics. During the twelve months ended November 30, 1996, the
committee held four meetings.

The trust's Nominating and Administration Committee is currently
composed of Messrs. McDonough (Chairman), Jones and Williams. The
committee members confer periodically and hold meetings as required.
The committee makes nominations for independent trustees, and for
membership on committees. The committee periodically reviews
procedures and policies of the Board of Trustees and committees. It
acts as the administrative committee under the Retirement Plan for
non-interested trustees who retired prior to December 30, 1996. It
monitors the performance of legal counsel employed by the trust and
the independent trustees. The committee in the first instance monitors
compliance with, and acts as the administrator of the provisions of
the code of ethics applicable to the independent trustees. During the
twelve months ended November 30, 1996, the committee held four
meetings. The Nominating and Administration Committee will consider
nominees recommended by shareholders. Recommendations should be
submitted to the committee in care of the Secretary of the Trust. The
trust does not have a compensation committee; such matters are
considered by the Nominating and Administration Committee.

Under a retirement program adopted in July 1988 and modified in
November 1995 and November 1996, each non-interested Trustee who
retired before December 30, 1996 may receive payments from a Fidelity
fund during his or her lifetime based on his or her basic trustee fees
and length of service. The obligation of a fund to make such payments
is neither secured nor funded. A Trustee became eligible to
participate in the program at the end of the calendar year in which he
or she reached age 72, provided that, at the time of retirement, he or
she had served as a Fidelity fund Trustee for at least five years.

Under a deferred compensation plan adopted in September 1995 and
amended in November 1996 (the Plan), non-interested Trustees must
defer receipt of a portion of, and may elect to defer receipt of an
additional portion of, their annual fees. Amounts deferred under the
Plan are treated as though equivalent dollar amounts had been invested
in shares of a cross-section of Fidelity funds including funds in each
major investment discipline and representing a majority of Fidelity's
assets under management (the Reference Funds). The amounts ultimately
received by the Trustees under the Plan will be directly linked to the
investment performance of the Reference Funds. Deferral of fees in
accordance with the Plan will have a negligible effect on a fund's
assets, liabilities, and net income per share, and will not obligate a
fund to retain the services of any Trustee or to pay any particular
level of compensation to the Trustee. A fund may invest in the
Reference Funds under the Plan without shareholder approval.

As of December 30, 1996, the non-interested Trustees terminated the
retirement program for Trustees who retire after such date. In
connection with the termination of the retirement program, each
then-existing non-interested Trustee received a credit to his or her
Plan account equal to the present value of the estimated benefits that
would have been payable under the retirement program. The amounts
credited to the non-interested Trustees' Plan accounts are subject to
vesting and are treated as though equivalent dollar amounts had been
invested in shares of the Reference Funds. The amounts ultimately
received by the Trustees in connection with the credits to their Plan
accounts will be directly linked to the investment performance of the
Reference Funds. The termination of the retirement program and related
crediting of estimated benefits to the Trustees' Plan accounts did not
result in a material cost to the funds.

2. TO RATIFY THE SELECTION OF COOPERS & LYBRAND L.L.P. AS INDEPENDENT
ACCOUNTANTS OF THE TRUST.
By a vote of the non-interested Trustees, the firm of Coopers &
Lybrand L.L.P. has been selected as independent accountants for
each fund     to sign or certify any financial statements of
each fund     required by any law or regulation to be certified by
an independent accountant and filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) or any state. Pursuant to the 1940 Act, such
selection requires the ratification of shareholders. In addition, as
required by the 1940 Act, the vote of the Trustees is subject to the
right of e   ach fund    , by vote of a majority of its outstanding
voting securities at any meeting called for the purpose of voting on
such action, to terminate such employment without penalty. Coopers &
Lybrand L.L.P. has advised e   ach fun    d that it has no direct or
material indirect ownership interest in e   ach     fund.
The independent accountants examine annual financial statements for
the funds and provide other audit and tax-related services. In
recommending the selection of the funds   '     accountants, the Audit
Committee reviewed the nature and scope of the services to be provided
(including non-audit services) and whether the performance of such
services would affect the accountants' independence. Representatives
of Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P. are not expected to be present at the
Meeting, but have been given the opportunity to make a statement if
they so desire and will be available should any matter arise requiring
their presence.

On September 18, 1997 Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P. and Price
Waterhouse LLP announced plans to merge their practices world wide.
Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P. and Price Waterhouse LLP expect the merger,
which is subject to approval by the partners of both organizations and
by the regulators, to become effective in early 1998.

3. TO AMEND THE TRUST INSTRUMENT TO PROVIDE DOLLAR-BASED VOTING RIGHTS
FOR SHAREHOLDERS OF THE TRUST.
The Board of Trustees has approved, and recommends that shareholders
of the trust approve a proposal to amend Article VII, Section 7.01 of
the Trust Instrument. The amendment would provide voting rights based
on a shareholder's total dollar interest in a fund (dollar-based
voting), rather than on the number of shares owned, for all
shareholder votes for a fund. As a result, voting power would be
allocated in proportion to the value of each shareholder's investment.

BACKGROUND. Connecticut Municipal Money Market Fund, Spartan
Connecticut Municipal Money Market Fund, Spartan Florida Municipal
Money Market Fund, and New Jersey Municipal Money Market Fund are
funds of Fidelity Court Street Trust II, an open-end management
investment company organized as a Delaware business trust. Currently,
there are four funds in the trust. Shareholders of each fund vote
separately on matters concerning only that fund and vote on a
trust-wide basis on matters that affect the trust as a whole, such as
electing trustees or amending the Trust Instrument. Currently, under
the Trust Instrument, each share is entitled to one vote, regardless
of the relative value of the shares of each fund in the trust.

The original intent of the one-share, one-vote provision was to
provide equitable voting rights to all shareholders as required by the
1940 Act. In the case where a trust has several series or funds, such
as Fidelity Court Street Trust II, voting rights may have become
disproportionate since the net asset value per share (NAV) of the
separate funds generally diverge over time. The Staff of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued a "no-action"
letter permitting a trust to seek shareholder approval of a
dollar-based voting system. The proposed amendment will comply with
the conditions stated in the no-action letter.

REASON FOR PROPOSAL. If approved, the amendment would provide a more
equitable distribution of voting rights for certain votes than the
one-share, one-vote system currently in effect. The voting power of
each shareholder would be commensurate with the value of the
shareholder's dollar investment rather than with the number of shares
held.

Under the current voting provisions, an investment in a fund with a
lower NAV may have significantly greater voting power than the same
dollar amount invested in a fund with a higher NAV. Currently, since
there are only money market funds in the trust, the proposal will not
affect the voting rights of fund shareholders on votes requiring
trust-wide participation since money market funds are managed to
maintain a $1.00 NAV. However, if additional funds with fluctuating
NAVs are added to the trust, relative voting rights would be changed
under the proposal. To illustrate the potentially disproportionate
calculation of voting power currently in place, the table below shows
a hypothetical example of a trust with funds with fluctuating NAVs.








FUND   NET ASSET VALUE   $1,000 INVESTMENT
                         IN TERMS OF
                         NUMBER OF SHARES

A      $ 10.00            100.000

B      $ 7.57             132.100

C      $ 10.93            91.491

D      $ 1.00             1,000.000








For example, Fund D shareholders would have ten times the voting
power of Fund A shareholders, because a $1,000 investment in Fund D
would buy ten times as many shares as a $1,000 investment in Fund A.
Accordingly, a one-share, one-vote system may provide certain
shareholders with a disproportionate ability to affect the vote
relative to shareholders of other funds in the trust. If dollar-based
voting had been in effect, each shareholder would have had 1,000
voting shares. Their voting power would be proportionate to their
economic interest, which FMR believes is a more equitable result, and
which is the result with respect to a typical corporation where each
voting share generally has an equal market price.

On matters requiring trust-wide votes where all funds are required to
vote, shareholders who own shares with a lower NAV than other funds in
the trust would be giving other shareholders in the trust more voting
"power" than they currently have. On matters affecting only one fund,
only shareholders of that fund vote on the issue. In this instance,
under both the current Trust Instrument and an amended Trust
Instrument, all shareholders of the fund would have the same voting
rights, since the NAV is the same for all shares in a single fund.

AMENDMENT TO THE TRUST        INSTRUMENT. Article VII, Section 7.01
sets forth the method of calculating voting rights for all shareholder
votes for the trust. If approved, Article VII, Section 7.01 will be
amended as follows (material to be added is
((    underlined   ))     and material to be deleted is [bracketed]):


ARTICLE VII

SHAREHOLDERS' VOTING POWERS AND MEETINGS VOTING POWERS


Section 7.01 The    S    hareholders shall have power to vote . . .
On any matter submitted to a vote of the Shareholders, all Shares
shall be voted separately by individual Series, except (i) when
required by the 1940 Act, Shares shall be voted in the aggregate and
not by individual Series; and (ii) when the Trustees have determined
that the matter affects the interests of more than one Series, then
the Shareholders of all such Series shall be entitled to vote thereon.
The Trustees may also determine that a matter affects only the
interests of one or more classes of a Series, in which case any such
matters shall be voted on by such class or classes. [Each whole Share
shall be entitled to one vote as to any matter on which it is entitled
to vote, and each fractional Share shall be entitled to a
proportionate fractional vote.]    ((    A Shareholder of each Series
shall be entitled to one vote for each dollar of net asset value
(number of shares owned times net asset value per share) of such
Series, on any matter on which such Shareholder is entitled to vote
and each fractional dollar amount shall be entitled to a proportionate
fractional vote.   ))     There shall be no cumulative voting in the
election of Trustees. Shares may be voted in person or by proxy, or in
any manner provided for in the Bylaws. A proxy may be given in
writing. The Bylaws may provide that proxies may also, or may instead,
be given by any electronic or telecommunications device or in any
other manner. Notwithstanding anything else herein or in the Bylaws,
in the event a proposal by anyone other than the officers or Trustees
of the Trust is submitted to a vote of the Shareholders of one or more
Series or of the Trust, or in the event of any proxy contest or proxy
solicitation or proposal in opposition to any proposal by the officers
or Trustees of the Trust, Shares may be voted only in person or by
written proxy. Until Shares are issued, the Trustees may exercise all
rights of Shareholders and may take any action required or permitted
by law, this Trust Instrument or any Bylaws of the Trust to be taken
by Shareholders.

CONCLUSION. The Board of Trustees has concluded that the proposal
will benefit the trust and its shareholders. The Trustees recommend
voting FOR the proposal. The amended Trust Instrument will become
effective upon shareholder approval. If the proposal is not approved
by shareholders of the trust, Article VII, Section 7.01 of the Trust
Instrument will remain unchanged.

4. TO APPROVE AN AMENDED MANAGEMENT CONTRACT FOR FIDELITY CONNECTICUT
MUNICIPAL MONEY MARKET FUND.
The Board of Trustees, including the Trustees who are not "interested
persons" of the Trust or of FMR (the Independent Trustees) has
approved, and recommends that shareholders of the fund approve a
proposal to adopt an amended management contract with Fidelity
Management & Research Company (FMR) (the Amended Contract). The
Amended Contract modifies the management fee that FMR receives from
the fund to provide for lower fees when FMR's assets under management
exceed certain levels. THE AMENDED CONTRACT WILL RESULT IN A
MANAGEMENT FEE THAT IS THE SAME AS, OR LOWER THAN, THE FEE PAYABLE
UNDER THE PRESENT MANAGEMENT CONTRACT (THE PRESENT CONTRACT).

PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE PRESENT MANAGEMENT CONTRACT. A copy of the
Amended Contract, marked to indicate the proposed amendments, is
supplied as Exhibit 1 on page        . Except for the modifications
discussed above, it is substantially identical to the Present
Contract. (For a detailed discussion of the fund's Present Contract,
refer to the section entitled "Present Management Contracts" beginning
on page        .) If approved by shareholders, the Amended Contract
will take effect on January 1, 1998 (or, if later, the first day of
the first month following approval) and will remain in effect through
May 31, 1998 and thereafter, but only as long as its continuance is
approved at least annually by (i) the vote, cast in person at a
meeting called for the purpose, of a majority of those Trustees who
are not "interested persons" of the trust or FMR (the Independent
Trustees) and (ii) the vote of either a majority of the Trustees or by
the vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of the fund. If the
Amended Contract is not approved, the Present Contract will continue
in effect through May 31, 1998, and thereafter only as long as its
continuance is approved at least annually by (i) the vote, cast in
person at a meeting called for the purpose, of a majority of the
Independent Trustees and (ii) the vote of either a majority of the
Trustees or by the vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of the
fund.

The management fee is an annual percentage of the fund's average net
assets (the management fee rate), calculated and paid monthly. The
management fee rate is the sum of two components: a Group Fee Rate,
which varies according to assets under management by FMR, and a fixed
Individual Fund Fee Rate. The Amended Contract modifies the Group Fee
Rate by providing for lower fee rates if FMR's assets under management
remain above $120 billion.

MODIFICATION TO GROUP FEE RATE. The Group Fee Rate varies based upon
the monthly average of the aggregate net assets of all registered
investment companies having management contracts with FMR (assets
under management by FMR). For example, as assets under management by
FMR increase, the Group Fee Rate declines. The Amended Contract would
not change the group fee calculation for assets under management by
FMR of $120 billion or less. Above $120 billion in assets under FMR's
management, the Group Fee Rate declines under both the Present
Contract and the Amended Contract, but under the Amended Contract, it
declines faster. Group Fee Rates that are lower than those contained
in the fund's Present Contract have been voluntarily implemented by
FMR on January 1, 1992, November 1, 1993, August 1, 1994, and January
1, 1996.

The Group Fee Rate is calculated according to a graduated schedule
providing for different rates for different levels of assets under
management by FMR. The rate at which the Group Fee Rate declines is
determined by fee "breakpoints" that provide for lower fee rates when
assets increase. The Amended Contract adds 12 new fee breakpoints for
assets under FMR's management above $120 billion as illustrated in the
following table. (For an explanation of how the Group Fee Rate is used
to calculate the management fee, see the section entitled "Present
Management Contracts" beginning on page        .)

schedules by FMR on January 1, 1992, November 1, 1993, August 1, 1994,
and January 1, 1996.
Assets under FMR's management for August 31, 1997 were approximately
$531 billion.
COMPARISON OF MANAGEMENT FEES. For August 31, 1997, average assets
under management by FMR were $531 billion. The fund's management fee
rate under the Amended Contract would have been .3882%, compared to
.4069% under the Present Contract. The management fee rate will remain
the same under both the Present Contract and the Amended Contract
until assets under FMR's management exceed $120 billion, at which
point the management fee rate under the Amended Contract begins to
decline relative to the Present Contract. The following chart compares
the fund's management fee under the terms of the Present Contract for
the fiscal year ended November 30, 1996 to the management fee the fund
would have incurred if the Amended Contract had been in effect.

MATTERS CONSIDERED BY THE BOARD

The mutual funds for which the members of the Board of Trustees serve
as Trustees are referred to herein as the "Fidelity funds." The Board
of Trustees meets eleven times a year. The Board of Trustees,
including the Independent Trustees, believe that matters bearing on
the appropriateness of the fund's management fees are considered at
most, if not all, of their meetings. While the full Board of Trustees
or the Independent Trustees, as appropriate, act on all major matters,
a significant portion of the activities of the Board of Trustees
(including certain of those described herein) are conducted through
committees. The Independent Trustees meet frequently in executive
session and are advised by independent legal counsel selected by the
Independent Trustees.

The proposal to present the Amended Contract to shareholders was
approved by the Board of Trustees of the fund, including the
Independent Trustees on October 17, 1996. The Board of Trustees
considered and approved the modifications to the Group Fee Rate
schedule during the two month periods from November to December 1995,
June to July 1994, September to October 1993, and November to December
1991. The Board of Trustees received materials relating to the Amended
Contract in advance of the meeting at which the Amended Contract was
considered, and had the opportunity to ask questions and request
further information in connection with such consideration.

INFORMATION RECEIVED BY THE INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES. In connection with
their monthly meetings Trustees receive materials specifically
relating to the Amended Contract. These materials include: (i)
information on the investment performance of the fund, a peer group of
funds and an appropriate index or combination of indices, (ii) sales
and redemption data in respect of the fund, (iii) the economic outlook
and the general investment outlook in the markets in which the fund
invests, and (iv) notable changes in the fund's investments. The Board
of Trustees and the Independent Trustees also consider periodically
other material facts such as (1) FMR's results and financial
condition, (2) arrangements in respect of the distribution of the
fund's shares, (3) the procedures employed to determine the value of
the fund's assets, (4) the allocation of the fund's brokerage, if any,
including allocations to brokers affiliated with FMR (5) FMR's
management of the relationships with the fund's custodian and
subcustodians, (6) the resources devoted to and the record of
compliance with the fund's investment policies and restrictions and
with policies on personal securities transactions, and (7) the nature,
cost and quality of non-investment management services provided by FMR
and its affiliates.

In response to questions raised by the Independent Trustees,
additional information was furnished by FMR including, among other
items, information on and analysis of (a) the overall organization of
FMR, (b) the choice of performance indices and benchmarks, (c) the
composition of peer groups of funds, (d) transfer agency and
bookkeeping fees paid to affiliates of FMR, (e) investment
performance, (f) investment management staffing, (g) the potential for
achieving further economies of scale, (h) operating expenses paid to
third parties, and (i) the information furnished to investors,
including the fund's shareholders.

In considering the Amended Contract, the Board of Trustees and the
Independent Trustees did not identify any single factor as
all-important or controlling, and the following summary does not
detail all the matters considered. Matters considered by the Board of
Trustees and the Independent Trustees in connection with their
approval of the Amended Contract include the following:

INVESTMENT COMPLIANCE AND PERFORMANCE. The Board of Trustees and the
Independent Trustees considered whether the fund has operated within
its investment objective and its record of compliance with its
investment restrictions. They also reviewed monthly the fund's
investment performance as well as the performance of a peer group of
mutual funds, and the performance of an appropriate index or
combination of indices.

FMR'S PERSONNEL AND METHODS. The Board of Trustees and the
Independent Trustees annually review a report detailing the background
of the fund's portfolio manager, and the fund's investment objective
and discipline. The Independent Trustees have also had discussions
with senior management of FMR responsible for investment operations,
and the senior management of Fidelity's money market group. Among
other things they considered the size, education and experience of
FMR's investment staff, its use of technology, and FMR's approach to
recruiting, training and retaining portfolio managers and other
research, advisory and management personnel.

NATURE AND QUALITY OF OTHER SERVICES. The Board of Trustees and the
Independent Trustees considered the nature, quality, cost and extent
of administrative and shareholder services performed by FMR and
affiliated companies, both under the Amended Contract and under
separate agreements covering transfer agency functions and pricing,
bookkeeping and securities lending services, if any. The Board of
Trustees and the Independent Trustees have also considered the nature
and extent of FMR's supervision of third party service providers,
principally custodians and subcustodians.

EXPENSES. The Board of Trustees and the Independent Trustees
considered the fund's expense ratio and expense ratios of a peer group
of funds. They also considered the amount and nature of fees paid by
shareholders.

PROFITABILITY. The Board of Trustees and the Independent Trustees
considered the level of FMR's profits in respect of the management of
the Fidelity funds, including the fund. This consideration included an
extensive review of FMR's methodology in allocating its costs to the
management of the fund. The Board of Trustees and the Independent
Trustees have concluded that the cost allocation methodology employed
by FMR has a reasonable basis and is appropriate in light of all of
the circumstances. They considered the profits realized by FMR in
connection with the operation of the fund and whether the amount of
profit is a fair entrepreneurial profit for the management of the
fund. They also considered the profits realized from non-fund
businesses which may benefit from or be related to the fund's
business. The Board of Trustees and the Independent Trustees also
considered FMR's profit margins in comparison with available industry
data, both accounting for and ignoring marketing expenses.

ECONOMIES OF SCALE. The Board of Trustees and the Independent
Trustees considered whether there have been economies of scale in
respect of the management of the Fidelity funds, whether the Fidelity
funds (including the fund) have appropriately benefitted from any
economies of scale, and whether there is potential for realization of
any further economies of scale. The Board of Trustees and the
Independent Trustees have concluded that FMR's mutual fund business
presents some limited opportunities to realize economies of scale and
that these economies are being shared between fund shareholders and
FMR in an appropriate manner. The Independent Trustees have also
concluded that the existing group fee structure should be continued
but determined that it would be appropriate to change the group fee
structure as proposed herein.

OTHER BENEFITS TO FMR. The Board of Trustees and the Independent
Trustees also considered the character and amount of fees paid by the
fund and the fund's shareholders for services provided by FMR and its
affiliates, including fees for services like transfer agency, fund
accounting and direct shareholder services. They also considered the
allocation of fund brokerage to brokers affiliated with FMR and the
receipt of sales loads and payments under Rule 12b-1 plans in respect
of certain of the Fidelity funds. The Board of Trustees and the
Independent Trustees also considered the revenues and profitability of
FMR businesses other than its mutual fund business, including FMR's
retail brokerage, correspondent brokerage, capital markets, trust,
investment advisory, pension record keeping, credit card, insurance,
publishing, real estate, international research and investment funds,
and others. The Board of Trustees and the Independent Trustees
considered the intangible benefits that accrue to FMR and its
affiliates by virtue of their relationship with the fund.

OTHER BENEFITS TO SHAREHOLDERS. The Board of Trustees and the
Independent Trustees considered the benefit to shareholders of
investing in a fund that is part of a large family of funds offering a
variety of investment disciplines and providing for a large variety of
fund and shareholder services.

CONCLUSION. Based on their evaluation of all material factors and
assisted by the advice of independent counsel, the Trustees concluded

(i) that the existing management fee structure is fair and reasonable
and (ii) that the proposed modifications to the management fee
structure, that is the reduction of the Group Fee Rate schedule are in
the best interest of the fund's shareholders. The Board of Trustees,
including the Independent Trustees, voted to approve the submission of
the Amended Contract to shareholders of the fund and recommends that
shareholders of the fund vote FOR the Amended Contract.

5. TO APPROVE AN AMENDED MANAGEMENT CONTRACT FOR FIDELITY NEW JERSEY
MUNICIPAL MONEY MARKET FUND.
The Board of Trustees, including the Trustees who are not "interested
persons" of the Trust or of FMR (the Independent Trustees), has
approved, and recommends that shareholders of the fund approve a
proposal to adopt an amended management contract with Fidelity
Management & Research Company (FMR) (the Amended Contract). The
Amended Contract modifies the management fee that FMR receives from
the fund to provide for lower fees when FMR's assets under management
exceed certain levels. The Amended Contract also includes a discussion
of FMR's ability to use brokers and dealers to execute portfolio
transactions. THE AMENDED CONTRACT WILL RESULT IN A MANAGEMENT FEE/
THAT IS THE SAME AS, OR LOWER THAN, THE FEE PAYABLE UNDER THE PRESENT
MANAGEMENT CONTRACT (THE PRESENT CONTRACT).

PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE PRESENT MANAGEMENT CONTRACT. A copy of the
Amended Contract, marked to indicate the proposed amendments, is
supplied as Exhibit 2 on page . Except for the modifications discussed
above, it is substantially identical to the Present Contract. (For a
detailed discussion of the fund's Present Contract, refer to the
section entitled "Present Management Contracts" beginning on page .)
If approved by shareholders, the Amended Contract will take effect on
January 1, 1998 (or, if later, the first day of the first month
following approval) and will remain in effect through May 31, 1998 and
thereafter, but only as long as its continuance is approved at least
annually by (i) the vote, cast in person at a meeting called for the
purpose, of a majority of those Trustees who are not "interested
persons" of the trust or FMR (the Independent Trustees) and (ii) the
vote of either a majority of the Trustees or by the vote of a majority
of the outstanding shares of the fund. If the Amended Contract is not
approved, the Present Contract will continue in effect through May 31,
1998, and thereafter only as long as its continuance is approved at
least annually by (i) the vote, cast in person at a meeting called for
the purpose, of a majority of the Independent Trustees and (ii) the
vote of either a majority of the Trustees or by the vote of a majority
of the outstanding shares of the fund.

The management fee is an annual percentage of the fund's average net
assets (the management fee rate), calculated and paid monthly. The
management fee rate is the sum of two components: a Group Fee Rate,
which varies according to assets under management by FMR, and a fixed
Individual Fund Fee Rate. The Amended Contract modifies the Group Fee
Rate by providing for lower fee rates if FMR's assets under management
remain above $120 billion.

MODIFICATION TO GROUP FEE RATE. The Group Fee Rate varies based upon
the monthly average of the aggregate net assets of all registered
investment companies having management contracts with FMR (assets
under management by FMR). For example, as assets under management by
FMR increase, the Group Fee Rate declines. The Amended Contract would
not change the group fee calculation for assets under management by
FMR of $120 billion or less. Above $120 billion in assets under FMR's
management, the Group Fee Rate declines under both the Present
Contract and the Amended Contract, but under the Amended Contract, it
declines faster. Group Fee Rates that are lower than those contained
in the fund's Present Contract have been voluntarily implemented by
FMR on January 1, 1992, November 1, 1993, August 1, 1994, and January
1, 1996.

The Group Fee Rate is calculated according to a graduated schedule
providing for different rates for different levels of assets under
management by FMR. The rate at which the Group Fee Rate declines is
determined by fee "breakpoints" that provide for lower fee rates when
assets increase. The Amended Contract adds 12 new fee breakpoints for
assets under FMR's management above $120 billion as illustrated in the
following table. (For an explanation of how the Group Fee Rate is used
to calculate the management fee, see the section entitled "Present
Management Contracts" beginning on page        .)

* Does not reflect voluntary adoption of extended group fee rate
schedules by FMR on January 1, 1992, November 1, 1993, August 1, 1994,
and January 1, 1996.
Assets under FMR's management for August 31, 1997 were approximately
$531 billion.
COMPARISON OF MANAGEMENT FEES. For August 31, 1997 average assets
under management by FMR were $531 billion. The fund's management fee
rate under the Amended Contract would have been .3882%, compared to
.4069% under the Present Contract. The management fee rate will remain
the same under both the Present Contract and the Amended Contract
until assets under FMR's management exceed $120 billion, at which
point the management fee rate under the Amended Contract begins to
decline relative to the Present Contract. The following chart compares
the fund's management fee under the terms of the Present Contract for
the fiscal year ended November 30, 1996 to the management fee the fund
would have incurred if the Amended Contract had been in effect.

TRANSACTIONS WITH BROKERS-DEALERS. The fund may execute portfolio
transactions with broker-dealers who provide research and execution
services to the fund or other accounts over which FMR or its
affiliates exercise investment discretion. The selection of such
broker-dealers is generally made by FMR (to the extent possible
consistent with execution considerations) in accordance with a ranking
of broker-dealers determined periodically by FMR's investment staff
based upon the quality of research and execution services provided. If
FMR grants investment management authority to a sub-adviser pursuant
to a Sub-advisory Agreement, the sub-adviser is authorized to place
orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities, and will do
so in accordance with the policies described below.
The receipt of research from broker-dealers that execute transactions
on behalf of the fund may be useful to FMR in rendering investment
management services to the fund and to its other clients, and
conversely, such research provided by broker-dealers who execute
transaction orders on behalf of other FMR clients may be useful to FMR
in carrying out its obligations to the fund. The receipt of such
research has not reduced FMR's normal independent research activities;
however, it enables FMR to avoid additional expenses that could be
incurred if FMR tried to develop comparable information through its
own efforts.
Subject to applicable limitations of the federal securities laws,
broker-dealers may receive commissions for agency transactions that
are in excess of the amount of commissions charged by other
broker-dealers in recognition of their research and execution
services. In order to cause the fund to pay such higher commissions,
FMR must determine in good faith that such commissions are reasonable
in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services
provided by such executing broker-dealers, viewed in terms of a
particular transaction or FMR's overall responsibilities to the fund
and its other clients. In reaching this determination, FMR will not
attempt to place a specific dollar value on the brokerage and research
services provided, or to determine what portion of the compensation
should be related to those services.
The fund has already been authorized by the Board of Trustees,
consistent with the federal securities laws and the rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, to place
portfolio transactions through broker-dealers who are affiliated with
FMR and through broker-dealers who provide research. The Amended
Contract expressly recognizes this authority.

MATTERS CONSIDERED BY THE BOARD

The mutual funds for which the members of the Board of Trustees serve
as Trustees are referred to herein as the "Fidelity funds." The Board
of Trustees meets eleven times a year. The Board of Trustees,
including the Independent Trustees, believe that matters bearing on
the appropriateness of the fund's management fees are considered at
most, if not all, of their meetings. While the full Board of Trustees
or the Independent Trustees, as appropriate, act on all major matters,
a significant portion of the activities of the Board of Trustees
(including certain of those described herein) are conducted through
committees. The Independent Trustees meet frequently in executive
session and are advised by independent legal counsel selected by the
Independent Trustees.

The proposal to present the Amended Contract to shareholders was
approved by the Board of Trustees of the fund, including the
Independent Trustees on October 17, 1996. The Board of Trustees
considered and approved the modifications to the Group Fee Rate
schedule during the two month periods from November to December 1995,
June to July 1994, September to October 1993, and November to December
1991. The Board of Trustees consider and approve twice every year
portfolio transactions with broker-dealers who provide research
services to the funds. The Board of Trustees received materials
relating to the Amended Contract in advance of the meeting at which
the Amended Contract was considered, and had the opportunity to ask
questions and request further information in connection with such
consideration.

INFORMATION RECEIVED BY THE INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES. In connection with
their monthly meetings Trustees receive materials specifically
relating to the Amended Contract. These materials include: (i)
information on the investment performance of the fund, a peer group of
funds and an appropriate index or combination of indices, (ii) sales
and redemption data in respect of the fund, (iii) the economic outlook
and the general investment outlook in the markets in which the fund
invests, and (iv) notable changes in the fund's investments. The Board
of Trustees and the Independent Trustees also consider periodically
other material facts such as (1) FMR's results and financial
condition, (2) arrangements in respect of the distribution of the
fund's shares, (3) the procedures employed to determine the value of
the fund's assets, (4) the allocation of the fund's brokerage, if any,
including allocations to brokers affiliated with FMR (5) FMR's
management of the relationships with the fund's custodian and
subcustodians, (6) the resources devoted to and the record of
compliance with the fund's investment policies and restrictions and
with policies on personal securities transactions, and (7) the nature,
cost and quality of non-investment management services provided by FMR
and its affiliates.

In response to questions raised by the Independent Trustees,
additional information was furnished by FMR including, among other
items, information on and analysis of (a) the overall organization of
FMR, (b) the choice of performance indices and benchmarks, (c) the
composition of peer groups of funds, (d) transfer agency and
bookkeeping fees paid to affiliates of FMR, (e) investment
performance, (f) investment management staffing, (g) the potential for
achieving further economies of scale, (h) operating expenses paid to
third parties, and (i) the information furnished to investors,
including the fund's shareholders.

In considering the Amended Contract, the Board of Trustees and the
Independent Trustees did not identify any single factor as
all-important or controlling, and the following summary does not
detail all the matters considered. Matters considered by the Board of
Trustees and the Independent Trustees in connection with their
approval of the Amended Contract include the following:

INVESTMENT COMPLIANCE AND PERFORMANCE. The Board of Trustees and the
Independent Trustees considered whether the fund has operated within
its investment objective and its record of compliance with its
investment restrictions. They also reviewed monthly the fund's
investment performance as well as the performance of a peer group of
mutual funds, and the performance of an appropriate index or
combination of indices.

FMR'S PERSONNEL AND METHODS. The Board of Trustees and the
Independent Trustees annually review a report detailing the background
of the fund's portfolio manager, and the fund's investment objective
and discipline. The Independent Trustees have also had discussions
with senior management of FMR responsible for investment operations,
and the senior management of Fidelity's money market group. Among
other things they considered the size, education and experience of
FMR's investment staff, its use of technology, and FMR's approach to
recruiting, training and retaining portfolio managers and other
research, advisory and management personnel.

NATURE AND QUALITY OF OTHER SERVICES. The Board of Trustees and the
Independent Trustees considered the nature, quality, cost and extent
of administrative and shareholder services performed by FMR and
affiliated companies, both under the Amended Contract and under
separate agreements covering transfer agency functions and pricing,
bookkeeping and securities lending services, if any. The Board of
Trustees and the Independent Trustees have also considered the nature
and extent of FMR's supervision of third party service providers,
principally custodians and subcustodians.

EXPENSES. The Board of Trustees and the Independent Trustees
considered the fund's expense ratio and expense ratios of a peer group
of funds. They also considered the amount and nature of fees paid by
shareholders.

PROFITABILITY. The Board of Trustees and the Independent Trustees
considered the level of FMR's profits in respect of the management of
the Fidelity funds, including the fund. This consideration included an
extensive review of FMR's methodology in allocating its costs to the
management of the fund. The Board of Trustees and the Independent
Trustees have concluded that the cost allocation methodology employed
by FMR has a reasonable basis and is appropriate in light of all of
the circumstances. They considered the profits realized by FMR in
connection with the operation of the fund and whether the amount of
profit is a fair entrepreneurial profit for the management of the
fund. They also considered the profits realized from non-fund
businesses which may benefit from or be related to the fund's
business. The Board of Trustees and the Independent Trustees also
considered FMR's profit margins in comparison with available industry
data, both accounting for and ignoring marketing expenses.

ECONOMIES OF SCALE. The Board of Trustees and the Independent
Trustees considered whether there have been economies of scale in
respect of the management of the Fidelity funds, whether the Fidelity
funds (including the fund) have appropriately benefitted from any
economies of scale, and whether there is potential for realization of
any further economies of scale. The Board of Trustees and the
Independent Trustees have concluded that FMR's mutual fund business
presents some limited opportunities to realize economies of scale and
that these economies are being shared between fund shareholders and
FMR in an appropriate manner. The Independent Trustees have also
concluded that the existing group fee structure should be continued
but determined that it would be appropriate to change the group fee
structure as proposed herein.

OTHER BENEFITS TO FMR. The Board of Trustees and the Independent
Trustees also considered the character and amount of fees paid by the
fund and the fund's shareholders for services provided by FMR and its
affiliates, including fees for services like transfer agency, fund
accounting and direct shareholder services. They also considered the
allocation of fund brokerage to brokers affiliated with FMR and the
receipt of sales loads and payments under Rule 12b-1 plans in respect
of certain of the Fidelity funds. The Board of Trustees and the
Independent Trustees also considered the revenues and profitability of
FMR businesses other than its mutual fund business, including FMR's
retail brokerage, correspondent brokerage, capital markets, trust,
investment advisory, pension record keeping, credit card, insurance,
publishing, real estate, international research and investment funds,
and others. The Board of Trustees and the Independent Trustees
considered the intangible benefits that accrue to FMR and its
affiliates by virtue of their relationship with the fund.

OTHER BENEFITS TO SHAREHOLDERS. The Board of Trustees and the
Independent Trustees considered the benefit to shareholders of
investing in a fund that is part of a large family of funds offering a
variety of investment disciplines and providing for a large variety of
fund and shareholder services.

With regard to the section of the proposed contract describing the
changes to portfolio transactions, the Trustees considered the value
of research provided by the broker-dealers, the quality of the
execution services provided, and the level of commissions paid. While
the fund does not generally purchase securities through a
broker-dealer by paying commissions, the Board of Trustees determined
that amending the management contract to expressly recognize the
authority of FMR to use affiliated broker-dealers and broker-dealers
who provide research services furthers the goal of standardizing
management contracts for Fidelity funds, and that explicitly
permitting all Fidelity funds to utilize certain broker-dealers is
beneficial to the fund.

CONCLUSION. Based on their evaluation of all material factors and
assisted by the advice of independent counsel, the Trustees concluded

(i) that the existing management fee structure is fair and reasonable
and (ii) that the proposed modifications to the management fee
structure, that is the reduction of the Group Fee Rate schedule, and
the addition of the discussion of FMR's ability to use brokers and
dealers to execute portfolio transactions, are in the best interest of
the fund's shareholders. The Board of Trustees, including the
Independent Trustees, voted to approve the submission of the Amended
Contract to shareholders of the fund and recommends that shareholders
of the fund vote FOR the Amended Contract.

ADOPTION OF STANDARDIZED INVESTMENT LIMITATIONS
The primary purpose of Proposals 6 and 7 is to revise certain of the
funds' investment limitations to conform to limitations which are
standard for similar types of funds managed by FMR. The Board of
Trustees asked FMR to analyze the various fundamental and
non-fundamental investment limitations of the Fidelity funds, and,
where practical and appropriate to a fund's investment objective and
policies, propose to shareholders adoption of standard fundamental
limitations and elimination of certain other fundamental limitations.
Generally, when fundamental limitations are eliminated, Fidelity's
standard non-fundamental limitations replace them. By making these
limitations non-fundamental, the Board of Trustees may amend a
limitation as they deem appropriate, without seeking shareholder
approval. The Board of Trustees would amend the limitations to
respond, for instance, to developments in the marketplace, or changes
in federal or state law. The costs of shareholder meetings called for
these purposes are generally borne by a fund and its shareholders.

It is not anticipated that these proposals will substantially affect
the way a fund is currently managed. However, FMR is presenting them
to you for your approval because FMR believes that increased
standardization will help to promote operational efficiencies and
facilitate monitoring of compliance with fundamental and
non-fundamental investment limitations. Although adoption of a new or
revised limitation is not likely to have any impact on the current
investment techniques employed by a fund, it will contribute to the
overall objectives of standardization.

6. TO AMEND FIDELITY CONNECTICUT MUNICIPAL MONEY MARKET FUND'S AND
FIDELITY NEW JERSEY MUNICIPAL MONEY MARKET FUND'S FUNDAMENTAL
INVESTMENT LIMITATION CONCERNING THE ISSUANCE OF SENIOR SECURITIES.
Each fund's current fundamental investment limitation regarding the
issuance of senior securities states:

"The fund may not issue bonds or any other class of securities
preferred over shares of the fund in respect of the fund's assets or
earnings, provided that Fidelity Court Street Trust II may issue
additional series of shares in accordance with the Trust Instrument."
The Trustees recommend that shareholders vote to replace this
limitation with the following fundamental investment limitation
governing the issuance of senior securities:

"The fund may not issue senior securities, except as permitted under
the Investment Company Act of 1940."

The primary purpose of the proposal is to revise each fund's
fundamental senior securities limitation to conform to a limitation
that is expected to become standard for all funds managed by FMR. (See
"Adoption of Standardized Investment Limitations" on page        .) If
the proposal is approved, the new fundamental senior securities
limitation cannot be changed without the approval of shareholders.

Adoption of the proposed limitation on senior securities is not
expected to affect the way in which each fund is managed, the
investment performance of each fund, or the securities or instruments
in which each fund invests. However, the proposed limitation clarifies
that each fund may issue senior securities to the extent permitted
under the 1940 Act.

Although the definition of a "senior security" involves complex
statutory and regulatory concepts, a senior security is generally
thought of as an obligation of a fund which has a claim to the fund's
assets or earnings that takes precedence over the claims of the fund's
shareholders. The 1940 Act generally prohibits mutual funds from
issuing senior securities; however, mutual funds are permitted to
engage in certain types of transactions that might be considered
"senior securities" as long as certain conditions are satisfied. For
example, a transaction which obligates a fund to pay money at a future
date (e.g., the purchase of securities for settlement on a date that
is further away than the normal settlement period) may be considered a
"senior security." A mutual fund, however, is permitted to enter into
this type of transaction if it maintains a segregated account
containing liquid securities in an amount equal to its obligation to
pay cash for the securities at a future date. Each fund utilizes
transactions that may be considered "senior securities" only in
accordance with applicable regulatory requirements under the 1940 Act.

CONCLUSION. The Board of Trustees has concluded that the proposal
will benefit each fund and its shareholders. The Trustees recommend
voting FOR the proposal. Upon shareholder approval, the amended
fundamental limitation will become effective when the disclosure is
revised to reflect the changes. If the proposal is not approved by the
shareholders of a fund, that fund's current limitation will remain
unchanged.

7. TO AMEND FIDELITY CONNECTICUT MUNICIPAL MONEY MARKET FUND'S,
FIDELITY NEW JERSEY MUNICIPAL MONEY MARKET FUND'S AND SPARTAN
CONNECTICUT MUNICIPAL MONEY MARKET FUND'S FUNDAMENTAL INVESTMENT
LIMITATION CONCERNING THE CONCENTRATION OF ITS INVESTMENTS IN A SINGLE
INDUSTRY.

Fidelity Connecticut Municipal Money Market Fund's and Fidelity New
Jersey Municipal Money Market Fund's current fundamental investment
limitation concerning the concentration of its investments within a
single industry states:

"The fund may not purchase the securities of any issuer (other than
securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or any of its
agencies, instrumentalities, territories or possessions,        or
issued or guaranteed by a state government or political subdivision
thereof) if, as a result, more than 25% of the value of its total
assets would be invested in securities of companies having their
principal business activities in the same industry."
Spartan Connecticut Municipal Money Market Fund's current fundamental
investment limitation concerning the concentration of its investments
within a single industry states:

"The fund may not purchase the securities of any issuer (other than
securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government or any of its
agencies or instrumentalities, or municipal securities issued or
guaranteed by a U.S. territory or possession or a state or local
government, or a political subdivision of any of the foregoing) if, as
a result, more than 25% of the fund's total assets would be invested
in the securities of companies whose principal business activities are
in the same industry."

The Trustees recommend that shareholders of each fund vote to replace
this fundamental investment limitation with the following amended
fundamental investment limitation governing concentration:

"The fund may not purchase the securities of any issuer (other than
securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government or any of its
agencies or instrumentalities, or tax-exempt obligations issued or
guaranteed by a U.S. territory or possession or a state or local
government, or a political subdivision of any of the foregoing) if, as
a result, more than 25% of the fund's total assets would be invested
in the securities of companies whose principal business activities are
in the same industry."

The primary purpose of the proposal is to revise each fund's
fundamental concentration limitation to conform to a limitation which
is expected to become standard for all municipal funds managed by FMR.
(See "Adoption of Standardized Investment Limitations" on page
.)    For Spartan Connecticut Municipal Money Market Fund, the
impact of the change in the investment limitation is that certain
private purpose municipal securities that are municipal securities but
not tax-exempt obligations under the Tax-Reform Act of 1986, are no
longer excluded from the concentration limits.     If the proposal is
approved, the new fundamental concentration limitation could not be
changed without the approval of shareholders.

Adoption of the proposed amended limitation on concentration is not
expected to affect the way each fund is managed, the investment
performance of each fund, or the securities or instruments in which
each fund invests.

The proposed amended limitation is not substantially different from
the current policy and is not likely to have any impact on the
investment techniques employed by each fund.

CONCLUSION. The Board of Trustees has concluded that the proposal
will benefit each fund and its shareholders. The Trustees recommend
voting FOR the proposal. Upon shareholder approval, the amended
fundamental limitation will become effective when the disclosure is
revised to reflect the changes. If the proposal is not approved by the
shareholders of a fund, that fund's current limitation will remain
unchanged.

OTHER BUSINESS

The Board knows of no other business to be brought before the
Meeting. However, if any other matters properly come before the
Meeting, it is the intention that proxies that do not contain specific
instructions to the contrary will be voted on such matters in
accordance with the judgment of the persons therein designated.

ACTIVITIES AND MANAGEMENT OF FMR

FMR, a corporation organized in 1946, serves as investment adviser to
a number of investment companies. Information concerning the advisory
fees, net assets, and total expenses of funds with investment
objectives similar to Fidelity Connecticut Municipal Money Market Fund
and Fidelity New Jersey Municipal Money Market Fund and advised by FMR
is contained in the Table of Average Net Assets and Expense Ratios in
Exhibit 3 beginning on page .

FMR, its officers and directors, its affiliated companies, and the
Trustees, from time to time have transactions with various banks,
including the custodian banks for certain of the funds advised by FMR.
Those transactions that have occurred to date have included mortgages
and personal and general business loans. In the judgment of FMR, the
terms and conditions of those transactions were not influenced by
existing or potential custodial or other fund relationships.

The Directors of FMR are Edward C. Johnson 3d, Chairman of the Board
and of the Executive Committee; Robert C. Pozen, President; and Peter
S. Lynch, Vice Chairman. With the exception of Robert C. Pozen, who is
proposed for election as a Trustee,each of the Directors is also a
Trustee of the trust. Messrs. Johnson 3d, Pozen, J. Gary Burkhead,
John H. Costello, Arthur S. Loring, Thomas D. Maher, Thomas    J.

Simpson, Richard A. Silver, Leonard M. Rush, Fred L. Henning, Jr.,
Boyce    I.     Greer, and Scott A. Orr are currently officers of the
trust and officers or employees of FMR or FMR Corp. With the exception
of Mr. Costello, Mr. Simpson, and Mr. Silver, all of these persons
hold or have options to acquire stock of FMR Corp. The principal
business address of each of the Directors of FMR is 82 Devonshire
Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02109.

All of the stock of FMR is owned by its parent company, FMR Corp., 82
Devonshire Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02109, which was organized on
October 31, 1972. Members of Mr. Edward C. Johnson 3d's family are the
predominant owners of a class of shares of common stock, representing
approximately 49% of the voting power of FMR Corp., and, therefore,
under the 1940 Act may be deemed to form a controlling group with
respect to FMR Corp.

During the period December 1, 1995 through August 31, 1997 no
transactions were entered into by Trustees and nominees as Trustee of
the trust involving more than 1% of the voting common, non-voting
common and equivalent stock, or preferred stock of FMR Corp.

ACTIVITIES AND MANAGEMENT OF FMR TEXAS

FMR Texas is a wholly owned subsidiary of FMR formed in 1989 to
provide portfolio management services to Fidelity's money market funds
and investment advice with respect to money market instruments.

Funds with investment objectives similar to Fidelity Connecticut
Municipal Money Market Fund and Fidelity New Jersey Municipal Money
Market Fund for which FMR has entered into a sub-advisory agreement
with FMR Texas, and the net assets of each of these funds, are
indicated in the Table of Average Net Assets and Expense Ratios in
Exhibit 3 beginning on page .

The Directors of FMR Texas are Edward C. Johnson 3d, Chairman, and
Robert C. Pozen, President. Mr. Johnson 3d also is President and a
Trustee of the trust and of other funds advised by FMR; Chairman,
Chief Executive Officer, President, and a Director of FMR Corp.;

President of the trust and a Senior Vice President and Trustee of
other funds advised by FMR; a Director of FMR Corp.; Director of FMR;
and President and Director of FMR U.K. and FMR Far East. Each of the
Directors is a stockholder of FMR Corp. The principal business address
of the Directors is 82 Devonshire Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02109.

PRESENT MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS FOR FIDELITY CONNECTICUT MUNICIPAL MONEY
MARKET FUND AND FIDELITY NEW JERSEY MUNICIPAL MONEY MARKET FUND
Each fund employs FMR to furnish investment advisory and other
services. Under its management contract with each fund, FMR acts as
investment adviser and, subject to the supervision of the Board of
Trustees, directs the investments of each fund in accordance with its
investment objective, policies, and limitations. FMR also provides
each fund with all necessary office facilities and personnel for
servicing each fund's investments, compensates all officers of each
fund and all Trustees who are "interested persons" of the trust or of
FMR, and all personnel of each fund or FMR performing services
relating to research, statistical, and investment activities.

In addition, FMR or its affiliates, subject to the supervision of the
Board of Trustees, provide the management and administrative services
necessary for the operation of each fund. These services include
providing facilities for maintaining each fund's organization;
supervising relations with custodians, transfer and pricing agents,
accountants, underwriters, and other persons dealing with each fund;
preparing all general shareholder communications and conducting
shareholder relations; maintaining each fund's records and the
registration of each fund's shares under federal and state laws;
developing management and shareholder services for each fund; and
furnishing reports, evaluations, and analyses on a variety of subjects
to the Trustees. Services provided by affiliates of FMR will continue
under the proposed management contract described in proposals 4 and 5.

In addition to the management fee payable to FMR, each fund
reimburses UMB Bank, n.a. (UMB) for its services as the fund's
custodian and transfer agent. Although each fund's current management
contract provides that each fund will pay for typesetting, printing,
and mailing prospectuses, statements of additional information,
notices, and reports to shareholders, the trust, on behalf of each
fund has entered into a revised transfer agent agreement with UMB,
pursuant to which UMB bears the costs of providing these services to
existing shareholders. Other expenses paid by each fund include
interest, taxes, brokerage commissions, and each fund's proportionate
share of insurance premiums and Investment Company Institute dues. The
fund is also liable for such non-recurring expenses as may arise,
including costs of any litigation to which the fund may be a party,
and any obligation it may have to indemnify the trust's officers and
Trustees with respect to litigation.

UMB has entered into a sub-contract with Fidelity Service Company,
Inc. (FSC), an affiliate of FMR, under the terms of which FSC performs
the processing activities associated with providing transfer agent and
shareholder servicing functions for the fund. Under the sub-contract,
FSC bears the expense of typesetting, printing, and mailing
prospectuses, statements of additional information, and all other
reports, notices, and statements to shareholders, except proxy
statements. FSC also pays all out-of-pocket expenses associated with
transfer agent services. Transfer agent fees and pricing and
bookkeeping fees, including reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses,
paid to FSC by UMB on behalf of Fidelity Connecticut Municipal Money
Market Fund and Fidelity New Jersey Municipal Money Market Fund for
the fiscal year ended November 30, 1996 were $578,870 and $910,968,
respectively.

Each fund also has a distribution agreement with FDC, a Massachusetts
corporation organized on July 18, 1960. FDC is a broker-dealer
registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is a member
of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Each
distribution agreement calls for FDC to use all reasonable efforts,
consistent with its other business, to secure purchasers for shares of
the fund, which are continuously offered at net asset value per share.
Promotional and administrative expenses in connection with the offer
and sale of shares are paid by FMR.

FMR is Fidelity Connecticut Municipal Money Market Fund's and
Fidelity New Jersey Municipal Money Market Fund's manager pursuant to
management contracts dated February 28, 1992, which were approved by
Court Street Trust, then sole shareholder of the fund on March 1,
1992.

For the services of FMR under the contract, each fund pays FMR a
monthly management fee composed of the sum of two elements: a group
fee rate and an individual fund fee rate.

The group fee rate is based on the monthly average net assets of all
of the registered investment companies with which FMR has management
contracts and is calculated on a cumulative basis pursuant to the
graduated fee rate schedule shown below on the left. The schedule
on page      on the right shows the effective annual group fee rate
at various asset levels, which is the result of cumulatively applying
the annualized rates on the left. For example, the effective annual
fee rate at $447 billion of group net assets - the approximate level
for November 1996 - was 0.1429%, which is the weighted average of the
respective fee rates for each level of group net assets up to $447
billion.

Under each fund's current management contract with FMR, the group fee
rate is based on a schedule with breakpoints ending at .1500% for
average group assets in excess of $84 billion. The group fee rate
breakpoints shown above for average group assets in excess of $120
billion and under $228 billion were voluntarily adopted by FMR on
January 1, 1992. The additional breakpoints shown above for average
group assets in excess of $228 billion were voluntarily adopted by FMR
on November 1, 1993.

On August 1, 1994, FMR voluntarily revised the prior extensions to
the group fee rate schedule, and added new breakpoints for average
group assets in excess of $156 billion and under $372 billion as shown
in the schedule below, pending shareholder approval of a new
management contract reflecting the revised schedule. The revised group
fee rate schedule provides for lower management fee rates as FMR's
assets under management increase. The revised group fee rate schedule
was identical to the above schedule for average group assets under
$156 billion.

On January 1, 1996, FMR voluntarily added new breakpoints to the
revised schedule for average group assets in excess of $372 billion,
pending shareholder approval of a new management contract reflecting
the revised schedule and additional breakpoints. The revised group fee
rate schedule and its extensions provide for lower management fee
rates as FMR's assets under management increase. For average group
assets in excess of $156 billion, the revised group fee rate schedule
with additional breakpoints voluntarily adopted by FMR is as follows:

The individual fund fee rate is 0.25%. Based on the average group net
assets of the funds advised by FMR for November 30, 1996, the annual
management fee rate would be calculated as follows:

FIDELITY CONNECTICUT MUNICIPAL MONEY MARKET FUND








Group Fee Rate         Individual Fund         Management Fee Rate
                       Fee Rate

0.1429%          +     0.25%             =     0.3929%

                       Fee Rate

0.1429%          +     0.25%             =     0.3929%








One-twelfth of this annual management fee rate is applied to each
fund's net assets averaged for the month, giving a dollar amount,
which is the fee for that month.

During fiscal year ended November 30, 1996, FMR received $1,308,203
and $1,726,411 for its services as investment adviser to Fidelity
Connecticut Municipal Money Market Fund and Fidelity New Jersey
Municipal Money Market Fund, respectively. This fee was equivalent to
0.3956% and 0.3956%, respectively, of the average net assets of
Fidelity Connecticut Municipal Money Market Fund and Fidelity New
Jersey Municipal Money Market Fund.

FMR may, from time to time, voluntarily reimburse all or a portion of
each fund's operating expenses (exclusive of interest, taxes,
brokerage commissions, and extraordinary expenses). FMR retains the
ability to be repaid for these expense reimbursements in the amount
that expenses fall below the limit prior to the end of the fiscal
year. Expense reimbursements by FMR will increase each fund's total
returns and yield and repayment of the reimbursement by each fund will
lower its total returns and yield.

SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENTS FOR FIDELITY CONNECTICUT MUNICIPAL MONEY
MARKET FUND AND FIDELITY NEW JERSEY MUNICIPAL MONEY MARKET FUND
On behalf of Fidelity Connecticut Municipal Money Market Fund and
Fidelity New jersey Municipal Money Market Fund, FMR has entered into
a sub-advisory agreement with FMR Texas Inc. (FMR Texas) pursuant to
which FMR Texas has primary responsibility for providing portfolio
investment management services to each fund. Fidelity Connecticut
Municipal Money Market Fund's sub-advisory agreement, dated February
28, 1992, was approved by Court Street Trust as sole shareholder of
the fund on March 1, 1992 pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of
Conversion approved by shareholders of the fund on December 11, 1991.
Fidelity New Jersey Municipal Money Market Fund's sub-advisory
agreement, dated February 28, 1992, was approved by Court Street Trust
as sole shareholder of the fund on March 1, 1992 pursuant to an
Agreement and Plan of Conversion approved by shareholders of the fund
on December 11, 1991. The terms of Fidelity Connecticut Municipal
Money Market Fund's and Fidelity New Jersey Municipal Money Market
Fund's current sub-advisory agreements with FMR Texas duplicate those
of their previous sub-advisory agreements which were dated November 1,
1990 and December 1, 1989, respectively and approved by FMR as sole
shareholder.

Under the sub-advisory agreements, FMR pays FMR Texas fees equal to
50% of the management fee payable to FMR under its management contract
with each fund after payments by FMR pursuant to each fund's 12b-1
plan, if any. The fees paid to FMR Texas are not reduced by any
voluntary or mandatory expense reimbursements that may be in effect
from time to time. For the fiscal year ended November 30, 1996, FMR
paid FMR Texas fees of $654,102 and $863,206, on behalf of Fidelity
Connecticut Municipal Money Market Fund and Fidelity New Jersey
Municipal Money Market Fund, respectively.

PORTFOLIO TRANSACTIONS

All orders for the purchase or sale of portfolio securities are
placed on behalf of each fund by FMR pursuant to authority contained
in the fund's management contract.

FMR may place agency transactions with National Financial Services
Corporation (NFSC) an indirect subsidiary of FMR Corp., if the
commissions are fair, reasonable, and comparable to commissions
charged by non-affiliated, qualified brokerage firms for similar
services.

During fiscal 1996 the funds paid no brokerage commissions to
affiliated brokers.

Dear Shareholder:

I am writing to let you know that a special meeting of shareholders will be held on April 16, 2008. The purpose of the meeting is to provide you
with the opportunity to vote on important proposals that affect the funds and your investment in them. As a shareholder, you have the
opportunity to voice your opinion on the matters that affect your funds. This package contains information about the proposals and the
materials to use when casting your vote.

Please read the enclosed materials and cast your vote on the proxy card(s). Please vote your shares promptly. Your vote is extremely
important, no matter how large or small your holdings may be.

Each proposal has been carefully reviewed by the Board of Trustees. The Trustees, most of whom are not affiliated with Fidelity, are
responsible for protecting your interests as a shareholder. The Trustees believe these proposals are in the interests of shareholders. They
recommend that you vote for each proposal.

The following Q&A is provided to assist you in understanding the proposals. Each of the proposals is described in greater detail in the enclosed
proxy statement.

Voting is quick and easy. Everything you need is enclosed. To cast your vote, simply complete the proxy card(s) enclosed in this
package. Be sure to sign the card(s) before mailing it in the postage-paid envelope. You may also vote your shares by touch-tone telephone or
through the internet. Simply call the toll-free number or visit the web site indicated on your proxy card(s), enter the control number found on
the card(s), and follow the recorded or online instructions.

If you have any questions before you vote, please call Fidelity at 1-800-544-3198 (for retail shareholders) or 1-877-208-0098 (for institutional
and Advisor class shareholders). We'll be glad to help you get your vote in quickly. Thank you for your participation in this important initiative. 

Sincerely,

/s/Edward C. Johnson 3d

Edward C. Johnson 3d
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

Important information to help you understand and vote on the
proposals 

Please read the full text of the proxy statement. Below is a brief overview of the proposals to be voted upon. Your vote is important. We appreciate you placing your trust
in Fidelity and look forward to helping you achieve your financial goals. 

Q. What am I being asked to vote on? 

A. The Board of Trustees of the Fidelity funds, with the support of Fidelity Management & Research Co. (FMR), has decided to create a two-Board structure. In
connection with this decision, you are being asked to elect a Board of Trustees to oversee the funds you own.

In addition, shareholders of funds in Fidelity Advisor Series II and Fidelity Court Street Trust are being asked to amend the Declaration of Trust for their funds and
trusts to reduce the required quorum for future shareholder meetings.

Q. What do you mean by a two-Board structure? 

A. Historically, the Board of each Fidelity fund has consisted the same group of individual Trustees who serve as Trustees for all other Fidelity funds. In effect, the
Fidelity funds have been overseen by a single Board of Trustees. The Trustees of the Fidelity funds -- with the support of FMR -- have made a decision to reorganize
themselves into two separate groups and thereby create two Boards. One Board will oversee Fidelity 's equity and high income funds (currently [212] funds with
approximate assets of [$862] billion), while the second Board will oversee Fidelity's investment-grade bond, money market, and asset allocation funds. (currently
[154] funds with approximate assets of [$442] billion).

Q. Why did the Board decide to create a two-Board structure?

A. The decision was based on three specific factors:


  Fidelity's mutual fund business continues to diversify into new asset classes and product types. For example, over the past few years, Fidelity has expanded its
product line of multi-asset class funds that invest in a variety of asset classes such as preferred stocks, REITs, inflation-protected securities, floating-rate securities,
and commodities. In addition, lifecycle funds and other types of packaged solutions continue to grow in popularity. As greater numbers of individuals continue to save
for, and transition into, retirement, the Trustees and FMR expect an increased demand for innovative products.
  As the securities marketplace has evolved, increasingly complex investment strategies are available to Fidelity's mutual funds. For example, the fixed income
marketplace has significantly expanded with new types of securities including different types of futures, options, and swaps, and that trend is likely to continue.
  Given prevailing demographic and business trends, the Trustees expect that Fidelity's mutual fund business will continue to expand. In recent years, Fidelity has
made efforts to position the firm as the most trusted provider of lifetime investment solutions in the U.S. At the same time, the amount of assets held by Americans over
age sixty is projected to increase dramatically between now and 2012 as the Baby Boomer generation nears and enters retirement. The Trustees and FMR believe this
provides a significant growth opportunity for Fidelity's business and for the mutual fund industry as a whole. Increased interest in principal preservation and income
distribution is expected to drive asset growth in Fidelity's fixed income funds and asset allocation products, in particular.

Q. What is involved in creating a two-Board structure?

A. Some existing Trustees and Advisory Board Members are proposed to serve on the Board overseeing the equity and high income funds, while the others are proposed
to serve on the Board overseeing the fixed income and asset allocation funds. In some cases, the two Boards can be created by having an existing Trustee resign and the
remaining Trustees fill the vacancy. In the majority of cases, however, the Investment Company Act of 1940 (1940 Act) requires that a shareholder meeting be held to
elect Trustees.

Q. When and how will the two-Board structure be implemented?

A. The two-Board structure will be implemented at the same time for all Fidelity funds. On August 1, 2008, or, if later, immediately after the last election is held for any
Fidelity fund scheduled to elect Trustees in connection with implementing the two-Board structure, the following will occur: Current Trustees will remain on the
Boards to which they have been elected or appointed and resign from the Boards on which they will no longer serve. Former Advisory Board Members that have been
elected or appointed as Trustees will join the Boards on which they will serve going forward. The size of the Board that will oversee the equity and high income funds
will be fixed at 10 Trustees, and the size of the Board that will oversee the fixed income and asset allocation funds will be fixed at eight Trustees. 

Q. What is the affiliation of the Board and Fidelity? 

A. Currently, there are two "interested" Trustees and nine "Independent" Trustees. Under the two-Board structure, it is expected that there initially will be 2 interested
Trustees on each Board, 8 Independent Trustees on the equity and high income Board, and 6 Independent Trustees on the fixed income and asset allocation Board.
Trustees are determined to be "interested" by virtue of, among other things, their affiliation with the funds, trusts, or various other entities under common control with
FMR. Interested Trustees are compensated by FMR. Independent Trustees have no affiliation with FMR and are compensated by each individual fund. Each of the new
Boards is expected to have 75 percent or more Independent Trustees.

Q. Will the Trustees that currently oversee my funds change?

A. Trustees on both Boards will continue to be experienced executives who will meet throughout the year to oversee the funds' activities, review contractual
arrangements with companies that provide services to the funds, and review fund performance. However, certain changes in Board membership are proposed,
depending on which Board a Trustee expects to join.

The current Board consists of 11 Trustees: Dennis J. Dirks, Albert R. Gamper, George H. Heilmeier, James H. Keyes, Marie L. Knowles, Ned C. Lautenbach, Cornelia M.
Small, William S. Stavropoulos, and Kenneth L. Wolfe are Independent Trustees, and Edward C. Johnson 3d and James C. Curvey are interested Trustees. Arthur E.
Johnson (no relation to Edward C. Johnson 3d), Alan Lacy, Joseph Mauriello, David M. Thomas, and Michael E. Wiley currently serve on the Advisory Board. At the time
that the two-Board structure is implemented, the size of the equity and high income funds' Board will be fixed at 10 Trustees and the size of the fixed income and asset
allocation funds' Board will be fixed at eight Trustees.

Dennis J. Dirks, Alan Lacy, Ned C. Lautenbach, Joseph Mauriello, Cornelia M. Small, William S. Stavropoulos, David M. Thomas, Michael E. Wiley, James C. Curvey, and
Edward C. Johnson 3d are proposed to serve on the Board overseeing the equity and high income funds. Albert R. Gamper, George H. Heilmeier, Arthur E. Johnson,
James H. Keyes, Marie L. Knowles, Kenneth L. Wolfe, James C. Curvey, and Edward C. Johnson 3d are proposed to serve on the Board overseeing the fixed income and
asset allocation funds. Biographical information for each nominee for the fixed income and asset allocation Board is included in the proxy statement. 

The Trustees fully expect that the environment of strong governance of the funds and protection of the interests of fund shareholders will continue under the new
structure.

Q. Why are you proposing to reduce the required quorum for future shareholder meetings for certain funds and trusts?

A. Lowering the quorum requirement will facilitate holding shareholder meetings to approve important matters necessary for the conduct of the trusts' business. When
not enough shareholders vote, a trust may be forced to adjourn meetings multiple times and incur the expense of additional shareholder solicitations and proxy
solicitors in order to obtain the shareholder vote necessary to hold a meeting. The reduced quorum requirement is not prohibited by Massachusetts or federal law.

Although the lower quorum requirement will allow for the approval of some matters by shareholders constituting less than a majority of the outstanding shares, certain
other proposals will still require a higher number of shares to be voted to meet the threshold required to approve the proposal. For example, the 1940 Act requires that
certain items, such as management contracts and 12b-1 plans, be approved by a majority of a fund's outstanding voting securities. Under the 1940 Act, the vote of a
"majority of the outstanding voting securities" means the affirmative vote of the lesser of (a) 67% or more of the voting securities present at a shareholder meeting or
represented by proxy if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities are present or represented by proxy, or (b) more than 50% of the outstanding
voting securities. The reduced quorum requirement will not affect such matters. 

Q. What role does the Board play generally? 

A. The Trustees serve as the fund shareholders' representatives. Members of the Board are fiduciaries and have an obligation to serve the best interests of shareholders,
including consideration of policy changes. In addition, the Trustees review fund performance, oversee fund activities, and review contractual arrangements with
companies that provide services to the fund. 

Q. Are Board members paid? 

A. Each Independent Trustee receives a fee for his or her service on the Board and participates in a deferred compensation plan. You can find the compensation table,
which details fees that have been paid to the Trustees, in the proxy statement. 

Q. Has the funds' Board of Trustees approved the proposals? 

A. Yes. The Board of Trustees has unanimously approved each of the proposals, and recommends that you vote to approve them.

Q. Who is D.F. King & Co., Inc.? 

A. D.F. King is a third party proxy vendor that Fidelity hires to call shareholders and record proxy votes. In order to hold a shareholder meeting, quorum must be
reached - which currently is a majority of the shares entitled to vote in person or by proxy at the shareholder meeting. If quorum is not attained, the meeting must
adjourn to a future date. Fidelity attempts to reach shareholders via multiple mailings to remind them to cast their vote. As the meeting approaches, phone calls may
be made to clients who have not yet voted their shares so that the shareholder meeting does not have to be postponed.

Voting your shares immediately will help minimize additional solicitation expenses and prevent the need to make a call to you to solicit your vote. 

Q. Who is paying for this proxy mailing and for the other solicitation costs associated with this shareholder meeting?

A. The expenses in connection with preparing this Proxy Statement and its enclosures and all solicitations will be paid by each fund and class, as applicable, provided
the expenses do not exceed any existing expense caps. Expenses exceeding an expense cap will be paid by FMR. 

Q. How many votes am I entitled to cast? 

A. As a shareholder, you are entitled to one vote for each dollar of net asset value you own of the fund on the record date. The record date is February 19, 2008. 

Q. How do I vote my shares? 

A. You can vote your shares by completing and signing the enclosed proxy card(s) and mailing it in the enclosed postage-paid envelope. You may also vote by touch-tone
telephone by calling the toll-free number printed on your proxy card(s) and following the recorded instructions. In addition, you may vote through the internet by
visiting www.proxyweb.com/proxy and following the on-line instructions. If you need any assistance, or have any questions regarding the proposals or how to vote
your shares, please call Fidelity at 1-800-544-3198 (for retail shareholders) or 1-877-208-0098 (for institutional and Advisor class shareholders).

Q. How do I sign the proxy card? 

A. Individual Accounts:  Shareholders should sign exactly as their names appear on the account registration shown on the card. 

Joint Accounts:  Either owner may sign, but the name of the person signing should conform exactly to a name shown in the registration. 

All Other Accounts:   The person signing must indicate his or her capacity. For example, a trustee for a trust or other entity should sign, "Ann B. Collins, Trustee."

The purpose of the Meeting is set forth in the accompanying Notice. The solicitation is being made primarily by the mailing of this Proxy Statement and the
accompanying proxy on or about February 19, 2008. Supplementary solicitations may be made by mail, telephone, telegraph, facsimile, electronic means or by
personal interview by representatives of the trusts. In addition, D.F. King & Co., Inc. may be paid on a per-call basis to solicit shareholders by telephone on
behalf of the funds in the trusts. The funds also may also arrange to have votes recorded by telephone. D.F. King & Co., Inc. may be paid on a per-call basis for
vote-by-phone solicitations on behalf of the funds. The approximate anticipated total cost of these services is detailed in Appendix B.

If the funds record votes by telephone or through the internet, they will use procedures designed to authenticate shareholders' identities, to allow
shareholders to authorize the voting of their shares in accordance with their instructions, and to confirm that their instructions have been properly recorded.
Proxies voted by telephone or through the internet may be revoked at any time before they are voted in the same manner that proxies voted by mail may be
revoked.

For New Jersey AMT Tax-Free Money Market Fund, Retirement Government Money Market Fund, and Retirement Money Market Fund, the expenses in
connection with preparing this Proxy Statement and its enclosures and all solicitations will be paid by FMR. For the other funds, the expenses in connection
with preparing this Proxy Statement and its enclosures and all solicitations will be paid by each fund and class, as applicable, provided the expenses do not
exceed any existing expense caps. See Appendix C for current expense cap information. Expenses exceeding an expense cap will be paid by FMR.

The funds (or FMR in the case of New Jersey AMT Tax-Free Money Market Fund, Retirement Government Money Market Fund, and Retirement Money
Market Fund) will reimburse brokerage firms and others for their reasonable expenses in forwarding solicitation material to the beneficial owners of shares.
The costs are allocated among the funds based upon the number of shareholder accounts in each fund. The costs are allocated on a pro rata basis to each class
of a fund based on the net assets of each class relative to the total net assets of the fund.

The principal business address of FMR, each fund's investment adviser and administrator, is 245 Summer Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02210. The
principal business address of Fidelity Distributors Corporation (FDC), each fund's principal underwriter and distribution agent, is 82 Devonshire Street, Boston,
Massachusetts, 02109. The principal business address of Fidelity Investments Money Management, Inc, (FIMM), sub-advisor to the funds, is One Spartan
Way, Merrimack, New Hampshire 03054. Fidelity Management & Research (U.K.) Inc. (FMR U.K.), located at 25 Lovat Lane, London, EC3R 8LL, England;
Fidelity Research & Analysis Company (FRAC), located at 245 Summer Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02210; Fidelity Investments Japan Limited (FIJ), located
at Shiroyama Trust Tower, 4-3-1 Toranomon Minato-ku, Tokyo 105, Japan; Fidelity International Investment Advisors (FIIA), located at Pembroke Hall, 42 Crow
Lane, Pembroke HM19, Bermuda; and Fidelity International Investment Advisors (U.K.) Limited (FIIA(U.K.)L), located at 25 Cannon Street, London, England
EC4M5TA are also sub-advisers to the funds.

If the enclosed proxy is executed and returned, or an internet or telephonic vote is delivered, that vote may nevertheless be revoked at any time prior to its
use by written notification received by a trust, by the execution of a later-dated proxy, by a trust's receipt of a subsequent valid internet or telephonic vote, or by
attending the Meeting and voting in person.

All proxies solicited by the Board of Trustees that are properly executed and received by a fund's Secretary prior to the Meeting, and are not revoked, will be
voted at the Meeting. Shares represented by such proxies will be voted in accordance with the instructions thereon. If no specification is made on a properly
executed proxy, it will be voted FOR the matters specified on the proxy. All shares that are voted and votes to ABSTAIN will be counted towards establishing a
quorum, as will broker non-votes. (Broker non-votes are shares for which (i) the beneficial owner has not voted and (ii) the broker holding the shares does not
have discretionary authority to vote on the particular matter.)

With respect to fund shares held in Fidelity individual retirement accounts (including Traditional, Rollover, SEP, SARSEP, Roth and SIMPLE IRAs), the IRA
Custodian will vote those shares for which it has received instructions from shareholders only in accordance with such instructions. If Fidelity IRA
shareholders do not vote their shares, the IRA Custodian will vote their shares for them, in the same proportion as other Fidelity IRA shareholders have voted.

If a quorum is not present at a Meeting, or if a quorum is present at a Meeting but sufficient votes to approve Proposal 1 are not received, or if other matters
arise requiring shareholder attention, the persons named as proxy agents may propose one or more adjournments of the Meeting to permit further solicitation
of proxies. Any such adjournment will require the affirmative vote of a majority of those shares present at the Meeting or represented by proxy. When voting on
a proposed adjournment, the persons named as proxy agents will vote FOR the proposed adjournment all shares that they are entitled to vote with respect to
each item, unless directed to vote AGAINST an item, in which case such shares will be voted AGAINST the proposed adjournment with respect to that item. A
shareholder vote may be taken on one or more of the items in this Proxy Statement prior to such adjournment if sufficient votes have been received and it is
otherwise appropriate.

Shares of each fund and class, if applicable, issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2007 are indicated in Appendix D.

Substantial (5% or more) record and/or beneficial ownership of each fund and class, as applicable, on December 31, 2007, to the knowledge of each trust,
is detailed in Appendix E. Other than disclosed in Appendix E, to the knowledge of each trust, no other shareholder owned of record or beneficially more than
5% of the outstanding shares of each fund and class, as applicable, on that date.

FMR has advised the trusts that certain shares are registered to FMR or an FMR affiliate. To the extent that FMR or an FMR affiliate has discretion to vote,
these shares will be voted at the Meeting FOR each proposal. Otherwise, these shares will be voted in accordance with the plan or agreement governing the
shares. Although the terms of the plans and agreements vary, generally the shares must be voted either (i) in accordance with instructions received from
shareholders or (ii) in accordance with instructions received from shareholders and, for shareholders who do not vote, in the same proportion as certain other
shareholders have voted.

Shareholders of record at the close of business on February 19, 2008 will be entitled to vote at the Meeting. Each such shareholder will be entitled to one
vote for each dollar of net asset value held on that date.

For a free copy of a fund's annual and/or semiannual reports, contact Fidelity at 1-800-544-3198 (for retail shareholders) or 1-877-208-0098 (for institutional
and Advisor class shareholders), visit Fidelity's web sites at www.fidelity.com or www.advisor.fidelity.com, or write to Fidelity Distributors Corporation (FDC) at 82
Devonshire Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02109.

VOTE REQUIRED: Approval of Proposal 1 requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of an entire trust voted in person or by proxy at the
Meeting, and a plurality of such shares is sufficient to elect trustees pursuant to Proposal 2. With respect to Proposal 1, votes to ABSTAIN and broker
non-votes will have the same effect as votes cast AGAINST the Proposal. With respect to Proposal 2, votes to ABSTAIN and broker non-votes will have no
effect.

The following table summarizes the proposals applicable to each fund:

1. TO AMEND THE DECLARATION OF TRUST OF EACH OF FIDELITY ADVISOR SERIES II AND FIDELITY COURT STREET TRUST TO REDUCE THE
REQUIRED QUORUM FOR FUTURE SHAREHOLDER MEETINGS.

The Declaration of Trust currently provides that a majority of the shares entitled to vote shall be a quorum for the transaction of business at a shareholders'
meeting. As amended, the Declaration of Trust (Article VIII, Section 3) would reduce the quorum required to one-third of the shares entitled to vote.

Lowering the quorum requirement will facilitate holding shareholder meetings to approve important matters necessary for the conduct of a trust's
business, such as the election of Trustees. When not enough shareholders vote, a trust may be forced to adjourn meetings multiple times and incur the expense
of additional shareholder solicitations and proxy solicitors in order to obtain the shareholder vote necessary to hold a meeting. The reduced quorum
requirement is not prohibited by Massachusetts or federal law.

Although the lower quorum requirement will allow for the approval of some matters by shareholders constituting less than a majority of the outstanding
shares, certain other proposals will still require a higher number of shares to be voted to meet the threshold required to approve the proposal. For example, the
Investment Company Act of 1940 (1940 Act) requires that certain items, such as management contracts and 12b-1 plans, be approved by a majority of a fund's
outstanding voting securities. Under the 1940 Act, the vote of a "majority of the outstanding voting securities" means the affirmative vote of the lesser of (a)
67% or more of the voting securities present at a shareholder meeting or represented by proxy if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding voting
securities are present or represented by proxy, or (b) more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities. The reduced quorum requirement will not affect such
matters.

Shareholders have the right to vote on any Declaration of Trust amendment affecting their right to vote or on any matter submitted to the shareholders by
the Trustees. On May 17, 2007, the Trustees approved the proposed amendment and also authorized its submission to each trust's shareholders for their
approval at this Meeting.

If approved, Article VIII, Section 3 of each Declaration of Trust will be amended as follows (new language is underlined; language to be deleted is
[bracketed]):

ARTICLE VIII
SHAREHOLDERS' VOTING POWERS AND MEETINGS

QUORUM AND REQUIRED VOTE

Section 3. Except when a higher quorum is required by any provision of this Declaration of Trust or the Bylaws, one-third [A majority] of Shares entitled to
vote in person or by proxy shall be a quorum for the transaction of business at a Shareholders' meeting, except that where any provision of law or of this
Declaration of Trust permits or requires that holders of any Series or Class shall vote as a Series or Class then one-third [a majority] of the aggregate number of
Shares of that Series or Class entitled to vote shall be necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business by that Series or Class. Any lesser
number shall be sufficient for adjournments. Any adjourned session or sessions may be held, within a reasonable time after the date set for the original
meeting, without the necessity of further notice. Except when a larger vote is required by applicable law or by any provision of this Declaration of Trust or the
Bylaws, if any, a majority of the Shares voted in person or by proxy shall decide any questions and a plurality shall elect a Trustee, provided that where any
provision of law or of this Declaration of Trust permits or requires that the holders of any Series or Class shall vote as a Series or Class, then a majority of the
Shares of that Series or Class voted on the matter shall decide that matter insofar as that Series or Class is concerned. Shareholders may act by unanimous
written consent. Actions taken by a Series or Class may be consented to unanimously in writing by Shareholders of that Series or Class.

Conclusion. The Board of Trustees of each trust has concluded that the proposal will benefit the trust and its shareholders. The Trustees recommend voting
FOR the proposal. The amended Declaration of Trust will become effective upon shareholder approval. If the proposal is not approved by shareholders of a
trust, the Declaration of Trust will remain unchanged.

2.  TO ELECT A BOARD OF TRUSTEES. 

The purpose of this proposal is to elect a Board of Trustees in connection with creating a two-Board structure for the Fidelity family of funds. You have
received this proxy statement because you own one or more Fidelity fixed income funds and you are being asked to elect a Board of Trustees to oversee your
funds.

Fidelity's mutual fund business and the broader mutual fund marketplace continue to expand and evolve. As a result, the Trustees of the Fidelity funds,
together with FMR, have been considering ways to structure the Board for each Fidelity fund in order to ensure that Fidelity's mutual fund shareholders
continue to be well served by Trustees in the years ahead. Historically, the Board of each Fidelity fund has consisted of the same group of individual Trustees
who serve as Trustees for all other Fidelity funds. In effect, the Fidelity funds have been overseen by a single Board of Trustees. The Trustees of the Fidelity
funds -- with the support of FMR -- have made a decision to reorganize themselves into two separate groups and thereby create two Boards. One Board will
oversee Fidelity's equity and high income funds (currently [212] funds with approximate assets of [$862] billion), while the second Board will oversee Fidelity's
investment-grade bond, money market, and asset allocation funds (currently [154] funds with approximate assets of [$442] billion).

In connection with creating two Boards, a slate of Trustees must be put in place to oversee each group of funds (the funds and trusts were aligned by
investment discipline in June 2007). Some existing Trustees and Advisory Board members are proposed to serve on the Board overseeing the equity and high
income funds, while the others are proposed to serve on the Board overseeing the fixed income and asset allocation funds. In some cases, the two Boards can
be created by having one existing Trustee resign and the remaining Trustees fill the vacancy. In the majority of cases, however, the 1940 Act requires that a
shareholder meeting be held to elect Trustees.

The Trustees, with the support of FMR, made the decision to create a two-Board structure in order to plan for the future, and based their decision on three
specific factors. First, Fidelity's mutual fund business continues to diversify into new asset classes and product types. For example, over the past few years,
Fidelity has expanded its product line of multi-asset class funds that invest in a variety of asset classes such as preferred stocks, REITs, inflation-protected
securities, floating-rate securities, and commodities. In addition, lifecycle funds and other types of packaged solutions continue to grow in popularity. As
greater numbers of individuals continue to save for, and transition into, retirement, the Trustees and FMR expect an increased demand for innovative products.

Second, as the securities marketplace has evolved in recent years, increasingly complex investment strategies are available to Fidelity's mutual funds. For
example, the fixed income marketplace has significantly expanded with new types of securities including different types of futures, options, and swaps, and
that trend is likely to continue.

Finally, given prevailing demographic and business trends, the Trustees and FMR expect that Fidelity's mutual fund business will continue to expand in the
future. In recent years, Fidelity has made efforts to position the firm as the most trusted provider of lifetime investment solutions in the U.S. At the same time,
the amount of assets held by Americans over age sixty is projected to increase dramatically between now and 2012 as the Baby Boomer generation nears and
enters retirement. The Trustees and FMR believe this provides a significant growth opportunity for Fidelity's business and for the mutual fund industry as a
whole. Increased interest in principal preservation and income distribution is expected to drive asset growth in Fidelity's fixed income funds and asset
allocation products, in particular.

The two-Board structure will be implemented at the same time for all Fidelity funds. On August 1, 2008, or, if later, immediately after the last election is held
for any Fidelity fund scheduled to elect Trustees in connection with implementing a two-Board structure, the following will occur: Current Trustees will remain
on the Boards to which they have been elected or appointed and resign from the Boards on which they will no longer serve. Former Advisory Board members
that have been elected or appointed as Trustees will join the Boards on which they will serve going forward. The size of the Board that will oversee the equity
and high income funds will be fixed at 10 Trustees, and the size of the Board that will oversee the fixed income and asset allocation funds will be fixed at 8
Trustees. The Trustees fully expect that the environment of strong governance of the funds and protection of the interests of fund shareholders will continue
under the new structure.

Except for James C. Curvey and Arthur E. Johnson, all nominees for the fixed income and asset allocation Board are currently Trustees of the trusts and
have served in that capacity continuously since originally elected or appointed. James C. Curvey is currently a Trustee of Fidelity Advisor Series II, Fidelity
Colchester Street Trust, and Fidelity Money Market Trust, and a Member of the Advisory Board of Fidelity Court Street Trust and Fidelity Court Street Trust II.
James C. Curvey was selected by the trusts' Governance and Nominating Committee (see page 23) and was appointed to the Board (or, in the case of Fidelity
Court Street Trust and Fidelity Court Street Trust II, the Advisory Board) on May 17, 2007. Arthur E. Johnson is currently a Member of the Advisory Board of the
trusts. Arthur E. Johnson was selected by the trusts' Governance and Nominating Committee and was appointed as a Member of the Advisory Board effective
January 1, 2008. A third-party search firm retained by the Independent Trustees recommended Arthur E. Johnson. An executive officer of FMR recommended
Mr. Curvey as a nominee.

Except for James C. Curvey, each of the nominees that currently is Trustee of the trusts oversees [366] funds advised by FMR or an affiliate. Mr. Curvey
oversees [340] funds advised by FMR or an affiliate.

In the election of Trustees, those nominees receiving the highest number of votes cast at the Meeting, provided a quorum is present, shall be elected.

Nominees you are being asked to elect as Trustees of the fixed income and asset allocation Board are as follows:

*  Except as otherwise indicated, each individual has held the office shown or other offices in the same company for the last five years.

As of December 31, 2007, the Trustees and nominees for election as Trustees and the officers of each fund owned, in the aggregate, less than 1% of each
fund's outstanding shares.

[proxy transaction disclosure- insert prior to print]

If elected, the Trustees will hold office without limit in time except that (a) any Trustee may resign; (b) any Trustee may be removed by written instrument,
signed by at least two-thirds of the number of Trustees prior to such removal; (c) any Trustee who requests to be retired or who has become incapacitated by
illness or injury may be retired by written instrument signed by a majority of the other Trustees; and (d) a Trustee may be removed at any special meeting of
shareholders by a two-thirds vote of the outstanding voting securities of the trust. Each Independent Trustee shall retire not later than the last day of the
calendar year in which his or her 72nd birthday occurs. The Independent Trustees may waive this mandatory retirement age policy with respect to individual
Trustees. In case a vacancy shall for any reason exist, the remaining Trustees will fill such vacancy by appointing another Trustee, so long as, immediately after
such appointment, at least two-thirds of the Trustees have been elected by shareholders. If, at any time, less than a majority of the Trustees holding office has
been elected by the shareholders, the Trustees then in office will promptly call a shareholders' meeting for the purpose of electing a Board of Trustees.
Otherwise, there will normally be no meeting of shareholders for the purpose of electing Trustees. Advisory Board Members hold office without limit in time
except that any Advisory Board Member may resign or may be removed by a vote of a majority of the Trustees at any regular meeting or any special meeting of
the Trustees.

Each trust's Board, which is currently composed of 2 Interested Trustees and 9 Independent Trustees, met 11 times (10 times for any fund with a fiscal year
ended December 31, 2007) during each fund's most recent fiscal year (see Appendix A for a list of the funds' fiscal year ends). Following the implementation of
the two-Board structure for all Fidelity funds, it is expected that the Trustees of the fixed income and asset allocation Board will initially include 2 interested and
6 Independent Trustees, and will meet at least 6 times a year at regularly scheduled meetings. For information on the current and proposed standing
committees of the funds' Trustees, refer to the section entitled "Standing Committees of the Funds' Trustees" beginning on page 17.

STANDING COMMITTEES OF THE FUNDS' TRUSTEES

Correspondence intended for each Independent Trustee may be sent to the attention of the individual Trustee or to the Board of Trustees at Fidelity
Investments, P.O. Box 55235, Boston, Massachusetts 02205-5235. Correspondence intended for each Interested Trustee may be sent to the attention of the
individual Trustee or to the Board of Trustees at Fidelity Investments, 82 Devonshire Street, Boston, Massachusetts, 02109. The current process for collecting
and organizing shareholder communications requires that the Board of Trustees receive copies of all communications addressed to it. All communications
addressed to the Board of Trustees or any individual Trustee are logged and sent to the Board or individual Trustee. The funds do not hold annual meetings and
therefore do not have a policy with regard to Trustees' attendance at such meetings. However, as a matter of practice, at least one Trustee attends special
meetings.

The Board of Trustees has established various committees to support the Independent Trustees in acting independently in pursuing the best interests of the
Fidelity funds and their shareholders. The committees facilitate the timely and efficient consideration of all matters of importance to Independent Trustees, each
fund, and fund shareholders and facilitate compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. Currently, the Board of Trustees has 12 standing committees.
The members of each committee are Independent Trustees. See Appendix H for the number of meetings each standing committee held during each fund's last
fiscal year. In connection with implementing a two-Board structure, it is expected that the fixed income and asset allocation Board will have an Operations
Committee, an Audit Committee, and a Governance and Nominating Committee.

The Operations Committee is composed of all of the Independent Trustees, with Mr. Lautenbach currently serving as Chair. The committee normally meets
monthly (except August), or more frequently as called by the Chair, and serves as a forum for consideration of issues of importance to, or calling for particular
determinations by, the Independent Trustees. The committee also considers matters involving potential conflicts of interest between the funds and FMR and its
affiliates and reviews proposed contracts and the proposed continuation of contracts between the Fidelity funds and FMR and its affiliates, and annually
reviews and makes recommendations regarding contracts with third parties unaffiliated with FMR, including insurance coverage and custody agreements. The
committee also monitors additional issues including the nature, levels and quality of services provided to shareholders, significant litigation, and the voting of
proxies of portfolio companies. The committee also has oversight of compliance issues not specifically within the scope of any other committee. The
committee is also responsible for definitive action on all compliance matters involving the potential for significant reimbursement by FMR.

The Fair Value Oversight Committee is composed of all of the Independent Trustees, with Mr. Lautenbach currently serving as Chair. The committee
normally meets quarterly, or more frequently as called by the Chair. The Fair Value Oversight Committee monitors and establishes policies concerning
procedures and controls regarding the valuation of fund investments and monitors matters of disclosure to the extent required to fulfill its statutory
responsibilities. The committee also reviews actions taken by FMR's Fair Value Committee.

The Board of Trustees has established three Fund Oversight Committees: the Equity I Committee (composed of Ms. Small (Chair) and Mr. Dirks), the Equity
II Committee (composed of Messrs. Stavropoulos (Chair) and Lautenbach), and the Fixed-Income and Asset Allocation Committee (composed Messrs. Wolfe
(Chair), Gamper, and Keyes, Dr. Heilmeier and Ms. Knowles). Each committee normally meets in conjunction with in-person meetings of the Board of Trustees,
or more frequently as called by the Chair of the respective committee. Each committee develops an understanding of and reviews the investment objectives,
policies, and practices of each fund under its oversight. Each committee also monitors investment performance, compliance by each relevant Fidelity fund with
its investment policies and restrictions and reviews appropriate benchmarks, competitive universes, unusual or exceptional investment matters, the personnel
and other resources devoted to the management of each fund and all other matters bearing on each fund's investment results. The Fixed-Income and Asset
Allocation Committee also receives reports required under Rule 2a-7 of the 1940 Act and has oversight of research bearing on credit quality, investment
structures and other fixed-income issues. The Equity I Committee has oversight of FMR's equity investment research. Each committee will review and
recommend any required action to the Board in respect of specific funds, including new funds, changes in fundamental and non-fundamental investment
policies and restrictions, partial or full closing to new investors, fund mergers, fund name changes, and liquidations of funds. The members of each committee
may organize working groups to make recommendations concerning issues related to funds that are within the scope of the committee's review. These working
groups report to the committee or to the Independent Trustees, or both, as appropriate. Each working group may request from FMR such information from
FMR as may be appropriate to the working group's deliberations. Prior to November 2007, the three Fund Oversight Committees were the Equity Committee;
the Fixed-Income, International, and Special Committee; and the Select and Asset Allocation Committee.

The Board of Trustees has established two Fund Contract Committees: the Equity Contract Committee (composed of Messrs. Stavropoulos (Chair), Dirks,
Lautenbach, and Ms. Small) and the Fixed-Income Contract Committee (composed of Messrs. Wolfe (Chair), Gamper, and Keyes, Dr. Heilmeyer, and Ms.
Knowles). Each committee will ordinarily meet as needed to consider matters related to the renewal of fund investment advisory agreements. The committees
will assist the Independent Trustees in their consideration of investment advisory agreements of each fund. Each committee receives information on and makes
recommendations concerning the approval of investment advisory agreements between the Fidelity funds and FMR and its affiliates and any non-FMR affiliate
that serves as a sub-adviser to a Fidelity fund (collectively, "investment advisers") and the annual review of these contracts. The Fixed-Income Contract
Committee is responsible for investment advisory agreements of the fixed-income funds. The Equity Contract Committee is responsible for the investment
advisory agreements of all other funds. With respect to each fund under its purview, each committee: requests and receives information on the nature, extent,
and quality of services provided to the shareholders of the Fidelity funds by the investment advisers and their respective affiliates, fund performance, the
investment performance of the investment adviser, and such other information as the committee determines to be reasonably necessary to evaluate the terms
of the investment advisory agreements; considers the cost of the services to be provided and the profitability and other benefits that the investment advisers
and their respective affiliates derive or will derive from their contractual arrangements with each of the funds (including tangible and intangible "fall-out
benefits"); considers the extent to which economies of scale would be realized as the funds grow and whether fee levels reflect those economies of scale for the
benefit of fund investors; considers methodologies for determining the extent to which the funds benefit from economies of scale and refinements to these
methodologies; considers information comparing the services to be rendered and the amount to be paid under the funds' contracts with those under other
investment advisory contracts entered into with FMR and its affiliates and other investment advisers, such as contracts with other registered investment
companies or other types of clients; considers such other matters and information as may be necessary and appropriate to evaluate investment advisory
agreements of the funds; and makes recommendations to the Board concerning the approval or renewal of investment advisory agreements. Each committee
will consult with the other committees of the Board of Trustees, and in particular with the Audit Committee and the applicable Fund Oversight Committees, in
carrying out its responsibilities. Each committee's responsibilities are guided by Sections 15(c) and 36(b) of the 1940 Act. While each committee consists
solely of Independent Trustees, its meetings may, depending upon the subject matter, be attended by one or more senior members of FMR's management or
representatives of a sub-adviser not affiliated with FMR.

The Shareholder, Distribution and Brokerage Committee is composed of Messrs. Dirks (Chair), Gamper, and Stavropoulos, and Ms. Small. The committee
normally meets monthly (except August), or more frequently as called by the Chair. Regarding shareholder services, the committee considers the structure and
amount of the Fidelity funds' transfer agency fees and fees, including direct fees to investors (other than sales loads), such as bookkeeping and custodial fees,
and the nature and quality of services rendered by FMR and its affiliates or third parties (such as custodians) in consideration of these fees. The committee also
considers other non-investment management services rendered to the Fidelity funds by FMR and its affiliates, including pricing and bookkeeping services.
Regarding brokerage, the committee monitors and recommends policies concerning the securities transactions of the Fidelity funds. The committee
periodically reviews the policies and practices with respect to efforts to achieve best execution, commissions paid to firms supplying research and brokerage
services or paying fund expenses, and policies and procedures designed to assure that any allocation of portfolio transactions is not influenced by the sale of
Fidelity fund shares. The committee also monitors brokerage and other similar relationships between the Fidelity funds and firms affiliated with FMR that
participate in the execution of securities transactions. Regarding the distribution of fund shares, the committee considers issues bearing on the various
distribution channels employed by the Fidelity funds, including issues regarding Rule 18f-3 plans and related consideration of classes of shares, sales load
structures (including breakpoints), load waivers, selling concessions, and service charges paid to intermediaries, Rule 12b-1 plans, contingent deferred sales
charges, and finders' fees, and other means by which intermediaries are compensated for selling fund shares or providing shareholder servicing, including
revenue sharing. The committee also considers issues bearing on the preparation and use of advertisements and sales literature for the Fidelity funds, policies
and procedures regarding frequent purchase of Fidelity fund shares, and selective disclosure of portfolio holdings.

The Audit Committee is composed of Ms. Knowles (Chair), Dr. Heilmeier, and Messrs. Keyes and Wolfe. All committee members must be able to read and
understand fundamental financial statements, including a company's balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement. At least one committee
member will be an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The committee will have at least one
committee member in common with the Compliance Committee. The committee normally meets monthly (except August), or more frequently as called by the
Chair. The committee meets separately at least four times a year with the Fidelity funds' Treasurer, with personnel responsible for the internal audit function of
FMR LLC, and with the Fidelity funds' outside auditors. The committee has direct responsibility for the appointment, compensation, and oversight of the work
of the outside auditors employed by the Fidelity funds. The committee assists the Trustees in overseeing and monitoring: (i) the systems of internal accounting
and financial controls of the Fidelity funds and the funds' service providers, (ii) the financial reporting processes of the Fidelity funds, (iii) the independence,
objectivity, and qualification of the auditors to the Fidelity funds, (iv) the annual audits of the Fidelity funds' financial statements, and (v) the accounting policies
and disclosures of the Fidelity funds. The committee considers and acts upon (i) the provision by any outside auditor of any non-audit services for any Fidelity
fund, and (ii) the provision by any outside auditor of certain non-audit services to Fidelity fund service providers and their affiliates to the extent that such
approval (in the case of this clause (ii)) is required under applicable regulations of the SEC. In furtherance of the foregoing, the committee has adopted (and may
from time to time amend or supplement) and provides oversight of policies and procedures for non-audit engagements by outside auditors of the Fidelity funds. It
is responsible for approving all audit engagement fees and terms for the Fidelity funds, resolving disagreements between a fund and any outside auditor regarding
any fund's financial reporting, and has sole authority to hire and fire any auditor. Auditors of the funds report directly to the committee. The committee will obtain
assurance of independence and objectivity from the outside auditors, including a formal written statement delineating all relationships between the auditor and the
Fidelity funds and any service providers consistent with Independent Standards Board Standard No. 1. The committee will receive reports of compliance with
provisions of the Auditor Independence Regulations relating to the hiring of employees or former employees of the outside auditors. It oversees and receives
reports on the Fidelity funds' service providers' internal controls and reviews the adequacy and effectiveness of the service providers' accounting and financial
controls, including: (i) any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are
reasonably likely to adversely affect the Fidelity funds' ability to record, process, summarize, and report financial data; (ii) any change in the fund's internal
control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the fund's internal control over financial reporting; and
(iii) any fraud, whether material or not, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the Fidelity funds' or service providers'
internal controls over financial reporting. The committee will review with counsel any legal matters that may have a material impact on the Fidelity funds'
financial statements and any material reports or inquiries received from regulators or governmental agencies. These matters may also be reviewed by the
Compliance Committee or the Operations Committee. The Chair of the Audit Committee will coordinate with the Chair of the Compliance Committee, as
appropriate. The committee reviews at least annually a report from each outside auditor describing any material issues raised by the most recent internal
quality control, peer review, or Public Company Accounting Oversight Board examination of the auditing firm and any material issues raised by any inquiry or
investigation by governmental or professional authorities of the auditing firm and in each case any steps taken to deal with such issues. The committee will
oversee and receive reports on the Fidelity funds' financial reporting process, will discuss with FMR, the Fidelity funds' Treasurer, outside auditors and, if
appropriate, internal audit personnel of FMR LLC their qualitative judgments about the appropriateness and acceptability of accounting principles and financial
disclosure practices used or proposed for adoption by the Fidelity funds, and will review with FMR, the Fidelity funds' Treasurer, outside auditor, and internal
auditor personnel of FMR LLC (to the extent relevant) the results of audits of the Fidelity funds' financial statements. The committee will review periodically the
Fidelity funds' major internal controls exposures and the steps that have been taken to monitor and control such exposures.

The Governance and Nominating Committee is composed of Messrs. Lautenbach (Chair), Stavropoulos, and Wolfe. The committee meets as called by the
Chair. A current copy of the Governance and Nominating Committee Charter With Respect to Nominations of Independent Trustees is available on Fidelity's
website (www.fidelity.com) and is attached as Exhibit 1 to this proxy. With respect to fund governance and board administration matters, the committee
periodically reviews procedures of the Board of Trustees and its committees (including committee charters) and periodically reviews compensation of
Independent Trustees. The committee monitors corporate governance matters and makes recommendations to the Board of Trustees on the frequency and
structure of the Board of Trustee meetings and on any other aspect of Board procedures. It acts as the administrative committee under the retirement plan for
Independent Trustees who retired prior to December 30, 1996 and under the fee deferral plan for Independent Trustees. It reviews the performance of legal
counsel employed by the Fidelity funds and the Independent Trustees. On behalf of the Independent Trustees, the committee will make such findings and
determinations as to the independence of counsel for the Independent Trustees as may be necessary or appropriate under applicable regulations or otherwise.
The committee is also responsible for Board administrative matters applicable to Independent Trustees, such as expense reimbursement policies and
compensation for attendance at meetings, conferences and other events. The committee monitors compliance with, acts as the administrator of, and makes
determinations in respect of, the provisions of the code of ethics and any supplemental policies regarding personal securities transactions applicable to the
Independent Trustees. The committee monitors the functioning of each Board committee and makes recommendations for any changes, including the creation
or elimination of standing or ad hoc Board committees. The committee monitors regulatory and other developments to determine whether to recommend
modifications to the committee's responsibilities or other Trustee policies and procedures in light of rule changes, reports concerning "best practices" in
corporate governance and other developments in mutual fund governance. The committee meets with Independent Trustees at least once a year to discuss
matters relating to fund governance. The committee recommends that the Board establish such special or ad hoc Board committees as may be desirable or
necessary from time to time in order to address ethical, legal, or other matters that may arise. The committee also oversees the annual self-evaluation of the
Board of Trustees and establishes procedures to allow it to exercise this oversight function. In conducting this oversight, the committee shall address all
matters that it considers relevant to the performance of the Board of Trustees and shall report the results of its evaluation to the Board of Trustees, including
any recommended amendments to the principles of governance, and any recommended changes to the Fidelity funds' or the Board of Trustees' policies,
procedures, and structures. The committee reviews periodically the size and composition of the Board of Trustees as a whole and recommends, if necessary,
measures to be taken so that the Board of Trustees reflects the appropriate balance of knowledge, experience, skills, expertise, and diversity required for the
Board as a whole and contains at least the minimum number of Independent Trustees required by law. The committee makes nominations for the election or
appointment of Independent Trustees and non-management Members of any Advisory Board, and for membership on committees. The committee shall have
authority to retain and terminate any third-party advisers, including authority to approve fees and other retention terms. Such advisers may include search
firms to identify Independent Trustee candidates and board compensation consultants. The committee recently retained a third-party search firm, which
received a fee to compile a list of candidates based upon criteria established by the Independent Trustees. The committee may conduct or authorize
investigations into or studies of matters within the committee's scope of responsibilities, and may retain, at the Fidelity funds' expense, such independent
counsel or other advisers as it deems necessary. The committee will consider nominees to the Board of Trustees recommended by shareholders based upon
the criteria applied to candidates presented to the committee by a search firm or other source. Recommendations, along with appropriate background material
concerning the candidate that demonstrates his or her ability to serve as an Independent Trustee of the Fidelity funds, should be submitted to the Chair of the
committee at the address maintained for communications with Independent Trustees. If the committee retains a search firm, the Chair will generally forward all
such submissions to the search firm for evaluation. With respect to the criteria for selecting Independent Trustees, it is expected that all candidates will possess
the following minimum qualifications: (i) unquestioned personal integrity; (ii) not an interested person of FMR or its affiliates within the meaning of the 1940
Act; (iii) does not have a material relationship (e.g., commercial, banking, consulting, legal, or accounting) that could create an appearance of lack of
independence in respect of FMR and its affiliates; (iv) has the disposition to act independently in respect of FMR and its affiliates and others in order to protect
the interests of the funds and all shareholders; (v) ability to attend 11 meetings per year; (vi) demonstrates sound business judgment gained through broad
experience in significant positions where the candidate has dealt with management, technical, financial, or regulatory issues; (vii) sufficient financial or
accounting knowledge to add value in the complex financial environment of the Fidelity funds; (viii) experience on corporate or other institutional oversight
bodies having similar responsibilities, but which board memberships or other relationships could not result in business or regulatory conflicts with the funds;
and (ix) capacity for the hard work and attention to detail that is required to be an effective Independent Trustee in light of the Fidelity funds' complex regulatory,
operational, and marketing setting. The Governance and Nominating Committee may determine that a candidate who does not have the type of previous
experience or knowledge referred to above should nevertheless be considered as a nominee if the Governance and Nominating Committee finds that the
candidate has additional qualifications such that his or her qualifications, taken as a whole, demonstrate the same level of fitness to serve as an Independent
Trustee.

The Board of Trustees established the Compliance Committee (composed of Ms. Small (Chair), Ms. Knowles, and Messrs. Stavropoulos and Wolfe) in May
2005. The committee normally meets quarterly, or more frequently as called by the Chair. The committee oversees the administration and operation of the
compliance policies and procedures of the Fidelity funds and their service providers as required by Rule 38a-1 of the 1940 Act. The committee is responsible
for the review and approval of policies and procedures relating to (i) provisions of the Code of Ethics, (ii) anti-money laundering requirements, (iii) compliance
with investment restrictions and limitations, (iv) privacy, (v) recordkeeping, and (vi) other compliance policies and procedures which are not otherwise
delegated to another committee. The committee has responsibility for recommending to the Board the designation of a Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) of the
Fidelity funds. The committee serves as the primary point of contact between the CCO and the Board, it oversees the annual performance review and
compensation of the CCO, and if required, makes recommendations to the Board with respect to the removal of the appointed CCO. The committee receives
reports of significant correspondence with regulators or governmental agencies, employee complaints or published reports which raise concerns regarding
compliance matters, and copies of significant non-routine correspondence with the SEC. The committee receives reports from the CCO including the annual
report concerning the funds' compliance policies as required by Rule 38a-1, quarterly reports in respect of any breaches of fiduciary duty or violations of
federal securities laws, and reports on any other compliance or related matters that may have a significant impact on the funds. The committee will recommend
to the Board, what actions, if any, should be taken with respect to such reports.

The Proxy Voting Committee is composed of Messrs. Gamper (Chair), Dirks, and Keyes. The committee will meet as needed to review the fund's proxy
voting policies, consider changes to the policies, and review the manner in which the policies have been applied. The committee will receive reports on the
manner in which proxy votes have been cast under the proxy voting policies and reports on consultations between the fund's investment advisers and portfolio
companies concerning matters presented to shareholders for approval. The committee will address issues relating to the fund's annual voting report filed with
the SEC. The committee will receive reports concerning the implementation of procedures and controls designed to ensure that the proxy voting policies are
implemented in accordance with their terms. The committee will consider FMR's recommendations concerning certain non-routine proposals not covered by
the proxy voting policies. The committee will receive reports with respect to steps taken by FMR to assure that proxy voting has been done without regard to any
other FMR relationships, business or otherwise, with that portfolio company. The committee will make recommendations to the Board concerning the casting of
proxy votes in circumstances where FMR has determined that, because of a conflict of interest, the proposal to be voted on should be reviewed by the Board.

INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMS 

The firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) or Deloitte & Touche LLP, the member firms of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, and their respective affiliates
(collectively, "Deloitte Entities"), has been selected as the independent registered public accounting firm for the funds, as indicated in Appendix A. PwC and
Deloitte Entities, in accordance with Independence Standards Board Standard No. 1 (ISB No.1), have confirmed to the Audit Committee of each trust, as
applicable, that they are the independent registered public accounting firms with respect to the funds.

The independent registered public accounting firm examines annual financial statements for the funds and provides other audit-related, non-audit, and
tax-related services to the funds. Representatives of PwC and Deloitte Entities are not expected to be present at the Meeting, but have been given the
opportunity to make a statement if they so desire and will be available should any matter arise requiring their presence.

Each trust's Audit Committee must pre-approve all audit and non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accounting firms relating to
the operations or financial reporting of the funds. Prior to the commencement of any audit or non-audit services to a fund, the Audit Committee reviews the
services to determine whether they are appropriate and permissible under applicable law.

Each trust's Audit Committee has adopted policies and procedures to, among other purposes, provide a framework for the Audit Committee's consideration
of non-audit services by the audit firms that audit the Fidelity funds. The policies and procedures require that any non-audit service provided by a fund audit
firm to a Fidelity fund and any non-audit service provided by a fund auditor to FMR and entities controlling, controlled by, or under common control with FMR
(not including any sub-adviser whose role is primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by another investment adviser) that
provide ongoing services to the funds ("Fund Service Providers") that relates directly to the operations and financial reporting of a Fidelity fund (Covered
Service) are subject to approval by the Audit Committee before such service is provided. Non-audit services provided by a fund audit firm for a Fund Service
Provider that do not relate directly to the operations and financial reporting of a Fidelity fund (Non-Covered Service) but that are expected to exceed $50,000
are also subject to pre-approval by the Audit Committee.

All Covered Services, as well as Non-Covered Services that are expected to exceed $50,000, must be approved in advance of provision of the service either: (i) by
formal resolution of the Audit Committee, or (ii) by oral or written approval of the service by the Chair of the Audit Committee (or if the Chair is unavailable, such other
member of the Audit Committee as may be designated by the Chair to act in the Chair's absence). The approval contemplated by (ii) above is permitted where the
Treasurer determines that action on such an engagement is necessary before the next meeting of the Audit Committee. Neither pre-approval nor advance notice of
Non-Covered Service engagements for which fees are not expected to exceed $50,000 is required; such engagements are to be reported to the Audit Committee
monthly.

Each trust's Audit Committee has considered Non-Covered Services that were not pre-approved that were provided by PwC and Deloitte Entities to Fund
Service Providers to be compatible with maintaining the independence of PwC and Deloitte Entities in their audit of the funds, taking into account
representations from PwC and Deloitte Entities, in accordance with ISB No.1, regarding their independence from the funds and their related entities.

Audit Fees. For each fund's last two fiscal years, the aggregate Audit Fees billed by PwC or Deloitte Entities for professional services rendered for the audits
of the financial statements, or services that are normally provided in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for those fiscal years, for
each fund and for all funds in the Fidelity Group of Funds are shown in Appendix I.

Audit-Related Fees. In each fund's last two fiscal years, the aggregate Audit-Related Fees billed by PwC or Deloitte Entities for services rendered for
assurance and related services to each fund that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the fund's financial statements, but not
reported as Audit Fees, are shown in Appendix J.

In each fund's last two fiscal years, the aggregate Audit-Related Fees that were billed by PwC and Deloitte Entities that were required to be approved by the Audit
Committee for services rendered on behalf of the Fund Service Providers for assurance and related services that relate directly to the operations and financial
reporting of each fund that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the fund's financial statements, but not reported as Audit Fees, are
shown in Appendix K.

Fees included in the audit-related category comprise assurance and related services (e.g., due diligence services) that are traditionally performed by the
independent registered public accounting firm. These audit-related services include due diligence related to mergers and acquisitions, accounting
consultations and audits in connection with acquisitions, internal control reviews, attest services that are not required by statute or regulation and consultation
concerning financial accounting and reporting standards.

There were no amounts that were approved by a trust's Audit Committee pursuant to the de minimis exception for the last two fiscal years on behalf of any
fund. There were no amounts that were required to be approved by a trust's Audit Committee pursuant to the de minimis exception for the last two fiscal years
on behalf of the Fund Service Providers that relate directly to the operations and financial reporting of any fund.

Tax Fees. In each fund's last two fiscal years, the aggregate Tax Fees billed by PwC or Deloitte Entities for professional services rendered for tax
compliance, tax advice, and tax planning for each fund is shown in Appendix L.

 In each fund's last two fiscal years, the aggregate Tax Fees billed by PwC or Deloitte Entities that were required to be approved by the Audit Committee for
professional services rendered on behalf of the Fund Service Providers for tax compliance, tax advice, and tax planning that relate directly to the operations and
financial reporting of each fund is shown in Appendix M.

Fees included in the Tax Fees category comprise all services performed by professional staff in the independent registered public accounting firm's tax
division except those services related to the audit. Typically, this category would include fees for tax compliance, tax planning, and tax advice. Tax compliance,
tax advice, and tax planning services include preparation of original and amended tax returns, claims for refund and tax payment-planning services, assistance
with tax audits and appeals, tax advice related to mergers and acquisitions and requests for rulings or technical advice from taxing authorities.

There were no amounts that were approved by a trust's Audit Committee pursuant to the de minimis exception for the last two fiscal years on behalf of any
fund.

There were no amounts that were required to be approved by a trust's Audit Committee pursuant to the de minimis exception for the last two fiscal years on
behalf of the Fund Service Providers that relate directly to the operations and financial reporting of any fund.

rendered to the funds is shown in Appendix N.

In each of the funds' last two fiscal years, the aggregate Other Fees billed by PwC or Deloitte Entities that were required to be approved by a trust's Audit
Committee for all other non-audit services rendered on behalf of the Fund Service Providers that relate directly to the operations and financial reporting of each fund is
shown in Appendix O.

Fees included in the All Other Fees category include services related to internal control reviews, strategy and other consulting, financial information
systems design and implementation, consulting on other information systems, and other tax services unrelated to the fund. There were no amounts that were
approved by a trust's Audit Committee pursuant to the de minimis exception for the last two fiscal years on behalf of any fund.

There were no amounts that were required to be approved by a trust's Audit Committee pursuant to the de minimis exception for the last two fiscal years on
behalf of the Fund Service Providers that relate directly to the operations and financial reporting of any fund.

For each fund's last two fiscal years, the aggregate fees billed by PwC and Deloitte Entities, for non-audit services rendered on behalf of the funds, FMR (not
including any sub-adviser whose role is primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by another investment adviser) and Fund
Service Providers relating to Covered Services and Non-Covered Services are shown in Appendix P.

SUBMISSION OF CERTAIN SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS

The trusts do not hold annual shareholder meetings. Shareholders wishing to submit proposals for inclusion in a proxy statement for a subsequent
shareholder meeting should send their written proposals to the Secretary of the Trusts, 82 Devonshire Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02109. Proposals must
be received a reasonable time prior to the date of a meeting of shareholders to be considered for inclusion in the proxy materials for the meeting. Timely
submission of a proposal does not, however, necessarily mean the proposal will be included. Persons named as proxies for any subsequent shareholder
meeting will vote in their discretion with respect to proposals submitted on an untimely basis.

NOTICE TO BANKS, BROKER-DEALERS AND
VOTING TRUSTEES AND THEIR NOMINEES

Please advise the trusts, in care of Fidelity Service Company, Inc., P.O. Box 789, Boston, MA 02109, (for retail shareholders), or Fidelity Investments
Institutional Operations Company Inc., 100 Salem St., Smithfield, RI, 02197 (for institutional and Advisor class shareholders), whether other persons are
beneficial owners of shares for which proxies are being solicited and, if so, the number of copies of the Proxy Statement and Annual Reports you wish to
receive in order to supply copies to the beneficial owners of the respective shares.

EXHIBIT 1

GOVERNANCE AND NOMINATING COMMITTEE CHARTER 
WITH RESPECT TO NOMINATIONS OF INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES

This charter relates to the responsibilities of the Governance and Nominating Committee in connection with the nomination of Independent Trustees.

The Governance and Nominating Committee will consist solely of Independent Trustees. The Chair of the Independent Trustees will be the Chair of the
Committee. If a Vice Chair of the Independent Trustees has been designated, such Vice Chair will normally serve on the Committee. The Committee will meet as
called by the Chair. A quorum will include at least two Independent Trustees.

The Committee will make nominations for the appointment or election of Independent Trustees in accordance with the Independent Trustee's Statement of
Policy on Criteria for Selecting Independent Trustees ("Statement of Policy") (attached as Appendix A). The selection of Independent Trustees will be
committed solely to the discretion of the Independent Trustees; persons so selected will be "disinterested" in terms of both the letter and spirit of the
Investment Company Act. The Committee will also make nominations for the appointment of any non-management member of any Advisory Board.

The Committee will periodically review the Statement of Policy, which may from time to time be revised by vote of a majority of Independent Trustees upon the
recommendation of the Governance and Nominating Committee.

The Committee will have sole authority to retain and terminate any search firm used to identify Independent Trustee candidates, including sole authority to
approve such firm's fees and other retention terms.

The Committee will consider Independent Trustee candidates recommended by Fund shareholders. Any such candidates will be considered based upon the
criteria applied to candidates presented to the Committee by a search firm or other sources, as set forth in the Statement of Policy. The names of such
candidates should be submitted to the Chairman of the Committee in writing at the address maintained for communications with Independent Trustees. The
submission should be accompanied by appropriate background material concerning the candidate that demonstrates his or her ability to serve as an
Independent Trustee of the Fidelity Funds. If the Committee retains a search firm, the Chairman will forward all such submissions to the search firm for
evaluation.

APPENDIX A TO EXHIBIT 1

December 2003

STATEMENT OF POLICY ON CRITERIA
FOR SELECTING INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES

The Governance and Nominating Committee of the Board of Trustees of the Fidelity Funds has adopted this Statement of Policy to memorialize its views as
to the appropriate criteria for selecting Independent Trustees of the Funds. This Statement has been prepared in connection with filling vacancies among the
Independent Trustees that are expected to arise through the end of 2004.

The Governance and Nominating Committee expects that all candidates will have the following characteristics:


Unquestioned personal integrity is a given.
The candidate may not be an "interested person" of FMR or its affiliates within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940.
The candidate should have no material relationship that could create an appearance of lack of independence in respect of FMR and its affiliates. Material
relationships can include commercial, industrial, banking, consulting, legal, accounting, charitable and familial relationships (among others).
The candidate needs the disposition to act independently in fact in respect of FMR and its affiliates and others in order to protect the interests of the Funds
and all shareholders. It is expected that Independent Trustees will play an active and, if necessary, an adversarial role in pursuing the best interests of the
Funds and shareholders.
The candidate needs to be able to attend 11 meetings per year. The effect of this requirement is to limit the number of other boards on which a candidate
can participate and other commitments.
The candidate needs to have demonstrated sound business judgment gained through broad experience in significant positions where the candidate has
dealt with management, technical, financial or regulatory issues.
The candidate should have sufficient financial or accounting knowledge to add value in the complex financial environment of the Fidelity Funds.
Candidates should have experience on corporate or other institutional oversight bodies having similar responsibilities. This helps assure that they have
other exposure to current governance issues and business practices. Candidates should not, however, have board memberships or other relationships that
could result in business or regulatory conflicts with the Fidelity Mutual Funds.
The candidate needs the capacity for the hard work and attention to detail that is required to be an effective Independent Trustee in light of the Fidelity
Funds' complex regulatory, operational and marketing setting.

The Governance and Nominating Committee may determine that a candidate who does not have the type of previous experience or knowledge referred to
above should nevertheless be considered as a nominee if the Governance and Nominating Committee finds that the candidate has additional qualifications such
that his or her qualifications, taken as a whole, demonstrate the same level of fitness to serve as an Independent Trustee.

The following characteristics are desirable, but not mandatory:


The candidate should have the ability to serve seven or more years before reaching mandatory retirement age.
The candidate should have diversity of interests evidenced by participation in community, charitable or other similar activities.

The following are desirable characteristics of the Independent Trustees as a group:


The Independent Trustees will generally be drawn from the ranks of respected and accomplished senior business leaders.
The Independent Trustees will strive to achieve diversity in terms of gender, race and geographic location.
The Independent Trustees as a whole should reflect a diversity of business experience. At least one Independent Trustee will be a "audit committee financial
expert," as such term is defined by the SEC. The Governance and Nominating Committee will strive to achieve a balance of experience of Independent
Trustees in respect of industries, management roles and other experience. For each candidate, the Committee will evaluate specific experience in light of
the makeup of the current board.

        November 6, 2012.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained via the Commission's Web site by searching for the file number, or an applicant using the Company name box, at http://www.sec.gov/search/search.htm or by calling (202) 551-8090.
Applicants' Representations
1. Each Trust is formed as a business trust or limited liability company under the laws of Massachusetts or Delaware, as applicable. Each Trust is registered under the Act as an open-end management investment company.[2] 
           FMR Co., SAI or another FMR entity serves as investment adviser or sub-adviser to each of the Funds. FMR Co. and SAI are investment advisers registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”). Any investment adviser to the Funds will be registered under the Advisers Act.
2. The Prior Order permits the Funds to participate in a credit facility administered by FMR (the “IFL Program”). The IFL Program enables the Funds to lend money to each other for temporary purposes, such as when redemptions exceed anticipated levels. The IFL Program is designed both to reduce the cost of borrowing for the Funds and enhance the lending Funds' ability to earn higher rates of interest of investment on their short-term balances. The Prior Order requires that the interest rate for loans made through the IFL Program (the “IFL Rate”) be based on the average of: (a) the higher of the overnight time deposit rate (the “OTD Rate”) and the Funds' current overnight repurchase agreement rate (the “FICASH Rate”); [3] 
           and (b) a benchmark rate representing the lowest bank loan rate available for borrowing by the Funds (“Benchmark Rate”). The board of trustees (each, a “Fund Board” and collectively, the “Fund Boards”) of each Fund, including a majority of the trustees who are not “interested persons,” as defined in section 2(a)(19) of the Act, (“Independent Trustees”) establishes the Benchmark Rate, and, reviews, no less frequently than annually, the continuing appropriateness of the Benchmark Rate. The Benchmark Rate is currently set each day based on the average actual spread between the lowest quoted bank loan rate and the Federal Funds rate over the previous 60 days.
3. Applicants state that their business purposes and operational preferences over time have made inclusion of the OTD Rate in calculation of the IFL Rate unnecessary. Therefore, applicants seek to amend the Prior Order to eliminate the use of the OTD Rate in the IFL Rate calculation provided in conditions 1 and 2 (“Rate Conditions”). Applicants also request an exemption from section 17(a)(2) of the Act.
Applicants' Legal Analysis
1. Section 17(a)(3) of the Act generally prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or affiliated person of an affiliated person, from borrowing money or other property from the registered investment company. Section 21(b) of the Act generally prohibits any registered management company from lending money or other property to any person, directly or indirectly, if that person controls or is under common control with that company. Section 2(a)(3)(C) of the Act defines an “affiliated person” of another person, in part, to be any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, such other person. Section 2(a)(9) of the Act defines “control” as the “power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company,” but excludes circumstances in which “such power is solely the result of an official position with such company.” Because the Funds share a common investment adviser or have an investment adviser  that is under common control with those of the other Funds, applicants state that each Fund may be deemed to be under common control with all the other Funds, and, therefore, an affiliated person of those Funds.
2. Section 17(a)(1) of the Act generally prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such a person, from selling securities or other property to the investment company. Section 17(a)(2) of the Act generally prohibits an affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such a person, from purchasing securities or other property from the investment company. Section 12(d)(1) of the Act prohibits a registered investment company from purchasing or otherwise acquiring any security issued by any other investment company except in accordance with the limitations set forth in that section.
3. Section 18(f)(1) of the Act prohibits registered open-end investment companies from issuing any senior security except that a company is permitted to borrow from any bank, if immediately after the borrowing, there is asset coverage of at least 300 per centum for all borrowings of the company. Under section 18(g) of the Act, the term “senior security” generally includes any bond, debenture, note or similar obligation or instrument constituting a security and evidencing indebtedness.
4. Section 17(b) of the Act authorizes the Commission to exempt a proposed transaction from section 17(a) provided that the terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are fair and reasonable and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned, and the transaction is consistent with the policy of the investment company as recited in its registration statement and with the general purposes of the Act. Section 6(c) of the Act provides that an exemptive order may be granted where an exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt persons or transactions from any provision of section 12(d)(1) if and to the extent such exception is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors.
5. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act generally prohibit any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of an affiliated person, when acting as principal, from effecting any joint transaction in which the company participates unless the transaction is approved by the Commission. Rule 17d-1(b) provides that in passing upon applications filed under the rule, the Commission will consider whether the participation of a registered investment company in a joint enterprise on the basis proposed is consistent with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the Act and the extent to which the company's participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants.
6. Applicants request an order under (a) section 6(c) of the Act granting an exemption from sections 18(f) and 21(b) of the Act; (b) section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act granting an exemption from section 12(d)(1) of the Act; (c) sections 6(c) and 17(b) of the Act granting an exemption from sections 17(a)(1), 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Act; and (d) section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act to permit certain joint arrangements. The requested order would amend the Rate Conditions in the Prior Order and grant applicants an exemption from section 17(a)(2) of the Act.
7. As noted previously, applicants state that their business purposes and operational preferences over time have made inclusion of the OTD Rate in calculation of the IFL Rate unnecessary. Applicants state further that the IFL Rate, as amended, would make it more likely that lending Funds would receive a market rate of return in excess of other market alternatives and that borrowing Funds would not be harmed because they would only participate in the IFL Program if the IFL Rate is lower than the lowest quoted bank loan rate. Applicants state that the Rate Conditions will prove to be a more efficient means for achieving savings to the Funds in connection with their routine daily cash management activities and for providing Funds with alternative sources of liquidity in times of substantial net redemption activity.
8. Applicants also state that the IFL Program, as modified by the Rate Conditions, will not involve any potential that one Fund might receive a preferential interest rate to the disadvantage of another Fund. Applicants state that under the IFL Program, as modified by the Rate Conditions, rates will be set under a pre-established formula, approved by the Fund Boards. Applicants state that all Funds participating in the IFL Program, as revised by the Rate Conditions, on any given day will receive the same interest rate.
9. Applicants therefore submit that the modifications to the Rate Conditions are necessary or appropriate in the public interest, consistent with the protection of investors and the policy and provisions of the Act, and meet the standards set forth in sections 6(c), 12(d)(1)(J), 17(b) and 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act. Applicants represent that the transactions conducted subject to the Rate Conditions would be reasonable and fair, would not involve overreaching, and would be consistent with the investment policies of the Funds and with the general purposes of the Act. Applicants submit further that each Fund's participation in the IFL Program would be consistent with the provisions, policies and purposes of the Act, and would be on a basis which is no different from, or less advantageous than that of any other participant.
Applicants' Conditions
Applicants agree that any order of the Commission granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions:
1. The IFL Rate to be charged to the Funds under the IFL Program will be the average of: (a) the FICASH Rate and (b) the Benchmark Rate.
2. On each business day, the Cash Management Services Department (“Cash Management Department”) of Fidelity Service Company, Inc. will compare the IFL Rate calculated as provided in condition 1 with the FICASH Rate that day and all short-term borrowing rates quoted to any of the Funds by any bank with which any Fund has a loan agreement. At least three such quotations will be obtained each day in which any Fund borrows through the IFL Program prior to such borrowing. The Cash Management Department will make cash available for interfund loans only if the IFL Rate is more favorable to the lending Fund than the FICASH Rate and more favorable to the borrowing Fund than the lowest quoted bank loan rate.
3. If a Fund has outstanding borrowings, any interfund loans to the Fund (i) will be at an interest rate equal to or lower than any outstanding bank loan, (ii) will be secured at least on an equal priority basis with at least an equivalent percentage of collateral to loan value as any outstanding bank loan that requires collateral, (iii) will have a maturity no longer than any outstanding bank loan (and in any event not over seven days), and (iv) will provide that, if an event of default by the Fund occurs under any agreement evidencing an outstanding bank loan to the Fund, that event of default will automatically (without need for action or notice by the lending Fund) constitute an immediate event of default under the interfund  loan agreement entitling the lending Fund to call the loan (and exercise all rights with respect to any collateral) and that such call will be made if the lending bank exercises its right to call its loan under its agreement with the borrowing Fund.
4. A Fund may make an unsecured borrowing through the IFL Program if its outstanding borrowings from all sources immediately after the interfund borrowing total 10% or less of its total assets, provided that if the Fund has a secured loan outstanding from any other lender, including but not limited to another Fund, the Fund's interfund borrowing will be secured on at least an equal priority basis with at least an equivalent percentage of collateral to loan value as any outstanding loan that requires collateral. If a Fund's total outstanding borrowings immediately after an interfund borrowing would be greater than 10% of its total assets, the Fund may borrow through the IFL Program only on a secured basis. A Fund could not borrow through the IFL Program or from any other source if its total outstanding borrowings immediately after the interfund borrowing would be more than 331/3% of its total assets.
5. Before any Fund that has outstanding interfund borrowings may, through additional borrowings, cause its outstanding borrowings from all sources to exceed 10% of its total assets, the Fund must first secure each outstanding interfund loan by the pledge of segregated collateral with a market value at least equal to 102% of the outstanding principal value of the loan. If the total outstanding borrowings of a Fund with outstanding interfund loans exceed 10% of its total assets for any other reason (such as a decline in net asset value or because of shareholder redemptions), the Fund will within one business day thereafter (i) repay all its outstanding interfund loans, (ii) reduce its outstanding indebtedness to 10% or less of its total assets, or (iii) secure each outstanding interfund loan by the pledge of segregated collateral with a market value at least equal to 102% of the outstanding principal value of the loan until the Fund's total outstanding borrowings cease to exceed 10% of its total assets, at which time the collateral called for by this condition shall no longer be required. Until each interfund loan that is outstanding at any time that a Fund's total outstanding borrowings exceed 10% is repaid or the Fund's total outstanding borrowings cease to exceed 10% of its total assets, the Fund will mark the value of the collateral to market each day and will pledge such additional collateral as is necessary to maintain the market value of the collateral that secures each outstanding interfund loan at least equal to 102% of the outstanding principal value of the interfund loan.
6. No Fund may lend to another Fund through the IFL Program if the loan would cause its aggregate outstanding loans through the IFL Program to exceed 15% of the lending Fund's current net assets at the time of the loan.
7. A Fund's interfund loans to any one Fund shall not exceed 5% of the lending Fund's net assets.
8. The duration of interfund loans will be limited to the time required to receive payment for securities sold, but in no event more than seven days. Loans effected within seven days of each other will be treated as separate loan transactions for purposes of this condition.
9. Each interfund loan may be called on one business day's notice by a lending Fund and may be repaid on any day by a borrowing Fund.
10. A Fund's participation in the IFL Program must be consistent with its investment objectives and limitations and organizational documents. No Fund may borrow through the IFL Program unless the Fund has a fundamental policy that prevents the Fund from borrowing for other than temporary or emergency purposes (and not for leveraging), except that certain Funds may engage in reverse repurchase agreements for any purpose.
11. The Cash Management Department will calculate total Fund borrowing and lending demand through the IFL Program, and allocate loans on an equitable basis among the Funds, without the intervention of any portfolio manager of the Funds. The Cash Management Department will not solicit cash for the IFL Program from any Fund or prospectively publish or disseminate loan demand data to portfolio managers. Cash amounts remaining after satisfaction of borrowing demand will be invested in FICASH, or in shares of one or more money market funds that are advised by FMR Co. or another FMR entity, or will be returned to be invested directly by the portfolio managers of the Funds.
12. FMR will monitor the IFL Rate and the other terms and conditions of the interfund loans and will make a quarterly report to the Fund Boards concerning the participation of the Funds in the IFL Program and the terms and other conditions of any extensions of credit under the IFL Program.
13. Each Fund Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, will: 
(a) Review, no less frequently than quarterly, each Fund's participation in the IFL Program during the preceding quarter for compliance with the conditions of any order permitting such transactions, 
(b) Establish the Benchmark Rate formula used to determine the interest rate on interfund loans, and review, no less frequently than annually, the continuing appropriateness of the Benchmark Rate formula, and 
(c) Review, no less frequently than annually, the continuing appropriateness of each Fund's participation in the IFL Program.
14. In the event an interfund loan is not paid according to its terms and such default is not cured within two business days from its maturity or from the time the lending Fund makes a demand for payment under the provisions of the interfund loan agreement, FMR will promptly refer such loan for arbitration to an independent arbitrator selected by each Fund Board involved in the loan who will serve as arbitrator of disputes concerning interfund loans.[4] 
           The arbitrator will resolve any problem promptly, and the arbitrator's decision will be binding on both Funds. The arbitrator will submit, at least annually, a written report to the Fund Boards setting forth a description of the nature of any dispute and the actions taken by the Funds to resolve the dispute.
15. Each Fund will maintain and preserve, for a period of not less than six years from the end of the fiscal year in which any transaction by it under the IFL Program occurred, the first two years in an easily accessible place, written records of all such transactions setting forth a description of the terms of the transactions, including the amount, the maturity and the IFL Rate, the rate of interest available at the time on overnight repurchase agreements and commercial bank borrowings, and such other information presented to the Fund's respective Fund Board in connection with the review required by conditions 12 and 13.
16. Each Fund's independent auditors, in connection with their audit examination of the Fund, will review the operation of the IFL Program for compliance with the conditions of the application and their review will form the basis, in part, of the auditor's report on internal accounting controls in Form N-SAR. Applicants will report on the operations of the IFL Program at the Fund Board meetings on a quarterly basis. 

17. No Fund will be permitted to participate in the IFL Program unless the Fund has fully disclosed in its prospectus and/or statement of additional information all material facts about its intended participation.

 
For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority.
Kevin O'Neill,
Deputy Secretary.
