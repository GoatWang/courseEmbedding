Cinema Lens Care and Maintenance
Read More 







This is a set of six lenses that cover the entire range of Cooke miniS4/i lenses. The set includes the 18, 25, 32, 50, 75, and 100mm lenses. Each lens in the set features a clickless aperture with a T-stop range of 2.8 to 22, and they cover Super35-sized sensors. The lenses feature Cam focus as opposed to Helicoid, enables the focus mechanism to stay play and backlash free and require less service with normal use. Featuring a PL mount, these lenses are designed as true cinema lenses with geared focus and iris, as well as manual focus. The lenses are color matched to a factory standard, and they share similar gear positions making for fast lens changes. All the lenses except for the 18mm feature an 87mm front diameter, again for fast lens changes, with the 18mm featuring a 110mm front diameter. Cooke's /i technology system shares lens information with your camera, providing the camera is /i compatible. This set of lenses is marked in feet and inches.

Cinema Lens Care and Maintenance
Read More 







This is a set of six lenses that cover the entire range of Cooke miniS4/i lenses. The set includes the 18, 25, 32, 50, 75, and 100mm lenses. Each lens in the set features a clickless aperture with a T-stop range of 2.8 to 22, and they cover Super35-sized sensors. The lenses feature Cam focus as opposed to Helicoid, enables the focus mechanism to stay play and backlash free and require less service with normal use. Featuring a PL mount, these lenses are designed as true cinema lenses with geared focus and iris, as well as manual focus. The lenses are color matched to a factory standard, and they share similar gear positions making for fast lens changes. All the lenses except for the 18mm feature an 87mm front diameter, again for fast lens changes, with the 18mm featuring a 110mm front diameter. Cooke's /i technology system shares lens information with your camera, providing the camera is /i compatible. This set of lenses is marked in feet and inches.

Ryder Appoints Dennis C. Cooke Senior Vice President, Chief of Operations, Fleet Management Solutions | Business Wire
























































Ryder Appoints Dennis C. Cooke Senior Vice President, Chief of 
      Operations, Fleet Management Solutions






July 22, 2011 08:01 AM Eastern Daylight Time



MIAMI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ryder System, Inc. (NYSE:R), a leader in transportation and supply chain 
      management solutions, today announced that Dennis C. Cooke has joined 
      Ryder’s Fleet 
      Management Solutions business segment as Senior Vice President and 
      Chief of Operations, U.S. and Canada. In this role, reporting to Ryder 
      President of Global Fleet Management Solutions Robert Sanchez, Mr. Cooke 
      will be responsible for leading the North America operations for the 
      company’s largest business segment, which manages a fleet of more than 
      180,000 vehicles from 850 locations, servicing the needs of more than 
      15,000 customers.
    


      “Dennis has proven capability in building large teams that accelerate 
      growth, and has a track record of proven results in driving operational 
      efficiencies and increased profitability,” said Mr. Sanchez. “We are 
      pleased to welcome Dennis to Ryder and look forward to the benefits of 
      his strong leadership skills, as our team works to accelerate profitable 
      growth.”
    

      Mr. Cooke joins Ryder following a 22-year career with GE and related 
      companies, where he progressed through numerous technical and general 
      management roles, leading large complex P&Ls and global functions in 
      both the healthcare and security industries.
    

      After joining the GE organization in 1989, Mr. Cooke held positions of 
      increasing responsibility with GE Healthcare, including serving as Vice 
      President and General Manager of GE Healthcare’s Global MRI business 
      from 2000 to 2005. In this role, he had responsibility for $1.2 billion 
      of global revenue, with direct responsibility for all products planning, 
      marketing and engineering. Mr. Cooke later served as President and CEO 
      of GE Security’s Homeland Protection business. In this position, he had 
      full P&L responsibility and provided strategic leadership to a global 
      team of employees. Following the sale of GE’s Homeland Protection 
      business to Safran group in 2009, the business was renamed Morpho 
      Detection, Inc., and Mr. Cooke continued serving as President and CEO 
      and was named a Board Director.
    

      Mr. Cooke earned his MBA from the University of Chicago, and holds both 
      master’s and bachelor’s degrees in Electrical Engineering from Purdue 
      University. He also is a Six Sigma Green Belt.
