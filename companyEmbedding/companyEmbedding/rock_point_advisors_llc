Our Mission is to work as a trusted partner
in the attainment of your financial goals.
Established in 2004, Rock Point Advisors is an employee-owned investment advisory firm serving individuals and organizations. Our team assembles and manages equity and balanced portfolios within the context of a plan developed for each of our clients.
Our investment team is dedicated to bottom-up fundamental research and socially responsible investing. We invest in businesses that we believe are substantially undervalued and may be positioned to benefit from secular trends. Our research focuses on securities that are currently out of favor with investors, because we believe that buying at a good price is associated with lower risk.

Our Mission is to work as a trusted partner
in the attainment of your financial goals.
Established in 2004, Rock Point Advisors is an employee-owned investment advisory firm serving individuals and organizations. Our team assembles and manages equity and balanced portfolios within the context of a plan developed for each of our clients.
Our investment team is dedicated to bottom-up fundamental research and socially responsible investing. We invest in businesses that we believe are substantially undervalued and may be positioned to benefit from secular trends. Our research focuses on securities that are currently out of favor with investors, because we believe that buying at a good price is associated with lower risk.
