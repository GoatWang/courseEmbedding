CBS SPORTS NAMES 14-TIME EMMY AWARD-WINNER 
PETE RADOVICH JR. CREATIVE DIRECTOR


             Pete Radovich Jr., has been named CBS Sports' Creative Director, the announcement was made today by Sean McManus, President, CBS News and Sports and George Schweitzer, President, CBS Marketing Group.
 
           A 14-time Emmy Award-winner, Radovich currently is the Coordinating Producer for INSIDE THE NFL ON SHOWTIME, a CBS Sports production and a producer for CBS Sports' coverage of the NFL, NCAA Championships, golf as well as other events. He will continue in those roles while assuming his new responsibilities as Creative Director. In this new position, Radovich will be responsible for the CBS Sports on-air look, image and graphic style. In addition, he will lead the creative development and production of CBS Sports on-air promotion, teases and show opens, as well as sponsored sales elements. Radovich replaces CBS Sports' legendary Creative Director Doug Towey, who passed away in March.
 
             "Pete is one of the great creative producers in our entire industry and has already made enormous contributions to CBS Sports," said McManus. "I look forward to him assuming an even larger role in shaping the CBS Sports brand with his unique vision."
 
             "Pete is a brilliant creative guy with a huge amount of passion for CBS Sports," said Schweitzer. "I know he will take the brand to new heights."
 
              "Pete has always been a great creative leader to have on our team," said Harold Bryant, Vice President, Production, CBS Sports. "He has a unique way of engaging the viewer with his cutting edge style and fantastic storytelling. His energy and passion will keep CBS Sports at the forefront of sports production."
 
            "Doug Towey set the standard of excellence for creativity and innovation for 28 years at CBS Sports," said Radovich. "We can never replace Doug, but I am honored and humbled to be given the opportunity to build on the unparalleled success and foundation that he created."
 
            Over his 13-year career, Radovich has worked on many of the biggest sporting events in television including the Olympic Games, the Super Bowl and the Masters.
 
            Radovich joined CBS Sports in 2001 as an Associate Director for the Network's coverage of the NFL.  He worked as Lead Tape Producer with Jim Nantz and Phil Simms for five years, including two Super Bowls, before being promoted to full-time producer.
 
            In 2008, he was tapped by Showtime Networks Inc. and CBS Sports to serve as coordinating producer of INSIDE THE NFL. That year, INSIDE THE NFL won the Sports Emmy® Award for Outstanding Studio Show-Weekly.
 
            In 2004 and 2007, Radovich co-produced and directed the Phil Simms "All Iron Team." In 2006, he produced the first-ever internet coverage of "Amen Corner" at The Masters for CBSSports.com and Masters.org. And, he produced and directed CBS College Sports Network's college football broadcasts in 2007.
 
            Radovich began his career as an intern with the NBC Olympic Unit in 1995 and was hired as a Production Assistant in 1996.
 
            He worked as a Production Assistant and Feature Producer at the Atlanta, Sydney, Salt Lake City and Athens Olympic Games.
 
            In addition, Radovich has worked world renowned events such as Wimbledon, the French Open, the World Series, NBA Finals, Final Four, U.S. Open Tennis, the Kentucky Derby and the Breeders' Cup.
 
            He has amassed 14 Emmy® Awards in his career thus far, including an impressive four-trophy haul at the 2008 ceremony, for work on the Olympic Games, Wimbledon, the NBA Finals, NCAA Men's College Basketball Tournament, INSIDE THE NFL, and twice for work on the Super Bowl - one for "Outstanding Feature" during the Super Bowl XXXVIII pregame show, and one for "Outstanding Opening Tease" for Super Bowl XLI.
