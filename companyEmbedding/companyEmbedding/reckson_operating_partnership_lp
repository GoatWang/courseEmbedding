(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview Reckson Operating Partnership, L.P., or ROP, commenced operations on June 2, 1995. The sole general partner of ROP is a wholly-owned subsidiary of SL Green Operating Partnership, L.P., or the Operating Partnership. The sole limited partner of ROP is the Operating Partnership. SL Green Realty Corp., or SL Green, is the general partner of the Operating Partnership. Unless the context requires otherwise, all references to "we," "our," "us" and the "Company" means ROP and all entities owned or controlled by ROP. ROP is engaged in the acquisition, ownership, management, operation, acquisition, leasing and financing of commercial real estate properties, principally office properties, and also owns land for future development located in the New York City, Westchester County and Connecticut, which collectively is also known as the New York Metropolitan area. The following discussion related to our consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements appearing in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Item 8 of SL Green and the Operating Partnership's Annual Report on Form 10-K. The New York City commercial real estate market continued to strengthen in 2013, and we took advantage of this strengthening market in improving occupancies and deploying capital in the borough of Manhattan to strategically position the Company for future growth. Leasing and Operating SL Green has historically outperformed the Manhattan office market, and did so again in 2013. SL Green's Manhattan office property occupancy on same-store properties based on leases signed increased to 96.6% from 95.1% in the prior year. During 2013, SL Green signed office leases in Manhattan encompassing 5.2 million square feet, of which 4.3 million square feet represented office leases that replaced previously occupied space. SL Green's mark-to-market on these 4.3 million square feet of signed Manhattan office leases that replaced previously occupied space was 9.5% for 2013. New leasing activity in Manhattan in 2013 totaled 25.7 million square feet, slightly below the ten-year average but higher than 2012. Of the total 2013 leasing activity in Manhattan, the Midtown submarket accounted for approximately 16.0 million square feet, or 62.3%. Midtown's overall office vacancy increased from 10.3% at December 31, 2012 to 11.2% at December 31, 2013. However, 1.2 million square feet of new office space was added to the Midtown office inventory, with approximately 2.2 million square feet (0.6% of the total 395.3 million square foot Manhattan office inventory) currently under construction and scheduled to be placed in service by 2015 or early 2016. Demand for space in certain sub-markets such as Midtown South and a lack of new supply created conditions in which asking rents for direct space in Midtown South increased during 2013 by 27.3% to $63.67 per square foot. Asking rents for direct space in Midtown increased during 2013 by 2.6% to $70.54 per square foot and have increased by 10.5% since the recessionary trough in in the first quarter of 2010. Over the same period, net effective rents (which take into consideration leasing concessions) have increased by 21.5%. Assets Transfer In connection with the closing of our 2011 revolving credit facility and 2012 credit facility, in which we, along with SL Green and the Operating Partnership are borrowers, SL Green transferred five properties, with total assets aggregating to $683.8 million at November 2011, and transferred three additional properties, with total assets aggregating to $320.2 million at December 31, 2012, to ROP. Under the Business Combinations guidance, these were determined to be transfers of businesses between the indirect parent company and its wholly-owned subsidiary. As such, the assets and liabilities were transferred at their carrying value. These transfers are required to be recorded as of the beginning of the current reporting period as though the assets and liabilities had been transferred at that date. The consolidated financial statements and financial information presented for all prior years have been retrospectively adjusted to furnish comparative information. On September 30, 2012, SL Green transferred $324.9 million of its preferred equity investments to ROP, one of which was subject to a secured $50.0 million loan. Under the Business Combinations guidance, these transfers were determined to be transfers of assets between the indirect parent company and its wholly-owned subsidiary. As such, the assets were transferred at their carrying value and accounted for prospectively from the date of transfer. As of December 31, 2013, we owned the following interests in commercial office properties in the New York Metropolitan area, primarily in midtown Manhattan, a borough of New York City. Our investments in the New York Metropolitan area also include investments in Westchester County and Connecticut, which are collectively known as the Suburban commercial office properties:   Number of Weighted Average Location Ownership Buildings Square Feet Occupancy(1) Manhattan Consolidated properties 12 6,866,400 94.6 % Suburban Consolidated properties 17 2,785,500 79.1 % 29 9,651,900 90.2 %  At December 31, 2013, we also own a mixed-use residential and commercial building encompassing approximately 493,000 square feet, a development property encompassing approximately 104,000 square feet and an inventory of development parcels that aggregated approximately 81 acres of land in four separate parcels on which we can, based on estimates at December 31, 2013, develop approximately 1.1 million square feet of office space and in which we have invested approximately $67.2 million. As of December 31, 2013, we also held preferred equity investments with a book value of $369.4 million.

Occupancy for our Suburban portfolio was 79.1% at December 31, 2013 compared to 79.5% at December 31, 2012. At December 31, 2013, approximately 4.3% and 7.8% of the space leased at our consolidated Manhattan and Suburban office properties, respectively, is expected to expire during 2014. Based on our estimates, the current market rents on all our consolidated Manhattan office properties for leases that are expected to expire during 2014 would be approximately 15.3% higher than the existing in-place fully escalated rents while the current market rents on all our consolidated Manhattan properties for leases that are scheduled to expire in future years would be approximately 10.4% higher than the existing in-place fully escalated rents. Based on our estimates, the current market rents on all our consolidated Suburban office properties for leases that are expected to expire during 2014 would be approximately 7.3% lower than the existing in-place fully escalated rents while the current market rents on all our consolidated Suburban properties for leases that are scheduled to expire in future years would be approximately 3.1% higher than the existing in-place fully escalated rents. Rental revenues depend on our ability to maintain the occupancy rates of currently leased space and to lease currently available space and space available from unscheduled lease terminations.  Escalation and reimbursement revenue was flat compared to prior year primarily as a result of higher real estate tax recoveries from non-acquisition properties ($1.5 million) and the acquisitions of 641 Sixth Avenue ($0.7 million), 315 West 33rd Street ($0.6 million) and 304 Park Avenue South ($0.4 million), partially offset by lower electric reimbursements ($1.8 million) from non-acquisition properties.

Occupancy for our Suburban portfolio was 79.5% at December 31, 2012 compared to 80.7% at December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2012, approximately 5.9% and 6.5% of the space leased at our consolidated Manhattan and Suburban properties, respectively, is expected to expire during 2013. We estimate that the current market rents on these expected 2013 lease expirations at our consolidated Manhattan and Suburban properties would be approximately 11.9% higher and 6.8% lower, respectively, than then existing in-place fully escalated rents. We estimate that the current market rents on all our consolidated Manhattan and Suburban properties were approximately 8.8% higher and 0.8% lower, respectively, than the existing in-place fully escalated rents on leases that are scheduled to expire in all future years.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
