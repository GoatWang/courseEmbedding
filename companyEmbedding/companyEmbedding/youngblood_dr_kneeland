Kneeland Youngblood (born December 13, 1955) is an African-American physician, businessman, and political figure. He is the co-founder of the private equity firm Pharos Capital Group, LLC, which focuses on providing later stage funding, generally for growth, acquisitions, and recapitalizations, to undercapitalized healthcare and business services oriented companies located in underserved regions across the nation. [1] Youngblood is listed as a top bundler for Barack Obama, having bundled more than $200,000.[2]
Youngblood was born in Galena Park, Texas. He became involved in politics at a young age, and was a page in the Texas State Legislature at age 14. Youngblood attended Princeton University and earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1978. Before he graduated (at the risk of expulsion) Youngblood participated in a sit-in calling for Princeton to divestment from South Africa under apartheid.
Youngblood traveled to Oxford, England, and Stockholm, Sweden, before returning to the United States. He attended the University of Texas, Southwestern Medical School at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and earned his M.D. in 1982.[3] He was a resident in Emergency Medicine at the Emory University School of Medicine from 1983 to 1985, training primarily at Grady Memorial Hospital. Youngblood worked in medicine from 1985 to 1997 as an emergency medicine physician at the Medical Center of Plano.
From 1993 to 1999, Youngblood served on the board of the Teacher Retirement System of Texas (TRS) as a trustee and chairman of the Fund's Real Estate Committee, directing asset allocations and managing the fund's $1.4 billion portfolio. In 1994, President Bill Clinton nominated Youngblood to the Board of Directors of the United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC). While on the board Youngblood traveled to Africa and met Nelson Mandela, which led him to write the essay "From Sit-in to Soweto." While with the Clinton administration, he also served on the Task Force on National Health Care Reform headed by First Lady Hillary Clinton.
In 1997, Youngblood, along with Michael Devlin and Robert Crants, founded Pharos Capital Group, LLC, a private equity firm.
Youngblood's other board memberships include: AMR Investments, Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Burger King, The Gap, Inc., and the City of Dallas Employee Retirement System. He is Director Emeritus of the U.S. Enrichment Corporation and iStar Financial, a NYSE-traded real estate investment trust (REIT). He is also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations..

Biography  |




 Interview Date:  10/28/2004 
 Physician, businessman, and presidential appointee Dr. Kneeland Youngblood, was born in Galena Park, Texas, on December 13, 1955.  At the age of fourteen, Youngblood was working as a page on the floor of the Texas State Legislature; after graduating from high school, he attended Princeton University, earning his B.A. degree in political science in 1978.  While at Princeton, Youngblood spent time studying abroad, attending both Warnborough College in Oxford, England, and the University of Stockholm in Sweden from 1976 to 1977.  In 1978, only a few months shy of his graduation, Youngblood took part in a sit-in at Nassau Hall with two hundred other students to protest Princeton’s investments in South African businesses, risking the threat of expulsion. Youngblood and the other students were not expelled, and in the autumn of 1978, he began attending the University of Texas Health Science Center, from which he earned his M.D. in 1982.  During his studies at the University of Texas, Youngblood traveled to Egypt, where he studied at the Cairo University Medical School.
After earning his M.D., Youngblood moved to New York City, where he held a surgical internship with Columbia University for a year; in 1983, he moved and began his two-year residency in emergency medicine at the Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, Georgia.  After completing his residency, Youngblood returned to Texas, taking a position as an emergency physician at the Medical Center of Plano, a Dallas suburb.  Youngblood remained in Plano until he left the medical profession in 1997, at which time he co-founded and became the managing partner of Pharos Capital Group, LLC., a private equity firm that invests in technology, business services, and health care companies, and manages more than $200 million in investments. 
In 1993, Youngblood was appointed by President Clinton to serve on the board of directors of the United States Enrichment Corporation, a government-owned corporation that provided nuclear fuel to countries hoping to utilize nuclear power.  Youngblood remained at the United States Enrichment Corporation until 1998, at one point traveling with a delegation to South Africa, where he met with both F.W. DeKlerk and Nelson Mandela.  Youngblood's time in South Africa prompted him to write an essay entitled From Sit-In to Soweto, detailing his experiences as a young man protesting South African policies dealing with working with the country.  During his tenure with the Clinton Administration, Youngblood was also a part of First Lady Hillary Clinton’s Health Care Task Force. 
Youngblood served on the board of directors of numerous corporations and organizations, including the Teacher Retirement System of the State of Texas, an $85 billion pension fund, and the boards of AMR Investments; Starwood Hotels & Lodging, Incorporated; Burger King, Incorporated; and The Gap, Incorporated.  Youngblood also served as a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.
