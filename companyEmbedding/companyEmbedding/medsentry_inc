ISO MedSentryISO MedSentry™ is the industry’s first integrated model to detect medical fraud. ISO MedSentry combines the strength and efficiency of advanced analytics with the quality and vigor of our clinical experts’ analyses to set a new standard in the early detection of fraud.Medical fraud: A critical problemMedical fraud has become increasingly problematic for property/casualty insurers. Multiple streams of information sources — such as claimant histories, medical billing data, and provider paperwork — create an environment in which greater and more sophisticated medical billing ploys can flourish.To fight those evolving schemes, ISO created ISO MedSentry, a system that puts the power back in the hands of individual insurers.A new standard in medical fraud detectionISO MedSentry is the first tool to integrate highly advanced analytical tools with a clinically expert, human-touch validation process — offering accurate, timely, and effective results.ISO MedSentry provides insurers with reliable, specific, and actionable cases. As evidenced by its 90 percent referral acceptance rate, the system helps you avoid the delays and costs associated with false positives, which can be a huge burden on already-strapped SIU resources.How it helpsThe combined “high-tech, high-touch” approach identifies medical billing fraud at the source in the earliest stages of the process.The breadth and depth of our analysts’ experi­ence improve the quality of referrals and saves SIUs time and effort in their initial investigations.ISO’s proven experience with big data analytical systems and knowl­edge of property/casualty claims processes ensure precise, accurate results and the safety and security of client data.SaaS (software-as-a-service) technology allows flexibility through customization and ensures more effective investigative resource deployment.BenefitsDiscover pockets of fraud risk in your own medical billing data that might otherwise go undetected.Prioritize exposure associated with specific medical providers to increase productivity.Receive actionable case reports that facilitate fast, effective investigations so you can close a greater amount of cases.Avoid the delays associated with false positives.Use information from the ISO MedSentry process to improve your ability to analyze claims accurately and process legitimate first-party medical bills quickly.Get started nowFind out how ISO MedSentry can help you win the fight against medical fraud.Phone: 1-800-888-4476E-mail: This email address is being protected from spambots.

The System — MedSentry


























































The only unified system that brings together everyone involved in a patient’s medication regimen, to ensure they take their medication and stay as healthy as possible.





How it WorksMedSentry is the only unified system that integrates everyone involved in a patient’s medication regimen. Our fill and verification tools live in pharmacies and fill multiple medications into single dosing cups.  These dose cups are delivered to patients homes by local care partners.  Patients are reminded by MedSentry when it’s time to take a dose, and depending on their level of dexterity, use a countertop or mobile device to dispense their medication. Networks of caregivers monitor high-risk patients via our cloud platform, and are notified if anyone misses a dose.























  







At the PharmacyPatient’s prescriptions are automatically sorted into individual dose cups by our Fill and Verification tools, and then delivered right to their door.

Join the Network
    







At HomeFor patients with poor dexterity, a Medsentry countertop device is set up right in their home. It notifies them with a chime when it’s time to take their medications. The patient pulls a lever and the correct medication is automatically dispensed in a single dose cup. 

Learn about In-Home
   







AnywhereFor patients with higher levels of ability and dexterity, the MedSentry mobile application is installed on the patient’s smartphone. They receive a push notification when it’s time to take their medications, and use the mobile app to scan the right dose cup and confirm their adherence.

Learn about Mobile
    







EverywhereMedSenty’s cloud platform links patients with caregivers. Data is sent from both in-home and mobile devices, so that caregivers can easily monitor a patient’s adherence in real time. Caregivers receive alerts when patients miss a dose, and use the online portal to update prescriptions lists and communicate across care networks.

“I used to literally have to give [my mother] the pills myself, or call her and listen to her swallow them. Now I have my life back.”

— Cassandra, Daughter of a patient

Would a Trump Self-Pardon Precipitate a Constitutional Crisis?



Cornell University law professor Michael C. Dorf argues that if President Trump were to pardon himself, that action itself would not cause a constitutional crisis, but other actions Trump has already taken have already placed us far along a road to a constitutional crisis.

ISO MedSentry™ – Detect Suspicious Medical Billing


(PDF Download)
ISO MedSentry™ uses a combination of advanced analytics, superior technology, and expert clinicians to detect suspicious patterns in medical billing data. ISO MedSentry Clinical Analysts place all the information they’ve obtained into the ISO MedSentry desktop, which supplies a wide variety of additional information about the suspect provider. The system makes all the information available to the insurer’s investigations unit for action, all on a comprehensive SaaS platform. Join us to experience ISO MedSentry.
