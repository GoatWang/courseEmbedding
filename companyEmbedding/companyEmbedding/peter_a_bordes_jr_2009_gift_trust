Making Christ Known
We aim to help you share God’s Word with the lost every day. We price our material at or sometimes 
  below our cost on our larger quantities with the desire to help you reach as many souls as possible. You will 
  find a range of affordable options from the value-priced Standard Tracts through the Audio Tracts made 
  very affordable for giving with tips or to neighbors and friends.
Not every soul is at the same point in its awareness of its need. Some need to wake up to being sinners 
  before it’s too late; others are hungry for the truth and don’t know where to find it. In the past 
  few years, we’ve added a large number of new gospel tracts, tract cards and gospel calendar options 
  as well as new categories of gospel booklets and audio tracts. Some of these address modern ways of stating 
  old error, such as post-modernism. Others provide new children’s tracts for use in your Sunday School or 
  Vacation Bible School. With the Lord’s help, we will continue to offer newly-crafted messages with the 
  unfading story of God’s grace and man’s need. Keep checking for new options and titles.
We’d love your feedback. If you have any suggestions for ways we can serve you better, we’d 
  like to hear about it. Feel free to send your ideas for new tract messages as well. Please write to 
  BTPorders@bibletruthpublishers.com with your helpful thoughts.

While attending Washington University, Mr. LeBlanc studied under Muhm & Reilly partner Edward F.

At Saint Louis University, Mr. LeBlanc received the Academic Achievement Award for Legal Research and Writing.  He later received Academic Excellence Awards at Washington University for Federal Estate & Gift Taxation and Asset Protection Planning.
Prior to his career as an attorney, Mr. LeBlanc worked in communications for private companies in both the manufacturing and service fields.  Mr. LeBlanc views his responsibilities at Muhm & Reilly as a culmination of these diverse backgrounds, each of which he has tailored toward serving his clients in the best possible manner.
 Mr. LeBlanc is a member of the Missouri Bar Association, the Bar Association of Metropolitan St. Louis, and the Estate Planning Council of St. Louis. He is admitted to practice law in Missouri.

The average rating is determined by calculating the mathematical average of all ratings that are approved for posting per the Customer Ratings and Reviews Terms of Use, and does not include any ratings that did not meet the guidelines and were therefore not posted). Ratings and reviews are added continuously to the Web site (after a delay for screening against guidelines), and average ratings are updated dynamically as reviews are added or removed.   The ratings and experiences of customers may not be representative of the experiences of all customers or investors and are not indicative of future success. The accuracy of information included in the customer ratings and reviews cannot be guaranteed by Fidelity Investments. Customers who post ratings may be responsible for disclosing whether they have a financial interest or conflict in submitting a rating or review.   Please contact a Fidelity representative if you have any questions or concerns about the ratings and reviews posted here.   Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information.
