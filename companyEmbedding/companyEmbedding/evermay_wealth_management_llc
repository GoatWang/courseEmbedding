Happiness & Planning: A Comprehensive Look

Most people think of estate planning as the process of arranging their affairs in anticipation of death. And that obviously is the main focus of estate planning. But, done properly, estate planning can help increase our own happiness.

We all want to be happy. That seems to be why we do everything, isn't it? It's especially true with respect to our financial lives. And yet, some of us can't figure out how to get there. There have been many books published on the science of happiness, particularly in the last 10 to 15 years. And, although none of them answer the question definitively, the findings they cite give us some signposts about financial happiness.
What Impacts Our Happiness?
Many factors contribute to our lack of financial happiness. To begin with, our perception of what we need to be happy dictates how we behave and how we pursue our goals. However, it turns out that our perceptions are often faulty.We think we have far more control over future events than we do. Our memories tend to be faulty; our brains, after having experienced something, will fill in “facts” that didn't actually exist, with the result that we build a past that never happened.Lack of true imagination is common: We find it particularly difficult to imagine that we will ever think, want, or feel differently than we do now.We treasure our own uniqueness. We see ourselves as better (more intelligent, more effective in business) or even worse (more selfish), but never average. As a result, we    fail to learn from the experiences of others.
Money and happiness
We have a difficult relationship with money. We have been told that money alone does not equal happiness. However, it is possible that, in some cases, money can add to happiness.The National Academy of Sciences reported that people's emotional well-being increases along with their income, but only up to about $75,000 per year. On the other hand, it also seems that incremental increases in income once a person is safely above the poverty level (or perhaps above the annual $75,000 level) do not result in incremental increases in happiness. Studies of other countries' levels of happiness bear this out. People in Latin American countries, for instance, where average income levels are much lower, are more or less on par in the happiness department with Americans, who have the highest per capita income.It may be that Americans are not as happy as their income level would suggest because we live in a culture of stress: We are overworked and our consumer culture (like our biology) posits that feeling good is the main purpose in life, rather than a byproduct of living right.
Planning Our Way to Happiness
So what can we do with this information? Because self-control is so critical for happiness, it would seem that in-depth planning for your financial life is an important component to happiness. If you have adequate information about your financial situation and can use that information to formulate a road map for where you want to go, then you are likely to have greater autonomy, or control, and therefore may have a greater potential to be happier.Good planning is not merely “financial” planning. This is true because money alone does not make a person happier. Rather, solid planning is built on a basis of solid discovery. That is, to formulate a plan that may truly improve your life, you must first discover those key goals and issues that really motivate you, and then compare your existing financial situation against these goals to see how prepared you are to meet those goals. Once you've uncovered what is most important to you, you can begin to formulate a plan that really makes sense and that can potentially lead you to greater happiness.This kind of planning can't be done on a website or with software. It requires soul-searching and possibly some help from professionals who know how to ask the right questions and interpret the answers. But the reward for doing it the right way just might be a greater degree of happiness!
Ready, Set, Plan
Put in more tangible terms, we strongly recommend planning that proceeds in the following steps. Note that the first four steps aren't really planning at all, but rather discovery steps that are necessary before any meaningful planning can take place:Identify your key goals and issues. Make them specific and start with the nonfinancial ones. One author identified seven factors that included things like family and personal relationships, meaningful work, friends, and values as being key drivers of happiness. Think of those kinds of goals first. What might retirement look like to you? Will you be the kind of person who will always have to work — not for the money but to keep you from going crazy? If maintaining community and personal relationships is important to you, do you really need that second house? Let personal, values-based decisions drive the financial ones. Complete your own personal balance sheet. Having a personal and  detailed balance sheet lets you see at a glance what your total financial picture looks like, including assets that you might not otherwise consider, like life insurance and real estate.Identify your risk sensitivity. We've now endured the Great Recession and we know viscerally how that feels. In light of that experience, what is your emotional reaction to risk? This is less about how a financial professional might describe it and more about your reaction to it.Assemble a list of your estate planning documents.Begin the planning process with all this information at hand. Only after you've assembled all the information just described should you start the planning process.

Don't let your focus on building and preserving wealth negatively impact your family relationships and personal health.

If you're in your prime earning years, your focus is likely on building the wealth you will need to live well in retirement. Americans are living longer and health care costs are rising. Investing enough money to provide sufficient income to sustain your current lifestyle can help pave the way for a more secure retirement. But too much focus on meeting future income needs can be stressful particularly when you are in your 30s, 40s and 50s and may be facing many family commitments. How do you find a balance?Start by realizing that it's normal to feel a nerve-wracking pull between enjoying your life today and accumulating sufficient wealth to cover all your expenses in retirement. “Thinking about how much income you will need in retirement can be very daunting,” says Tracie McMillion, CFA, Head of Global Asset Allocation at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.For most people, prime working years are also prime family years — the time when children are growing up and older family members may begin to need medical care. Having a single-minded focus on wealth-building at the expense of family priorities can cause major stress, which can even impact your health. More than just an annoyance, chronic stress raises the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, depression, anxiety disorder, and other illnesses.Burying your head in the sand isn't the answer, either. “People tend to focus more on the present than the future,” says Margie E. Lachman, Ph.D., professor of psychology and director of the Lifespan Initiative on Healthy Aging and Lifespan Lab at Brandeis University.While it can be fun to live in the moment, the secret to building wealth without damaging your health lies in taking a balanced approach. Here are six ways to find a work-life balance that allows you to enjoy today while saving for tomorrow.
1) Don't wait
If you don’t think that you will be able to meet your income needs in retirement, don't waste time beating yourself up about it. Meet with your financial team now to take immediate action. You may want to consider whether you are accumulating wealth in the most tax-efficient accounts and also revisit your regular expenditures. Having a clear plan in place can help you increase opportunities available to you when you retire.
2) Rethink retirement income
When interest rates are high, many retired investors look to bond portfolios for income. But with sustained low interest rates, those accumulating wealth for retirement as well as those already in retirement may need to consider other avenues to generate their income.“Sometimes, fear of risk makes people too conservative with retirement savings. They don't want to lose what they've worked so hard for,” McMillion says. “But you do want to get a good return on your money.&rdquo Because people are living longer in retirement, you may want to keep exposure to equities and other growth investments even as you get closer to retirement. A portfolio that relies solely on fixed income may not be able to keep up with inflation. “Talk to your investment specialist to determine which strategies align with your specific needs,” offers McMillion.
3) Involve your family
Take advantage of opportunities to talk with your family about finances. When your children are young, it can help to explain why it's so important for you to save for the future and that sometimes short-term sacrifices are necessary to make that happen. Understanding the family's financial realities may help lower everyone's stress levels when you occasionally have to make the choice to skip a Little League game or gymnastics meet in order to put in some extra hours at work. By having regular conversations about budgeting and investing, your children will be well informed as they mature and more prepared for their own financial futures.
4) Take care of your health
Neglecting self-care not only interferes with your quality of life but can also make your post-retirement health care costs skyrocket. Protect your health and your nest egg by eating a healthy diet, exercising most days of the week, maintaining a healthy weight, getting regular health checkups, and staying up to date on vaccinations. These things do take time and effort, but they can have big payoffs later in life.
5) Make your money work as hard as you do
Business owners often have their company’s balance sheet top of mind as they build their business. But once the business is passed along, their personal balance sheet will need to be structured to sustain them. As always, diversification and asset placement are key strategies to help plan for growth and income in a portfolio. Your investment professional can help you evaluate your current allocation against your anticipated needs and recommend adjustments to help keep you on track.
6) Think beyond dollars
Investing cash during your prime earning years is important, of course. But it's also essential to plan in a more holistic way as well. “Make investments in the future — not just monetary ones, but also in relationships, health, career, and education,” Lachman says. “They all can pay big dividends in the long run.”Alice Lesch Kelly is a freelance writer based in the Boston area.

Five ways you may want to adjust your retirement plan as people live longer, more active years.

Thanks to medical advances, more people are living longer and with an eye on a healthy lifestyle. That's terrific news for everyone. But a longer, more active life also means rethinking traditional views of your needs for retirement, and that should include a critical look at how your portfolio is put together.It used to be that as individuals and investors got close to and entered retirement, they changed their portfolios to have less exposure to equities and more to fixed income in order to protect what was built over the years. Drew Denning, Retirement Strategist for Wells Fargo Advisors, notes that now, however, you may need retirement income for 30 or more years. And he adds that with an inflation assumption of 3%, your costs will double in 24 years.So how do you help ensure you stay as financially healthy as you are physically fit for all those wonderful years of retirement? Denning outlines five suggestions to rethink the way you invest in retirement.
1) Reconsider your risk
For starters, Denning advises that you revisit your risk tolerance. For those transitioning from working to retirement, this advice is even more important. “The loss of a regular paycheck can cause more aggressive investors to become even more nervous when a market correction occurs. If you cannot either emotionally or financially withstand a market correction without withdrawing from the market, then your portfolio is too risky,” says Denning.This doesn't mean, however, that you should move to 100% bonds. “Keeping a healthy dose of exposure to stocks and/or equities can help a portfolio keep pace with inflation,” he adds.
2) Keep a cash reserve
Most people know the importance of keeping an emergency fund during your working years, but what about when you're drawing down on existing funds? Conventional advice about establishing a cash reserve bears repeating, according to Denning. When a market decline occurs or when you have an emergency expense, your cash reserve can be a resource not only financially but also emotionally. Denning points out that analysis shows that this reserve should cover anywhere from one to three years of essential expenses.
3) Adjust your habits for market conditions
“Consider using adaptable spending if your budget allows,” counsels Denning. “When your portfolio declines in value, reduce your planned withdrawals; and when the market increases, increase your withdrawals or spending.” This approach, he adds, “can dramatically increase the long-term sustainability of your portfolio.”
4) Focus on fixed income
Although it's important to maintain an allocation of stocks, bonds, and cash in your portfolio, pay special attention to your bond allocation, Denning advises. In today's low-interest-rate environment, many analysts are predicting a slow and steady increase in rates during the next five to 10 years. While increasing rates are desirable to retirees, it can also have a negative impact on the value of your bond portfolio.“For instance, if interest rates rise by 1%, a bond portfolio with a 10-year duration will decrease in value by 10%,” Denning says. A possible solution: “I would suggest selecting a bond portfolio with a two-to-three-year duration, where a 1% increase in rates would only result in a 2% to 3% decline in the value of the portfolio.”
5) Build your health care plan
As life spans and the number of years you spend in retirement increase, you likely will be subject to a corresponding increase in health care expenses. According to a 2015 report from HealthView Insights, the average lifetime health care expenses for a 65-year-old healthy couple retiring in 2015 and covered by Medicare parts B, D, and a supplemental insurance policy will be more than $400,000 once out-of-pocket medical expenses are added into the equation.Regarding this somewhat sobering statistic, Denning advises to pay attention to your health and address any medical issues before they have a chance to become major concerns.It's not your parents' retirement — the same strategies that worked for them may not be right for you if you're looking at spending 25 or more active years as a retiree. Taking a thorough look at your investment strategy may help ensure you'll be enjoying every one of those years.

Unique Approach












A Richer Life Defined
As wealth managers, we immerse ourselves in the world of finance and in service to our clients. We understand that each client is different, with different goals, different priorities, different hopes and dreams.
When we talk about helping you build a richer life, it is more than a single-minded goal to increase your net worth. It is with a deeper understanding of what wealth means to your life and to your loved ones.
Getting There
The first step is a conversation. A dialogue. We believe face-to-face works best. We listen to and understand your financial needs, goals and expectations and measure them against your current situation. At the same time, we get to know you and your family, developing a relationship that is as much personal as it is business.
Then we create a financial plan for you. A plan that incorporates wealth counseling, because it’s not enough just to work out the numbers. Flexibility is essential. While a few of our clients take an active role in investment decisions, others take a more passive approach. Finding what is right for you is the key.
We also guide clients on how best to use wealth and handle the family dynamics that are affected by it. Finding the balance between the future and the now. This is a truly comprehensive approach to wealth management. It’s how Evermay can help guide you to a richer life.

Investment Management








Asset management is a continuous process. We are constantly evaluating new investments and opportunities in order to keep you on the path to your investment goals. Our approach is grounded in research designed to find the best combination of investments that will produce the highest expected return given a level of risk appropriate for you.
Determining the mix of assets to achieve your goals is the cornerstone of our investment process. Specific investments used in your portfolio are selected based on their expected performance, net of fees. In some cases, that means choosing an exchange-traded fund that tracks a particular index, such as the S&P 500. In other situations, it means choosing a mutual fund where the fund manager actively selects the holdings. Additionally, some portfolios can benefit from individual equities and bonds selected by us in-house. It is also our practice to incorporate alternative investments and separate account managers when appropriate. 
Decisions we make on your behalf are grounded in rigorous quantitative analysis to determine what factors are important to performance. Our dynamic approach eliminates much of the distracting noise surrounding investment selection. We regularly update our analysis to incorporate new data and improve our methodology.
Through our quantitative analysis, we identify investments for further qualitative analysis and due diligence. At this point, we assess investment risks that are not reflected in the numbers. Our final investment decisions capture our best thinking to design the most suitable investment portfolio for you.

Who We Serve















Individuals and Families
These clients want to protect what they have today, and grow it for tomorrow. They have future generations and a legacy in mind. They seek comfort in knowing they have taken the right steps to secure the future.





Entrepreneurs
They tend to be risk takers. We understand the spirit and drive of a more aggressive investor. We provide balance and perspective. For this group, our financial savvy and long-range vision have great value.





Corporate Executives and Professionals
Ownership in a firm adds complexity to one’s financial life. New partners must now manage cash to meet quarterly tax payments in anticipation of annual distributions. Executives with stock options must balance diversification with their firm’s ownership requirements. Evermay makes sure these clients make the most of their opportunities.





Women
Often wealth management tends to focus on men. At Evermay, we understand that women can face unique challenges. Our advisors are attuned to the female perspective and provide wealth management that focuses on their particular financial planning concerns.





Life Events
The death of a spouse or family member can change everything—and quickly. Wealth management in these situations must be handled respectfully and dispassionately. Similarly, a divorce can be a disruptive life event. Our advisors provide reassurance and calm when navigating through these painful and unsettling times.





Multiple Generations
Families with three or four generations of wealth have unique situations. Along with wealth management, these clients often benefit from wealth counseling to handle family dynamics of inheritance.






Creative Problem Solving 
Evermay was not afraid to think out of the box for one of our entrepreneurial clients.

The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (the "S&P 500") and the Russell 2000 Index, if applicable, are mentioned for comparative purposes only because they represent, respectively, an index typically used to gauge the general performance of the U.S. securities markets and an index that offers investors access to the small-cap segment of the U.S. equity universe. The use of these indices is not meant to be indicative of the asset composition or volatility of the portfolio of securities held by our clients, which may or may not have included securities which comprise the S&P 500 and the Russell 2000 Index, and which may hold considerably fewer than the number of different securities that make up the S&P 500 and the Russell Index. As such, clients’ investment portfolios should be considered riskier than an investment in either index.

IACCP® certification is a voluntary certification; no federal or state law or regulation requires compliance professionals to hold IACCP® certification. To attain the right to use IACCP® an individual must have at least two years’ work experience, complete 22 hours of coursework, make an ethical commitment, pass a certifying examination and annually complete 12 hours of continuing education.

Company Description


Evermay Wealth Management employs a long-term asset allocation strategy that emphasizes diversification and discipline over market timing. Through their open architecture investment platform, the firm conducts a rigorous process for selecting managers focusing only on the most consistent and best performing. Equity and fixed-income investments are selected their potential to enhance portfolio performance.  Evermay uses sophisticated optimization and allocation models to identify a mix of assets that will deliver the highest possible return based on each client's risk tolerance. The firm also offers a variety of alternative investment options to enhance portfolio performance with more consistent returns and reduced volatility.Although the firm generally focuses on long-term investments, they may also seek to take advantage of opportunistic investments that are attractive given prevailing market conditions. They look for opportunities that: (1) possess strong absolute or relative return potential (2) have expected equity-like returns (at least 10% annualized) looking forward 6 to 18 months (3) represent a significant relative opportunity within a comparable asset class and (4) can be implemented with a mutual fund and/or ETF. Separate accounts or limited partnership mandates are only considered in appropriate situations.Evermay offers tax efficient investment options including ETFs, separately managed accounts and tax efficient market capture strategies. They also recommend high-grade, tax-exempt state and local bonds to help reduce a portfolios tax liability. The firm reviews all tax lots and assesses all tax implications prior to selling specific securities or executing trades. Evermay seeks to place less tax-efficient investments in tax-sheltered or tax-deferred accounts such as IRAs or SEP plans.

Happiness & Planning: A Comprehensive Look











Happiness & Planning: A Comprehensive Look

Wealth Management
4 MINUTE READ









Most people think of estate planning as the process of arranging their affairs in anticipation of death. And that obviously is the main focus of estate planning. But, done properly, estate planning can help increase our own happiness.

We all want to be happy. That seems to be why we do everything, isn't it? It's especially true with respect to our financial lives. And yet, some of us can't figure out how to get there. There have been many books published on the science of happiness, particularly in the last 10 to 15 years. And, although none of them answer the question definitively, the findings they cite give us some signposts about financial happiness.
What Impacts Our Happiness?
Many factors contribute to our lack of financial happiness. To begin with, our perception of what we need to be happy dictates how we behave and how we pursue our goals. However, it turns out that our perceptions are often faulty.We think we have far more control over future events than we do. Our memories tend to be faulty; our brains, after having experienced something, will fill in “facts” that didn't actually exist, with the result that we build a past that never happened.Lack of true imagination is common: We find it particularly difficult to imagine that we will ever think, want, or feel differently than we do now.We treasure our own uniqueness. We see ourselves as better (more intelligent, more effective in business) or even worse (more selfish), but never average. As a result, we    fail to learn from the experiences of others.
Money and happiness
We have a difficult relationship with money. We have been told that money alone does not equal happiness. However, it is possible that, in some cases, money can add to happiness.The National Academy of Sciences reported that people's emotional well-being increases along with their income, but only up to about $75,000 per year. On the other hand, it also seems that incremental increases in income once a person is safely above the poverty level (or perhaps above the annual $75,000 level) do not result in incremental increases in happiness. Studies of other countries' levels of happiness bear this out. People in Latin American countries, for instance, where average income levels are much lower, are more or less on par in the happiness department with Americans, who have the highest per capita income.It may be that Americans are not as happy as their income level would suggest because we live in a culture of stress: We are overworked and our consumer culture (like our biology) posits that feeling good is the main purpose in life, rather than a byproduct of living right.
Planning Our Way to Happiness
So what can we do with this information? Because self-control is so critical for happiness, it would seem that in-depth planning for your financial life is an important component to happiness. If you have adequate information about your financial situation and can use that information to formulate a road map for where you want to go, then you are likely to have greater autonomy, or control, and therefore may have a greater potential to be happier.Good planning is not merely “financial” planning. This is true because money alone does not make a person happier. Rather, solid planning is built on a basis of solid discovery. That is, to formulate a plan that may truly improve your life, you must first discover those key goals and issues that really motivate you, and then compare your existing financial situation against these goals to see how prepared you are to meet those goals. Once you've uncovered what is most important to you, you can begin to formulate a plan that really makes sense and that can potentially lead you to greater happiness.This kind of planning can't be done on a website or with software. It requires soul-searching and possibly some help from professionals who know how to ask the right questions and interpret the answers. But the reward for doing it the right way just might be a greater degree of happiness!
Ready, Set, Plan
Put in more tangible terms, we strongly recommend planning that proceeds in the following steps. Note that the first four steps aren't really planning at all, but rather discovery steps that are necessary before any meaningful planning can take place:Identify your key goals and issues. Make them specific and start with the nonfinancial ones. One author identified seven factors that included things like family and personal relationships, meaningful work, friends, and values as being key drivers of happiness. Think of those kinds of goals first. What might retirement look like to you? Will you be the kind of person who will always have to work — not for the money but to keep you from going crazy? If maintaining community and personal relationships is important to you, do you really need that second house? Let personal, values-based decisions drive the financial ones. Complete your own personal balance sheet. Having a personal and  detailed balance sheet lets you see at a glance what your total financial picture looks like, including assets that you might not otherwise consider, like life insurance and real estate.Identify your risk sensitivity. We've now endured the Great Recession and we know viscerally how that feels. In light of that experience, what is your emotional reaction to risk? This is less about how a financial professional might describe it and more about your reaction to it.Assemble a list of your estate planning documents.Begin the planning process with all this information at hand. Only after you've assembled all the information just described should you start the planning process.

Don't let your focus on building and preserving wealth negatively impact your family relationships and personal health.

If you're in your prime earning years, your focus is likely on building the wealth you will need to live well in retirement. Americans are living longer and health care costs are rising. Investing enough money to provide sufficient income to sustain your current lifestyle can help pave the way for a more secure retirement. But too much focus on meeting future income needs can be stressful particularly when you are in your 30s, 40s and 50s and may be facing many family commitments. How do you find a balance?Start by realizing that it's normal to feel a nerve-wracking pull between enjoying your life today and accumulating sufficient wealth to cover all your expenses in retirement. “Thinking about how much income you will need in retirement can be very daunting,” says Tracie McMillion, CFA, Head of Global Asset Allocation at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.For most people, prime working years are also prime family years — the time when children are growing up and older family members may begin to need medical care. Having a single-minded focus on wealth-building at the expense of family priorities can cause major stress, which can even impact your health. More than just an annoyance, chronic stress raises the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, depression, anxiety disorder, and other illnesses.Burying your head in the sand isn't the answer, either. “People tend to focus more on the present than the future,” says Margie E. Lachman, Ph.D., professor of psychology and director of the Lifespan Initiative on Healthy Aging and Lifespan Lab at Brandeis University.While it can be fun to live in the moment, the secret to building wealth without damaging your health lies in taking a balanced approach. Here are six ways to find a work-life balance that allows you to enjoy today while saving for tomorrow.
1) Don't wait
If you don’t think that you will be able to meet your income needs in retirement, don't waste time beating yourself up about it. Meet with your financial team now to take immediate action. You may want to consider whether you are accumulating wealth in the most tax-efficient accounts and also revisit your regular expenditures. Having a clear plan in place can help you increase opportunities available to you when you retire.
2) Rethink retirement income
When interest rates are high, many retired investors look to bond portfolios for income. But with sustained low interest rates, those accumulating wealth for retirement as well as those already in retirement may need to consider other avenues to generate their income.“Sometimes, fear of risk makes people too conservative with retirement savings. They don't want to lose what they've worked so hard for,” McMillion says. “But you do want to get a good return on your money.&rdquo Because people are living longer in retirement, you may want to keep exposure to equities and other growth investments even as you get closer to retirement. A portfolio that relies solely on fixed income may not be able to keep up with inflation. “Talk to your investment specialist to determine which strategies align with your specific needs,” offers McMillion.
3) Involve your family
Take advantage of opportunities to talk with your family about finances. When your children are young, it can help to explain why it's so important for you to save for the future and that sometimes short-term sacrifices are necessary to make that happen. Understanding the family's financial realities may help lower everyone's stress levels when you occasionally have to make the choice to skip a Little League game or gymnastics meet in order to put in some extra hours at work. By having regular conversations about budgeting and investing, your children will be well informed as they mature and more prepared for their own financial futures.
4) Take care of your health
Neglecting self-care not only interferes with your quality of life but can also make your post-retirement health care costs skyrocket. Protect your health and your nest egg by eating a healthy diet, exercising most days of the week, maintaining a healthy weight, getting regular health checkups, and staying up to date on vaccinations. These things do take time and effort, but they can have big payoffs later in life.
5) Make your money work as hard as you do
Business owners often have their company’s balance sheet top of mind as they build their business. But once the business is passed along, their personal balance sheet will need to be structured to sustain them. As always, diversification and asset placement are key strategies to help plan for growth and income in a portfolio. Your investment professional can help you evaluate your current allocation against your anticipated needs and recommend adjustments to help keep you on track.
6) Think beyond dollars
Investing cash during your prime earning years is important, of course. But it's also essential to plan in a more holistic way as well. “Make investments in the future — not just monetary ones, but also in relationships, health, career, and education,” Lachman says. “They all can pay big dividends in the long run.”Alice Lesch Kelly is a freelance writer based in the Boston area.

Five ways you may want to adjust your retirement plan as people live longer, more active years.

Thanks to medical advances, more people are living longer and with an eye on a healthy lifestyle. That's terrific news for everyone. But a longer, more active life also means rethinking traditional views of your needs for retirement, and that should include a critical look at how your portfolio is put together.It used to be that as individuals and investors got close to and entered retirement, they changed their portfolios to have less exposure to equities and more to fixed income in order to protect what was built over the years. Drew Denning, Retirement Strategist for Wells Fargo Advisors, notes that now, however, you may need retirement income for 30 or more years. And he adds that with an inflation assumption of 3%, your costs will double in 24 years.So how do you help ensure you stay as financially healthy as you are physically fit for all those wonderful years of retirement? Denning outlines five suggestions to rethink the way you invest in retirement.
1) Reconsider your risk
For starters, Denning advises that you revisit your risk tolerance. For those transitioning from working to retirement, this advice is even more important. “The loss of a regular paycheck can cause more aggressive investors to become even more nervous when a market correction occurs. If you cannot either emotionally or financially withstand a market correction without withdrawing from the market, then your portfolio is too risky,” says Denning.This doesn't mean, however, that you should move to 100% bonds. “Keeping a healthy dose of exposure to stocks and/or equities can help a portfolio keep pace with inflation,” he adds.
2) Keep a cash reserve
Most people know the importance of keeping an emergency fund during your working years, but what about when you're drawing down on existing funds? Conventional advice about establishing a cash reserve bears repeating, according to Denning. When a market decline occurs or when you have an emergency expense, your cash reserve can be a resource not only financially but also emotionally. Denning points out that analysis shows that this reserve should cover anywhere from one to three years of essential expenses.
3) Adjust your habits for market conditions
“Consider using adaptable spending if your budget allows,” counsels Denning. “When your portfolio declines in value, reduce your planned withdrawals; and when the market increases, increase your withdrawals or spending.” This approach, he adds, “can dramatically increase the long-term sustainability of your portfolio.”
4) Focus on fixed income
Although it's important to maintain an allocation of stocks, bonds, and cash in your portfolio, pay special attention to your bond allocation, Denning advises. In today's low-interest-rate environment, many analysts are predicting a slow and steady increase in rates during the next five to 10 years. While increasing rates are desirable to retirees, it can also have a negative impact on the value of your bond portfolio.“For instance, if interest rates rise by 1%, a bond portfolio with a 10-year duration will decrease in value by 10%,” Denning says. A possible solution: “I would suggest selecting a bond portfolio with a two-to-three-year duration, where a 1% increase in rates would only result in a 2% to 3% decline in the value of the portfolio.”
5) Build your health care plan
As life spans and the number of years you spend in retirement increase, you likely will be subject to a corresponding increase in health care expenses. According to a 2015 report from HealthView Insights, the average lifetime health care expenses for a 65-year-old healthy couple retiring in 2015 and covered by Medicare parts B, D, and a supplemental insurance policy will be more than $400,000 once out-of-pocket medical expenses are added into the equation.Regarding this somewhat sobering statistic, Denning advises to pay attention to your health and address any medical issues before they have a chance to become major concerns.It's not your parents' retirement — the same strategies that worked for them may not be right for you if you're looking at spending 25 or more active years as a retiree. Taking a thorough look at your investment strategy may help ensure you'll be enjoying every one of those years.
