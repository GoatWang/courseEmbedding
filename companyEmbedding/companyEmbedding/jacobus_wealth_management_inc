Welcome to
Jacobus Wealth Management




A Message 
fromPeter Bach, CPA
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer

As Chairman & CEO of Jacobus Wealth Management (JWM), I wish to personally welcome you to our website.
JWM was established in 1985 by my father-in-law Richard Jacobus, CFA, a 
prominent Milwaukee investor and banker. The firm originated as an 
outgrowth of a single family office assisting several generations of the 
extended Jacobus family. In 1996, JWM incorporated as a private business 
dedicated to serving multiple clients and their extended families.
In 2009, after serving on JWM's Board of Directors since 1998, I made a long-term commitment to the organization and assumed the responsibilities of CEO. I am fortunate to now work side by side with Richard, pursuing and implementing his vision of providing access to the same expertise and dedicated personalized service that has benefited the extended Jacobus family. JWM is solely owned by Richard's immediate family, also ensuring that the well-being and stability of the firm will continue well into the future.

We offer both investment advisory and strategic family management services on either a stand-alone or combined basis. Through managed, selective growth we now serve in excess of 70 clients, many with multiple generations, with over $885 million of assets under investment management and more than $2.5 billion of assets under administration.
Our staff of highly trained, experienced and dedicated professionals is small enough to offer detailed and personalized attention, yet large enough to provide a broad range of services. JWM offers our services to families, individuals, professional athletes, trusts, endowments and foundations.
We pride ourselves on the independence we provide to our clients. We do not sell proprietary investment products and are not part of a commercial bank, investment bank or accounting firm. Our highly disciplined approach and access to outside professional resources provide clients with the highest level of unbiased quality advice and service.
Working with a multi-family office creates continuity and provides numerous opportunities otherwise out of reach to an individual or family. In addition, we work in a collaborative and coordinated manner with your existing advisors, such as investment managers, trustees, tax preparers and estate planning attorneys.
Let us show you how JWM can provide peace of mind and put time back into your life, so that you can pursue your own unique passions, goals, aspirations and personal well-being.

Investment Advisory - Jacobus Wealth Management, Inc.

























































Investment Advisory
                



JWM tailors a personalized, broadly diversified investment program for each client targeted to meet individualized return objectives and risk parameters. As most investors know from their personal investment experience, interpretation of the data in the marketplace adds significant value to investment decision making. Our organization attempts to anticipate future economic, industry and market trends when building portfolios. Client portfolios are constructed using a core-satellite approach with a mix of active and passive investment products.









Wide Range of Investment Solutions
JWM utilizes a broad array of asset classes when building out portfolios. We also have extensive experience in providing access to alternative investments. Typical JWM portfolios include many of the following asset classes:
Income Assets

Traditional – Municipal Bonds, Treasury Bonds, Inflation Protected Bonds, Corporate Bonds, International Bonds & Bank Loans
Non-Traditional – Energy Master Limited Partnerships (MLP’s), Preferred Stocks & Conservative Allocation Funds

Equities

Domestic and International (Developed & Emerging) include a range of styles (Value, Blend, Growth) and market capitalizations (Large, Mid, Small)

Alternative Investments

Alternative investments include real estate, energy, private equity and debt capital, venture capital, hedge funds and ownership of real assets such as commodities
Core Investments – generally include investments with tax efficient cash flow in addition to potential capital gains
Opportunistic Investments – provide potentially higher long-term returns but minimal ongoing cash flow

Independent
We pride ourselves on the independence we provide to clients. We do not sell our own proprietary investment products instead offering an open architecture platform. JWM brings to our clients a proven stable of highly experienced separate account portfolio managers, institutional class mutual funds, closed-end funds, low cost ETF’s and alternative investments.
Seasoned Professionals
Our 7 member Investment Committee brings over 200 years of financial services and investment industry experience and holds a wide variety of industry designations and credentials.
Team Approach
Several JWM team members with diversified skills and backgrounds are assigned to each relationship. We strive to work in a collaborative manner with other investment managers a client may have.
Aligned with Client Interests
Our owners and management use the same disciplined approach and select from the same investment products as our clients when investing their own holdings. Further, as a fee-only investment advisor, our success is directly aligned with our clients’ success.
Best-of-Class Manager Relationships
Due to our size, JWM is able to negotiate significantly reduced product fees and access at levels below typical firm minimums. All cost savings are passed on to our clients.
Reporting
We have the capability of providing consolidated reporting that can include both managed and non-managed accounts. Clients benefit from having a better understanding of their overall asset allocation. Further, client specific customized benchmarks are created to help measure overall investment performance of their consolidated program.
Custody & Trading
All assets are segregated and held at highly regarded independent custodians, providing full transparency to clients.
