Richard T. Farmer - Wikipedia





















 






Richard T. Farmer

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Richard "Dick" Farmer is an American businessman whose fortune is self-made through his development of the Cintas Corporation. The company started out as his grandfather's industrial rag-cleaning business.
He worked for his father in the family business, Acme Wiper and Industrial Laundry, through childhood, high school, and college. He received a Bachelor of Arts in Business from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio in 1956.[1] At Miami, he became a member of Delta Tau Delta fraternity. After graduation, he served United States Marines before being honorably discharged,[2] coming on full-time with the family business in 1957.
In 1959, Farmer's father transferred operation of the business to Richard. In 1962, the company name was changed to Acme Uniform & Towel Supply to reflect the uniform rental growth segment. By 1966, Acme annual revenues had grown to $1.8 million.[3]
In 1968 Farmer created a new company, Satellite Corp., to provide a centralized distribution system and to develop smaller uniform plants in major U.S. cities. In 1973, Satellite acquired Acme and became known as Cintas. The company became publicly traded on the NASDAQ stock exchange in 1983.[4]
He turned Mason, Ohio-based Cintas from a negative net worth of $34,000 into a Fortune 500 company with annual sales of $3.8 billion. Today Cintas works with over 800,000 other clients.[5]
Cintas is not only the nation's leading corporate uniform provider, but beginning in 1996 it greatly diversified and currently manufactures and implements corporate identity uniform programs and provides entrance mats, restroom supplies, promotional products, first aid and safety products, fire protection services and document management services.[6]
Farmer served as Cintas Corporation's CEO from 1968 to August 1, 1995. He served as Chairman from 1968 until his retirement on October 20, 2009, when he assumed the role of Chairman Emeritus and remained on the board of directors.[7]
He has served as a member and chair of the board of directors at Miami University. At Miami, the Farmer School of Business is named for him after Farmer and his wife, Joyce (Barnes) Farmer (whom he married in 1957), provided the cornerstone gift to the school of business in 1992..[8] The Farmer School of Business consistently ranks as one of the best in the U.S.. In 2013, it was ranked 22nd overall and eighth among undergraduate business programs at U.S. public universities, according to BusinessWeek.[9]
In 2005, they announced a $30 million leadership gift through the Farmer Family Foundation, of which $25 million helped underwrite the construction of Farmer Hall and $5 million was earmarked for faculty support.[10]
Farmer was the 15th largest fundraiser for the 2000 election of George W. Bush and has raised hundreds of millions of dollars for the Republican Party [1]. Farmer has also authored a book, "Rags to Riches."[11]
Farmer is a former director for Fifth Third Bancorp, the Lindner Center for Research & Education, Bethesda Inc., Safety-Kleen Corp., Bowne Inc., Home Federal Savings & Loan Association, Midwest Income Investment Company and Eagle Picher Industries Inc.[12]
Farmer was honored as Ernst & Young’s Entrepreneur of the Year in 1995. He was inducted into the Greater Cincinnati Business Hall of Fame in 1996. In 2010, Farmer was honored by the Cincinnati USA Regional Chamber as one of the Great Living Cincinnatians.[13]

FT. WORTH, Texas, Nov. 30, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Farmer Bros. Co. (NASDAQ:   FARM, the "Company" or "Farmer Bros.") a national coffee roaster, wholesaler and distributor of coffee, tea and culinary products, today announced that Richard Farmer, PhD, a member of the founding Farmer family, provided the Company with a letter he sent to Farmer Bros. employees in support of the Company's Board of Directors.  








The full text of the letter follows:
November 28, 2016
Dear Farmer Bros. Co. Employees,
You may have heard or read about the recent activities of Carol Farmer Waite and the group she has formed to oppose Farmer Bros. Co.'s nominees for reelection to the Board of Directors at the Company's upcoming 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
This group does not represent all members of the Farmer family, nor does this group represent the views of most of the trusts for which Carol claims to speak. As a member of the Farmer family, as well as a longtime Farmer Bros. stockholder and co-trustee of numerous Farmer family trusts, I fully support the Company's Board of Directors and management team.  
I believe that Mike Keown, the rest of the management team, and Farmer Bros. Co. employees are working together to execute the right strategy to position Farmer Bros. to compete and grow the business over the long term while honoring the guiding principles established by my grandfather and upheld by my father. In my own personal experience, the Board and management team have shown their willingness to engage in a dialogue with stockholders, and I believe they are committed to acting in the best interests of Farmer Bros. and all of the Company's stockholders and employees.  
I also recognize and appreciate the significant improvements to the business that the current leadership team has already made. Since Mike Keown became CEO, the Company's stock price has nearly tripled in value, creating approximately $400 million in value for stockholders, including you as participants in the Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP). This is a testament to the hard work and dedication throughout the Company; from the Board of Directors, management team, and all employees.
The future of Farmer Bros. and the value of your ESOP shares depend on the management team's continued execution of the Company's proven turnaround plan under the leadership of a Board that I believe is highly engaged and independent.  
I look forward to supporting the Company's Board nominees at the Company's upcoming 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
Sincerely,
Richard F. Farmer
The Farmer Bros. Co. Board and management team appreciate the support of Richard Farmer and remain committed to acting in the best interests of the Company and delivering value to all stockholders.

Description

                    Although cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is the most widely practiced evidence-based clinical approach in mental health today, CBT is a broad term that encompasses a wide array of approaches and techniques that can be difficult for even experienced clinicians to navigate.  In this fully updated edition, the authors provide a detailed, step-by-step guide to behavioral interventions in CBT. They discuss case formulation and treatment planning, core behavioral intervention strategies, and innovative approaches such as acceptance, mindfulness, and a behavioral approach to cognition. They look at key behavioral techniques, such as self-monitoring, behavioral activations, exposure therapy, and skills training, that are essential features of CBT practice. The behavioral framework they describe is practical and accessible to clinicians and students with varying degrees of behavioral training.  Alongside a comprehensive update of the research literature, this edition features new chapters on enhancing interpersonal effectiveness, emotion regulation, and navigating particularly difficult therapeutic challenges.show more

                            This book offers a step-by-step guide to behavioral interventions in cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). The authors discuss case formulation and treatment planning, core behavioral intervention strategies, and innovative approaches such as acceptance, mindfulness, and a behavioral approach to cognition. They examine key behavioral techniques including self-monitoring, behavioral activations, exposure therapy, and skills training, that are essential features of CBT practice. This practical behavioral framework is accessible to clinicians and students with varying degrees of behavioral training. Alongside a comprehensive update of the research literature, this edition features new chapters on enhancing interpersonal effectiveness, emotion regulation, and navigating difficult therapeutic challenges.show more
