New Generation
To accelerate business insights from all their data, IT managers are adopting a new generation of technologies such as Apache Spark, noSQL databases and containers. But traditional IT server configurations, hypervisor environments and storage silos do not work well for these modern approaches because they are not optimized for distributed computing. IBM Spectrum Conductor with Spark meets this challenge with software defined infrastructure technology that is designed for distributed environments and enables organizations to deploy Apache Spark efficiently and effectively, supporting multiple versions and instances of Spark and a broad set of born-in-the-cloud application frameworks.
