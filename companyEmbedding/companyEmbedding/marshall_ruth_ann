Ruth can work equally well under her own initiative or as part of a team and we would have no hesitation in using her creative, design and interiors expertise on future projects.
Ken Taylor, Project Manager - Insite Development Ltd. London



Ruth is very professional, completely trustworthy and reliable and I really enjoyed working with her.  Attention to detail and her ideas were an inspiration and at the same time she had the ability to take onboard our thoughts..
Mrs K. Powell, Blakenhall Park



When we moved back into the barn the whole place looked amazing but again it took a visit from Ruth to add the final touches such as the odd cushion, throw, strategically placed ornament or pot plant to make it a home ready to be featured in any home interiors magazine.
Mrs L Graff



Ruth is a pleasure to work with.
Mrs J. Burton

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/24/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
