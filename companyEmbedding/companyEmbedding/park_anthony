Product Description

Four people go to the park, and through their eyes we see four different stories about what took place there. There’s the bossy woman, the sad man, the lonely boy – and the young girl whose warmth touches them all. As the story moves from one voice to another, their perspectives are reflected in the shifting landscapes and seasons.

Author/Illustrator


Anthony Browne


Anthony grew up in a village called Hipperholme, in Yorkshire. He loved art and would spend hours drawing with his beloved father. He says of his father, “He was an unusual man – outwardly strong and confident, but also shy and sensitive – a bit like the gorillas I love to illustrate now. As well as drawing, he encouraged me to play a lot of sports, such as rugby and soccer and cricket. I was small for my age and I used to go to a fairly tough school – if I hadn’t been good at sports, I would probably have been bullied.”
After he left school, Anthony studied graphic design and then went on to paint the insides of people’s bodies for medical textbooks. He found this fascinating, but after three years found that the work was becoming repetitive (“if you’ve seen one stomach operation, you’ve seen ‘em all!”) and instead began designing greetings cards. This in turn led him to illustrating children’s books – his book Gorilla began life as a picture on a birthday card. Anthony lives in Kent and has two grown-up children.
Gorillas feature in many of Anthony’s books. He says, “I am fascinated by them and the contrast they represent – their huge strength and gentleness. They’re thought of as being very fierce creatures and they’re not.” Anthony’s illustrations also reveal his love of the Surrealist painters, whose pictures often depict strange, dreamlike scenes (look out for all the disguised bananas hidden in Anthony’s books!). When Anthony first has an idea for a picture book, he says, “it’s a strange combination of story and images. Deciding what will be illustrated on the pages of a book is like deciding on the scenes of a film.” Anthony has won many prizes for his work, including the Kate Greenaway Medal (twice) and the Kurt Maschler Award (three times). In 2000, he received the highest international honour for illustration, the Hans Christian Andersen Award, for his services to children’s literature – the first British illustrator to win the prize since 1956.
Anthony  was also Children’s Laureate from 2009-2011.

“It’s amazing! Literally, from the basement of my original Marc Anthony Salon came a line of professional hair products so renowned that they can now be found internationally. Marc Anthony products began because we wanted to ensure that all of our clients kept their salon-fresh look wherever they went. Our products are ultimately tailored to our clients’ needs. From curly hair products to create curly hair styles and frizz control, to hair thickening products to create high volume and hold, we have the right product for Your Hair, Your Way.”
“For a cut to sit well, hair has to be in great shape. Hair needs to move, be manageable and have shine to look amazing. That’s why Marc Anthony products have the highest caliber ingredients.”


“On top of working with some of the topmost chemists, our largest point of difference is how we test the products. Our salons are where each product passes or fails. Our International Team of celebrity hair stylists put each product through its paces. We stand behind our brands because we use them in our salons each and every day. That’s the Marc Anthony True Professional difference.”

- Marc Anthony

        Dry Shampoo Products from Marc Anthony
Whether you pushed the "snooze" button one too many times on your alarm and slept in or are hurrying to save time in the locker room or before a night out, dry shampoo is your solution!  Often times, when beating the clock, shampooing hair in the traditional method is just not an option.  A dry shampoo and the ease of use is a great suitable alternative solution.  Modern, busy women swear by dry shampoos!  When your hair appears greasy, it’s usually just the roots (close to the scalp) that need to be refreshed.  Dry shampoos work wonders at reviving your day-old style, soaking up oil, masking odours and amping up volume—no water required.  If you’re strapped for time and don’t have time to wash your hair and you need to freshen up your locks dry shampoo serves as a fantastic solution.

Next, apply our "Moisture Gloss" to small sections of your hair to smooth your curls, tame frizz, and give shape and shine.  Lastly, scrunch your hair while following-up with our ‘Pro Finish’ Hair Spray for all day hold.

 Four different voices tell their own versions of the same walk in the park. The radically different perspectives give a fascinating depth to this simple story which explores many of the author's key themes, such as alienation, friendship and the bizarre amid the mundane. Anthony Browne's world-renowned artwork is full of expressive gorillas, vibrant colours and numerous nods to Magritte and other artists, while being uniquely Browne's own style.

Amazon Review
Four people go to the park, and through their eyes  we see four different stories about what took place there.  There's the bossy woman, the sad man, the lonely boy and  the young girl whose warmth touches them all. As the story  moves from one voice to another, their perspectives are  reflected in the shifting landscapes and seasons.  As with so many of Anthony Browne's works, this is an  intriguing, many layered, hugely entertaining book which  can be read again and again, and which will appeal to  adults and children alike.Voices in the Park  revisits a previous book by Anthony Browne, A Walk in  the Park, written 20 years ago, but now sadly out of  print. (Age 4 to 8) --Philippa Reece

Review
"Highly original talent . . . Browne's picures of the city streets and the park are a joy to look at . . . Anthony Browne first editions are likely to become collector's items" (Daily Telegraph)"An instant classic" (Financial Times)"The haunting Voices in the Park by Anthony Browne turns a simple tale and a visually stunning series of surreal pictures . . . into a many-layered odyssey . . . this book will last a long time" (The Times)"A genuinely thought-provoking read, and, as usual with Anthony Browne's work, the illustrations, with their surreal references draw the reader in" (Sunday Telegraph)

  I absolutely love this book.  Both the pictures and the words are superb.  The more often that you read it, the more you see in it.  It is wonderful for a child, as they can get more from it, as they mature.  I am old, so I came upon it by chance during a course at the Open University, and I am now buying it for family children.

Massapequa Park companies of all kinds come to ANTHONY J WISZOWATY with their business insurance and risk management needs. That’s why we’ve partnered with Nationwide. Maybe you’re looking for a specific product offering like general liability or commercial property. Maybe you’re looking for a business owner’s policy customized to eliminate any lingering coverage gaps.

Versatile insurance solutions are available for local companies that operate in major industries as well as small businesses in niche markets.
