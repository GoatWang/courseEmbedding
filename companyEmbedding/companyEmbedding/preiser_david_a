Preiser, Stanley E., passed away in his home Thursday, December 17, 2009 of complications from chronic congestive heart failure. Preiser was one of the last great lawyers who could litigate cases of all types, from major criminal defense to civil matters involving product liability, medical negligence, and various commercial aspects. He had received most every accolade available to a trial lawyer, including the top awards for accomplishments from the Southern Trial Lawyers Association, the West Virginia Trial Lawyers Association, and the Melvin Belli International Law Society. Most recently, Preiser was inducted into the American Trial Lawyer Hall of Fame, joining the ranks of Johnny Cochran, Justice Thurgood Marshall, and the legendary Clarence Darrow. Other lawyers often referred to Stanley Preiser as the best. He successfully defended then sitting West Virginia Governor Arch Moore on extortion charges in 1976, represented Dee Caperton in 1989 in her divorce case from then sitting Governor Gaston Caperton, and obtained many of the largest civil verdicts of their kind. He was known for his courtroom charisma, his love of teaching other lawyers, and his penchant for always being prepared. Preiser called his profession the search for justice for all mankind. Asked what his father loved most about law, Monty Preiser, also an attorney, said, "He loved the ability to protect those who could not protect themselves." Preiser was born in Charleston, WV, did his undergraduate work at the Universities of Virginia and Chicago, earned a law degree from the University of Louisville, and a Master's from New York University. He began practicing law in the early 1950's in West Virginia, but ultimately appeared in court in over 25 states. University of Miami law graduate William Druckman, who worked with Preiser for about ten years, called the experience a privilege, and indescribable. "He was one of the giants in the legal field across the country, not just in West Virginia," said Druckman, who added that many of the country's top lawyers received some training from Preiser. Besides son Monty and Monty's wife Sara; Stanley Preiser also is survived by his wife of 61 years Joyce; daughter Terri Preiser of Boca Raton; granddaughter Blair Preiser, a lawyer in Pittsburgh; and grandson Justin Preiser, a magazine publisher in Napa, CA. Rabbi Victor Urecki of Charleston, WV, officiating. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to Ruth Rales Jewish Family Services of S. Palm Beach County, 21300 Ruth and Baron Coleman Blvd., Boca Raton, FL 33428. Services will be held 1 p.m. Monday, December 21, 2009 at Gutterman Warheit Memorial Chapel, 7240 North Federal Highway, Boca Raton. For further information, Toll Free 800-992-9262.
