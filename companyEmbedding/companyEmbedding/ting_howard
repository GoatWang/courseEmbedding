Larry Ponemon will reveal research about the risks, fears, and exposures in data governance and security that enterprises have experienced and that will impede the broad deployment of collaboration platforms such as Microsoft SharePoint without an effective policy management and control framework.
The findings were gathered from a survey of over 900 IT professionals who are currently using SharePoint in their organizations to enable collaboration and share information with remote employees, customers, and partners. Learn about the significant risks posed by the proliferation of SharePoint sites and learn about ways to manage these risks.
Key findings to be addressed:

Use of SharePoint is increasing rapidly across all segments of the market
A large percentage of an organization's sensitive or confidential information is available through the SharePoint platform
The perceived risk of users inappropriately accessing restricted information is high
Companies are frustrated by the lack of tools available to properly secure SharePoint sites
Companies do not have the visibility they require to address their compliance and auditing mandates


Attendees will also hear from Avanade regarding best practices for securing the sensitive content in their SharePoint sites and learn about Cisco's policy management solution for SharePoint.

Zscaler Appoints Howard Ting As Chief Marketing Officer

                Former Nutanix CMO Brings Track Record for Building Industry Leading Brands to Propel Zscaler’s Leadership in Secure Cloud Transformation               






















































San Jose, California, June 20, 2017Zscaler, Inc., the leading cloud security company, today announced the appointment of Howard Ting as its new chief marketing officer. In this role, Ting will apply more than 20 years of marketing and product experience to accelerate the company’s growth and strengthen its leadership position in driving secure IT transformation in the enterprise. 
“Howard’s track record of building world-class brands speaks to his ability to define and position transformative technologies,” said Jay Chaudhry, founder and CEO of Zscaler. “As users and applications move off the corporate network, companies must fundamentally shift their strategy to protect users in an environment they no longer control. Zscaler plays an integral role in this transformation, and Howard’s deep understanding of cloud security and network infrastructure will help accelerate our growth and extend our leadership.”
Ting joins the Zscaler™ team from Nutanix, where he played an essential role in scaling the business from initial sales to approximately $1 billion in annualized billings in just over four years. During his tenure, Ting built and led the marketing organization and was also responsible for product management, investor relations, and talent acquisition at various points. Prior to Nutanix, he held leadership positions at Palo Alto Networks, overseeing the demand generation and associated functions, which spurred the company’s accelerated growth. He has also held product management and marketing roles at Securent, Microsoft, and RSA Security. Ting holds a bachelor’s degree from the University of California, Berkeley.
“Zscaler might be one of Silicon Valley’s best kept secrets, with a cloud security platform that helps leading Global 2000 organizations securely transform their network to enable cloud adoption and user mobility,” said Ting. “After being in the cockpit of two high-growth companies in the past decade, I am thrilled to join a company with the technology platform and market opportunity that Zscaler has and look forward to contributing to the next phase of growth.”
