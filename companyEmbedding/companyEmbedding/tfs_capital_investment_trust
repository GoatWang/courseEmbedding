		About TFS Capital		

Home
Firm Overview
Firm Leadership
Guiding Principles
Investment Philosophy
TFS In The News
Press Releases

 

 Our Edge
We believe there are many factors that give us a competitive advantage over other managers. TFS utilizes a team approach, which we believe greatly reduces the chance of irrational decision-making and limits dependence on a single individual. We also have a stated principle to limit growth because we believe that managing a smaller pool of capital generally permits more attractive investment opportunities.
We believe that our innovative quantitative techniques expedite our evaluation of securities, which allows us to make faster adjustments to the portfolios being managed. Finally, our portfolio managers do not have traditional “Wall Street” backgrounds, which we believe helps us to avoid overused analysis methods that may be losing their utility.

Investment Philosophy
Avoid the Status Quo
TFS has found that the best opportunities exist where others do not think to look. As such, the firm seeks to employ creative portfolio managers with non-traditional backgrounds in an effort to avoid the pitfalls of relying on pre-conceived notions about what factors drive the securities markets.
Ignore the Style Boxes
TFS believes the best results are generated when a portfolio manager is given greater freedom in regard to the securities that may be chosen. As such, with many of our products, we do not allow ourselves to be confined to a single style, sector or market capitalization range. Rather, TFS considers a broad universe of securities and selects positions based upon a detailed bottom-up analysis.
Use an Academic Approach to Strategy Research
TFS manages funds using its own proprietary investment strategies that are developed by an experienced team of portfolio managers. Similar to academic research, a candidate strategy must be supported by a solid foundation of qualitative research and must also, through trading simulations, empirically demonstrate an ability to produce positive abnormal return.
Perform Rigorous Quantitative Analysis
TFS gains an edge through its exhaustive quantitative analysis of potential investment strategies. Upon developing a potential investment strategy, TFS will perform a trading simulation of the strategy using actual historical data for the securities used. Through the simulation, TFS is able to quantify whether or not certain factors have historically been predictive of security price movement.
Embrace Technology
With the abundance of information that is available on the markets today, it is critical to leverage the power of information technology for trade-execution and ongoing research and development. As such, we are committed to incorporating technology in all aspects of our portfolio management process. For example, trades are executed using electronic routing technologies that are designed to obtain favorable executions. In addition, we use sophisticated optimization and analysis software, along with proprietary computer programming, to evaluate strategies and monitor risk.
Strategically Manage Risk
When managing investment funds, our first consideration is capital preservation because we believe it is the most significant factor in generating enhanced long-term performance. Our entire portfolio management process is directed by a team of managers, thereby reducing dependence on a single manager and facilitating rational decision-making. This team establishes parameters for strategy implementation that are designed to mitigate exposure to certain risks. Parameters are then monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure that certain thresholds are not compromised.

 Our Mission
To manage superior investment products that improve client portfolios while establishing ethical and fiduciary standards that promote the positive evolution of the portfolio management industry through fair competition and by mitigating conflicts of interest.

Guiding Principles
Create Valuable Products
TFS will only launch and manage funds that we believe add value to investment portfolios. TFS does not create products based on potential asset flow. Instead, we would manage only products that we think are valuable – ones we would put our own money into and would want our friends and family members to invest in as well.
Align Interests With Investors
TFS is a firm believer in the benefit of its owners and portfolio managers investing in the funds that the firm manages since it provides the clearest indication that our interest is directly aligned with that of our investors. Each portfolio manager has a meaningful allocation to all of our TFS products.
Build Trust Through Integrity and Higher Fiduciary Standards
Customer trust is the most critical element to the success of our business and, consequently, we embrace the fiduciary responsibility we have to our clients. This philosophy is apparent in all aspects of the organization where TFS seeks to be an industry leader by setting standards that are more stringent than required by law. For example, the mutual funds managed by TFS adopted a policy of maintaining a majority of independent board members before this practice became an industry standard. As another example, TFS greatly restricts personal trading by employees and requires that any employee trades are pre-cleared by the firm’s Chief Compliance Officer.
Educate Through Clear Disclosures and Fee Transparency
In an industry wrought with hidden agendas and poor disclosure, TFS has nothing to hide. Our disclosure documents are written to facilitate client understanding because we believe the key to building a long-term relationship is to establish a good product fit from the start. The funds managed by TFS do not charge any type of sales loads. TFS discourages these fees and believes that they are a threat to the interests of investors and also inhibit progress in the fund industry by allowing inferior products to survive. In addition, TFS does not participate in soft-dollar arrangements with brokerage firms. Although these arrangements are legal and accepted by many of our competitors, TFS believes they do not allow investors to fully understand the costs of owning a mutual fund. Lastly, TFS seeks best execution on behalf of its fund clients.
Invest Heavily in Research & Development
Given the increasingly competitive landscape in the financial services industry, TFS knows that ongoing research and development is critical to our continued success. TFS will continue to invest heavily each year in ongoing strategy research.

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.

Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.
