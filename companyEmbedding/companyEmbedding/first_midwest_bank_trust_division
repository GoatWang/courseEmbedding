  Trust and Estate PlanningTrusts can be a very sensible way to obtain professional investment management with a minimum of risk, tax exposure and day-to-day worry. A Trust is simply the means by which you assign legal title to, and fiduciary responsibility for, the disposition of your financial assets to another person or entity. That entity, usually a Trust services provider such as First Midwest Wealth Management1, is obligated to carry out these activities according to your wishes.Fiduciary Services  Financial Planning For more information about Trust and Estate Planning, contact a First Midwest Wealth Management Officer today.1Wealth Management is offered through First Midwest Bank.

Consensus Ratings for Mueller Industries (NYSE:MLI) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A
