Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

                  Reviews/Endorsements
                









 
















These chapters are rooted in a World Council of Churches conference of Historic Peace Churches in Asia that took place in Solo, Indonesia. There, as part of the WCC's Decade to Overcome Violence, Asian Christians engaged interfaith diversity, violence, and radical pluralism in Asia.  
 
This volume presents another strong contribution to the ongoing search for a credible and faithful Christian presence in the midst of religious pluralism, in face of religious radicalism and the violence of poverty.
 
July 2011






Among recent publications on peace and justice, this book stands out as a "must read." Informative, provocative, and inspiring, From Nonresistance to Justice helps to ensure that church-centered conversations on the gospel of peace will continue to move forward in a lively and relevant way.
- John D. Roth, director of the Mennonite Historical Library, Goshen College
 
I fell in love with Anabaptist Vision thiry years ago but always wondered to what extent it still applies today. The beauty of the words recorded here and the significance of the issues convince m that the vision has not dimmed and that the Spirit is still working abundantly in our midst.
- Nancy Murphy, professor of Christian philosophy, Fuller Theological Seminary
