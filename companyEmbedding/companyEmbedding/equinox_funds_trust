About Equinox Funds

At Equinox Funds, we are pioneers in developing investor-friendly alternatives, such as the first multi-strategy managed futures mutual fund. We started with managed futures because we believe they are the single most powerful diversifier for a portfolio of stocks and bonds. But we’ve also moved into other alternative assets such as hedged equities, which can potentially help reduce risk and enhance the returns of an overall portfolio over time.
With a deep research culture, our mission is to bring the potential benefits of alternatives to institutions and individuals by offering diverse investment strategies that can help meet the unique goals of each investor, including:  
Commodity Pools
Multi-Strategy Mutual Funds
Single-Strategy Mutual Funds
Specialized Institutional Solutions
In addition to our alternative investment offerings, specific services for institutions, family groups, trusts, charitable foundations and pension funds are provided through the Equinox Institutional Asset Management division. Equinox Institutional is an investment advisor that specializes in the construction, implementation and monitoring of multi-manager portfolios as well as the evaluation of traditional equity and fixed income strategies within an overall portfolio construction framework.
Averaging 20 years of hedge fund and managed futures investing experience, the Equinox Institutional portfolio management team has deep research capabilities and a strong track record managing large, multi-strategy portfolios across the entire spectrum of liquid alternatives, including:
Managed futures
Equity long-short
Arbitrage
Sector specific
Emerging managers
Customized institutional mandates
Research and Development
Our research and development group, Equinox Financial Solutions, is responsible for the design and customization of innovative products and solutions that seek to meet the needs of leading financial institutions across the globe.  The team’s broad research capabilities, industry connectivity and product development expertise facilitate the structuring of highly-customized products that attempt to meet bespoke needs that cannot be met through standard investment vehicles.  Led by John E. Pallat III, co-founder of Equinox Funds, our research and development team has been involved in the design of Equinox’s mutual funds and other offerings including but not limited to:
Structured products
UCITS
Commodity Pools
Unit Investment Trusts

PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS. THERE IS RISK OF LOSS. YOU CAN LOSE MONEY IN A MANAGED FUTURES PROGRAM.
*For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a funds’ monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.
Morningstar Rating is for the I share class only; other classes may have different performance characteristics.

	estimate and any suggestions for reducing the burden to the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW,
