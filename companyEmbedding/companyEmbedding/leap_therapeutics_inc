					Full Description



Leap Therapeutics, Inc., formerly HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, Inc., is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company. The Company engages in acquiring and developing therapeutics in cancer biology. Leap's programs are monoclonal antibodies that target key cellular pathways that enable cancer to grow and spread and specific mechanisms that activate the body's immune system to identify and attack cancer. The Company's lead product candidates for use in clinical trials include TRX518 and DKN-01. DKN-01 is a monoclonal antibody targeting Dickkopf-related protein 1 (DKK1). DKK1 serves as the inhibitors of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway and modulates the non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways. When DKN-01 binds to DKK1, Wnt signaling pathways and the tumor microenvironment are altered, and an anti-tumor effect can be generated. The Company is testing DKN-01 in ongoing clinical trials in patients with esophageal cancer in combination with paclitaxel and in patients with cholangiocarcinoma in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin. The Company has studied DKN-01 as a monotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). DKN-01-based therapies have generated responses and clinical benefit in these patient populations.DKN-01 has potential as a targeted cancer treatment in other tumor types, such as pancreatic, gastric, liver, head and neck, uterine, and prostate cancers and multiple myeloma. DKN-01 has been tested as a monotherapy in patients with NSCLC and in a pilot study in patients with multiple myeloma in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone. TRX518 is a monoclonal antibody targeting the glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor-related receptor (GITR), a receptor found on the surface of a range of immune cells. TRX518 has been engineered to enhance the immune system's anti-tumor response by activating GITR signaling, or GITR agonism, to activate tumor fighting white blood cells, or T effector cells, and decrease the activity of potentially tumor-protective white blood cells, or T regulatory cells, without causing the immune cells to be destroyed. The Company is conducting two clinical trials of TRX518 in patients with advanced solid tumors and have evidence of biomarker modulation and clinical activity.The Company competes with Novartis AG, Merck & Co., Pfizer, Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, AstraZeneca PLC, Agenus Inc. and Incyte Corporation.

					Full Description



Leap Therapeutics, Inc., formerly HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, Inc., is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company. The Company engages in acquiring and developing therapeutics in cancer biology. Leap's programs are monoclonal antibodies that target key cellular pathways that enable cancer to grow and spread and specific mechanisms that activate the body's immune system to identify and attack cancer. The Company's lead product candidates for use in clinical trials include TRX518 and DKN-01. DKN-01 is a monoclonal antibody targeting Dickkopf-related protein 1 (DKK1). DKK1 serves as the inhibitors of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway and modulates the non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways. When DKN-01 binds to DKK1, Wnt signaling pathways and the tumor microenvironment are altered, and an anti-tumor effect can be generated. The Company is testing DKN-01 in ongoing clinical trials in patients with esophageal cancer in combination with paclitaxel and in patients with cholangiocarcinoma in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin. The Company has studied DKN-01 as a monotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). DKN-01-based therapies have generated responses and clinical benefit in these patient populations.DKN-01 has potential as a targeted cancer treatment in other tumor types, such as pancreatic, gastric, liver, head and neck, uterine, and prostate cancers and multiple myeloma. DKN-01 has been tested as a monotherapy in patients with NSCLC and in a pilot study in patients with multiple myeloma in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone. TRX518 is a monoclonal antibody targeting the glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor-related receptor (GITR), a receptor found on the surface of a range of immune cells. TRX518 has been engineered to enhance the immune system's anti-tumor response by activating GITR signaling, or GITR agonism, to activate tumor fighting white blood cells, or T effector cells, and decrease the activity of potentially tumor-protective white blood cells, or T regulatory cells, without causing the immune cells to be destroyed. The Company is conducting two clinical trials of TRX518 in patients with advanced solid tumors and have evidence of biomarker modulation and clinical activity.The Company competes with Novartis AG, Merck & Co., Pfizer, Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, AstraZeneca PLC, Agenus Inc. and Incyte Corporation.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., June  26, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leap Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq:LPTX), a biotechnology company developing targeted and immuno-oncology therapeutics, today announced that it was added to the Russell Microcap® Index when the Russell Investment Group reconstituted its family of U.S. indexes effective today, June 26, 2017. Membership in the Russell Microcap Index, which remains in place for one year, means automatic inclusion in the appropriate growth and value style indexes. FTSE Russell determines membership for its Russell indices primarily by objective, market-capitalization rankings and style attributes. About Leap TherapeuticsLeap Therapeutics’ (NASDAQ:LPTX) most advanced clinical candidate, DKN-01, is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) protein. DKN-01 is in clinical trials in patients with gastroesophageal cancer, alone and in combination with paclitaxel, and in patients with biliary tract cancer, in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin. An investigator-initiated study of DKN-01 will be conducted in hepatocellular carcinoma patients, in combination with sorafenib.  DKN-01 has demonstrated single agent activity in non-small cell lung cancer patients. Leap’s second clinical candidate, TRX518, is a novel, humanized GITR agonist monoclonal antibody designed to enhance the immune system’s anti-tumor response that is in two monotherapy studies.  For more information about Leap Therapeutics, visit http://www.leaptx.com or our public filings with the SEC that are available via EDGAR at http://www.sec.gov or via http://www.investors.leaptx.com/. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include statements relating to Leap’s expectations with respect to the development and advancement of DKN-01, TRX518, and other programs, including the initiation, timing and design of future studies, enrollment in future studies, business development, and other future expectations, plans and prospects. Leap has attempted to identify forward looking statements by such terminology as ‘‘believes,’’ ‘‘estimates,’’ ‘‘anticipates,’’ ‘‘expects,’’ ‘‘plans,’’ ‘‘projects,’’ ‘‘intends,’’ ‘‘may,’’ ‘‘could,’’ ‘‘might,’’ ‘‘will,’’ ‘‘should,’’ or other words that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes to identify these forward-looking statements. Although Leap believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date made, forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the outcome, cost, and timing of our product development activities and clinical trials; the uncertain clinical development process, including the risk that clinical trials may not have an effective design or generate positive results; our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval of our drug product candidates; our plans to research, develop, and commercialize our drug product candidates; our ability to achieve market acceptance of our drug product candidates; unanticipated costs or delays in research, development, and commercialization efforts; the applicability of clinical study results to actual outcomes; the size and growth potential of the markets for our drug product candidates; the accuracy of our estimates regarding expenses, future revenues, capital requirements and needs for financing; our ability to continue obtaining and maintaining intellectual property protection for our drug product candidates; and other risks. Detailed information regarding factors that may cause actual results to differ materially will be included in Leap Therapeutics’ periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including Leap Therapeutics’ Form 10-K that Leap filed with the SEC on March 31, 2017. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors. Any forward looking statements contained in this release speak only as of its date. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this release to reflect events or circumstances occurring after its date or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.
