Grenfell Tower fire: Cladding company stops all global sales of product to high-rise blocks

Fire caused devastating casualties as it swept through entire building in half an hour

        Cladding and insulation material at Grenfell failed fire safety tests carried out after the disaster Reuters 




The firm which supplied the panels used in the cladding of Grenfell Tower has stopped global sales for high rise blocks.
US company Arconic said on Monday afternoon it would discontinue sales amid growing concern about the safety of its cladding panels following the fire which killed at least 79 people.
The statement said, “Arconic is discontinuing global sales of Reynobond PE for use in high-rise applications.

Why we need an inquest into what happened at Grenfell Tower


“We believe this is the right decision because of the inconsistency of building codes across the world and issues that have arisen in the wake of the Grenfell Tower tragedy regarding code compliance of cladding systems in the context of buildings’ overall designs.”
The Government confirmed that 60 high-rise buildings in 25 local authority areas failed fire cladding safety tests.
The Reynobond PE panels used in the cladding of Grenfell was the cheaper option out of three – including panels with a fire resistant core, suitable for buildings up to 30 metres, and panels with a non-combustible core, for buildings above that height, as detailed in the company's leaflet.
Arconic, known as Alcoa Inc until 2016, told Reuters that it knew the panels would be used for the high-rise in Kensington, but it was not responsible for deciding what was compliant or not compliant with local building regulations.
Grenfell Tower was more than 60 metres tall.

“When conceiving a building, it is crucial to choose the adapted products in order to avoid the fire to spread to the whole building. Especially when it comes to facades and roofs, the fire can spread extremely rapidly,” the brochure said.
“As soon as the building is higher than the fire fighters’ ladders, it has to be conceived with an incombustible material.”
The announcement to discontinue sales comes after Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond said the Reynobond PE panels were banned for use in high rise buildings in the UK, as well as in Europe and the US.
Omnis Exteriors, the company that cut the Arconic tiles to shape and supplied them to the cladding contractor, said the Reynobond PE panels could be used for high rise buildings as long as the insulation material behind the panels were non-combustible.
The cladding and the insulation material failed fire safety tests after the tragedy.

On Friday evening, around 4,000 people were evacuated from high-rise buildings in Camden after the council had tested the cladding and found it to be unsafe.
Nicholas Holgate, former chief executive of Kensington and Chelsea council, was forced to resign following backlash to the council's response to the fire.
The Prime Minister has requested councils carry out swift action regarding safety tests on buildings.

In Croydon, the most populous London borough, the council will start implementing sprinklers in all residential tower blocks of 10 storeys or more in September.
An inquest has been opened into the deaths of some of the victims, including a five-year-old boy.
Emergency workers warned last week that the death toll was likely to rise over the coming weeks and that some victims would never be identified, due to the intensity of the blaze.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

5 Anti-Drone Products on the Rise
Posted By: Jason Reaganon: June 29, 2016
Although the drones have proven to be beneficial in the consumer, public and private sectors, a few inerrant drones causing mischief has spawned a growing anti-drone industry. A recent study predicts the emerging market will grow to a billion-dollar industry within six years with a predicted compound annual growth rate of 23.89 percent across 2017-22.
Recently, five new anti-drone products have emerged and are creating some unfriendly skies for unauthorized drones.
Drone Dome
An Israeli tech firm wants to create a virtual dome to keep out drones. Rafael Advanced Defense Systems offers Drone Dome – a system billed as a “new end-to-end defense solution designed to detect, identify, track, and neutralize drones.” Drone Dome is essentially a radar/radio jamming system providing defense for strategic targets in a radius of up to 3 km. The system can jam the signal of large drones on down to micro/nano drones, which the company says can be used by terrorists. Under the hood, Drone Dome sports a RPS-42 radar, MEOS electro-optical observation mechanism, and a C-Guard RD wide spectrum signal jammer.
DroneShield
DroneShield uses acoustic technology to detect incoming drones from up to 150 yards and sends e-mails or text messages to a monitoring service. Formerly based in Herndon, Va., the start-up was recently acquired by an Australian venture-capital group. Prisons have started using the product to stop drones from delivering contraband such as cell phones of drugs to prisoners. DroneShield proved that it could also operate in a noisier, less stable environment when it deployed detectors at the2015 and 2016 Boston Marathon. The entire marathon route had been declared a “no-drone zone” by city officials.








AUDS/Pathfinder
The FAA recently partnered with the Anti-UAV Defense System (AUDS) – a team of British anti-drone companies that includes Blighter Surveillance Systems, Chess Dynamics and Enterprise Control Systems. AUDs will join with American company Liteye Systems as “the world’s first fully integrated detect-track-disrupt-defeat” drone defense system. The partnership is one piece of the FAA’s Pathfinder Initiative which is designed, the agency says, to address three areas of national drone integration – “visual line-of-sight operations in urban areas, extended visual line-of-sight operations in rural areas [and] beyond visual line-of-sight in rural/isolated areas.”
Cyber-Rifle
A visit to West Point by the U.S. Secretary of Defense is not a rare occurrence. However, watching the nation’s top defense official zap a drone with a state-of-the-art, anti-drone rifle is not an everyday event.
But that’s the scene that greeted cadets and dignitaries in March as Secretary Ashton Carter took out a Parrot quadcopter with the U.S. Army’s newest innovation – a drone-killing rifle that can be built for about $150 in parts. Soldiers first unveiled the aptly named “cyber-rifle” in October — a weapon that resembles a standard, Army-issue M4/16 rifle. Designed by the Army Cyber Institute, the rifle emits a radio signal that can command a UAV to power down – resulting in the inevitable plummet to terra firma. Following the rifle’s successful test, the Defense Department posted a video of the demo to its Twitter account.
SkyWall
A British engineering firm’s new anti-drone system is practically ripped from the pages of a James Bond script. In March, OpenWorks Engineering demonstrated SkyWall (a truly Bond-esque name) at a UK Home Office security conference. According to an OpenWorks press release, the solution is a simple concept — it “physically captures a drone in a net and brings it to the ground safely under a parachute.” The device resembles a missile launcher and can deploy an “intelligent projectile with on-board countermeasures” up to 100 meters. After the launcher’s targeting AI calculates a drone’s trajectory, the launched projectile hunts down the errant drone, apprehending it with an on-board net/parachute apparatus.
