HomeWATCH: The Property Brothers on Girlfriends, Using Magic to Get Dates and Pole Dancing
By Mackenzie SchmidtPosted on October 12, 2016 at 11:44am EDT 
ShareTweetEmail 





 




Jonathan and Drew Scott got NSF-HGTV on Chelsea Handler’s Netflix talk show on Wednesday.
The twin stars of the wildly popular series Property Brothers (and no fewer than four current spin-offs) are known for their playful on-screen antics and their legion of adoring fans. But the duo’s appearance on Chelsea, where they were promoting the latest season of their original series, which premiers October 12, and their book, veered into some risqué territory they don’t often broach on more wholesome programming.
Drew sets the tone introducing them as “twins who do tight jeaned renovations in slow motion.” And things only escalate from there: “Have you ever thought about being with twins and [Ken] Boner [sic]?” asks Jonathan, referencing Handler’s earlier segment about the breakout star of the second presidential debate, Kenneth Bone. The latter, at one point, even climbs into the host’s lap.

The Scotts also talk about their much-hypothesized-about relationships — yes, they’re both in one — sharing that Drew has been with his girlfriend for six years, and Jonathan has “just started seeing someone. Her name is Jacinta,” he says.
The pair met at a charity event but parted ways without exchanging contact information. “I went back to try and . . . see if somebody knows who she is and she was like a ghost. Nobody knew who she was,” Jonathan details.
The pair, who have now been together six months, reconnected after, he says, “a friend of mine posted a picture and she was in the background.”
Before finding love, however, Jonathan in particular admits he struggled in the romance department. “I literally learned everything I could try to do to get a date, and it did not work when I was younger,” he says. “I heard people love musicians so I took up the bagpipes.” The one act that did draw the female attention he was hoping for? Magic.
“He was the jock,” Jonathan says of Drew. “So we’d be at a party and he’d be like ‘you’re not going to talk to anybody.’ And I would have this swarm of girls around me because I was doing magic. And he’d be like dribbling a basketball in the corner and masturbating.”

Previously, their most deviant televised moment was likely Jonathan performing in an all-male review as punishment for losing a challenge on Brother vs. Brother.

Drew and Jonathan Scott are coming to you in a new show — this time from behind the lens.
The 39-year-old twins and their production company, Scott Brothers Entertainment, are releasing the first series they’ve created that doesn’t star the massively popular siblings. Set to premiere June 19th on Discovery Family, Reno, Set Go! follows hosts Cheryl Torrenueva and Roger Morin as they secretly renovate homes for people in need.
“Reno, Set, Go! is a terrific show with a ton of heart and something the family can enjoy together,” Jonathan tells PEOPLE.

The siblings behind Property Brothers are far more than just home improvement gurus. For starters, one-half of the wildly popular HGTV series is gearing up to wed longtime girlfriend Linda Phan, an endeavor Drew Scott told E! News hasn't been easy to plan."It's tough," Drew shared. "Let me tell you, we're on a plane every two days, whether we're flying somewhere for an appearance or QVC or for our product line or filming. We're filming three shows in different cities. It's tough, but Linda and I are excited."The lovebirds are looking forward to hosting a destination wedding for their family and friends, and the pressure to please is most definitely on. Drew continued, "I'm losing sleep some nights because we really want to get through all the details. I'm hoping that all of our fans and the network will understand if I need to take a week of personal time to get married."

  A post shared by Linda Phan (@_lindaphan) on Feb 22, 2017 at 4:18pm PST

And while HGTV fanatics might not receive a wedding invitation to Drew and Linda's nuptials, they can expect to catch the newlyweds renovating their first home together thanks to the Property Brothers spin-off series, Property Brothers at Home: Drew's Honeymoon House. The program is slated to debut in November 2017, and will also feature Drew's identical twin brother, Jonathan Scott.

We also spoke to Jonathan, who couldn't help but weigh in on the internet freaking out over the duo's third brother, who became an overnight sensation earlier this year."It was so funny," Jonathan dished, "We're like, 'But J.D.'s been on our shows for the last six years!' There was one article that said, ‘Just found: The reason why the property brothers have been hiding their other brother.'"Drew then teased, "I think it's hilarious. We do keep him in a closet underneath the stairs and only feed him pizza because it fits under the door, but other than that..." before his bro chimed in, "I mean you can't have the better looking brother out in public."LOL!

All jokes aside, Jonathan and Scott are currently gearing up for the premiere of yet another spin-off, which will feature fellow HGTV stars judging the pair's ability to flip homes in a competition-style reality series."Jonathan and I love flipping homes," Drew explained. "We've been renovating and flipping houses since the '90s. For Brother vs. Brother that's taken us back to our roots... [It] shows our true colors and sibling rivalry. And the best part is that in the end, once we sell the houses and we're all done, whoever nets more profit wins, so then all the profits from both houses goes directly to Rebuilding Together, directly to charity and back into the community."


Brother vs. Brother: Jonathan vs. Drew premieres Wednesday, May 31, at 9 p.m. ET/PT.

Wall Removed in Clean Bright Kitchen


The removal of walls has allowed for more space between the new island and the other side of the kitchen, giving the family the space to all be in the kitchen together. Brand new counter tops brighten up the space and give it a clean feel.

Updated Island


By knocking down one wall, Drew and Jonathan Scott were able to create a light, open atmosphere in this once cramped kitchen. A new island with a built-in sink and dishwasher is the perfect centerpiece, combining style and function.

Clear Sightline in First Floor


Jonathan and Drew removed the walls that closed off the Horsman house and have made the space open and inviting. Now, there is a clear sightline from the kitchen through the living room, allowing the Horsmans to keep an eye on their kids from anywhere on the first floor.

Light and Welcoming Living Room


Drew and Jonathan wanted to create a bright, open living room space. Light flows into the space from the huge window at the end of the room, while the light wall colors and neutral furniture help to reflect that light. Soft color can be found throughout the space in the accessories on the wall, furniture and tables.

Open Concept Kitchen with Breakfast Nook


After opening up and including the old family room area into kitchen, the new kitchen is almost twice as large as most other homes in the neighborhood. New paint, light colored custom cabinetry, a fireplace, stainless steel appliances, and a contemporary layout with large center island and breakfast nook make this new kitchen the central hub of the home.

Mature Modern Sitting Area


Hezekiyah and Nyahsa wanted a mature space to entertain friends, so Drew and Jonathan designed a contemporary space for the couple. By lightening up the wall shade, they were able to brighten the space, making it seem larger. Then, they brought in new, modern furniture that provides plenty of seating for a small gathering. The modern end table and lamp help to brighten up the space as the metallic water bar at the end of the space reflects light back into the rest of the room. Pillows and artwork adorn the space to add splashes of color.

Defined Seating Area in Mature Space


Hezekiyah and Nyahsa's living room was dark and mismatched with different colored earth tone walls and large, dark furniture. Lightening the wall color and creating a defined seating area creates a mature and appealing living space.

Modern Grown-Up Living Room


Cameron and Krystal wanted a grown up space to entertain their friends and family, so Drew and Jonathan brought in some modern furniture and updated the details of their outdated home. The neutral colors of the walls sofa, and chairs are complimented by natural elements around the doors and windows.

Small Bedroom from Converted Walk-In Closet


Noam and Ella needed more space in their home, so Drew and Jonathan turned the spacious master closet into a welcoming second bedroom. With plenty of natural light coming in through the large window and even more light emanating from the light fixture above, the space feels much larger than it is, and is very bright and inviting. The brothers used the daybed to draw the eye, with bright, luscious pillows and smart artwork above. The floating shelves and clock to the right help to break up the space and make it more personalized.

A devoted widowed father of five, David needs to downsize to a smaller home so he can afford to pay for college tuition.

Alisha and her contractor husband bought a sprawling fixer-upper they planned to transform into their dream home.

Drew and Jonathan step in with a creative plan to make the most of her limited budget. In order to get top dollar for Alisha's place, Jonathan undertakes an ambitious ten-day makeover that stalls when demolishing a stone accent wall proves tougher than expected.

It was just the two of them when Rob and Julie moved in to their cozy home in a lakeside community. But two kids and a decade later, they're desperate for more space. The couple tried their hand at home improvement over the years, but their poor design choices ended up lowering the value of their home and now it's holding them back. Drew and Jonathan step in with a design plan to transform the tired property into a showpiece, and to make the couple's dream of a beautiful move-in ready home a reality. The budget immediately takes a hit when Jonathan uncovers a costly fix during the kitchen demo. Meanwhile, it's up to Drew to find a luxurious suburban home in the couple's exclusive waterfront neighborhood.

It's been six years since his wife passed away, and Ken and his daughter Kimberly are now ready to move on. Their sprawling home on a one-acre yard holds a lot of great memories. It's time to finish up the stalled renovations, sell the home for top dollar, and start fresh. Ideally, the sale of the property will provide money for Ken's retirement, Kimberly's education, and their new family home. And while Jonathan gets busy with his knockout design plan, Drew is determined to find the father and daughter duo a low-maintenance property with two separate living areas. The only problem is they don't necessarily agree on what it is they're looking for.

Laura was an artist living in the big city until she married Ken and settled down in the suburbs.

Jonathan vows to finish the partially renovated kitchen and modernize the outdated interiors, but runs into a potentially hazardous structural problem along the way. Meanwhile, Drew's hurdle is finding a downtown home that satisfies the couple's suburban wish list.

Feeling the squeeze in their tiny place, Pearl and Folkert are ready to move out of their starter home. They've been saving for years and can finally afford a major upgrade. But the move depends on selling their current home for top dollar. And unless they spruce up the property's lackluster interiors, they won't be going anywhere. Jonathan comes up with a solution for the home's tricky layout and turns a forgettable fireplace into a functional focal point. Concerned about the home's location right next to a school, Drew reassures the couple there's a buyer for every house. And then the search is on for a picture-perfect four-bedroom home with plenty of room for grandma and the kids.

Pastor Chris and Jennifer's house may be big enough for the average family, but their family is anything but average. With nine children, three bedrooms, a home classroom and just one bathroom, space is at a premium.

Later, Jonathan tackles an ambitious kitchen and bathroom overhaul, and gets the kids working on a surprise for Mom and Dad.

We've watched Drew Scott renovate properties, transform rooms and turn ordinary houses into something extraordinary.But is there any chance that fans of the HGTV star could see his wedding on TV? Never say never!"I don't know. We get proposed everything all the time. I think one of the reasons why our brand has grown is because we never close any opportunity," Drew shared during Monday's all-new episode of Daily Pop. "We are open to anything and then we sort of move forward from there."He continued, "What Linda and I know is that we haven't set our date yet but we know we want to do destinations so we're trying to search for destinations."Back in December, E! News confirmed that HGTV's Property Brothers star proposed to his longtime girlfriend Linda Phan in Toronto.

Since then, the couple has tried their best to balance wedding planning and filming their new spinoff. Titled Property Brothers at Home: Drew's Honeymoon House, the series is set to debut in November."Don't pressure him. It took him seven years to propose," Jonathan Scott joked to E! News' Catt Sadler, Justin Sylvester and Carissa Culiner. "He needs breathing room."Drew later joked, "If I wait another seven years to marry her, I would be kicked to the curb."


All jokes aside, both HGTV stars have their plates full as their careers continue soaring to new heights. But don't worry, viewers. Wedding bells are ringing and Drew doesn't mind the sounds one bit."Let me tell you, we're on a plane every two days, whether we're flying somewhere for an appearance or QVC or for our product line or filming. We're filming three shows in different cities. It's tough, but Linda and I are excited," Drew previously shared with us. "I'm losing sleep some nights because we really want to get through all the details."He added, "I'm hoping that all of our fans and the network will understand if I need to take a week of personal time to get married."To hear more from Drew and Jonathan Scott, watch E! News tonight at 7 p.m. and 11 p.m.And for even more celebrity interviews and pop culture discussions, tune into Daily Pop weekdays at 12 p.m. only on E!

Mini Bio (1)


          Andrew Alfred Scott, better known as Drew Scott, is an entrepreneur and entertainer. He is a well-known television personality, co-hosting HGTV's popular series Property Brothers (2011), along with his identical twin brother Jonathan Silver Scott. Property Brothers, which blends Drew's passions for real estate investment and TV production, focuses on helping families get into their dream homes without breaking their budget. As one of HGTV's highest-rated shows, it has several spin-off series, including Property Brothers at Home (2014), Property Brothers at Home on the Ranch, Buying and Selling (2012) and Brother vs. Brother (2013).Much like his brother Jonathan, Drew began acting in theater, improv and sketch comedy at a young age. His earlier television appearances have included roles on Smallville (2001), Breaker High (1997) and Madison (1993). Drew developed an interest in directing and producing while in high school, and to avoid being a struggling actor/director, he began investing in real estate as a means for funding their own productions. In 2004, after years of growing his successful real estate company, Drew decided to once again focus more energy on acting, directing and producing. As a young, driven filmmaker, Drew became heavily involved producing independent film. Drew and Jonathan founded their own production company that later evolved into Scott Brothers Entertainment, a multifaceted media entity creating scripted and unscripted productions. Over the years Drew has also produced film and TV events such as the Leo Film & TV Awards and the Producers Ball. Founded by Drew and Jonathan in 2011, the Producers Ball is an annual gala held during the Toronto International Film Festival. This highly exclusive gala honors the best of film, television and digital producers.Since Drew and Jonathan were approached with the television show concept for Property Brothers in 2009, the resounding success quickly led to multiple spin-offs, three of which are produced by their own Scott Brothers Entertainment: Brother vs Brother, Property Brothers at Home and Property Brothers at Home on the Ranch. The powerhouse producers continue to expand their reach behind the camera by producing multi-genre programming for numerous networks, starring other talent.In addition to both serving as Scott Brothers Entertainment's co-founder and executive producers, Drew and Jonathan showcased their longtime passion for music by releasing two country music songs on iTunes, "Hold On" and "Let The Night Shine In," in 2015. Their first book, Dream Home: The Property Brothers' Ultimate Guide To Finding And Fixing Your Perfect House, released April 4, 2016 and debuted on the New York Times Best-Seller List and Wall Street Journal Best-Seller List. The brothers have also expanded their furniture and decor line, Scott Living, into one of the largest and most recognized brands in the home space.Another passion for Drew is philanthropy. From working with the Children's Hospitals to coordinating initiatives to help underprivileged youth, he demonstrates the importance of giving back. Over the past few years, Drew has been collaborating with the network of artists involved in Paul Haggis Artists for Peace and Justice (APJ), a non-profit organization that supports communities in Haiti through programs in education and health. Drew has had the honor of helping raise millions of dollars and global awareness for APJ's efforts.

Personal Quotes (4)

      On his family: We are very close. And very supportive of each other. This industry can be very trying on relationships, friends and family. Choosing this career and traveling this path would have been a lot harder if I didn't have such great support from them.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
