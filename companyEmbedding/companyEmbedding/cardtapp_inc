Rates Disclosure


Interest rates and APRs are based on current market rates, are for informational purposes only, are subject
      to change without notice and may be subject to pricing add-ons related to property type, loan amount,
      loan-to-value, credit score and other variables - call for details. This is not a credit decision or a
      commitment to lend.  Mortgage insurance may be required. If mortgage insurance is required, the mortgage
      insurance premium could increase the APR and the monthly mortgage payment. Additional loan programs may be
      available. APR (annual percentage rate) reflects the effective cost of your loan on a yearly basis, taking
      into account such items as interest, most closing costs, discount points (also referred to as "points"), and
      loan-origination fees. One point is 1% of the mortgage amount (e.g., $1,000 on a $100,000 loan). Your
      monthly payment is not based on APR, but instead on the interest rate on your Note. Adjustable Rate Mortgage
      (ARM) rates assume no increase in the financial index after the initial fixed period. ARM rates and monthly
      payments are subject to increase after the fixed period.
Rates and APRs also assume owner occupied Single family residences with an 80 loan-to-value (20% Down
      payment).  Discount point have varied and can be found on www.freddiemac.com.  These mortgage averages are
      for loans in 1st Lien Position.  The historical Freddie Mac PMMS® data is provided "as is," with no
      warranties of any kind, express or implied, including, but not limited to, warranties of accuracy or implied
      warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. Use of the data is at the user's sole
      risk. In no event will the advertiser on this app or Freddie Mac be liable for any damages arising out of or
      related to the data, including, but not limited to direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or
      punitive damages, whether under a contract, tort, or any other theory of liability, even if Freddie Mac is

    Trevarrow, Inc. began in 1928 as a construction contracting company. In 1950, Trevarrow Plumbing and Hardware opened in Pleasant Ridge, Michigan, and this retail establishment is now located in Troy, Michigan. The Kitchen and Bath Division was opened by Larry Trevarrow in 1959. As a retail store, this division provided kitchen designs, cabinetry and appliances to the public. Within just a few years it grew into a wholesale distribution firm when the Jenn-Air Corporation awarded the first distributor contract in Michigan to Trevarrow in 1965. By 1972, the retail kitchen store was closed to provide the opportunity to build new accounts focusing exclusively on distributing appliances to retail kitchen and appliance dealers. With the addition of many new US and European product lines, Trevarrow, Inc. continued to grow through two different locations in Troy and expanded into the current corporate office and warehouse facility in Auburn Hills in 1987. In 1989, the corporation purchased a distributorship in Cleveland, expanding the sales territory to also include Ohio. In 2001 Sub-Zero Freezer Co., one of our top lines brought to the industry the Wolf cooking line. Wolf has a long history in the restaurant industry and Sub-Zero has not only made Wolf available for residential use but also expanded the line to include built-in ovens, modules, cooktops, warming drawers and microwaves. We were proud to welcome to our portfolio of product in 2002 Asko dishwashers and laundry.

In 2003, our company's 75th year, we were pleased to open our newly remodeled "Gallery of Culinary Art", with eleven beautiful professionally designed kitchens, with styles ranging from French Country and Mission, to Japanese Contemporary and more!

This fabulous facility has allowed us to expand our culinary and product trainings with our four live kitchens and our state-of-the-art 85-person culinary training auditorium.

2006 proved to be a stellar year of growth for Trevarrow, Inc. as we were proud to unveil our new Living Kitchen Showroom in Parma, Ohio. This premier facility features 6 beatifully appointed kitchens, including 3 live kitchens and a culinary training auditorium. 

It is our pleasure to represent the highest quality kitchen equipment manufacturers in the industry. We distribute our products through a network of appliance and kitchen design firms, which specialize in the finest products for the consumer. We hope that you will contact our company for additional information on the products you see here. We offer you product information, design and installation guides, product cooking demonstrations, "Cuisine du Jour" culinary training and after-the-sale technical and in-home service on the products we carry.

Not only was your comment extremely offensive but also inaccurate. Management succeeds at recognizing strengths in their team members and where each individual will fit best. Employees also are able to voice this and express their goals to management, who is then able to consider where people fit best based off of potential and current client-base. Switching titles does not mean "promotion" and more money so do not be so quick to judge our peers based off time at the company and their gender.ConsJust have to be flexible within a startup!Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) CardTapp Response seconds agoEdit • Delete CardTapp 2017-03-23 16:34 PDT Join the CardTapp team See Our Latest Jobs Mar 13, 2017 Helpful (1) CardTapp Logo"Positive Culture is Everything"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - National Account Executive in Bellevue, WACurrent Employee - National Account Executive in Bellevue, WARecommendsPositive OutlookI have been working at CardTapp full-time (More than a year)ProsWorking at CardTapp has been exciting and rewarding, from the daily competitions to free Gym access, everything the management and employees stress revolves around building a positive work culture.
