Angel Investor Directory














172 COMMENTS



















CREDIT: 










Finding the right angel investor could help you get your start-up off the ground. Angel-investor networks are a good place to start looking for funding. These national and local groups of angels meet -- formally or informally -- to discuss deals and learn about the best new business opportunities. Each network works in a slightly different way: Some may charge fees for making presentations and some may charge a fee to apply for consideration. Some even require an official introduction to the group by an angel member while others solicit ideas via the group's Web site.
To help get you started in your search for an angel, we've compiled a list of U.S. angel networks. Because many angel groups limit their investments to a particular geographical area, we've divided the list into eight regions: Pacific Northwest, Southwest, Mid-Atlantic, Northeast, North Central, California, South, and Midwest. There is also a category for those groups that consider investments anywhere in the country.
National Networks
Pacific Northwest
Southwest
Mid-Atlantic

Disclaimer: We strive to update this directory on a regular basis and have tried to ensure that the information contained herein is correct and current. This information is only intended to be a starting point in your search for financing, so please be sure to do your own due diligence before sending your plans, ideas, and/or other personal information to any of the groups listed. Additionally, if you know of a network that should be added to this directory or spot any incorrect information, please email AngelUpdate@inc.com.
NATIONAL NETWORKS

ACE-Net was developed by the U.S. Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy. Only entrepreneurs who can sell security interest in their companies can enroll. There is an annual fee to enroll -- fees vary by state. Maximum fee is $450.
Sweet Spot: Although companies can raise up to $5 million in financing with ACE-Net, the network may be most helpful to companies seeking up to $1 million.
No-Go: Certain businesses cannot list on ACE-Net. These include businesses involved in the oil or gas industries, sole proprietorships, general or limited partnerships, joint ventures, and blank-check or development-stage companies.
