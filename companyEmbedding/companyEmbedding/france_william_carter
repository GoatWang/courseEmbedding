William Carter


William Carter was born in Los Angeles in 1934 and graduated from Stanford University in 1957. Moving to Berkeley, California, he became a professional photographer, writer and editor. Living in New York from 1961–63, Carter worked as an editor for publisher Harper & Row. Based in Beirut, Lebanon 1964-66, he published photographs and articles on subjects such as the Kurds of Iraq in Life, the Sunday Times, Geographical Magazine and others. In 1966-69 he freelanced from London doing assignments for The New York Times, Women’s Wear Daily, and TWA’s Annual Report.[1][2]
Returning to San Francisco in 1969, Carter turned to longer-term projects. He published his first book of text and pictures, Ghost Towns of the West, in 1971 – an in-depth study of the boom-to-bust mining towns preserved in the high-dry climate zones of the American West. His second book, Middle West Country, appeared in 1975 – a poignant historical study of the Midwest from the earliest settlements by European farmers to the present era of mechanized agriculture. In 1991 Carter’s lifelong interest in New Orleans jazz led him to create his third book of text and photographs, Preservation Hall.
Increasingly drawn to classic fine-art photography, in 1996 he published Illuminations, a book of nudes.
Then came Carter’s fifth book, Causes and Spirits: Photographs from Five Decades. Published by Steidl in 2011, this is a photo-appreciation of humanity worldwide.[1][2] Enthusiastic reviews included this passage by Matt Damsker in Photocentral.com:
“William Carter’s half-century career as one of the world’s leading photojournalists has yielded innumerable images, contributing strongly and compassionately to the visual grammar we associate with places as disparate as the American West and Midwest, Europe, the Middle East, and India.” [3]
Having toured nationally and recorded as clarinetist with Turk Murphy’s Jazz Band at age twenty, William Carter remained active as a semi-professional jazz musician into his eighties. From 1990-2015 he served as Chairman of the San Francisco Traditional Jazz Foundation.[4] In 2015 he mounted an exhibition of his jazz and blues photographs, including portraits of Louis Armstrong donated to the Armstrong House and Museum in Queens, New York.
Carter’s decades of travel photography took him throughout the world – Ireland, England, France, Scotland, Italy, Germany, Holland, Spain, India, Tibet, Hong Kong, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Vietnam, Gaza, the West Bank, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Israel, Uzbekistan, Mexico, Canada, Costa Rica. Closer to home, he documented the birth and care of premature babies in the neo-natal department of the Stanford University Hospital.
William Carter’s photographs have been exhibited throughout the U.S. and in Europe. Over 250 of his black and white prints are held in the permanent collection of the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles. A Carter nude was shown in the Getty’s concise 150-year history of that genre in 2007-2008. Four of his Middle Eastern prints were exhibited at the Getty in "Engaged Observers," a major 2010 survey of photojournalism since 1960.[1][2] Four Carter photographs of western Americana were shown at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; another, “Near Jerome, Arizona, 1970” was mounted at that museum’s grand reopening in 2016. His classic nudes were presented in the 1990s at Galerie zur Stockeregg in Zurich, Switzerland – then the leading photography gallery in continental Europe.
Carter was a founding board member of Photo Alliance, San Francisco, in 1996. He served on the board of Humanities West, San Francisco, from 1996-2001, where he produced programs on Jerusalem and New Orleans. And he was a founding member of the Photographs Council at the J. Paul Getty Museum from 2005 until c. 2012.[1][2]

The LSU Agricultural Experiment Station was established in 1885 as a sugar research station funded by the Louisiana Sugar Planters Association. The station’s purpose was "to develop and improve the agricultural interests and resources of Louisiana, especially the cultivation of sugarcane and rice by scientific and agricultural and chemical experiments and to disseminated information connected therewith." With the passage of the federal Hatch Act of 1887, agriculture research at land grant universities established throughout the US. Today, the Louisiana Agricultural Experiment Station serves as the research arm of the LSU AgCenter. It is composed of academic departments and research stations across Louisiana. Scientists at research stations develop new knowledge and technologies to help agricultural producers provide citizens of the state and the nation with a vast array of food, fiber, and fuel. More information about the Louisiana Agricultural Experiment Station can be found here: http://www.lsuagcenter.com/en/administration/about_us/research/
The digitization of the LSU Agricultural Experiment Station bulletins was funded through Project Ceres, a program that supports the ongoing preservation and digitization of collections in the field of agriculture. Project Ceres is a partnership between the United States Agriculture Information Network (USAIN), the Agriculture Network Information Center (AgNIC), and the Center for Research Librares (CRL).

View Recall #00-166b
Girl's Nightshirts Recalled by the William Carter Co.
PRODUCT: Girl's Nightshirts - The William Carter Co. (Carter's), of Morrow, Ga., is voluntarily recalling about 1,000 girl's nightshirts. The recalled nightshirts have long sleeves, and were sold in sizes small (4-5 year), medium (6-7 year), large (8-10 year) and, x-large (12-14 yr). They are made with 100 percent polyester fabric with a pattern of brown bears wearing pink pajamas and the words "p.j. bear" printed on a white background. Identification code "GPU CF79761" and "Carter's" are printed on a label sewn into the collar. Carter's, department and specialty stores sold these pajamas nationwide from May 2000 through August 2000 for between $10 and $13.PROBLEM: The nightshirts, which fail to meet federal children's sleepwear flammability standards, could ignite easily and present a serious risk of burn injuries in violation of the Federal Flammable Fabrics Act.
 
 
INCIDENTS/INJURIES: None reported.WHAT TO DO: Take these nightshirts away from children immediately, and call Carter's toll-free at (888) 339-2129 anytime for instructions on returning the nightshirts for a refund and a $15 Carter's gift certificate. Consumers also can visit the firm's web site at http://www.carters.com/recall.html.



The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is charged with protecting the public from unreasonable risks of injury or death associated with the use of
          thousands of types of consumer products under the agency’s jurisdiction. Deaths, injuries, and property damage from consumer product incidents cost the
          nation more than $1 trillion annually. CPSC is committed to protecting consumers and families from products that pose a fire, electrical, chemical or
          mechanical hazard. CPSC's work to help ensure the safety of consumer products - such as toys, cribs, power tools, cigarette lighters and household
          chemicals -– contributed to a decline in the rate of deaths and injuries associated with consumer products over the past 40 years.
Federal law bars any person from selling products subject to a publicly-announced voluntary recall by a manufacturer or a mandatory recall ordered by the
          Commission.
To report a dangerous product or a product-related injury go online to www.SaferProducts.gov or call CPSC's Hotline at 800-638-2772 or teletypewriter at
          301-595-7054 for the hearing impaired. Consumers can obtain news release and recall information at www.cpsc.gov, on Twitter @USCPSC or by subscribing

About THE WILLIAM CARTER COMPANY

   Carter's has built a big business catering to little ones. Operating through its William Carter Company, it's the largest US branded marketer of apparel exclusively for babies and young children. Primary products include newborn layette clothing, sleepwear, and playwear. It markets its items under the Carter's and OshKosh B'Gosh brands, as well as private labels Child of Mine, Just One You, Genuine Kids, and Precious Firsts. While Carter's sells products online and as a wholesaler via 17,400 department and specialty stores, it also operates some 835 Carter's and OshKosh stores nationwide and almost 150 stores in Canada.
   Operations

   The company operates its business through five segments: Carter's Wholesale, Carter's Retail, OshKosh Retail, OshKosh Wholesale, and International. Following its Bonnie Togs purchase, Carter's realigned its reportable segments to include a new international segment to house its Canadian operations, existing international wholesale business, and royalty income from its international licensees.
  

   Under its Carter's brand, it designs, source, and market a broad array of products, primarily for sizes newborn to eight.
  

   Under the OshKosh brand, it designs, source, and market a broad array of young children's apparel, primarily for children in sizes newborn to 12.
  

   Its International segment includes company-operated retail, wholesale, and online operations in addition to royalty income from its international licensees.
  

   In fiscal 2016 (January year end) the company's international sales were 11% of total net sales; retail, 38%; and wholesale, 37%.
  

   That year, the company sold more than 342 million units of Carter's, Child of Mine, Just One You, and Precious Firsts products in the US.
  
Sales and Marketing

   Carter's markets its products through the department stores, national chains, outlet, specialty stores, off-price sales channels. The company sells its products through the wholesale channel, through company-owned retail stores in the US and Canada, and online. It partners with 20 licensees to sell the Carter's and OshKosh brands in 40 countries. Its Carter's brand wholesale customers include major retailers, such as, Costco, JCPenney, Kohl's, Macy's, and Sam's Club. Its OshKosh brand wholesale customers include major retailers, such as Belk, Bon-Ton, Fred Meyer, and Sears.
  

   The company's brands compete in the $20.5 billion children's apparel market for children newborn to age 7. Carter's enjoys the #1 branded position and a 14% market share; OshKosh has a 2% market share. Because the company uses a variety of distribution channels, it's able to market its products to a more diverse range of consumers and geographic regions. Wal-Mart sells its Child of Mine line, while Target offers the Just One You and Precious Firsts brands.
  

   Carter's maintains three distribution centers in US and other international distribution centers in Canada and Asia to support its direct-to-consumer retail operations.
  

   The company allocated $3.9 million for each of the fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014 for advertising costs.
  

   Carter's' marketing is focused on connecting with millennials by strengthening and evolving its digital programs to put its brands in front of the consumer in new and innovative way.
  

   In fiscal 2016, the company implemented the Rewarding Moments rewards program to drive customer traffic, sales, and brand loyalty.
  

   Carter's trademarks and copyrights include Genuine Kids, Child of Mine, Just One You, Precious Firsts and Little Layette.
  
Financial Performance

   Net revenues have increased over the last five years. In fiscal 2016 revenues rose by 4% due to sales growth in all segments except OshKosh Wholesale.
  

   Carter's Retail net sales increased by 5.9% as the result of new store openings, e-commerce sales, and an increase in comparable store sales. Carter's Wholesale net sales increased 2.4% driven by a rise in average price per unit and a 0.9% increase in units shipped, primarily driven by increased seasonal product demand, a new playwear initiative, and favorable replenishment trends.
  

   OshKosh Wholesale net sales decreased 10.4%, reflecting a 15.8% decline in units shipped.
  

   In 2016 net income increased by 22% mainly due to higher net and other income of $1.8 million compared to expense of $3.1 million in 2015 relating to contracts settled and unrealized gains.
  

   Operating cash flows increased by 9%.
  
Strategy

   Carter's focuses on refreshing its brand presentation in all channels of distribution; geographic expansion, and strengthening its multi-channel business model. The company's strategy is to drive our brand image as the leader in baby and young children's apparel and to consistently provide high-quality products at a great value to consumers. It also strives to provide wholesale customers with a consistent, high-level of service, including delivering and replenishing products on time to fulfill customer needs. Its retail stores and websites focus on the customer experience through store and website design, visual enhancements, clear product presentation, and experienced customer service.
  

   The company has developed a reputation for producing high-quality clothing for children -- from the cradle through the early school years. The Carter's brand and private-label collections made for mass-market customers offer apparel in newborn through children's size 12. These lines mostly consist of cotton essentials, such as bodysuits and pajamas, and collectively typically account for the bulk of its revenues. Besides apparel, Carter's licenses bedding, toys, furnishings, baby gear, and gifts that are sold through mass merchandisers. The OshKosh brand, acquired in 2005, has extended the company's product range from newborns through children size 12. Known for its rugged playclothes, including overalls and T-shirts, OshKosh items are marketed at higher price points than the company's traditional Carter's branded products. The company is working to boost its revenues further through expansion of its retail and outlet store operations.
  

   In 2013 it opened 21 retail stores in Canada, expanded relationships with its global wholesale partners, and grew its eCommerce business. It also invested more than $180 million in capital expenditures in key areas including new retail stores, the build out of its new multi-channel distribution center in Georgia, the consolidation of operations into a new headquarters in Atlanta, and strengthening its information technology resources. During 2013 the company also opened 65 Carter's stores and 18 OshKosh stores in the US.
  

   The company replicated its US multi-channel business model in Canada, the company's largest international business, including the launch of eCommerce capabilities in 2014. The company is also looking for growth opportunities in China and Brazil, and assessing the full potential of relationships with its international partners representing the company's brands throughout the world.
  
Mergers and Acquisitions

   In 2014 Carter's acquired the exclusive rights to the Carter's brands including trademark registrations in Chile. The company acquired these rights ($3.6 million) in order to freely operate in Chile by offering products and service under the Carter's brand.
  
Company Background

   The company in 2013 acquired worldwide rights to the Carter's Watch the Wear and H.W. Carter & Sons brands (including trademark registrations) for $38 million.
  

   Carter's extended its reach northward into Canada and added an international segment to its business as a result of the company's 2011 $98 million purchase of Bonnie Togs, a Canadian specialty retailer of children's apparel and accessories. Bonnie Togs had been Carter's principal licensee in Canada since 2007.
  

   Carter's was established in 1865 by William Carter.
