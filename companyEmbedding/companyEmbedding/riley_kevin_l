Service and Spares


If you are an owner of a Riley system you will be aware that our equipment is inherently reliable. In addition to this reliability, we aim to respond to any request for spare parts within 24 hours. These two factors combined, result in the very low down time figures experienced by our customers.
After a system has been installed, the list of recommended spares for that system will be issued.  We strongly recommend that a number of key components are held in stock.
We also offer a "System Healthcheck" initially, a number of months after the system is commissioned. The equipment will generally be inspected and tested for functionality / performance.  At this point, our system engineers can review any teething troubles or maintenance queries which your factory personnel may have with the line and propose actions which can be taken to improve line efficiency. Similar checks can then be carried out at periodic intervals, ensuring the system operates at maximum efficiency for many years to come. 
Our existing customers have found this service most worthwhile.
To inquire about parts, please use the form which can be accessed via the button at the top of this page. You may also contact us by phone or fax, details can be found under "contact us".

Kevin Riley
Kevin Riley 51 years old, I live in Glen Spey, NY located in Sullivan County. I have been a New York State Licensed fishing guide #3100 since 1998. I am the Owner/Operater of Reel'Em In Guide Service offering Driftboat fishing and Ice Fishing outings. I have been participating in competitive Ice fishing tournaments since 2005. I have fished the Trap Attack, NAIFC, and Mid-West Open Tournament trails. One of my proudest tournament accomplishments was winning the 2007 North American Ice Fishing Championship on Lake Henry/Agnes in Alexandria MN. I look forward to competing in Knutsons 2015 Mid-West Open(with Dave Young), Champlain Valley Hardwater, and Northeast Panfish League tournament trails this season. My favorite rod is an HT Ice Blue Professional IBP-26 UL Ultralight action rod with 2 # test line. My favorite jig is a HT Marmooska Tungsten Diamond Jig MJDIB-12A tipped with Maki-Plastic or a Wax worm. My Favorite sports team is the New York Yankees My hobbies are collecting Vinyl Records and Vintage Bottles. My passion is talking, teaching, and participating in anything regarding the sport of Icefishing!
