	Forward-Looking Statement


	40


	This slide presentation contains statements that constitute forward-looking statements
	within the meaning of


	the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as
	amended by the Private Securities


	Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  These forward-looking
	statements include, among others, our statements


	regarding (1) strategic initiatives with respect
	to our assets, operations and capital and (2) the assumptions


	underlying our expectations. 
	Prospective investors are cautioned that any such forward-looking statements are


	not
	guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties, and that actual results may differ


	materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements.  A number of important
	factors could


	cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by
	forward-looking statements in this slide


	presentation.  Many of these factors are beyond
	our ability to control or predict.  Factors that could cause actual


	results to differ
	materially from those contemplated in this slide presentation include the factors set forth in our


	filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form10-K,
	quarterly report


	on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.  We believe these
	forward-looking statements are reasonable,


	however, undue reliance should not be placed on
	any forward-looking statements, which are based on current


	expectations.  We do not
	assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new


	information
	or future developments or otherwise.




	Certain of the financial measures appearing in this slide presentation are or may be considered to be
	non-GAAP


	financial measures. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures
	provide additional


	appropriate measures of our operating results.  While we believe these
	non-GAAP financial measures are useful


	in evaluating our company, the information should be
	considered supplemental in nature and not a substitute for


	the information prepared in accordance
	with GAAP.  We have provided for your reference supplemental financial


	disclosure for these
	measures, including the most directly comparable GAAP measure and an associated


	reconciliation in
	our most recent quarter supplemental report, which is available on our website at


	www.dukerealty.com




	.  Our
	most












	recent quarter supplemental report also includes the information necessary to




	recalculate certain operational ratios and ratios of financial position.  The
	calculation of these non-GAAP


	measures may differ from the methodology used by other REITs,
	and therefore, may not be comparable.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

CELEBRATING 45 YEARS OF RELIABILITY
Click the thumbnail images on the timeline to explore Duke Realty’s strong history of reliability and success.

























































1972
1977
1985-1997
1993
1999
2006
2011-2016
2013
2015-2017








1972



With $40,000 in capital and limited knowledge of commercial real estate, John Rosebrough, Phil Duke, and John Wynne embarked on their first industrial development in Park 100 on the northwest side of the city. Over the years, Duke Realty transformed Park 100 into one of the country’s largest industrial parks, eventually encompassing 1,500 acres.




1977



Once Duke Realty was well established in Indianapolis, company leaders decided to expand geographically and began development in Cincinnati. In addition to opening its first satellite office, Duke Realty expanded its development portfolio to include office buildings.




1985-1997



Over the next 20 years, Duke Realty’s presence in the Midwest grew. Offices were opened in Chicago, St. Louis, Nashville, Minneapolis and Columbus, Ohio, with Duke Realty becoming one of the largest developers and property owners in each of these markets.




1993



The company issued an IPO that generated more than $310 million and became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: DRE). Funds generated by the IPO helped improve the company’s balance sheet and put it in an excellent position to raise capital in the future to grow its portfolio.




1999



With a strong business model in place, Duke Realty was ready to expand and acquired a company that was similar in terms of product types and business operations, but geographically diverse. The merger gave Duke Realty an entrance into new and fast-growing markets throughout the southeastern United States and a stronger national presence.




2006



Duke Realty was once again ready to expand geographically and identified strong markets where it wanted a presence. Properties in Houston expanded Duke Realty’s footprint in the West. The company also strengthened its position in the East with an acquisition in Washington D.C. and properties in Savannah, Baltimore and New Jersey near major seaports.




2011-2016



Duke Realty exited the suburban office sector of the business and repositioned its portfolio so that the majority of its net operating income was generated by its industrial portfolio. Duke Realty used proceeds from the sale of its office properties to fund new development and acquisitions of industrial properties and strengthen its balance sheet.




2013



Duke Realty expanded geographically to capitalize on industrial development opportunities near ports and population-dense areas of the country. Through acquisitions and new development, the company established a footprint in Southern California, Pennsylvania and New Jersey.




2015-2017



As part of its growth strategy, Duke Realty continues to focus on the top-tier industrial markets in the United States. The company expanded its portfolios in both Northern and Southern California, as well as New Jersey, Eastern Pennsylvania and South Florida, through the acquisition and development of high-quality, modern warehouse facilities.
