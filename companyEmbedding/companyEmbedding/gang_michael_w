10 MS-13 Gang Members in NY Indicted For Murder Are Illegal Aliens



 

                  By Michael W. Chapman | March 8, 2017 | 4:05 PM EST          





  
  
   

 (AP) Thirteen members of the notorious gang MS-13 were charged on March 2 by the U.S. Attorney's Office, Eastern District of New York, with 41 crimes, including racketeering, seven murders, attempted murders, assaults, arson, and other illegal acts and, according to prosecutors, 10 of the 13 suspects are illegal aliens. "This indictment has 13 defendants and 10 of those defendants are illegal aliens, who are not lawfully in the United States," said U.S. Attorney Robert L. Capers during a March 2 press conference. "Two [of the 13 defendants] are U.S. citizens and one is a green card holder." The murder charges included the killings of 15-year-old Nisa Mickens and 16-year-old Kayla Cuevas in September 2016, and 18-year-old Jose Pena in June 2016. The victims were bludgeoned to death with baseball bats and cut and stabbed with knives and machetes, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.“The brutal murders of Nisa Mickens and Kayla Cuevas, and the savage killing of Jose Pena, allegedly committed by these defendants, exemplify the depravity of a gang whose primary mission is murder,” stated U.S. Attorney Capers.“As the MS-13 continues its efforts to expand and entrench itself in our communities, both by sending gang members to illegally enter the United States from Central America, and by recruiting new members from our schools and neighborhoods, this Office and the FBI’s Long Island Gang Task Force will continue our mission to dismantle the MS-13 and free our neighborhoods from the terror they cause," said Capers. Nisa Mickens, 15, left, and Kayla Cuevas, 16, who were murdered by members of the MS-13 gang.According to the U.S. Attorney's Office, "The MS-13’s leadership is based in El Salvador and Honduras, but the gang has thousands of members across the United States, comprised primarily of immigrants from Central America.  With numerous branches, or 'cliques,' the MS-13 is the largest and most violent street gang on Long Island.  Since 2003, hundreds of MS-13 members, including dozens of clique leaders, have been convicted on federal felony charges in the Eastern District of New York."The defendants named in the indictment -- two are not named because they are minors -- by the U.S. Attorney's Office are as follows: EDWIN AMAYA-SANCHEZ (“Strong”)Age:  29Brentwood, New YorkIllegal alien WILLIAM CASTELLANOS (“Dizzy” and “Satanico”) Age:  20Central Islip, New YorkU.S. citizen SELVIN CHAVEZ (“Flash”)Age:  19Brentwood, New YorkIllegal alien JOHNNY CONTRERAS (“Muerte,” “Reaper” and “Conejo”)Age:  23Brentwood, New YorkU.S. citizen






 GERMAN CRUZ (“Bad Boy”)Age:  18Brentwood, New YorkIllegal alien JONATHAN HERNANDEZ (“Travieso” and “Kraken”)Age:  19Brentwood, New YorkIllegal alien ELMER ALEXANDER LOPEZ (“Smiley,” “Little Smiley” and “Alex”)Age:  19Central Islip, New YorkIllegal alienMS-13 gang members (not among those indicted on March 2 in the Eastern District of New York.)  (AP)  REYNALDO LOPEZ-ALVARADO (“Mente”)Age:  24Brentwood, New YorkIllegal alien ENRIQUE PORTILLO (“Oso” and “Turkey”)Age:  19Brentwood, New YorkIllegal alien ALEXI SAENZ (“Blasty” and “Big Homie”)Age:  22Central Islip, New YorkGreen Card holder JAIRO SAENZ (“Funny”)Age:  19Central Islip, New YorkIllegal alienCommenting on the murder of the two young women, then-President-elect Donald Trump said in December, "They [MS-13] come from Central America. They're tougher than any people you've ever met. They're killing and raping everybody out there. They're illegal. And they are finished."

The Second Chance (Michael W Smith) - DVD
Grammy Award-winning recording artist Michael W. Smith makes his film debut playing Ethan Jenkins, a musician-turned-pastor who's rocking the pulpit and his well-to-do suburban flock. When the church board sends him on sabbatical, Ethan decides to help Second Chance Community Church, an inner-city fellowship. But Pastor Jake resents Ethan's arrival. Can they overcome their prejudices and find common ground?
Ethan Jenkins (Michael W. Smith) and Jake Sanders (introducing Jeff Obafemi Carr) are both passionate pastors who worship the same God from the same book--but that's where the similarity ends. White and well-to-do Ethan is comfortable in his music ministry at the media-savvy suburban mega-church, The Rock; Jake is a street smart African-American who ministers to the gang members, teen mothers, and drug addicts of the urban Second Chance. When they are suddenly thrown together in a tough neighborhood and forced to work side by side, Ethan discovers there is no boundary between the streets and the sanctuary. But can the faith these two men share overcome the prejudices that divide them to give themselves and a struggling urban church a second chance?

Part 8:
Why Gangs Form



Shortcut to the Outline
        of Why Gangs Form







Gangs are a type of 
		support system. 
		They provide all of the resources needed for survival.
(From
		
		Payne, p. 73)
The reason for
      the existence of a subculture must be that, through the solving of
      particular problems by the collective, the individual more efficiently
      survives. That is, the subculture allows the individual to derive
      psychological benefits of recognition and respect. Consequently, the
      member of the subculture gains in self-esteem and in social status. 
(Martin,
      et al., 1990, pp. 246-247) 


Introduction

While reading about why gangs form it is important to remember two
    things. First, as defined in this book, a gang is a group of two or more individuals who have an
    on-going relationship with each other and support one another individually or collectively in
    the recurring commission of delinquent and/or criminal behavior. 
    
Second, as we learned in The
    Structure of Gangs, gangs vary widely in their make up. They may
    consist of as few as two people who exhibit little organization in the gang
    and commit minor delinquent acts or crimes to highly organized crime gangs 
    (organized crime, crime networks, etc.)
    involving scores of members involved in sophisticated international crime.
    
Even minor violations of law are still violations of the law. Truancy
    (unexcused or inexcusable absences from school as a minor) is an example.
    That's why I believe two boys who have an on-going relationship and who support
    one another in continually being truant have the potential for becoming a gang.
    

Gangs are a conscious product of young people
    organizing their lives on the streets. They usually begin as unsupervised
    male or female peer groups within defined urban spaces. Some, but not all,
    evolve into formal organizations with social, economic, or political
    functions, and have older members. Gangs also organize within certain
    institutions, such as prisons and the military, with variable ties to
    outside street gangs or organizations. (Kenneth
    B. Clark Center, no date, page)



Two friends playing hooky may not fit the image most people have of a gang, but
    they have the potential of forming one. Left alone, the behavior of the two boys may turn to
    other violations of law (i.e., loitering, disturbing the peace, being a
    public nuisance, theft, experimenting with drugs) and, were it to do so,
    more people would see them as a gang. 
    

We define group delinquency as law-violating behavior
    committed by juveniles in relatively small peer groups that tend to be
    ephemeral, i.e., loosely organized with shifting leadership. (Curry
    and Spergel, 1997, p. 314-315) 


Perhaps Curry and Spergel (1997)
    would not define two associating truants as a gang, but I think we should be
    concerned about them. It's all a matter of degree, and the
    sooner we recognize what it is that is  potentially developing, the more
    likely we are to "nip the problem in the bud," to use an old
    expression. If the two boys are willing to violate the law and be
    truant, and they
    know what they're doing is illegal, they have an incorrect mind set. They
    need attention and supervision. They need help. Without it, things could get
    worse.
    
Why do gangs form? 


"The
    gang ... becomes a mechanism for surviving deprivation and trauma ..."

    (Donna
    DeCesare, 1999, removed from the Internet by November, 2004)  


[G]angs come into
    existence and flourish because the needs of the young people in a
    neighborhood or culture or family are not being met. The gang, in essence,
    fills the void.
    (Gardner,
    1992, p. 83) 


Why do gangs form? That may be the single most important question to ask concerning the
    gang phenomenon. The answer to it reveals why some youths join gangs
    and, correspondingly, the needs gangs fulfill for youths which are going unmet.
    
The situation in the United States is repeated in other cultures, as I
    witnessed when studying the gang situation in Canada, England, and the
    Netherlands. Nearly everyone I interviewed identified the causes of gang
    formation within a relatively narrow range of possibilities.
    They believed unmet needs drove many youths to join gangs, as did greed and
    fear.
    

The causes of the
    waves of street gang and wanna-be group activity in Vancouver were elusive,
    but the main reasons for involvement with ... gangs and [wanna-be] groups
    were: economic and ethnic marginality; material gain; the attraction of
    supportive peer groups; and flight from abusive family circumstances.  (Gordon,
    2000) 


American psychologist Abraham Maslow (Maslow,
    1970) categorized human
    needs into higher and lower levels. He referred to this as the "hierarchy of
    needs." His is a widely accepted model for understanding the
    biological, psychological, and social needs of human beings. Lower level needs, he believed, must be
    at least adequately satisfied or met before an individual may successfully pursue the higher level
    needs.
The  lower level needs are:






physiological  
 (hunger, thirst,
    shelter, sex, and other bodily needs) and
 safety related  
 (security and protection
    from physical and emotional harm).






The  higher level needs  are: 







    belongingness  
                (affection, belonging, acceptance, and friendship),
 esteem
                 
    (self-respect, autonomy, achievement, status recognition), and

    self-actualization  
 (the drive to fulfill one's potential and self-fulfillment).






According to Maslow, as each lower need is satisfied, the
    next level becomes dominant with self-actualization being the ultimate goal.
    Where a need is absent, movement to
    the next level is impeded. From this point of view, lacking a sense of  security
    (a lower level need) at home or in school, a youth may join with similarly situated youths
    who provide the needed security. Absent a sense of  belonging (a
    higher level need) at home or at school, a youth may
    join with similarly situated youths for
    mutual support, acceptance, and friendship. The same situation
    may develop in order to satisfy the other higher level needs. 




Field
            Note: I asked the principal of
            an alternative middle school why some youths get involved in gangs.
            "Where we're going wrong is that the family is not meeting
            their needs," she replied, "so they go to the gang where they can get them.
            Things like being
accepted and getting support - good times or bad. Families should be
a place where a child can get unconditional love, set goals and parameters of
behavior, be protected. I don't think the kids in gangs are getting those
things from their families. These kids have not experienced success
- and neither have their parents.

            "We [the community] don't support our families. At the
same time, the families need to be self supported - they should not depend on welfare programs and the government.
            We've given them the wheat
instead of showing them how to grow it. Do you know what I mean? Lots of families have been allowed to be weak, that's what I mean.
            And there don't seem to be any family traditions for these kids. Like
            'In our family we do this, or we celebrate
that, or we believe this is right or that is wrong.' That seems to
be missing.

            "We need to teach them process, not just give them food, housing and jobs. Instead
of using a bus to pick up kids and bring them to school, we should use a cattle
prod to poke the kids' parents to get them to bring their kids to school. Actually, I think the problem has gone on too long.
            We
should forget about the parents and just focus on the kids. It's too late
for the parents."   

I remember what a
probation officer told me a couple of months ago about this same thing. She said "We've lost a generation or two.
            It's too late for
them. All we have left is just working with the kids and hoping we
can have a positive impact on them."






 One might ask, How
    do such similarly situated children meet each other? Children who are abused at home or who are tormented at school may,
    because of their behavior, be singled out by school officials for special treatment.
    Placing these children in special classes, tracks, or programs puts them together.
If the behavior these at-risk youths exhibit leads to
    police custody, they are likely to meet in detention centers. Upon release
    these youths are sometimes shunned and, intentionally or not, placed in a situation
    where their only friends may be others who have misbehaved. The beginnings of a gang are not difficult to see in
    these scenarios. A lack of security or sense of belonging at home, however, is not the only reason why gangs
    form.

"The gang is an important social institution for low-income male
    youths and young adults from newcomer and residual populations because it
    often serves social, cultural, and economic functions no longer adequately
    performed by family, school, and the local market." 
(Spergel,
    et al., 1991, preface) 


Why gangs form and why some youths join them are two different questions,
    but their answers are inextricably intertwined. If you read the professional
    literature on gangs you will find the topic "Why youths join gangs"
    discussed far more often than "Why do gangs form?" I prefer to write
    about why gangs form  because I believe removing those factors will
    more effectively reduce
    gang activity in the long run. It puts our focus on the forces which pull or push some
    youths into a gang rather than on the youths themselves.
    
This perspective on why gangs form requires a paradigm shift for those who focus more on the gang
    members than on the reasons why the gang they joined was created in the
    first place. Using the analogy
    of the spigot and the
    spill, I would rather turn off the spigot than spend an eternity trying to
    clean up a never ending spill. 
    
Gangs
    are an adaptive social mechanism for satisfying the needs of some youth
    which are not, or can not be, met through
    traditional and socially acceptable avenues. Gangs form to satisfy
    needs which are going unmet in the families, schools, and neighborhoods in
    which they live or which are perceived of as unavailable to the youths who
    join
    them.
    Moore (1998)
	encapsulates the multi-causal perspective on gangs when he suggests 
	that four community conditions often precede the transition from typical 
	adolescent groupings to established youth gangs.  First, conventional 
	socializing agents, such as families and schools, are largely 
	ineffective and alienating.  Under these conditions, conventional adult 
	supervision is largely absent.  Second, the adolescents must have a great 
	deal of free time that is not consumed by other healthy social 
	development roles.  Third, for the gang to become established, members must 
	have limited access to appealing conventional career lines; that is, 
	good adult jobs.  Finally, the young people must have a place to 
	congregate � such a well-defined neighborhood.

"Gangs are nothing more than a
perversion of what contemporary society is all about - money, power, sex,
consumption, status, leisure, amusement. People who have the
resources have those things. How they get the
resources determines whether we see their behavior as legal or illegal.
The
behavior may be different between gang members and members of a traditional
    businessmen's organization, but the
objective is often the same: strengthening the organization,
generating income, securing new members, honoring outstanding and/or long-time
members, and so on."  (Rosenfield,
    Therapist Interview)

Some researchers have written about the pushes and  pulls of
    gangs. (Reckless
    being the among the first)  That is, there are factors which push youths into gangs
    and
    factors which pull them in. The  pushes are listed in the chart
    below under "Why Gangs Form." The  pulls are listed under
    "What Gangs Offer." For example, economic deprivation
    may push a youth into a gang because the gang offers an opportunity
    for economic gain which the youth could not or would not pursue
    legitimately. That's what is attractive about the gang and thus
    pulls the youth into it.
    

Street gangs are
    an amalgam of racism, of urban underclass poverty, of minority and youth
    culture, of fatalism in the face of rampant deprivation, of political
    insensitivity, and the gross ignorance of inner-city (and inner-town)
    America on the part of most of us who don't have to survive there.
    (Klein,
    1995, p. 234) 


There is no one all-encompassing reason for the formation of
    gangs, although there may be some reasons which are more significant than others
    in their initial impact. The reasons why I believe gangs form, what they offer their members, and
    why some youths join them, are presented in the chart below.
    They seem obvious to me now after three years in the field and after reading
    the findings of many experts on gangs. At least three themes form the backdrop against which the causes of gang
    formation should be understood.
    








Issues raised by Maslow's  hierarchy of needs
            provide a silent but ever present backdrop for understanding several of the explanations.


Excerpts from the literature on gangs often allude 
        to the interaction or relationship between one cause for gang formation 
        and another (e.g., the causes are often intermingled).


The causal role of social
            disorganization (as measured by the weakness of social
            institutions of informal social control - family, school,
            faith institutions) on gang formation lies behind several of the
            explanations.









Rapid
      urban population change, community disintegration, increasing poverty, and
      social isolation contribute to institutional failures and the consequent
      development of youth gangs. The interplay of social disorganization and
      lack of access to legitimate resources, in particular, figure in the
      development of seriously deviant groups.  (Spergel,
      et al., 1994, p. 3) 


The following are the most apparent explanations for the formation of 
    gangs. The explanations are not mutually exclusive and 
    the exact mix of one or more explanations with other explanations may vary over time and from one neighborhood to another. There 
    are a few, however, which regularly appear in
    chronic gang communities. Addressing 
    and removing them would have a major impact upon the gang phenomenon. There 
    are other explanations, not covered here, which suggest that the typical
    sociological and psychological 
    explanations are misleading.
