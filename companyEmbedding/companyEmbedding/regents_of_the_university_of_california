The Regents of the University of California is the governing board of the University of California system.[3] The board has 26 voting members.
The California Constitution grants broad institutional autonomy, with limited exceptions, to the Regents.[4] According to article IX, section 9, "The University shall be entirely independent of all political or sectarian influence and kept free therefrom in the appointment of its regents and in the administration of its affairs."
As with almost all other public university systems nationwide, the board of regents is treated as the real party in interest for all purposes under California law.[5][6] Legally speaking, the Regents are a California corporation,[7] administering the university as a public trust under the California Constitution. All actions of the university are done in their name, all degrees are conferred in their name, all UC property is held in their name (and is marked by signs indicating "Property of the Regents of the University of California"), all bank accounts are held in their name (and all checks must be written as payable to "UC Regents"), and all lawsuits involving the University always refer specifically to the regents. This is notable because most corporations (especially private ones) are treated by the law as a legal entity separate from their boards and employees, and lawsuits against them are addressed to the corporation or university itself, not its board of directors or trustees.[citation needed]
Administrative support is provided to the Regents by the Office of the Secretary of the Regents of the University of California, which shares an office building with the UC Office of the President in Oakland.[citation needed]
In May 2017, The San Francisco Chronicle reported that the Regents had been hosting costly dinner parties using university funds.[8] After extensive public outcry, university leaders released a statement saying the university would no longer fund these dinners.[9]

Composition[edit]
The majority of the board (18 Regents) is appointed via nomination by the Governor of California and confirmation by the California State Senate to 12-year terms. One student Regent is appointed by the Board for a one-year term. The remaining 7 Regents are ex officio members. They are the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Speaker of the State Assembly, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, president and vice president of the Alumni Associations of UC, and president of the University of California.[3]
The Board also has two non-voting faculty representatives. The incoming student Regent serves as a non-voting Regent-designate from the date of selection (usually between July and October) until beginning their formal term the following July 1.
The vast majority of the Regents appointed by the Governor historically have consisted of lawyers, politicians and businessmen.[10] Over the past two decades, it has been common that UC Regents appointees have donated relatively large sums of money either directly to the Governor's election campaigns or indirectly to party election groups.[11][12]

Honorary Regents[edit]
In its early years, UC had thirteen Honorary Regents, with ten appointed in 1868.[21] "Honorary Regents" were full board members, with the word "Honorary" simply denoting their manner of selection (that is, they were elected to serve on the board by the other board members, instead of being appointed by the governor). Some were then appointed to another term, following their term as Honorary Regent, by the governor. One (Tompkins) was re-elected.[25]

Honorary Regents[edit]
In its early years, UC had thirteen Honorary Regents, with ten appointed in 1868.[21] "Honorary Regents" were full board members, with the word "Honorary" simply denoting their manner of selection (that is, they were elected to serve on the board by the other board members, instead of being appointed by the governor). Some were then appointed to another term, following their term as Honorary Regent, by the governor. One (Tompkins) was re-elected.[25]

The Regents of the University of California is the governing board of the University of California system.[3] The board has 26 voting members.
The California Constitution grants broad institutional autonomy, with limited exceptions, to the Regents.[4] According to article IX, section 9, "The University shall be entirely independent of all political or sectarian influence and kept free therefrom in the appointment of its regents and in the administration of its affairs."
As with almost all other public university systems nationwide, the board of regents is treated as the real party in interest for all purposes under California law.[5][6] Legally speaking, the Regents are a California corporation,[7] administering the university as a public trust under the California Constitution. All actions of the university are done in their name, all degrees are conferred in their name, all UC property is held in their name (and is marked by signs indicating "Property of the Regents of the University of California"), all bank accounts are held in their name (and all checks must be written as payable to "UC Regents"), and all lawsuits involving the University always refer specifically to the regents. This is notable because most corporations (especially private ones) are treated by the law as a legal entity separate from their boards and employees, and lawsuits against them are addressed to the corporation or university itself, not its board of directors or trustees.[citation needed]
Administrative support is provided to the Regents by the Office of the Secretary of the Regents of the University of California, which shares an office building with the UC Office of the President in Oakland.[citation needed]
In May 2017, The San Francisco Chronicle reported that the Regents had been hosting costly dinner parties using university funds.[8] After extensive public outcry, university leaders released a statement saying the university would no longer fund these dinners.[9]

Composition[edit]
The majority of the board (18 Regents) is appointed via nomination by the Governor of California and confirmation by the California State Senate to 12-year terms. One student Regent is appointed by the Board for a one-year term. The remaining 7 Regents are ex officio members. They are the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Speaker of the State Assembly, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, president and vice president of the Alumni Associations of UC, and president of the University of California.[3]
The Board also has two non-voting faculty representatives. The incoming student Regent serves as a non-voting Regent-designate from the date of selection (usually between July and October) until beginning their formal term the following July 1.
The vast majority of the Regents appointed by the Governor historically have consisted of lawyers, politicians and businessmen.[10] Over the past two decades, it has been common that UC Regents appointees have donated relatively large sums of money either directly to the Governor's election campaigns or indirectly to party election groups.[11][12]

Honorary Regents[edit]
In its early years, UC had thirteen Honorary Regents, with ten appointed in 1868.[21] "Honorary Regents" were full board members, with the word "Honorary" simply denoting their manner of selection (that is, they were elected to serve on the board by the other board members, instead of being appointed by the governor). Some were then appointed to another term, following their term as Honorary Regent, by the governor. One (Tompkins) was re-elected.[25]

Moore v. Regents of the University of California (51 Cal. 3d 120; 271 Cal. Rptr. 146; 793 P.2d 479) was a landmark Supreme Court of California decision filed on July 9, 1990, which dealt with the issue of property rights to one's own cells taken in samples by doctors or researchers. In 1976, John Moore was treated for hairy cell leukemia by physician David Golde, a cancer researcher at the UCLA Medical Center. Moore's cancer cells were later developed into a cell line that was commercialized by Golde and UCLA. The California Supreme Court ruled that a hospital patient's discarded blood and tissue samples are not his personal property and that individuals do not have rights to a share in the profits earned from commercial products or research derived from their cells.[1]

History[edit]
John Moore first visited UCLA Medical Center on October 5, 1976, after he was diagnosed with hairy cell leukemia. Physician and cancer researcher David Golde took samples of Moore's blood, bone marrow, and other bodily fluids, to confirm the diagnosis and recommended a splenectomy due to the potentially fatal amount of swelling in Moore's spleen.[2] Moore signed a written consent form authorizing the procedure that said the hospital could "dispose of any severed tissue or member by cremation" and his spleen was removed by surgeons (not named as defendants) at UCLA Medical Center.[3]
Moore's blood profile returned to normal after only a few days and further examination of his spleen led Golde to discover that Moore's blood cells were unique in that they produced a protein that stimulated the growth of white blood cells, the type of blood cells that help protect the body from infections.[4]
Moore moved to Seattle, Washington after surgery and returned to the UCLA Medical Center for follow-up visits with Golde several times between 1976 and 1983.[3] After a few years of traveling back to Los Angeles to see Golde and to have samples taken of bone marrow, blood, and semen, Moore asked about transferring his care to a doctor closer to home. In response, Golde offered to cover the expense of Moore's airfare and accommodations in Los Angeles and Moore agreed to continue.[2]
In 1983, Moore became suspicious about a new consent form he was asked to sign that said: "I (do, do not) voluntarily grant to the University of California all rights I, or my heirs, may have in any cell line or any other potential product which might be developed from the blood and/or bone marrow obtained from me". Moore initially signed the consent, but refused at later visits and eventually gave it to an attorney who then discovered a patent on Moore's cell line, dubbed "Mo", that had been issued to the regents of UCLA in 1984, naming Golde and his research assistant as the inventors.[3] Under an agreement with Genetics Institute, Golde became a paid consultant and acquired the rights to 75,000 shares of common stock in the patent. Genetics Institute also agreed to pay Golde and the regents at least US$330,000 over three years, in exchange for exclusive access to the materials and research performed on the cell line and products derived from it.[citation needed]
After learning of the patent, Moore filed a lawsuit for a share in the potential profits from products or research that had been derived from his cell line without his knowledge or consent. Moore's lawsuit alleged that Golde had been aware of the potential for financial benefit when he obtained medical consent and had concealed this from Moore. This claim was rejected by the Los Angeles Superior Court, but in 1988, the state Court of Appeal ruled that blood and tissue samples are one's own personal property and that patients may have a right to share in profits derived from them.[4]
According to the Los Angeles Times, "Moore later negotiated what he called a 'token' settlement with UCLA that covered his legal fees based on the fact that he wasn't informed and hadn't agreed to the research."[4]
Decision[edit]
Moore brought suit against defendants Dr. David W. Golde (Golde), a physician who attended Moore at UCLA Medical Center; the Regents of the University of California (Regents), who own and operate the university; Shirley G. Quan, a researcher employed by the Regents; Genetics Institute, Inc. (Genetics Institute); and Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corporation and related entities (collectively Sandoz).
The court found that Moore had no property rights to his discarded cells or any profits made from them. However, the court concluded that the research physician did have an obligation to reveal his financial interest in the materials harvested from Moore, and that Moore would be allowed to bring a claim for any injury that he sustained as a result of the physician's failure to disclose those circumstances.
The opinion written by Justice Edward Panelli was joined by three of the seven judges of the Supreme Court of California.
The opinion first looked at Moore's claim of property interests under existing law. The court first rejected the argument that a person has an absolute right to the unique products of their body because his products were not unique. "[The cells are] no more unique to Moore than the number of vertebrae in the spine or the chemical formula of hemoglobin."[5] The court then rejected the argument that his spleen should be protected as property in order to protect Moore's privacy and dignity. The court held these interests were already protected by informed consent. The court noted laws that required the destruction of human organs as some indication that the legislature had intended to prevent patients from possessing their extracted organs. Finally, the property at issue may not have been Moore's cells but the cell line created from Moore's cells.
The court then looked at the policy behind having Moore's cells considered property. Because conversion of property is a strict liability tort, the court feared that extending property rights to include organs would have a chilling effect on medical research. Laboratories doing research receive a large volume of medical samples and could not be expected to know or discover whether somewhere down the line their samples were illegally converted. Furthermore, Moore's interest in his bodily integrity and privacy are protected by the requirement of informed consent (which must also inform about economic interests).
Justice Arabian wrote a concurring opinion stating that the deep philosophical, moral and religious issues that are presented by this case could not be decided by the court.
Justice Broussard concurred in part and dissented in part.
Justice Mosk dissented stating that Moore could have been denied some property rights and given others. Mosk would hold that at the very least Moore had the "right to do with his own tissue what the defendants did with it." That is, as soon as the tissue was removed Moore at least had the right to choose to sell it to a laboratory or have it destroyed. Thus there would be no necessity to hold labs strictly liable for conversion when property rights can be broken up to allow Moore to extract a significant portion of the economic value created by his tissue. Furthermore, in order to prove damages from informed consent Moore must prove both that he would not have consented to the procedure had he been properly informed and that a reasonable person would not have consented to the procedure if they had been properly informed. Thus Moore's chances of proving damages through informed consent are slim. Also, Moore could not consent to the procedure but reserve the right to sell his organs. Finally, Moore can only sue his doctor and nobody else for failing to adequately inform him. Thus Moore is unlikely to win, could not extract the economic value of his tissue even if he refused consent and could not sue the parties that might be culpable for exploiting him.

The Regents of the University of California is the governing board of the University of California system.[3] The board has 26 voting members.
The California Constitution grants broad institutional autonomy, with limited exceptions, to the Regents.[4] According to article IX, section 9, "The University shall be entirely independent of all political or sectarian influence and kept free therefrom in the appointment of its regents and in the administration of its affairs."
As with almost all other public university systems nationwide, the board of regents is treated as the real party in interest for all purposes under California law.[5][6] Legally speaking, the Regents are a California corporation,[7] administering the university as a public trust under the California Constitution. All actions of the university are done in their name, all degrees are conferred in their name, all UC property is held in their name (and is marked by signs indicating "Property of the Regents of the University of California"), all bank accounts are held in their name (and all checks must be written as payable to "UC Regents"), and all lawsuits involving the University always refer specifically to the regents. This is notable because most corporations (especially private ones) are treated by the law as a legal entity separate from their boards and employees, and lawsuits against them are addressed to the corporation or university itself, not its board of directors or trustees.[citation needed]
Administrative support is provided to the Regents by the Office of the Secretary of the Regents of the University of California, which shares an office building with the UC Office of the President in Oakland.[citation needed]
In May 2017, The San Francisco Chronicle reported that the Regents had been hosting costly dinner parties using university funds.[8] After extensive public outcry, university leaders released a statement saying the university would no longer fund these dinners.[9]

Composition[edit]
The majority of the board (18 Regents) is appointed via nomination by the Governor of California and confirmation by the California State Senate to 12-year terms. One student Regent is appointed by the Board for a one-year term. The remaining 7 Regents are ex officio members. They are the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Speaker of the State Assembly, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, president and vice president of the Alumni Associations of UC, and president of the University of California.[3]
The Board also has two non-voting faculty representatives. The incoming student Regent serves as a non-voting Regent-designate from the date of selection (usually between July and October) until beginning their formal term the following July 1.
The vast majority of the Regents appointed by the Governor historically have consisted of lawyers, politicians and businessmen.[10] Over the past two decades, it has been common that UC Regents appointees have donated relatively large sums of money either directly to the Governor's election campaigns or indirectly to party election groups.[11][12]

Honorary Regents[edit]
In its early years, UC had thirteen Honorary Regents, with ten appointed in 1868.[21] "Honorary Regents" were full board members, with the word "Honorary" simply denoting their manner of selection (that is, they were elected to serve on the board by the other board members, instead of being appointed by the governor). Some were then appointed to another term, following their term as Honorary Regent, by the governor. One (Tompkins) was re-elected.[25]

The Regents of the University of California is the governing board of the University of California system.[3] The board has 26 voting members.
The California Constitution grants broad institutional autonomy, with limited exceptions, to the Regents.[4] According to article IX, section 9, "The University shall be entirely independent of all political or sectarian influence and kept free therefrom in the appointment of its regents and in the administration of its affairs."
As with almost all other public university systems nationwide, the board of regents is treated as the real party in interest for all purposes under California law.[5][6] Legally speaking, the Regents are a California corporation,[7] administering the university as a public trust under the California Constitution. All actions of the university are done in their name, all degrees are conferred in their name, all UC property is held in their name (and is marked by signs indicating "Property of the Regents of the University of California"), all bank accounts are held in their name (and all checks must be written as payable to "UC Regents"), and all lawsuits involving the University always refer specifically to the regents. This is notable because most corporations (especially private ones) are treated by the law as a legal entity separate from their boards and employees, and lawsuits against them are addressed to the corporation or university itself, not its board of directors or trustees.[citation needed]
Administrative support is provided to the Regents by the Office of the Secretary of the Regents of the University of California, which shares an office building with the UC Office of the President in Oakland.[citation needed]
In May 2017, The San Francisco Chronicle reported that the Regents had been hosting costly dinner parties using university funds.[8] After extensive public outcry, university leaders released a statement saying the university would no longer fund these dinners.[9]

Composition[edit]
The majority of the board (18 Regents) is appointed via nomination by the Governor of California and confirmation by the California State Senate to 12-year terms. One student Regent is appointed by the Board for a one-year term. The remaining 7 Regents are ex officio members. They are the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Speaker of the State Assembly, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, president and vice president of the Alumni Associations of UC, and president of the University of California.[3]
The Board also has two non-voting faculty representatives. The incoming student Regent serves as a non-voting Regent-designate from the date of selection (usually between July and October) until beginning their formal term the following July 1.
The vast majority of the Regents appointed by the Governor historically have consisted of lawyers, politicians and businessmen.[10] Over the past two decades, it has been common that UC Regents appointees have donated relatively large sums of money either directly to the Governor's election campaigns or indirectly to party election groups.[11][12]

Honorary Regents[edit]
In its early years, UC had thirteen Honorary Regents, with ten appointed in 1868.[21] "Honorary Regents" were full board members, with the word "Honorary" simply denoting their manner of selection (that is, they were elected to serve on the board by the other board members, instead of being appointed by the governor). Some were then appointed to another term, following their term as Honorary Regent, by the governor. One (Tompkins) was re-elected.[25]

The Regents of the University of California is the governing board of the University of California system.[3] The board has 26 voting members.
The California Constitution grants broad institutional autonomy, with limited exceptions, to the Regents.[4] According to article IX, section 9, "The University shall be entirely independent of all political or sectarian influence and kept free therefrom in the appointment of its regents and in the administration of its affairs."
As with almost all other public university systems nationwide, the board of regents is treated as the real party in interest for all purposes under California law.[5][6] Legally speaking, the Regents are a California corporation,[7] administering the university as a public trust under the California Constitution. All actions of the university are done in their name, all degrees are conferred in their name, all UC property is held in their name (and is marked by signs indicating "Property of the Regents of the University of California"), all bank accounts are held in their name (and all checks must be written as payable to "UC Regents"), and all lawsuits involving the University always refer specifically to the regents. This is notable because most corporations (especially private ones) are treated by the law as a legal entity separate from their boards and employees, and lawsuits against them are addressed to the corporation or university itself, not its board of directors or trustees.[citation needed]
Administrative support is provided to the Regents by the Office of the Secretary of the Regents of the University of California, which shares an office building with the UC Office of the President in Oakland.[citation needed]
In May 2017, The San Francisco Chronicle reported that the Regents had been hosting costly dinner parties using university funds.[8] After extensive public outcry, university leaders released a statement saying the university would no longer fund these dinners.[9]

Composition[edit]
The majority of the board (18 Regents) is appointed via nomination by the Governor of California and confirmation by the California State Senate to 12-year terms. One student Regent is appointed by the Board for a one-year term. The remaining 7 Regents are ex officio members. They are the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Speaker of the State Assembly, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, president and vice president of the Alumni Associations of UC, and president of the University of California.[3]
The Board also has two non-voting faculty representatives. The incoming student Regent serves as a non-voting Regent-designate from the date of selection (usually between July and October) until beginning their formal term the following July 1.
The vast majority of the Regents appointed by the Governor historically have consisted of lawyers, politicians and businessmen.[10] Over the past two decades, it has been common that UC Regents appointees have donated relatively large sums of money either directly to the Governor's election campaigns or indirectly to party election groups.[11][12]

The Regents of the University of California is the governing board of the University of California system.[3] The board has 26 voting members.
The California Constitution grants broad institutional autonomy, with limited exceptions, to the Regents.[4] According to article IX, section 9, "The University shall be entirely independent of all political or sectarian influence and kept free therefrom in the appointment of its regents and in the administration of its affairs."
As with almost all other public university systems nationwide, the board of regents is treated as the real party in interest for all purposes under California law.[5][6] Legally speaking, the Regents are a California corporation,[7] administering the university as a public trust under the California Constitution. All actions of the university are done in their name, all degrees are conferred in their name, all UC property is held in their name (and is marked by signs indicating "Property of the Regents of the University of California"), all bank accounts are held in their name (and all checks must be written as payable to "UC Regents"), and all lawsuits involving the University always refer specifically to the regents. This is notable because most corporations (especially private ones) are treated by the law as a legal entity separate from their boards and employees, and lawsuits against them are addressed to the corporation or university itself, not its board of directors or trustees.[citation needed]
Administrative support is provided to the Regents by the Office of the Secretary of the Regents of the University of California, which shares an office building with the UC Office of the President in Oakland.[citation needed]
In May 2017, The San Francisco Chronicle reported that the Regents had been hosting costly dinner parties using university funds.[8] After extensive public outcry, university leaders released a statement saying the university would no longer fund these dinners.[9]

Composition[edit]
The majority of the board (18 Regents) is appointed via nomination by the Governor of California and confirmation by the California State Senate to 12-year terms. One student Regent is appointed by the Board for a one-year term. The remaining 7 Regents are ex officio members. They are the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Speaker of the State Assembly, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, president and vice president of the Alumni Associations of UC, and president of the University of California.[3]
The Board also has two non-voting faculty representatives. The incoming student Regent serves as a non-voting Regent-designate from the date of selection (usually between July and October) until beginning their formal term the following July 1.
The vast majority of the Regents appointed by the Governor historically have consisted of lawyers, politicians and businessmen.[10] Over the past two decades, it has been common that UC Regents appointees have donated relatively large sums of money either directly to the Governor's election campaigns or indirectly to party election groups.[11][12]

Honorary Regents[edit]
In its early years, UC had thirteen Honorary Regents, with ten appointed in 1868.[21] "Honorary Regents" were full board members, with the word "Honorary" simply denoting their manner of selection (that is, they were elected to serve on the board by the other board members, instead of being appointed by the governor). Some were then appointed to another term, following their term as Honorary Regent, by the governor. One (Tompkins) was re-elected.[25]

The Regents of the University of California is the governing board of the University of California system.[3] The board has 26 voting members.
The California Constitution grants broad institutional autonomy, with limited exceptions, to the Regents.[4] According to article IX, section 9, "The University shall be entirely independent of all political or sectarian influence and kept free therefrom in the appointment of its regents and in the administration of its affairs."
As with almost all other public university systems nationwide, the board of regents is treated as the real party in interest for all purposes under California law.[5][6] Legally speaking, the Regents are a California corporation,[7] administering the university as a public trust under the California Constitution. All actions of the university are done in their name, all degrees are conferred in their name, all UC property is held in their name (and is marked by signs indicating "Property of the Regents of the University of California"), all bank accounts are held in their name (and all checks must be written as payable to "UC Regents"), and all lawsuits involving the University always refer specifically to the regents. This is notable because most corporations (especially private ones) are treated by the law as a legal entity separate from their boards and employees, and lawsuits against them are addressed to the corporation or university itself, not its board of directors or trustees.[citation needed]
Administrative support is provided to the Regents by the Office of the Secretary of the Regents of the University of California, which shares an office building with the UC Office of the President in Oakland.[citation needed]
In May 2017, The San Francisco Chronicle reported that the Regents had been hosting costly dinner parties using university funds.[8] After extensive public outcry, university leaders released a statement saying the university would no longer fund these dinners.[9]

Composition[edit]
The majority of the board (18 Regents) is appointed via nomination by the Governor of California and confirmation by the California State Senate to 12-year terms. One student Regent is appointed by the Board for a one-year term. The remaining 7 Regents are ex officio members. They are the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Speaker of the State Assembly, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, president and vice president of the Alumni Associations of UC, and president of the University of California.[3]
The Board also has two non-voting faculty representatives. The incoming student Regent serves as a non-voting Regent-designate from the date of selection (usually between July and October) until beginning their formal term the following July 1.
The vast majority of the Regents appointed by the Governor historically have consisted of lawyers, politicians and businessmen.[10] Over the past two decades, it has been common that UC Regents appointees have donated relatively large sums of money either directly to the Governor's election campaigns or indirectly to party election groups.[11][12]

Honorary Regents[edit]
In its early years, UC had thirteen Honorary Regents, with ten appointed in 1868.[21] "Honorary Regents" were full board members, with the word "Honorary" simply denoting their manner of selection (that is, they were elected to serve on the board by the other board members, instead of being appointed by the governor). Some were then appointed to another term, following their term as Honorary Regent, by the governor. One (Tompkins) was re-elected.[25]

Honorary Regents[edit]
In its early years, UC had thirteen Honorary Regents, with ten appointed in 1868.[21] "Honorary Regents" were full board members, with the word "Honorary" simply denoting their manner of selection (that is, they were elected to serve on the board by the other board members, instead of being appointed by the governor). Some were then appointed to another term, following their term as Honorary Regent, by the governor. One (Tompkins) was re-elected.[25]

Frederick Low (1868), 9th Governor of California from 1863 to 1867; considered the "father of the University of California"[26]
Andrew J. Moulder (1868), State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 1862–1863; a founder of Minns’ Evening Normal School in San Francisco in 1857 and of the first California State Normal School in San Jose, approved by the Legislature in 1862[27]

Moore v. Regents of the University of California (51 Cal. 3d 120; 271 Cal. Rptr. 146; 793 P.2d 479) was a landmark Supreme Court of California decision filed on July 9, 1990, which dealt with the issue of property rights to one's own cells taken in samples by doctors or researchers. In 1976, John Moore was treated for hairy cell leukemia by physician David Golde, a cancer researcher at the UCLA Medical Center. Moore's cancer cells were later developed into a cell line that was commercialized by Golde and UCLA. The California Supreme Court ruled that a hospital patient's discarded blood and tissue samples are not his personal property and that individuals do not have rights to a share in the profits earned from commercial products or research derived from their cells.[1]

History[edit]
John Moore first visited UCLA Medical Center on October 5, 1976, after he was diagnosed with hairy cell leukemia. Physician and cancer researcher David Golde took samples of Moore's blood, bone marrow, and other bodily fluids, to confirm the diagnosis and recommended a splenectomy due to the potentially fatal amount of swelling in Moore's spleen.[2] Moore signed a written consent form authorizing the procedure that said the hospital could "dispose of any severed tissue or member by cremation" and his spleen was removed by surgeons (not named as defendants) at UCLA Medical Center.[3]
Moore's blood profile returned to normal after only a few days and further examination of his spleen led Golde to discover that Moore's blood cells were unique in that they produced a protein that stimulated the growth of white blood cells, the type of blood cells that help protect the body from infections.[4]
Moore moved to Seattle, Washington after surgery and returned to the UCLA Medical Center for follow-up visits with Golde several times between 1976 and 1983.[3] After a few years of traveling back to Los Angeles to see Golde and to have samples taken of bone marrow, blood, and semen, Moore asked about transferring his care to a doctor closer to home. In response, Golde offered to cover the expense of Moore's airfare and accommodations in Los Angeles and Moore agreed to continue.[2]
In 1983, Moore became suspicious about a new consent form he was asked to sign that said: "I (do, do not) voluntarily grant to the University of California all rights I, or my heirs, may have in any cell line or any other potential product which might be developed from the blood and/or bone marrow obtained from me". Moore initially signed the consent, but refused at later visits and eventually gave it to an attorney who then discovered a patent on Moore's cell line, dubbed "Mo", that had been issued to the regents of UCLA in 1984, naming Golde and his research assistant as the inventors.[3] Under an agreement with Genetics Institute, Golde became a paid consultant and acquired the rights to 75,000 shares of common stock in the patent. Genetics Institute also agreed to pay Golde and the regents at least US$330,000 over three years, in exchange for exclusive access to the materials and research performed on the cell line and products derived from it.[citation needed]
After learning of the patent, Moore filed a lawsuit for a share in the potential profits from products or research that had been derived from his cell line without his knowledge or consent. Moore's lawsuit alleged that Golde had been aware of the potential for financial benefit when he obtained medical consent and had concealed this from Moore. This claim was rejected by the Los Angeles Superior Court, but in 1988, the state Court of Appeal ruled that blood and tissue samples are one's own personal property and that patients may have a right to share in profits derived from them.[4]
According to the Los Angeles Times, "Moore later negotiated what he called a 'token' settlement with UCLA that covered his legal fees based on the fact that he wasn't informed and hadn't agreed to the research."[4]
Decision[edit]
Moore brought suit against defendants Dr. David W. Golde (Golde), a physician who attended Moore at UCLA Medical Center; the Regents of the University of California (Regents), who own and operate the university; Shirley G. Quan, a researcher employed by the Regents; Genetics Institute, Inc. (Genetics Institute); and Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corporation and related entities (collectively Sandoz).
The court found that Moore had no property rights to his discarded cells or any profits made from them. However, the court concluded that the research physician did have an obligation to reveal his financial interest in the materials harvested from Moore, and that Moore would be allowed to bring a claim for any injury that he sustained as a result of the physician's failure to disclose those circumstances.
The opinion written by Justice Edward Panelli was joined by three of the seven judges of the Supreme Court of California.
The opinion first looked at Moore's claim of property interests under existing law. The court first rejected the argument that a person has an absolute right to the unique products of their body because his products were not unique. "[The cells are] no more unique to Moore than the number of vertebrae in the spine or the chemical formula of hemoglobin."[5] The court then rejected the argument that his spleen should be protected as property in order to protect Moore's privacy and dignity. The court held these interests were already protected by informed consent. The court noted laws that required the destruction of human organs as some indication that the legislature had intended to prevent patients from possessing their extracted organs. Finally, the property at issue may not have been Moore's cells but the cell line created from Moore's cells.
The court then looked at the policy behind having Moore's cells considered property. Because conversion of property is a strict liability tort, the court feared that extending property rights to include organs would have a chilling effect on medical research. Laboratories doing research receive a large volume of medical samples and could not be expected to know or discover whether somewhere down the line their samples were illegally converted. Furthermore, Moore's interest in his bodily integrity and privacy are protected by the requirement of informed consent (which must also inform about economic interests).
Justice Arabian wrote a concurring opinion stating that the deep philosophical, moral and religious issues that are presented by this case could not be decided by the court.
Justice Broussard concurred in part and dissented in part.
Justice Mosk dissented stating that Moore could have been denied some property rights and given others. Mosk would hold that at the very least Moore had the "right to do with his own tissue what the defendants did with it." That is, as soon as the tissue was removed Moore at least had the right to choose to sell it to a laboratory or have it destroyed. Thus there would be no necessity to hold labs strictly liable for conversion when property rights can be broken up to allow Moore to extract a significant portion of the economic value created by his tissue. Furthermore, in order to prove damages from informed consent Moore must prove both that he would not have consented to the procedure had he been properly informed and that a reasonable person would not have consented to the procedure if they had been properly informed. Thus Moore's chances of proving damages through informed consent are slim. Also, Moore could not consent to the procedure but reserve the right to sell his organs. Finally, Moore can only sue his doctor and nobody else for failing to adequately inform him. Thus Moore is unlikely to win, could not extract the economic value of his tissue even if he refused consent and could not sue the parties that might be culpable for exploiting him.
Cultural impact[edit]
The Michael Crichton book Next, while specifically mentioning the Moore case, extrapolates possible legal ramifications of the Moore case with a patient called Frank Burnet.

Thus Moore is unlikely to win, could not extract the economic value of his tissue even if he refused consent and could not sue the parties that might be culpable for exploiting him.

Moore v. Regents of the University of California (51 Cal. 3d 120; 271 Cal. Rptr. 146; 793 P.2d 479) was a landmark Supreme Court of California decision filed on July 9, 1990, which dealt with the issue of property rights to one's own cells taken in samples by doctors or researchers. In 1976, John Moore was treated for hairy cell leukemia by physician David Golde, a cancer researcher at the UCLA Medical Center. Moore's cancer cells were later developed into a cell line that was commercialized by Golde and UCLA. The California Supreme Court ruled that a hospital patient's discarded blood and tissue samples are not his personal property and that individuals do not have rights to a share in the profits earned from commercial products or research derived from their cells.[1]

History[edit]
John Moore first visited UCLA Medical Center on October 5, 1976, after he was diagnosed with hairy cell leukemia. Physician and cancer researcher David Golde took samples of Moore's blood, bone marrow, and other bodily fluids, to confirm the diagnosis and recommended a splenectomy due to the potentially fatal amount of swelling in Moore's spleen.[2] Moore signed a written consent form authorizing the procedure that said the hospital could "dispose of any severed tissue or member by cremation" and his spleen was removed by surgeons (not named as defendants) at UCLA Medical Center.[3]
Moore's blood profile returned to normal after only a few days and further examination of his spleen led Golde to discover that Moore's blood cells were unique in that they produced a protein that stimulated the growth of white blood cells, the type of blood cells that help protect the body from infections.[4]
Moore moved to Seattle, Washington after surgery and returned to the UCLA Medical Center for follow-up visits with Golde several times between 1976 and 1983.[3] After a few years of traveling back to Los Angeles to see Golde and to have samples taken of bone marrow, blood, and semen, Moore asked about transferring his care to a doctor closer to home. In response, Golde offered to cover the expense of Moore's airfare and accommodations in Los Angeles and Moore agreed to continue.[2]
In 1983, Moore became suspicious about a new consent form he was asked to sign that said: "I (do, do not) voluntarily grant to the University of California all rights I, or my heirs, may have in any cell line or any other potential product which might be developed from the blood and/or bone marrow obtained from me". Moore initially signed the consent, but refused at later visits and eventually gave it to an attorney who then discovered a patent on Moore's cell line, dubbed "Mo", that had been issued to the regents of UCLA in 1984, naming Golde and his research assistant as the inventors.[3] Under an agreement with Genetics Institute, Golde became a paid consultant and acquired the rights to 75,000 shares of common stock in the patent. Genetics Institute also agreed to pay Golde and the regents at least US$330,000 over three years, in exchange for exclusive access to the materials and research performed on the cell line and products derived from it.[citation needed]
After learning of the patent, Moore filed a lawsuit for a share in the potential profits from products or research that had been derived from his cell line without his knowledge or consent. Moore's lawsuit alleged that Golde had been aware of the potential for financial benefit when he obtained medical consent and had concealed this from Moore. This claim was rejected by the Los Angeles Superior Court, but in 1988, the state Court of Appeal ruled that blood and tissue samples are one's own personal property and that patients may have a right to share in profits derived from them.[4]
According to the Los Angeles Times, "Moore later negotiated what he called a 'token' settlement with UCLA that covered his legal fees based on the fact that he wasn't informed and hadn't agreed to the research."[4]
Decision[edit]
Moore brought suit against defendants Dr. David W. Golde (Golde), a physician who attended Moore at UCLA Medical Center; the Regents of the University of California (Regents), who own and operate the university; Shirley G. Quan, a researcher employed by the Regents; Genetics Institute, Inc. (Genetics Institute); and Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corporation and related entities (collectively Sandoz).
The court found that Moore had no property rights to his discarded cells or any profits made from them. However, the court concluded that the research physician did have an obligation to reveal his financial interest in the materials harvested from Moore, and that Moore would be allowed to bring a claim for any injury that he sustained as a result of the physician's failure to disclose those circumstances.
The opinion written by Justice Edward Panelli was joined by three of the seven judges of the Supreme Court of California.
The opinion first looked at Moore's claim of property interests under existing law. The court first rejected the argument that a person has an absolute right to the unique products of their body because his products were not unique. "[The cells are] no more unique to Moore than the number of vertebrae in the spine or the chemical formula of hemoglobin."[5] The court then rejected the argument that his spleen should be protected as property in order to protect Moore's privacy and dignity. The court held these interests were already protected by informed consent. The court noted laws that required the destruction of human organs as some indication that the legislature had intended to prevent patients from possessing their extracted organs. Finally, the property at issue may not have been Moore's cells but the cell line created from Moore's cells.
The court then looked at the policy behind having Moore's cells considered property. Because conversion of property is a strict liability tort, the court feared that extending property rights to include organs would have a chilling effect on medical research. Laboratories doing research receive a large volume of medical samples and could not be expected to know or discover whether somewhere down the line their samples were illegally converted. Furthermore, Moore's interest in his bodily integrity and privacy are protected by the requirement of informed consent (which must also inform about economic interests).
Justice Arabian wrote a concurring opinion stating that the deep philosophical, moral and religious issues that are presented by this case could not be decided by the court.
Justice Broussard concurred in part and dissented in part.
Justice Mosk dissented stating that Moore could have been denied some property rights and given others. Mosk would hold that at the very least Moore had the "right to do with his own tissue what the defendants did with it." That is, as soon as the tissue was removed Moore at least had the right to choose to sell it to a laboratory or have it destroyed. Thus there would be no necessity to hold labs strictly liable for conversion when property rights can be broken up to allow Moore to extract a significant portion of the economic value created by his tissue. Furthermore, in order to prove damages from informed consent Moore must prove both that he would not have consented to the procedure had he been properly informed and that a reasonable person would not have consented to the procedure if they had been properly informed. Thus Moore's chances of proving damages through informed consent are slim. Also, Moore could not consent to the procedure but reserve the right to sell his organs. Finally, Moore can only sue his doctor and nobody else for failing to adequately inform him. Thus Moore is unlikely to win, could not extract the economic value of his tissue even if he refused consent and could not sue the parties that might be culpable for exploiting him.

The Impact of Social Science Evidence in Predicting Dangerousness and Establishing a Duty to Warn

Compiled by Matt Campbell and Cristina Quinones-Betancourt




Figure 1
General Overview of Duty to Rescue
Generally, American tort law does not impose liability on parties for failing to aid or rescue other parties.  The Restatement (Second) of Torts § 314 (1965) states: "The fact that the actor realizes or should realize that action on his part is necessary for another's aid or protection does not of itself impose upon him a duty to take such action."  However, the law provides narrow exceptions in some instances when parties owe a specific duty to one another, such as when parties have a "special relationship."
Special Relationships
Special relationships apply to narrow categories of  relationships.

Figure 2: Special Relationships
Under modern tort law, "special relationships" usually refer to  those involving dependence or mutual dependence, such as therapist-patient  relationships (See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 315)).
Tarasoff v. Regents of the University of California
On October 27, 1969, University of California, Berkeley graduate student Prosenjit Poddar sought out Berkeley student Tatiana Tarasoff while she was alone in her home, shot her with a pellet gun, chased her into the street with a kitchen knife, and stabbed her seventeen times, causing her death.




Figure 3: Tatiana Tarasoff



Figure 4: Pronsenjit Poddar



 
 Podder became enamored with Tatiana Tarasoff and was confused and enraged when she rejected his advances. On June 5, 1969, Poddar sought and received emergency psychological treatment from Dr. Lawrence Moore, a psychologist employed by the Cowell Memorial Hospital at the University of California at Berkeley.

Figure 5: Cowell Memorial Hospital

Poddar saw Dr. Moore seven times.  On August 20, 1969, during his 7th  therapy session, Poddar confessed that he planned to kill Tatiana Tarasoff.  Dr. Moore diagnosed Poddar with having an  acute and severe "paranoid schizophrenic reaction."  He and two other doctors determined that  Poddar should be committed to a psychiatric hospital for observation and  contacted the police. 
However, the police only  briefly detained Poddar, releasing him after he promised to stay away from  Tarasoff.  Following Poddar’s release,  Dr. Harvey Powelson, Dr. Moore’s superior, instructed the police to return the  letter from Dr. Moore instructing them to detain Poddar, ordered that the  letter and all notes taken on Poddar be destroyed, and instructed Dr. Moore to  take no further action in detaining Poddar.   The doctors who examined Poddar never notified Tarasoff or her family  about Poddar’s threatening statements.   Poddar never returned to therapy and killed Tatiana Tarasoff as planned.
People v. Poddar: Poddar's Criminal Trial
At  his criminal trial, Poddar pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity.    Psychologists who evaluated Poddar prior to the murder presented evidence at  the trial demonstrating that Poddar lacked a culpable mental state at the time  of the murder because he was insane and a paranoid schizophrenic. 

Figure 6: Normal Brain (left) Schizophrenic Brain (right)
Although the trial court convicted Poddar of second-degree  murder, the Court of Appeal reduced the crime to manslaughter.  On appeal,  the California Supreme Court determined that even the charge of manslaughter  was too harsh under the circumstances and reversed the conviction.  Poddar  was never retried and was allowed to return to India, where he reportedly  married a lawyer and led a normal life.
Tarasoff v. Regents of the University of California (Tarasoff II)

Following Poddar’s criminal trial, Tarasoff’s parents sued the  psychiatrists and police who were involved in treating Poddar.  The charges against the police were  ultimately dropped because the police were immune to the suit.
Although the trial court and California Court of Appeal  determined that Tarasoff’s parents had no cause of action, the California allowed  Tarasoff’s parents to amend their complaint to state the following:


 "[R]egardless of the therapists' unsuccessful 	attempt to confine Poddar, since they knew that Poddar was at large and dangerous, their failure to warn Tatiana or others likely to apprise her of the danger constituted a breach of the therapists' duty to exercise reasonable care to protect Tatiana."


The  California Supreme Court ultimately reversed and remanded the Court of Appeal’s  decision. In its holding, the California Supreme Court considered the following  factors:

Foreseeability of harm to Plaintiff;
the degree of certainty that Plaintiff suffered injury;
the closeness of the connection between Defendent's conduct and the injury suffered by Plaintiff;
the moral blame attached to Defendent's conduct;
the policy of preventing future harm;
the extent of the burden to Defendent and consequences to the community of imposing a duty to exercise care with resulting liability for breach;
and the availability, cost and prevalence of insurance for the risk involved.


  Of these  factors, the California Supreme Court held that foreseeability was most  important when establishing a duty because a defendant generally owes a duty of  care to all persons endangered by his or her conduct, with respect to all risks  that make the conduct unreasonably dangerous. Moreover, when the avoidance of  foreseeable harm requires a defendant to control or warn about the conduct of  another person, a defendant is generally liable only if the defendant had a  special relationship with the dangerous person or to the potential victim.  Since the relationship between a therapist and the patient constitutes a special  relationship, the Court determined that the defendant-therapists had a duty to  use reasonable care to protect Tatiana Tarasoff and breached that  duty.
The Tarasoff Rule
"When a therapist determines, or pursuant to the standards of  his profession, should determine, that his patient presents a serious  danger of violence to another, he  incurs an obligation to use reasonable  care to protect the intended victim against such danger." 
"[T]he judgment of the therapist in diagnosing emotional  disorders and in predicting whether a patient presents a serious danger of  violence is comparable to the judgment which doctors and professionals must  regularly render under accepted rules of responsibility."
In other words, The  Court also rejected as "entirely speculative" the defendant-therapists'  predictions that imposing a duty to warn on therapists would deter some  violent patients from seeking counseling and would disrupt the treatment of  other patients.  Moreover, the Court concluded that the claim that  psychiatric patients could be harmed if their therapist warned their potential  victims was "uncertain and conjectural." 
Social Science Evidence: The Difficulties of Predicting  Dangerousness
In Tarasoff, the defendant-therapists urged the Court to  consider evidence demonstrating that predictions of future dangerousness are  inherently unreliable.  The evidence  presented by the defendants was admissible under the following admissibility tests:

Frye General Acceptance Test: This test states that scientific evidence may be admitted if it is both relevant to the case at bar and is generally accepted as true by the scientific community.
Daubert Sound Methodology Test: This test requires that the scientific evidence be relevant and that it reflect good science derived through sound methodology.  Factors that may indicate whether a piece of scientific evidence meets this test include: demonstrable error rates, testing, peer-review, and general acceptance in the scientific community.
Federal Rule of Evidence 702:
   "If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if (1) the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data, (2) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods, and (3) the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case."


  The defendant-therapists argued that the imposition of a duty to  exercise reasonable care to protect third persons was impractical because  therapists could not accurately predict whether or not a patient would resort  to violence.  
The American Psychiatric Association ("APA") and other  organizations agreed, arguing that imposing a duty to warn on therapists would:

Cause therapists to over predict violence;
make providers reluctant to treat dangerous patients;
make violent patients less likely to seek treatment; and
diminish the effectiveness of treatments



The California Supreme Court cited to Dr. Bernard Diamond’s 1974  article, Psychiatric Predictions of Dangerousness, in which he argues  that dangerousness cannot be reliably predicted.  Diamond’s article referred to several recent  studies:

A study by Dr. Carl P. Malmquist, in which he determined that warning signs and symptoms typically found in violent offenders are also commonly found in people who never commit a violent act
Another study followed 967 patients who had previously been confined in a hospital for the criminally insane and were transferred to ordinary civil mental health hospitals after the Supreme Court ruled that their continued confinement violated the Equal Protection Clause.  Only twenty-six patients committed acts serious enough to warrant their return to a maximum-security hospital for the criminally insane.
Other studies demonstrate that conditions most clearly recognized as mental illness, such as schizophrenia and the other psychoses, are not found significantly more often in the criminal population.

Although it agreed with the defendants’ evidence, the Tarasoff Court ultimately held that Poddar’s psychiatrists were liable for failure  to warn (also referred to in this case as "failure to protect").
Thompson v. County of Alameda
The claimants brought a wrongful death action against the County  of Alameda following their release of James F., a juvenile offender.  The claimants alleged that James F. knew that  he had "latent, extremely dangerous and violent propensities regarding young  children and that sexual assaults upon young children and violence connected  therewith were a likely result of releasing [him] into the community."  The claimants also maintained that James F.  had stated that he would kill a neighborhood child if released. Despite this  threat, the county temporarily released James F. into his mother’s custody  without warning local police or nearby families. Almost immediately, James F.  sexually assaulted and murdered the claimant’s five year-old son.  
After noting that the county has discretionary authority to  release James and disposing of other minor matters, the Court held that the County  did not have a duty to warn the community prior to the release. The Court found  that parole and probation decisions do not encourage open dialogue in the same  way as psychiatrist-patient relationships. The Court also noted that parole  decisions are imprecise and cited to a study showing that that nearly 18% of  parolees nationwide violate their probation before they have served their  terms. Since the County functions as an arm of the public, the Court held that  the public at large bears the cost of failed rehabilitation. 

  Ultimately, the Supreme Court of California held that the county  was immune from suit under Cal. Gov’t Code Section: 820.2, because the decision  not to warn was a matter of discretion.   Moreover, the County also had immunity under Cal. Gov’t Code Section:  845.8(a), which grants immunity to decisions regarding the release of a  prisoner
Explaining the Verdicts
At the time when Tarasoff and Thompson were being decided, courts were moving from  corrective justice to a more "functional ideal" in which the courts were "risk  regulators." This functionalism enlarged the scope of tort liability in favor  of furthering policy goals, such as allocation of risk. 
The California Supreme Court has held that foreseeability is  most important factor when establishing a duty because a defendant generally  owes a duty of care to all persons endangered by his conduct.  When the avoidance of foreseeable harm  requires a defendant to control or warn about the conduct of another person, a  defendant is generally liable only if  the defendant had a special relationship with the dangerous person or to the  potential victim.  Since the relationship  between a therapist and his patient is a special relationship, the Court  determined that the defendants in Tarasoff had a duty to use reasonable care  to protect Tatiana Tarasoff.  Moreover,  since the County in Thompson did not  have a special relationship with the claimants, it was under no obligation to  warn them about John F.’s release.
Legislative Impact
In California, a psychiatrist’s duty to warn is now labeled as a  duty to protect:
California  Code § 43.92 (as Amended in 2012)
Psychotherapists;  duty to warn of threatened violent behavior of patient; immunity from monetary  liability
(a) There shall be no monetary liability on the part of, and no  cause of action shall arise against, any person who is a psychotherapist as  defined in Section 1010 of the Evidence Code in failing to protect from a  patient's threatened violent behavior or failing to predict and protect from a  patient's violent behavior except if the patient has communicated to the  psychotherapist a serious threat of physical violence against a reasonably  identifiable victim or victims.
(b) There shall be no monetary liability on the part of, and no  cause of action shall arise against, a psychotherapist who, under the limited  circumstances specified in subdivision (a), discharges his or her duty to  protect by making reasonable efforts to communicate the threat to the  victim or victims and to a law enforcement agency.
Impact  on Mental Health Professionals

The number of therapists warning potential victims have doubled
Therapists are more likely to take more careful and deliberate steps to determine patient dangerousness
Therapists have a greater awareness of the violent patient's potential for acting out and use closer scrutiny and better documentation when treating their patients
Psychiatrists are now more careful to inform patients at the outset of treatment regarding the limits of their confidentiality
Studies demonstrate that Tarasoff did not have disastrous results on patients-psychiatrist confidentiality as originally predicted (See Fillmore Buckner & Marvin Firestone, "Where the Public Peril Begins" 25 Years After Tarasoff, 21 J. LEGAL MED. 187 (2000)).

 
How Psychiatrists Evaluate Patients Today
While psychiatrists still use evaluative tools, such as scales,  to diagnose and treat patients, the APA Practice Guide states that these types  of evaluative tools are not all-inclusive.   Specifically, the guidelines state:


 "[R]ating scales should never be used alone to establish a diagnosis or clinical treatment plan; they can augment but not supplant the clinician's evaluation, narrative, and clinical judgment."


Psychiatrists use mental status examinations to  determine whether patients pose a threat to themselves or others.  This type of examination typically contains  the following elements:
  (1)  Appearance and general behavior
  (2) Motor  activity
  (3)  Speech
  (4) Mood  and affect
  (5)  Thought processes
  (6)  Thought content
  (7)  Perceptual disturbances
  (8)  Sensorium and cognition
  (9)  Insight
  (10)  Judgment
Currently the APA maintains that: 


 "[A psychiatrists] default position is to maintain confidentiality unless the patient gives consent to a specific intervention or Communication. However, the psychiatrist is justified in attenuating confidentiality to the extent needed to address the safety of the patient and others."


Conclusion
Despite the decades since the Tarasoff and Thompson decisions,  psychiatrists today are still unable to accurately predict the dangerousness of  psychiatric patients.  Thus, in cases where a defendant’s duty to warn may  stem from a third party’s potential dangerousness, courts will need to continue  to determine liability by weighing important policy interests against the risks  posed by potentially dangerous persons instead of purely relying on  psychiatrists’ predictions of dangerousness.
