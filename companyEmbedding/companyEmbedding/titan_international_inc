                                Low Sidewall (LSW) assemblies feature a larger rim diameter and smaller tire sidewall than conventional tire and wheel assemblies. LSW technology is helping to eliminate problems that farmers face including road lope, power hop and soil compaction. Titan is the only company able to design, test and produce both wheels and tires for the agriculture markets.

About Titan

Who We AreTitan has a heritage of over 100 years in the off-highway wheel manufacturing business. Since Titan's entrance into the tire market in 1993, we have evolved into a leading global supplier of complete wheel and tire assemblies for off-highway vehicles. Titan's primary markets include agriculture, earthmoving/construction and consumer applications.
 
Strategic acquisitions have built Titan into a successful worldwide corporation serving the most respected names in the original equipment industry. With that support, Titan is expanding its focus in the off-highway markets.

Our History
1890Titan traces its roots to the Electric Wheel Company in Quincy, Illinois. Founded by John A. Stillwell and three associates, the company originally produced wheels for wagons and farm implements, later progressing into the manufacture of wagons, tractors and other implements.

1957Electric Wheel became a division of Firestone Tire & Rubber's Steel Product Division.

1982Due to setbacks caused by several strikes in the farm implement manufacturing industry, Firestone shut down its operations and sold off certain assets.

1983Certain assets of the Firestone facility were purchased by Titan Proform of Toronto, led by the late Canadian industrialist Joseph Tanenbaum and Maurice Taylor Jr., current Titan chairman and CEO. The new company was named Can-Am Industries.

1986When Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company decided to exit the steel wheel and rim business, it provided an excellent opportunity for Can-Am to purchase certain agricultural wheel-making assets. Can-Am installed the Goodyear equipment to manufacture "power adjust" wheels at the Quincy facility.

1988Can-Am purchased certain assets of French & Hecht's wheel plant in Walcott, Iowa, an indirect subsidiary of the Fruehauf Corporation. This purchase added to the capacity to manufacture wheels and rims for the agricultural industry.

1989Can-Am entered a joint venture agreement with New Warrington Wheel Company of Merseyside, England, marking the company's expansion into the European market. Ownership was increased in 1991, and the Titan name was added.

1990Tanenbaum began restructuring his holdings in Can-Am. MascoTech, Inc., a leading auto parts manufacturer headquartered in Taylor, Michigan, split ownership with Tannenbaum and Taylor through a leveraged buyout. The company was renamed Titan Wheel International, Inc. and a new era began.

1991Titan acquired certain assets of Berkeley-Davis International, Inc., a specialist in welding and technology equipment. This expertise was used to strengthen Titan's technological abilities in steel welding. This subsidiary was sold in 1996 as Titan redefined its focus on wheel and tire assemblies.

1992Taylor and MascoTech bought out Tanenbaum's interest in Titan, thereby resulting in Taylor holding 53 percent ownership.

1993Titan acquired certain assets of Auto Wheel Group, Inc. from NI Industries, Inc., a MascoTech affiliate. As Automotive Wheels, the company manufactured steel and aluminum rims sold to wheel manufacturers in the automotive and light truck aftermarket, as well as assemblies and steel wheels for sale to OEMs in the North American automobile industry.
Titan became a publicly traded company on NASDAQ in May of 1993. The initial offering included 2,700,000 shares of common stock offered at $15 per share.
Titan also announced the stock exchange purchase of Dyneer Corporation, a manufacturer of small diameter off-road wheels and tires for all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), lawn and garden equipment, golf cars, recreational and utility trailers, as well as mechanical differentials, clutches and brakes. The purchase of Dyneer extended Titan's product offering into the smaller wheel market and marked the entry into the tire business.
Titan acquired certain assets of Dotson Wheel of Saltville, Virginia, now known as Titan Wheel Corporation of Virginia. This acquisition added to the company's strength by expanding the ability to produce wheels for the construction and mining industries.

1994Titan announced the purchase of Nieman's Ltd. with its two facilities in Ventura, Iowa, and Elkhart, Indiana, a national distributor of tires, wheels, axle assemblies and component parts to OEMs.
In March, the company's growing size and revenues prompted a move to the New York Stock Exchange, trading under the symbol TWI.
In July 1994, Titan acquired certain assets of the Pirelli Armstrong Tire Corporation facility in Des Moines, Iowa, under the name of Titan Tire Corporation. The facility specializes in manufacturing agricultural tires, complementing Titan's line of agricultural wheels. This allowed agricultural equipment buyers to receive the added service of a wheel and tire assembly both manufactured by Titan.
Also in 1994, Titan purchased a facility in Greenwood, South Carolina, in order to expand Titan's wheel production and distribution network in the southeastern United States. Titan expanded its manufacturing base in Europe in November of 1994, buying 50 percent of the Sirmac Group of Italy, a major European manufacturer of specialty wheels and other products for the agricultural and construction markets.

1995In February of 1995, Titan purchased from Lemmerz Holding GmbH, Lemmerz UK Limited (now Titan Steel Wheels, Limited), an England-based manufacturer of steel wheels for off-road specialty vehicles. Titan Steel Wheels, Ltd. is now the largest manufacturer of construction wheels in Europe with an 80 percent market share.
In December, the company purchased certain assets of Metallbau Grasdorf GmbH near Hannover, Germany. Titan Germany GmbH manufactures wheels and rims for the earthmoving and agricultural markets, supporting Titan's facilities in England and Italy.
Titan stock split three-for-two twice in 1995. The first stock split was effective on February 15, 1995, with a March 15 payable date. The second three-for-two split had a record date of July 31, 1995 and a payable date of August 31.

1996In July, Titan completed the acquisition of the Sirmac Group of Italy. Sirmac, in Modena, produces idler wheels for Caterpillar, Inc. Siria, in Bologna, manufactures agricultural wheels. In September, Titan announced plans to build an agricultural and construction tire plant in Brownsville, Texas.
Tractech, the subsidiary which manufactured differentials, was divested as Titan chose to concentrate on wheel and tire assemblies. This marked the elimination of Titan's engineered products sector.
Titan acquired the wheel subsidiary of the French manufacturing company, Delachaux, which has been renamed Titan France SA.

1997Titan reorganized its operations into separate wheel and tire groups, Titan Wheel Corporation and Titan Tire Corporation, to provide the framework for continued world-wide expansion in both sectors. The wheel and tire groups have individual presidents, while Taylor serves as chairman and CEO of the parent company.
A breakthrough concept in wheel and tire assemblies, named the Grizz LSW series, was unveiled. The assemblies, which were designed to meet the needs of off-highway vehicle applications, feature a larger wheel and a lower tire sidewall than traditional designs.
A corporate name change to Titan International, Inc. was approved by the shareholders in May to more accurately reflect the identity as a manufacturer of both wheels and tires.
Titan acquired certain assets of American Welding of Warren, Ohio, which served as a development center for patent-pending multi-piece off-highway wheels, utilizing the plant's capacity to produce rolled and seamless rings.
Titan divested the Automotive Wheels facility in a continuing effort to concentrate on core business.

1998Titan purchased the assets of Condere Corporation, including Fidelity Tire, through U.S. Bankruptcy Court and renamed the Natchez, Mississippi, tire manufacturing facility Titan Tire Corporation of Natchez.

1999Subsidiary Titan Europe Plc acquired 35.9 percent of the stock of Wheels India Limited, the largest manufacturer of steel wheels for all applications in the Indian sub-continent.
Caterpillar Inc. became one of the first original equipment manufacturers (OEM) to take advantage of Titan’s private branding program for LSW and standard assemblies, resulting in tires bearing the Caterpillar name.

2000In April 2000, Titan exited the lawn and garden and ATV wheel and tire business for original equipment manufacturers with the sale of certain assets of facilities located in Clinton, Tennessee, and Slinger, Wisconsin, to Carlisle Tire & Wheel Company. Titan remained active in the aftermarket for these products.

2001Labor strikes brought against Titan in 1998 by the United Steelworkers of America at facilities in Des Moines, Iowa, and Natchez, Mississippi, were settled resulting in five-year contracts.

2002Titan became the only tire manufacturer to receive the Society for Engineering in Agricultural, Food and Biological Systems (ASAE) AE50 award for innovation in product technology four consecutive years.

2003Titan's flagship wheel facility in Quincy, Illinois, expanded manufacturing capability in December when Titan Wheel Corporation of Iowa ceased wheel manufacturing in Walcott, Iowa.

2004Titan Europe Plc, previously a wholly-owned subsidiary, was admitted to trading on London’s AIM Exchange. A Titan subsidiary retained a 30 percent interest in this new European public company.

2005Titan Tire Corporation closed on the acquisition of Goodyear's North American farm tire assets, which included the manufacturing facility in Freeport, Illinois.

2006Titan Tire Corporation of Bryan acquired the off-the-road (OTR) tire assets of Continental Tire North America, Inc. in Bryan, Ohio. This acquisition expanded Titan's product offering into larger earthmoving, construction and mining tires, in addition to the added manufacturing capacity of the Bryan, Ohio facility.

2011Titan Tire Corporation closed on the acquisition of Goodyear's Latin American farm tire business in Sao Paulo, Brazil.  The transaction included Sao Paulo's manufacturing plant, property, equipment and licensing agreement similar to the North American Goodyear farm asset purchase in 2005.
Titan also closed on asset purchases in Automation International and Ohio Machinery in 2011 which included molds, welding equipment and technology needed for the existing factories.
Titan Tire Corporation purchased the physical assets of Goodyear's Union City, TN plant.  This purchase included land, building and mixing equipment.  A portion of this facility is used for rubber mixing plant for the tire locations.

2012In August, Titan purchased a 56 percent controlling interest in Planet Corporation Group based in Perth, Australia. This location will help extend our mining presence.
In October, Titan closed on the purchase of Titan Europe, Plc in a Share Offer of 5.6 million shares of common stock. The value of the new shares issued was approximately $121.8M. Prior to the purchase, Titan International held a 21.8% interest in Titan Europe. Titan Europe is in the wheel and undercarriage business for Ag, Construction and Mining markets around the globe.

2013In October, Titan in partnership with One Equity Partners and the Russian Direct Investment Fund closed the acquisition of an 85% interest in Voltyre-Prom, a leading producer of agricultural and industrial tires in Volgograd, Russia, for approximately $94.0 million. Titan will act as operating partner with responsibility for Voltyre-Prom's daily operations on behalf of the consortium of which Titan initially held a 30% interest. In 2014, the partnership of Titan, OPE and RDIF purchased an additional 14% to bring the total Voltyre-Prom ownership to 99%. In 2016, Titan acquired an additional $25.0 million of additional shares to increase its ownership to 43%.

2015In November, Titan entered into a licensing agreement with Goodyear which allows Titan to distribute and sell Goodyear-brand farm tires in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Russia and other Commonwealth of Independent States countries, as well as manufacture such farm tires in parts of the licensed territory outside the European Union.
Also in November, Titan sold the assets of its North American brake and actuator business.

2016In March, Titan Tire Reclamation Corp. celebrated its grand opening in Fort McMurray, Canada, the oil sands of North America.  After years of research and development, Titan Tire Reclamation Corp developed a unique environmental solution to process giant scrap mining tires.

Titan- A Leader in Rhenium Production

Titan is the leading producer of recycled Rhenium metal products ("Re") in North America. Titan has developed unique and proprietary manufacturing processes that enable Titan to produce Pure Rhenium metal ("Re") and Ammonium Perrhenate ("APR") products.  Titan's Re pellets, Catalyst Grade APR and specialty Re powders have been used in the most demanding industries by the world's most quality-conscious manufacturers.  Contact Titan today about Rhenium.


Toll Processing Services
Titan has several successful models for recycling including grading of super alloy scrap and rhenium reclaim.  Clients that consume Re products in combination with toll processing services are able to increase material value from the byproducts and lower overall material cost.  Titan can also recover Pt and valuable constituent metals that may be present in significant quantities and return either metal or cash.


Ammonium Perrhenate (APR) and Perrhenic Acid

Titan’s APR is available in various grades depending on customer specs.  For economical rhenium units, basic grade APR is available for further refining.  For manufacture of catalyst or organometallic chemicals, Titan has refining processes to meet low residual specifications. Perrhenic acid is produced on demand in Titan’s wet chemistry lab.  Let Titan quote your APR requirements today. 


Rhenium Pellets

Titan’s rhenium pellets are ideal for alloy melting.  Standard packaging includes argon purge and vacuum packaging for storage in small increments.  For melt shop agreements, Titan will package as requested, including private labels where appropriate.  Protecting customer value is a Titan tradition which is how Titan arrived in the rhenium business around 2010.  Ask us about Titan’s rhenium pellet story.  Whether your application is land based turbines or high performance jet engines, Titan ensures high quality pellets with excellent melt recovery.


Rhenium Powder

Titan’s rhenium powder production is engineered for PM – the powder metallurgy industry.  Titan’s decades of experience with tungsten and molybdenum powders are a great background for rhenium metal powder.  With in-house blending ability and custom sizing, Titan’s Re powder can create tremendous value for your application.  Titan’s powder processing technology has delivered pure rhenium spherical powder as well as micron sizes for additive manufacturing and missile technology applications.  Challenge Titan with a powder application today.




Laboratory Testing, Inc. is Nadcap accredited with Merit Status by the Performance Review Institute (PRI) in materials and nondestructive testing, and A2LA accredited in accordance with ISO/IEC 17025 in calibration, dimensional inspection and materials testing services, including mechanical, metallurgical and chemical.
