NetVisit™ Video Visitation 

Reducing the Administrative Burden on Corrections Staff .....
Maintaining the Bond Between Inmates and Their Families and Friends









Secure Video Visitation Solution Significantly Reduces Corrections Staff Burden
Transporting inmates for live visitation sessions with family and friends is an extremely costly and time-consuming task for corrections staff, one that also involves security risks. Lattice’s NetVisitTM Video Visitation solution significantly reduces these labor hours, costs, and security risks by minimizing inmate transport.
For inmates, there is the added benefit of seeing their spouses, children, parents, and friends over live video on a frequent basis. Maintaining this connection and bond can promote inmate self-improvement during incarceration and help reduce recidivism upon release.
NetVisit is a complete solution that includes all hardware, software and support for scheduling, monitoring and recording secure video visitation sessions.



Installation Flexibility
Our corrections-grade, tamper-resistant MaxVisitTM video stations are available in Powder-Coated and Stainless Steel options.
These stations are highly energy-efficient – each station uses less energy than the average light bulb.
We offer fixed, mounted stations, along with Mobile video units for applications such as Medical.


Robust Software Interface
Our NetVisit software platform features a user-friendly interface and works with any standard Web browser.
Authorized corrections staff can schedule visits, monitor multiple live visits simultaneously, communicate with all parties during live sessions, and record visits to access for investigative purposes.
Customizable Reports track visit history and system usage over a range of criteria input by corrections staff.

NetVisit™ Video Arraignment 

Reducing Corrections Staff Labor Burden and Costs...
Increasing Efficiency In the Jail and the Courtroom










Increasing Efficiency In the Jail AND In the Courtroom
Transporting inmates to a courtroom for arraignment involves significant time, cost, and security risks for corrections staff.  Lattice’s NetVisitTM Video Arraignment is an innovative technology that enables inmates to remain at the jail facility while a Judge conducts the arraignment over a secure, real-time video connection.  The process is extremely efficient, utilizing a video station at the Judge’s chambers and one at the jail facility.



Significant Labor Time and Cost Savings
With a video station conveniently located at the jail facility, corrections staff no longer needs to transport inmates on foot or in vehicles to a separate courtroom.
Correctional facilities will save time and money, and corrections staff will be able to focus on higher-priority responsibilities.


Reduced Security Risk In the Jail and the Courtroom
Eliminating the need to transport inmates to a courthouse will reduce the security risk to corrections staff, courtroom staff, and attendees.

 A phlebotomy application is included in Lattice Inc.'s
MediCopia, a suite of automated information systems for in-patent
caregiving.

 MediCopia consists of a handheld computer, barcode scanner, barcode
printer, and laboratory information system (LIS) interface. Caregivers
download the collection list to handheld computers, rather than printing
labels. At the bedside, caregivers scan patients' identification
bracelets before drawing blood, ensuring positive patient
identification. Barcoded specimen labels are printed at bedside. After
the specimens are drawn, MediCopia transfers data to the LIS.

Emerging leader in regenerative medicine
Lattice is an emerging personalized/precision medicine leader in the field of cellular therapies and tissue engineering, with a focus on bone, skin, and cartilage regeneration.  Lattice develops and processes biologic products to domestic and international markets.
Lattice Biologics’ Extracellular Matrix (ECM) technology powers Next Generation Allografts for dramatically improved surgical outcomes.
More than a million allografts (bone, ligament, cartilage, tendon or skin transplanted from one person to another) are used in the United States, alone, each year for a wide variety of surgical applications ranging from reconstruction to orthopedic, spine, sports medicine, cardiac, dental, and cosmetic procedures.  Allograft transplantation has been used for decades to help everyone from athletes who need knee reconstruction to patients suffering from back pain and cancer patients who undergo surgery.  These operations rely on the invaluable gift of donors, but not all allograft procedures are successful.
Lattice Biologics is passionately committed to honoring the gift of tissue donation and “stacking the deck” to maximize all patients’ results which is why we have devoted extensive ongoing research to improve the surgical outcomes for allograft recipients.  This was the impetus for developing Next Generation Allograft Technology.
Unlike the undirected scaffold allograft products currently available on the market, Lattice Biologics’ Next Generation Allografts drastically improve post-surgical healing and reduce recovery time for allograft recipients.  
Read on to learn more about this technology and how Lattice is utilizing it to improve patient outcomes.



















 EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX (ECM) Dramatically improves healing and reduces recovery times.

PRESSURE TREATED

Pressure treatment is a process that forces chemical preservatives into
	 the wood. Wood is placed inside a closed cylinder, then vacuum and pressure
	 are applied to force the preservatives into the wood. The preservatives
	 help protect the wood from attack by termites, other insects, and fungal
	 decay. This material is great for retaining walls and fences that have
	 soil contact.

CEDAR

This species of lumber is best for any type of board or picket fence -
	 as long as the bottom of the fence is not continually touching the ground.
	 Cedar is a very stable wood. It does not warp, shrink, or check. A fence
	 using cedar boards will have a nice appearance as it ages.

To make the most of this space, it's helpful to have supplies that make it easy to work in the garage and have plenty of room while you're working on projects. Because we have low prices, every day, on everything, we can help you achieve this for much less than you may think.garage door openersFor easy access to your garage, install a garage door opener. It makes it easy to get into or out of your garage without getting out of your vehicle thanks to an included remote control. You can also go out the garage door from the house with just the touch of a button. These openers are powered by a belt drive and an engine that ranges from 1/2 to 1 horsepower. Most garage door openers have two remotes and allow access via a wireless keypad system. Work benchesBecause you may be working on various projects in your garage, you might want to invest in a workbench too. Many of these workbenches have wood tops with either drawers or open storage space underneath to conveniently house your most used tools. Some workbenches double as sawhorses that have vises attached and allow you to work on projects without holding down the items with your hands. Some workbenches have high backs so you can attach pegboard to hang small tools and other items from it.Garage cabinets and storageIf you need additional storage for items that you want to keep behind closed doors, consider either freestanding cabinets or wall-mounted cabinets. These cabinets can have as many as six shelves and feature one or two sections. Some of the freestanding units have casters on the bottom and allow you to move them about freely. Some units have both drawer and cabinet space if you need to store small tools and larger tools or other items at the same time. The heights on these units range from less than 20 inches to as much as 100 inches or more. The widths range from around 5 inches to more than 45 inches. This variety lets you choose what's best for your needs.Garage shelvingIf enclosed storage isn't what you want, there are several varieties of open shelving units from which you can choose. Most of these feature two to five shelves, with some having a back. Most units stand in one place, but some have casters and allow you to roll them wherever you need them to go. Most are metal with metal shelves or metal with wood composite shelves. Some are plastic for lighter weight or steel for strength, and all shelving comes unassembled.Tool storageSince this is a garage, it's likely that you have several tools lying around. The best way to keep track of your tools is with a tool box to tool chest or by placing them on a pegboard on a wall of the garage. Tool boxes, for the most part, are portable and allow you to carry your essential tools and related items (think nails, screws and other fasteners) to a job site or whenever you might need quick access to them. Tool boxes usually have a top that opens and two or three drawers that slide out. The top is secured with clasps that flip closed. There are also tool bags that work like a tool box but look like a duffel bag. For added portability, we have some tool boxes that resemble luggage and even have wheels that allow you to pull or push them along.For working at home or long term on a job site, a tool chest is more suitable. These have much more space and allow you to store many more tools. These tool boxes have a top that opens, have anywhere from two to eight drawers and sometimes have open storage space on the bottom, ideal for power tools. Although some of these chests are stationary, most of them have casters and allow you to have access to them wherever you're working. Many of these chests are metal, but some are rigid plastic or aluminum too. Red and black are common colors, but there are other colors available, including some that are two-tone. Another feature of tool chests is that they're more secure because you can lock them with a key.Show moreElectrode, Comp-115863884, DC-prod-dfw2, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-

Maybe the exterior walls have become dingy or weathered, or maybe it's just time for a new paint scheme to go with your updated decor. Whatever your reasons, using quality paints, supplies and tools helps you get the job done right and fast, and it also helps you create a look that you'll love. Check out the paints, wall coverings and paint products we have at Walmart. We have low prices, every day, on everything, making it easy to get all the painting supplies you need.Interior and exterior paints and primersNo matter what you need to paint, we have the paint for it. Use interior wall and trim paint in the correct formulation for any room in your home   whether you're painting your baby's nursery or adding dynamic color to your living room. There are exterior wall and trim paints that can give that 10-year-old paint job on the outside of your home a refreshed look. If you're painting inside and looking to hide some imperfections above, use ceiling paints that can do the job. Maybe you have a dull finish on your refrigerator or dishwasher, but they still work like new. Refresh the exterior of these items with appliance paint. If you have oil stains and oil paint spills you want to cover up on your garage floor, concrete stain or paint or concrete coating can make everything look uniform.Paints come in several types and are used at certain points during the painting process or used to create certain finishes:Primer   Primer is the first coat of paint that goes on either new or uncoated surfaces and is suitable for protecting the surface of what you're painting. Primer is available as either oil-based or water-based. When applying primer, you can use any paint tool to apply it, such as a paintbrush, roller or pad. Don't use a paint sprayer, however; it can clog.Flat   A type of latex paint, flat paints are commonly used for ceilings and interior walls. Exterior flat paints sometimes have vinyl mixed in to make them more durable. To apply flat paint, you can use a paintbrush or roller. This type of paint is completely matte without any shine.Eggshell   For paint that has a slight shine to it, use eggshell paint, especially on wood surfaces. Except for a paint sprayer, you can apply eggshell paint any way you want.Gloss and satin   Gloss and satin are virtually the same paints, except that satin has less shine to it. Ideal for both interiors and exteriors, gloss and satin paints are best applied with a paintbrush.StainsStains are used both inside and outside the home. Inside, people use them most often on furniture that's either brand new, sometimes referred to as nude furniture, or furniture they're restoring. Outside, desks and patios are the most frequent places people use stains. You might want to use interior wood stain to make furniture match what's already in your home. Wood stain is also terrific at bringing out the wood's natural grain. For both inside and out, stains are available in three forms: water-based, oil-based and gel stain, which is an oil-based wood stain that has a no-drip formula and is ideal for painting walls or other vertical surfaces. Water-based stains have less odor and dry faster, and they're popular for interior wood staining.Wallpaper and wall bordersFor those who want a change from painted walls, wallpaper and wall borders are another way to go. The styles of wallpaper are almost as varied as the colors of wall paint. Many wallpaper schemes draw from the style of furniture that's in a home, meaning you have traditional, modern, contemporary or Scandinavian wallpaper styles to choose from. For children's rooms, cartoon characters and animal prints are terrific options. For the edges around a room's ceiling you can use wallpaper borders, which are peel-and-stick pieces, to set off your wallpaper. If you want, you can combine painted walls with wall decals, which don t take up entire walls. Although some wallpaper is the peel-and-stick kind, for others you'll need to invest in some wallpaper epoxy or glue and smoothing tools, scoring tools and stripping liquid for removing any existing wallpaper.Other paint productsIn addition to paintbrushes, rollers, pads and sprayers, there are other tools you may need to include for your painting job. These include painter's masking tape for covering areas that you don t want to risk getting paint on, sandpaper for smoothing any wood surfaces before painting or staining them, tarps or drop cloths for protecting the floor and furniture, paint trays for accessing paint and protective gear like masks and goggles if you're using a paint sprayer.Show moreElectrode, Comp-115863890, DC-prod-dfw2, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-
