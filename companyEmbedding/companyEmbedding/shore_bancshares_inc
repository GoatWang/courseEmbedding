Corbyn Investment Management, Inc.

                                    Corbyn Investment Management's objective is to provide strong, consistent performance for their clients throughout an entire market cycle. The firm seeks to limit downward volatility during unfavorable market environments and steadily grow capital during better times. For the equities in their portfolios, Corbyn pursues a value-oriented investment philosophy and purchases stocks they believe are undervalued in relation to the company’s earnings, cash flow and intrinsic value. They also look for company-specific catalysts for future appreciation. For fixed-income securities, Corbyn favors bonds with near-term maturities that are capable of producing a combination of attractive income streams and, from time to time, capital appreciation potential. Their strategies include: Strategic Value, Capital Appreciation, Balanced, and Strategic Income.^^The Greenspring Fund's primary investment objective is long-term capital appreciation through a total return approach to investing.  Income is an important, but secondary, objective. The Fund employs a value-oriented approach to equities and also places emphasis on special situation fixed income securities. The Fund also invests in fixed income securities to reduce portfolio volatility. The fixed income securities held in the Fund are often high- yielding corporate and convertible bonds. Many of the holdings possess a put feature. The expected return on these investments can be calculated in advance, thus, there is little correlation to movements in the overall markets.^^
