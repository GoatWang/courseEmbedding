                                It is in a great location. Next to alot of major shopping plazas. The amount of money per month for them would be worth it if it was updated.

Overview
In 1776, Georgia's population was around 40,000. Today, it's ranked tenth among the states with a population of 8.6 million. Growth isn't the only interesting feature about the Peach State; from ancient mountains to rolling rivers, charming towns to the bustling metropolis of Atlanta, Georgia offers plenty of features to attract newcomers on the search for apartment rentals.
What to Expect

Georgia's economy peaked in the 19th century due to its vast cotton and rice plantations fueled by slave labor, which made it one of the wealthiest Southern states. The Civil War and its aftermath were major turning points in the economic and social life of Georgia. The state was devastated during the war, and the abolition of slavery made an enormous impact on the economy. However, in recent decades, manufacturing and service industries have instituted a resurgence in the state's economy, making employment and apartments more plentiful.
The weather is generally mild in much of the state, with hot and humid summers and cool winters, with temperatures only dropping to the 40s and 50s. And as for snow? Snowfall is rare except in the mountains.
Where to Explore

Residents and tourists alike enjoy Georgia's many historical sites and natural attractions throughout the state. Scenic mountains, lakes, rivers and coastal areas provide a wide range of outdoor activities. There are also many historic sites of interest in Georgia, most of them associated with the elegant plantation lifestyle of antebellum days, as well as the Civil War.
Atlanta Apartments

Atlanta, the largest city in the state, is often considered the capital of the South. With a population of 416,000 and rising, the city's growth is matched by rapid economic expansion. "Hotlanta" houses the headquarters of some of the largest and best-known companies in the nation, including Coca-Cola, United Parcel Service, Georgia-Pacific Corporation, Turner Broadcasting System and Delta Air Lines. Tall buildings and busy streets are to be found at Five Points, the city's historic business center. Away from the hustle and bustle, you can still find charming neighborhoods (some even with apartments available), tree-shaded streets and friendly communities. Average apartment rentals cost $931 with utilities at $93, putting it on par with apartments for rent in cities like Philadelphia and Los Angeles.
Columbus Apartments

Located 95 miles southwest of Atlanta, Columbus is Georgia's second largest city with 186,000 residents. Fort Benning, a large United States Army infantry base, is nearby, which contributes to Columbus's strong military and patriotic culture. It's 7.4% cheaper to live in Columbus than in Atlanta, a feature that may come in handy when looking for apartments there.
Savannah Apartments

Savannah, with a population of 131,000, was the largest city in Georgia until Atlanta overtook it in the 20th century. A thriving industrial center and seaport, Savannah is the oldest city in the state and has retained much of the culture of its gracious past, retaining its sense of Southern charm and old-fashioned hospitality. World-class restaurants, Civil War forts, art galleries, fine antique shops and other attractions make Savannah a terrific place to call home. From elegant homes in the historic Gardens District to modern apartments for rent close to downtown, housing options are plentiful.Rent.com is a free rental site that offers a large selection of trusted apartments and houses for rent.

                                It is in a great location. Next to alot of major shopping plazas. The amount of money per month for them would be worth it if it was updated.

I could not sleep because they make a lot of noise. They leave there mess everywhere in the kitchen and there are bugs that fly everywhere. The nates get into the freezer and die there around my food. My freezer doesn't freeze very well, any icecream I put in there goes bad. The maintenance help is very horrible. They don't know exactly what they are doing. I was told I would get another refrigerator but I didn't get it. The dishwasher floods and smells.04-07-2016Was this helpful?

                                It is in a great location. Next to alot of major shopping plazas. The amount of money per month for them would be worth it if it was updated.

                                It is in a great location. Next to alot of major shopping plazas. The amount of money per month for them would be worth it if it was updated.

Though the population of Decatur is less than 20,000, the city has a much larger feel due to its close proximity to Atlanta. Despite experiencing tough times during the 1960's and 70's, Decatur has since regained economic vigor. Several long-term plans to develop downtown have turned Decatur into a trendy suburb with easy transit to the big city. Decatur citizens have a reputation for their progressiveness and active involvement within their city. With the motto, "A city of homes, schools and places of worship," Decatur is an ideal place to live if you want to work and play in a big city, but live and relax in a small town. 
Living in Decatur, GA
Decatur was founded in 1822 at the crossroads of two Native American trails, but established itself as a cozy town in the 1830s, when it refused an offer from Western and Atlantic Railroad to become the last stop on its line. Citizens at the time did not want the pollution or population boom that would have come with the railway, which means residents today can enjoy the peaceful living of Decatur while still being within close proximity to the place that did end up with that railroad stop: Atlanta. With the percentage of its citizens who have at least a bachelor's degree nearly double that of the state average, Decatur prides itself on its forward-thinking government and citizens. Because of this, the city's population has steadily grown over the past twenty years, while still remaining solidly grounded in its provincial history.
In one of Decatur's nineteen distinct neighborhoods, you are bound to find a style of rental home or apartment you love at the price point you desire. Whether it's the historic single family estates of Winnona Park, the brick Cape Cod style homes of Midway Woods or the more modest craftsman bungalows of Oakhurst, Decatur's architectural diversity will make finding a rental a piece of cake.
Decatur Work & Study
Located just seven miles outside of Downtown Atlanta, Decatur is an excellent place to live if you are employed in the state's capitol. Though only about a twenty minute drive, the speed and convenience of the MARTA transportation system can cut a morning commute to less than fifteen minutes - just enough time to check the week's news in The Champion, DeKalb county's local paper. If you decide even more local employment is more appropriate to your tastes, DeKalb County's Chamber or Commerce claims a membership of nearly 700 local businesses. Either way, Decatur apartments and home rentals are a smart choice.
For its small size, it is surprising that Decatur is home to two nationally ranked universities and a third Presbyterian seminary. Emory University, located just outside of Decatur in unincorporated DeKalb County, is consistently ranked in the top 20 U.S. universities. The smaller Agnes Scott College, whose campus is within the city's limits, is considered the top women's college in the southeast. Both campuses are working toward complete sustainability and have taken deliberate measures to reduce their impacts on the environment. Columbia Theological Seminary, also located in Decatur, offers Master's and Doctorate degrees in theology and ministry. But wherever you are attending school, it is Decatur apartments and homes are affordable and nearby.
Decatur Cost of Living
Although Decatur boasts a per capita income about 15% higher than the state's average, its residents experience a high standard of living in more places than just their pocketbooks. And despite the cost of living being higher than the national average, the percentage of citizens living below poverty level is much lower. The affordability of Decatur rentals, with an average one-bedroom costing $750 and a two-bedroom only $850 per month, may be a contributing factor to the comfortable life Decatur residents enjoy.
Decatur Attractions & Entertainment
Decatur is lucky to house a host of historical buildings, each telling its own story of the history of the region and the country. Ranked among one of the country's most beautiful campuses, Agnes Scott College is a perfect site to take a stroll or have a picnic. For lovers of space, the college's Bradley Observatory is home to several telescopes and a 70-seat planetarium. If your interests rest closer to home, the High House is believed to be the first two-story building in the city, and the nearby Old DeKalb County Courthouse contains a small history museum. For art, shopping and dining, Oakhurst Village is a haven for small town commerce. No matter where your in Decatur rental resides, with an area of only 4.2 square miles, you're never too far from any attraction.
Decatur Special Events
You'll never be wanting for neighborhood events when living in Decatur. Regardless of your interests, as the city's website boasts, "There's a festival for that!" With nearly sixty unique events taking place throughout the year, citizens of Decatur can head into Atlanta for fun but certainly don't have to. Jazz and arts festivals, wine crawls and even breakfast with Santa are just a few of the many special events that fill the calendars of Decatur residents.
So if you love the big city but can't stand to live there, Decatur is the place for comfortable, affordable rental homes and apartments.

Rent SpecialsUpdated 1 day ago(478) 845-7647Check AvailabilityPrev12345NextAll aboutMacon, GAPlopped right in the center of the state, Macon is known as "the Heart of Georgia" for a good reason. Of course, it's also one of the state's friendliest small cities and regularly poaches families from less-inviting places across the land. With a rich history, vibrant economy and beautiful surroundings, Macon is a true Georgia original.
Macon Attractions

Although Macon sprang up around Fort Benjamin Hawkins and still attracts plenty of visitors who wish to learn about its extensive military history, the city was historically known as an agricultural and industrial market town. In addition to the fort, history buffs marvel at the prehistoric mounds of Ocmulgee National Monument and the early colonial architecture of the Cannonball House. Macon has plenty of modern attractions as well. The International Cherry Blossom Festival and the Georgia State Fair both bring thousands of visitors to town every year.
Macon Natural Beauty

Nestled in the low hills near the Ocmulgee River's fall line, Macon delights nature lovers and recreation enthusiasts. The meandering Ocmulgee serves as the focal point for a network of local hiking and biking trails, and the paved paths at regionally acclaimed Bloomfield Community Park serve as a great place for locals to practice their distance-running skills. To the north, the Piedmont National Wildlife Refuge gives bird-watchers the chance to see plenty of endemic species.
