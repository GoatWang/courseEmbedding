Fitness Tips    Why Be Active       Regular physical activity has many benefits. It is a potent stress buster, it can help keep weight off and it lowers your risk of developing major chronic diseases. Additional benefits include increased energy, stronger bones and muscles, improved sleep, improved body shape, a boost to mental wellbeing and a change in your outlook on life.       For some quick tips, see below.      1 Renew your commitment to a healthy lifestyle. Think about increasing the types of activities that work for your lifestyle and that can easily be built into your day. Make it a point to read up on fitness news and information, such as this article about exercise. Put your fitness plan into action today!      2 Aerobic exercise is important for the cardiovascular system. It’s defined by repetitive motion such as running, swimming or cycling. It can also tone muscles. Incorporating a little of both aerobic and resistance training is best for your daily routine.      3 Set small, specific goals you can stick to (like losing 5 percent of body weight or exercising three times a week, etc.) Drink green tea (which helps promote weight loss). Snack on fresh fruits and vegetables during your day.      4 Resistance exercise is important for healthy muscles and bones. It also builds strength. It’s defined by activities with short bursts of energy, such as weight lifting, playing sports and even pushing a lawn mower. Ideally, you need both resistance exercise and aerobic exercise to keep your body operating at its peak.      5 Simple ways work for getting fit – you don’t need to join a gym. If you become more active in your everyday life – such as parking your car further and walking more, taking the stairs instead of the elevator, or even walking to a co-worker’s desk instead of emailing them – you’ll get fit faster.      6 Your metabolism doesn’t slow with age. It’s just that as people get older they do less strength-training and can lose lean muscle mass. The more lean muscle tissue you have, the higher your metabolism – and the faster you’ll lose weight. Keep your exercise and activity levels up each year, and you’ll simultaneously maintain your muscle tone, keep your metabolism up and maximize healthy weight loss.      7 At least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity activity, at least five times each week, will keep you physically active. You can split each half hour into three 10-minute sessions. If 30 minutes are out of reach right now, start with what you can do and gradually build up.      8 Keep hydrated by consuming at least two liters of water each day. It is even more important to drink water before, during and after exercise. Even low-intensity exercise requires you to be well-hydrated.      9 Rest between workouts and allow your body time to recover.

Herbalife International is a global multi-level marketing corporation that develops, markets and sells nutrition supplements, weight management, sports nutrition and personal-care products. The company was founded by entrepreneur Mark Hughes in 1980, and it employs around 7,800 people worldwide. Herbalife reported net sales of US$4.488 billion in 2016, flat with 2015, and net income of $260.0 million, down 23% from the year prior.[4] The business is incorporated in the Cayman Islands,[2] and its corporate headquarters are there.[5]
The company operates internationally and distributes its products in 95 countries (as of July 2015) through a network of approximately 3.2 million independent distributors,[2] some of whom earn profit on product sales and additional commission from a network marketing compensation structure. The MLM compensation structure consists of commissions, royalties and bonuses on sales done by a distributor's downline (the people they have sponsored as new recruits). Out of about 526,000 total members in the US at the beginning of 2014, about 62,000 received bonuses of some kind from Herbalife: 7,385 (1.4%) received over $5,000 in bonuses per year (this translates to an average of $417 per month) and 1,304 (0.25%) received over $50,000 ($4,167 per month average). These figures do not include income from product sales nor do they include any costs incurred by distributors.[6]
The company has been criticized by, among others, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Capital, who claimed that Herbalife operates a "sophisticated pyramid scheme"[7][8] after taking a $1-billion short position in Herbalife stock.[9] The company denies the allegations.[10] However, in March 2014, Herbalife came under investigation by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the state of Illinois.[11] In July 2016, Herbalife agreed to change its business model and pay $200 million in a settlement with the FTC.[12]

History[edit]
In February 1980, Mark Hughes began selling the original Herbalife weight management product from the trunk of his car. Hughes often stated that the genesis of his product and program stemmed from the weight loss concerns of his mother Joanne, whose premature death he attributed to an eating disorder and an unhealthy approach to weight loss (though, according to an article from Los Angeles Times, this depiction of the story is not accurate [13]). His stated goal was to change the nutritional habits of the world.[14]
His first product was a protein shake designed to help people manage their weight. He structured his company using a direct-selling, pyramid marketing model.
In 1985, the California Attorney General sued the company for making inflated claims about the efficacy of its products. The company settled the suit for $850,000 without admitting wrongdoing.[15] In 1986, Herbalife became a publicly traded company on the NASDAQ, and in 1996 Herbalife reached US$1 billion in annual sales.
Mark Hughes died at age 44 on May 20, 2000.[16] The Los Angeles County Coroner autopsy results ruled that the entrepreneur had died of an accidental overdose of alcohol and doxepin, an anti-depressant.[17] The company continued to grow after his death and in 2002 was acquired for US$685 million by J.H. Whitney & Company and Golden Gate Capital, which took the company private again.
In April 2003, Michael O. Johnson joined Herbalife as CEO following a 17-year career with The Walt Disney Company, most recently as president of Walt Disney International.[15] On December 16, 2004, the company had an initial public offering on the NYSE of 14,500,000 common shares at $14 per share. 2004 net sales were reported as $1.3 billion.
On April 9, 2013, the company's long-time auditor, KPMG, resigned after the KPMG executive who oversaw Herbalife audits admitted to providing insider information to a golfing friend about at least five companies, including Herbalife and Skechers.[18][19] The company hired PricewaterhouseCoopers as its auditor on May 21, 2013.[20]
On May 7, 2014, the company announced that it entered into a deal with Bank of America Merrill Lynch to repurchase $266 million of its stock.[21]
The company announced in November 2016 that Chief Operating Officer Richard Goudis would take over the position of CEO in June 2017 and Johnson would transition to executive chairman.[22]
Products[edit]
Herbalife's products include protein shakes; protein snacks; nutrition, energy and fitness supplements; and personal care products.[23] The Formula 1 protein shake, a soy-based meal-replacement shake, is the company's number one product and was one of the first products it sold. Other products include products for heart health, digestive health, skin care, and the new 24 sports line released in 2011. Some products are vegetarian, kosher, allergen free,[24] or halal, and Herbalife provides testimonials and advice from health professionals as part of their product marketing.
According to the 2009 Form 10-K, many of Herbalife's weight management, nutritional and personal care products are manufactured by third-party manufacturing companies, with the exception of products distributed in and sourced from China, where they have their own manufacturing facility, and several products are produced in its manufacturing facility in Lake Forest, California (renovated in 2011[25]). Herbalife is modifying its recently acquired manufacturing facility in order to increase capability and capacity; after completion of these modifications, it expects to increase self-manufacturing.[26]:16 In June 2013, Herbalife announced the opening of a plant in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, in a facility previously occupied by Dell; the facility was expected to open in 2014 and employ 500 people.[27]
In October 2010, Herbalife held a groundbreaking ceremony in Changsha, Hunan Province, China, for a botanical extraction facility for its inner and outer nutrition products. The new facility opened in early 2013.[28] It purchases botanicals directly from farms in Hunan province, China, and other regions; performs extraction and other conversion processes; and then sends the processed raw materials directly to Herbalife's manufacturing facilities in Suzhou, China, and Lake Forest, California, or to its third-party manufacturers throughout the world. The new extraction plant produces botanical extracts, including teas, guarana, chamomile, broccoli, and bilberry, for use in many of the company's products.[29]
The specialists of the German Society for Nutrition (de) concluded that the use of Herbalife products alone does not solve weight problems.[30] In independent studies made by the German magazine Konsument (Zeitschrift Ökotest 11/2003), the products of Herbalife were found to be among the most expensive "healthy eating" products.[31]
Adverse effects[edit]
Ephedrine[edit]
Some of the original Herbalife weight loss products included herbs containing ephedrine, Ephedra sinica (ma huang) and Sida cordifolia. Ephedrine suppresses appetite; it is closely related to pseudoephedrine, and, like the latter compound, it acts as a nasal decongestant and can increase the heart rate. Plant sources of ephedrine were removed from Herbalife products in 2002 after several U.S. states banned supplements containing such herbs.[32]:15[33] The U.S. Food and Drug Administration banned supplements containing ephedrine in 2004.[34]
Allegations of lead contamination[edit]
In May 2009, an organization known as the Fraud Discovery Institute reported that laboratory test results of Herbalife products showed lead levels in excess of limits established by law in California under Proposition 65.[35] The Fraud Discovery Institute was founded by Barry Minkow; it dissolved in 2011 after Minkow pleaded guilty to an insider trading charge not related to Herbalife.[36]
Multiple independent labs reported finding lead in Herbalife products.[37][38][39][40] Herbalife responded by stating its products met federal FDA requirements[41][42] and claimed that they had commissioned independent laboratory tests showing that the products did not exceed Proposition 65 limits.[36] According to court documents, Herbalife settled with Minkow and paid him US$300,000.[43] In August 2008, Minkow retracted all accusations against Herbalife and removed any mention of the company from his web site.[44]
On May 10, 2008, a civil lawsuit was filed on behalf of a woman who developed lead-related liver complaints that she claimed were a reaction to a combination of Herbalife products.[36][45] The suit was filed by lawyer Christopher Grell, cofounder of the Dietary Supplement Safety Committee and an ally of Barry Minkow.[36] On June 17, 2008, the suit was expanded to add distributors who had supplied the woman with the Herbalife products, with Grell launching a website to offer persons who believe they were harmed by Herbalife products the chance of redress.[46]
Herbalife and liver disease inquiries[edit]
In 2004, Israel's Health Minister began an investigation into Herbalife's products after four persons using Herbalife's products were found to have liver problems.[47]
Herbalife was accused of selling products containing toxic ingredients such as Qua-qua, Kompri, and Kraska. The products were sent to Bio-Medical Research Design LTD (B.R.D), to a private U.S. laboratory, and to Israel's Forensic research laboratory. A study of the cases funded by the Israeli Ministry of Health concluded that a causative relationship[48] is suggested by the evidence, which included the temporal association between exposure to Herbalife products and the development of liver injury, the negative evaluation of other potential causes of liver injury, the normalization of liver function when Herbalife products were discontinued, and the return of liver injury symptoms in three patients who resumed using Herbalife products after recovery. Herbalife withdrew one product, which was only marketed in Israel, but not all of the Israeli patients had consumed this specific Herbalife product.[49] Herbalife's SEC 10-Q filings state that the Israeli Ministry of Health did not establish a causal relationship between the product and liver ailments. The Israeli Ministry of Health advises individuals with compromised liver function to avoid dietary supplements.[50] In 2009, an Israeli woman sued Herbalife International and Herbalife Israel, claiming that her liver damage resulted from the use of Herbalife products.[51]
Scientific studies in 2007 by doctors at the University Hospital of Bern in Switzerland and the Liver Unit of the Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center in Israel found an association between consumption of Herbalife products and hepatitis.[47][52] In response, the Spanish Ministry of Health issued an alert asking for caution in consuming Herbalife products.[53] Herbalife stated they were cooperating fully with Spanish authorities,[54] and after investigation, the agency determined no action was required and removed the alert.
Hospitals in Israel, Spain, Switzerland, Iceland, Argentina, and the United States had reported liver damage in a number of patients, some of whom had used Herbalife products.[47][52][55][56][57][58][59][60][61] Some patients recovered after they had stopped taking the products, while in others the disease continued, and two patients died. Several authors considered it “certain” that Herbalife products were the cause of the observed liver disease because of a positive re-challenge, while most of the remaining cases were scored as “probable.”[62] Herbalife employees claim there is no definitive proof that Herbalife products cause hepatotoxicity or other liver problems.[63]
In January 2009, the Scientific Committee of the Spanish Agency for Food Safety and Nutrition (AESAN) reached the same conclusion. After reviewing cases implicating Herbalife products in Spain, Switzerland, Israel, Finland, France, Italy, Iceland and Portugal, the 12-member scientific panel issued a report concluding: "The analyses of these cases and information regarding their circumstances have not allowed us to establish a causal relationship" between liver anomalies and Herbalife's dietary supplements. The panel attributed the cases to metabolic changes from overzealous and unsupervised dieting.[64] However, neither a 2005 American Association for the Study of the Liver position paper[65] on the management of acute liver failure nor a 2013 review in the New England Journal of Medicine[66] lists "overzealous dieting" among the recognized causes of acute liver failure.
A July 2013 peer-reviewed study published in the World Journal of Hepatology reexamined known cases of hepatoxicity that had previously been linked to consumption of Herbalife products and concluded that using "the liver specific Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences scale, causality was probable in 1 case, unlikely and excluded in the other cases. Thus, causality levels were much lower than hitherto proposed."[67] In a separate review published less than a year earlier, the same author described the relationship between Herbalife products and reported hepatoxicity cases as "highly probable".[68]
Business model[edit]




A car decorated with Herbalife branding, parked in London


Herbalife is a pyramid (sometimes called pyramid scheme or network marketing) company. In addition to profits from product sales, Herbalife distributors can earn additional commissions from sales by other distributors they recruited, called their downline distributors. Supporters of MLM contend this is a fair compensation system, while critics contend that it is a pyramid scheme.[69][70] Critics also argue that the company does not make enough effort to curb abuses by individual distributors, though Herbalife has consistently denied such allegations.[71] Herbalife is a member of the Direct Selling Association in most countries in which it operates. In its filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), company management note problems with inappropriate business practices in the past, their subsequent long-lasting effects and the need to avoid any repetition.
Company management considers the number and retention of distributors a key parameter and tracks it closely in financial reports. By January of each year, sales leaders are required to requalify. In February of each year, individuals who did not satisfy the sales leader qualification requirements during the preceding 12 months are removed from that rank. For the latest 12-month requalification period ending January 2011, approximately 48.9 percent of the eligible sales leaders requalified, an improvement from 43 percent in 2009.[72] The company was cited as one of the most profitable companies in Los Angeles County.[73]
A 2004 settlement resolved a class action suit on behalf of 8,700 former and current distributors who accused the company and distributors of "essentially running a pyramid scheme." A total of $6 million was to be paid out, with defendants not admitting guilt.
In a California class action suit (Minton v. Herbalife International, et al.) filed on February 17, 2005, the plaintiff challenged "the marketing practices of certain Herbalife International independent distributors and Herbalife International under various state laws prohibiting "endless chain schemes", insufficient disclosure in assisted marketing plans, unfair and deceptive business practices, and fraud and deceit".[74]
In a West Virginia class action suit (Mey v. Herbalife International, Inc., et al.) filed on July 16, 2003, the plaintiffs allege that some

telemarketing practices of certain Herbalife International distributors violate the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, or TCPA, and seeks to hold Herbalife International vicariously liable for the practices of these distributors. More specifically, the plaintiffs' complaint alleges that several of Herbalife International's distributors used pre-recorded telephone messages and autodialers to contact prospective customers in violation of the TCPA's prohibition of such practices

Herbalife management insisted they have meritorious defenses in both cases and that, in the West Virginia case, any such distributor actions also went against Herbalife's own policies. Management also contends that any adverse legal outcomes Herbalife might suffer would not significantly affect their financial condition, particularly since they have already set aside an amount that they "believe represents the likely outcome of the resolution of these disputes".[74] The case was resolved with Herbalife and its distributors paying $7 million into a fund for class members part of the suit.[75]:42 Herbalife International did not acknowledge wrongdoing or admit culpability for the actions of its distributors.
As of April 2008, a series of commercials featuring a large red animated fox advertising home-based business opportunities has been running on American television. The advertisements typically feature testimonials from actors playing individuals who have made sums of money between US$5,000 and US$15,000 per month as a result of participating in an undescribed business program. The advertisements direct viewers to a website that allows them to purchase a "success kit". The kit also provides no information about how the business opportunity works. These advertisements have been found to be run by independent Herbalife distributors, as a method of recruiting new downline distributors.[76] While it is not illegal, critics of this type of advertising prefer advertisers to be up-front about their company associations.
Herbalife Nutrition Clubs[edit]
While there are many ways to do the Herbalife business, earlier methods have fallen out of favor over time (i.e. direct mail and internet “lead generation"). One of the most popular current ways of doing the business is through what is called a "Nutrition Club." These clubs are usually storefront shops in densely populated areas, often predominantly Latino.[77]
Some Herbalife distributors complain they have no way of knowing if other clubs are already open in the area. One of the reasons for this is that Herbalife Nutrition Clubs can be hard to find,[78] since the company doesn’t allow the shop owner/manager to advertise, to have awnings, to have any visible interior, to have an open / closed sign, to have a public facing website, or indicate in any other way that they are a business. They also cannot use the word “Herbalife” or "shop" on the club's exterior.
Furthermore, distributors are disallowed from selling the products directly at the club; instead they are to sell a daily "membership" that entitles the customer to a shake, a cup of aloe water, and a tea in a styrofoam cup. A daily "member" typically pays $5 to $7 in cash for the membership. Herbalife rules also dictate that no one can leave the club with these products; they must be consumed in the club.[79]
Pyramid scheme allegations[edit]
On December 3, 2013, a Belgian appeals court overturned[80] a November 2011 ruling by the Commercial Court in Brussels, Belgium that Herbalife was an illegal pyramid scheme.[81]
Herbalife responded to the original Belgium decision by stating:

"Herbalife believes the judgment contains factual errors and is based on misinterpretations of the law and its direct-selling sales model. Herbalife remains committed to its pyramid direct-selling sales model and is confident that, with clarifications in certain aspects of its business, there will be no doubt as to its compliance with all applicable Belgian laws."[82]

The company filed an appeal on March 8, 2012.[83] In response to the ruling being overturned, Herbalife said in a statement that it welcomed:

"the judgment by a Belgian Appeal Court that states the company’s sales model is in full compliance with Belgian law. This judgment overturns a previous ruling by the lower court, in response to claims brought by Belgian consumer organization Test-Aankoop, that Herbalife was operating a pyramid scheme. Herbalife always believed that the first judgment contained factual errors and was based on misinterpretations of its direct-selling sales method, and was confident that the original judgment would be overturned on appeal."[84]

Short sales[edit]
On May 1, 2012, a well-known short seller David Einhorn asked pointed questions about the company’s business and sales models during the Q1 earnings call, setting off suspicions that Einhorn had a short position.[85][86] These suspicions were proved correct in January 2013 when at an investor meeting Einhorn revealed that he had profited through a short position against the company. Einhorn said the short had been closed before the end of 2012.[87]
Allegations of running a 'pyramid scheme'[edit]
On December 20, 2012, Bill Ackman (of Pershing Square Capital) presented a series of arguments outlining why his firm believed that Herbalife operates a "sophisticated pyramid scheme".[8][10] Ackman has alleged after a year-long investigation that the majority of distributors lose money, that the chance of making the testimonial-implied headline income is approximately one in five thousand, and that the company materially overstates its distributors' retail sales and understates their recruiting rewards, to the point that he concludes it is a pyramid scheme.[88]
According to Reuters:

"The sales method, under which some people get more money for recruiting new distributors than selling products, has attracted criticism."[89]

Ackman claimed that Herbalife distributors "primarily obtain their monetary benefits from recruitment rather than the sale of goods and services to consumers." His firm estimates that, since 1980, the scheme has led to more than $3.5 billion of total net losses suffered by those at the bottom of the Herbalife chain. He said on CNBC that millions of low income people around the world, hoping to become millionaires, are being duped with this scheme, and if they knew that the probability is less than 1% of making a hundred thousand dollars, what Herbalife calls the "millionaires team", no one would sign up for it.[90]
Herbalife responded to Ackman's 2012 presentation saying:

"[It] was a malicious attack on Herbalife's business model based largely on outdated, distorted and inaccurate information. Herbalife operates with the highest ethical and quality standards, and our management and our board are constantly reviewing our business practices and products. Herbalife also hires independent, outside experts to ensure our operations are in full compliance with laws and regulations. Herbalife is not an illegal pyramid scheme."[91]

Herbalife also countered that Ackman based his accusations on a misunderstanding of the company's distributor base. At an investor conference in January 2013, the company released results of a Nielsen Research International survey showing 73 percent of Herbalife distributors never intended to make money by reselling the product. Instead, they wanted to buy products at a discount for personal use.[92] To make the distinction clearer, the company announced on its June 2013 earnings call that it would begin referring to these discount buyers as "members" rather than "distributors." [93]
According to a number of financial commentators, Ackman bet roughly $1 billion against the company;[94] soon after remarks to the press, the price of the stock decreased such that Ackman would have made $300 million if he had closed his short position then.[95] Ackman stated that he will donate all of his profits from the trade to charity, taking the financial incentive out of the equation.[90][96] A few months after Ackman's initial comments, billionaire investor Carl Icahn refuted Ackman's comment in a very public spat on national TV. Shortly thereafter, Icahn bought shares of Herbalife Intl. As Icahn continued to buy up HLF shares, the stock price continued to show strength.[97] By May 2013, Icahn owned 16.5% of the company.[98] That number had declined to 6.4 by November 2013.[99] Investor George Soros and Post Foods CEO William Stiritz also bought large shares of Herbalife. Ackman acknowledged losing $400–500 million on his short position in November 2013.[100] By November 2014, Soros had sold 2.8 million shares, 60% of his stake, while Perry Capital had purchased 1.6 million shares.[101][102]
By December 2, 2014 stock prices had fallen nearly 50% to $42.08 from their January 8 high of $83.48.[103] On 17 December 2014 Pershing Square Capital released a 2005 video of a Herbalife training conference in which Stephan Gratziani, a member of Herbalife's Chairman's Club sales team, was recorded telling an audience of high-level distributors "We sell people on a dream business that they can make it, yet deep down inside we know that most of them aren't going to," along with other statements that Pershing described as implying that the business model was not sustainable.[104][105][106] According to an unnamed source speaking to the New York Post, the video had previously been subpoenaed by federal investigators.[105] In an interview with Bloomberg, Ackman predicted that the company would experience an "implosion" in 2015 or early 2016, citing federal scrutiny and debt.[106][107]
FTC investigation[edit]
Based on information from a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, the New York Post reported on February 4, 2013, that HerbaLife was subject to a pending probe from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC released 729 pages containing 192 complaints received over a 7-year period in regards to the New York Post's FOIA request. After reviewing the now-public complaints, which the FTC put on its website, Ackman told the New York Post: “I have a lot more confidence in our government’s regulators than those who own the stock.” [108] The FTC stated that the wording it used in its response to the FOIA request was incorrect; the FTC could not confirm or deny an investigation into Herbalife.[109]
In March 2014, the FTC opened an investigation into Herbalife in response to calls from consumer groups and members in both houses of Congress. Herbalife responded to the probe by saying it “welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace, and will co-operate fully with the FTC. We are confident that Herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.” The investigation process that is required for alleged pyramid schemes takes 12 to 18 months. In cases like the Herbalife investigation, the FTC often seeks to impose changes to a company’s practices—known as injunctive relief—in order to stop misconduct that it sees as harming consumers. In May 2016 a spokesperson from the FTC told Bloomberg that “Injunctive relief can be just as significant as the money obtained for consumers and even more influential on a company’s future operations”, in response to speculation that Herbalife was close to a resolution with the FTC.[11][110][111][112]
In July 2016, Herbalife agreed to change its business model and pay $200 million in a settlement with the FTC.[12][113][114][115] Partial refund checks were mailed to roughly 350,000 Herbalife distributors in January 2017.[116][117]
The lawsuit alleged that Herbalife deceived consumers into believing they could earn substantial income from the business opportunity or big money from the retail sale of the company’s products. In addition, the complaint charged that one of the fundamental principles of Herbalife’s business model—incentivizing distributors to buy products and to recruit others to join and buy products so they could advance in the company’s marketing program, rather than in response to actual consumer demand—is an unfair practice in violation of the FTC Act.[118]
As part of the settlement, Herbalife agreed to pay distributors based only on actual retail sales of products, rather than for recruiting other distributors. The FTC had noted that the overwhelming majority of Herbalife's distributors earn very little or nothing.

Herbalife International is a global multi-level marketing corporation that develops, markets and sells nutrition supplements, weight management, sports nutrition and personal-care products. The company was founded by entrepreneur Mark Hughes in 1980, and it employs around 7,800 people worldwide. Herbalife reported net sales of US$4.488 billion in 2016, flat with 2015, and net income of $260.0 million, down 23% from the year prior.[4] The business is incorporated in the Cayman Islands,[2] and its corporate headquarters are there.[5]
The company operates internationally and distributes its products in 95 countries (as of July 2015) through a network of approximately 3.2 million independent distributors,[2] some of whom earn profit on product sales and additional commission from a network marketing compensation structure. The MLM compensation structure consists of commissions, royalties and bonuses on sales done by a distributor's downline (the people they have sponsored as new recruits). Out of about 526,000 total members in the US at the beginning of 2014, about 62,000 received bonuses of some kind from Herbalife: 7,385 (1.4%) received over $5,000 in bonuses per year (this translates to an average of $417 per month) and 1,304 (0.25%) received over $50,000 ($4,167 per month average). These figures do not include income from product sales nor do they include any costs incurred by distributors.[6]
The company has been criticized by, among others, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Capital, who claimed that Herbalife operates a "sophisticated pyramid scheme"[7][8] after taking a $1-billion short position in Herbalife stock.[9] The company denies the allegations.[10] However, in March 2014, Herbalife came under investigation by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the state of Illinois.[11] In July 2016, Herbalife agreed to change its business model and pay $200 million in a settlement with the FTC.[12]

History[edit]
In February 1980, Mark Hughes began selling the original Herbalife weight management product from the trunk of his car. Hughes often stated that the genesis of his product and program stemmed from the weight loss concerns of his mother Joanne, whose premature death he attributed to an eating disorder and an unhealthy approach to weight loss (though, according to an article from Los Angeles Times, this depiction of the story is not accurate [13]). His stated goal was to change the nutritional habits of the world.[14]
His first product was a protein shake designed to help people manage their weight. He structured his company using a direct-selling, pyramid marketing model.
In 1985, the California Attorney General sued the company for making inflated claims about the efficacy of its products. The company settled the suit for $850,000 without admitting wrongdoing.[15] In 1986, Herbalife became a publicly traded company on the NASDAQ, and in 1996 Herbalife reached US$1 billion in annual sales.
Mark Hughes died at age 44 on May 20, 2000.[16] The Los Angeles County Coroner autopsy results ruled that the entrepreneur had died of an accidental overdose of alcohol and doxepin, an anti-depressant.[17] The company continued to grow after his death and in 2002 was acquired for US$685 million by J.H. Whitney & Company and Golden Gate Capital, which took the company private again.
In April 2003, Michael O. Johnson joined Herbalife as CEO following a 17-year career with The Walt Disney Company, most recently as president of Walt Disney International.[15] On December 16, 2004, the company had an initial public offering on the NYSE of 14,500,000 common shares at $14 per share. 2004 net sales were reported as $1.3 billion.
On April 9, 2013, the company's long-time auditor, KPMG, resigned after the KPMG executive who oversaw Herbalife audits admitted to providing insider information to a golfing friend about at least five companies, including Herbalife and Skechers.[18][19] The company hired PricewaterhouseCoopers as its auditor on May 21, 2013.[20]
On May 7, 2014, the company announced that it entered into a deal with Bank of America Merrill Lynch to repurchase $266 million of its stock.[21]
The company announced in November 2016 that Chief Operating Officer Richard Goudis would take over the position of CEO in June 2017 and Johnson would transition to executive chairman.[22]
Products[edit]
Herbalife's products include protein shakes; protein snacks; nutrition, energy and fitness supplements; and personal care products.[23] The Formula 1 protein shake, a soy-based meal-replacement shake, is the company's number one product and was one of the first products it sold. Other products include products for heart health, digestive health, skin care, and the new 24 sports line released in 2011. Some products are vegetarian, kosher, allergen free,[24] or halal, and Herbalife provides testimonials and advice from health professionals as part of their product marketing.
According to the 2009 Form 10-K, many of Herbalife's weight management, nutritional and personal care products are manufactured by third-party manufacturing companies, with the exception of products distributed in and sourced from China, where they have their own manufacturing facility, and several products are produced in its manufacturing facility in Lake Forest, California (renovated in 2011[25]). Herbalife is modifying its recently acquired manufacturing facility in order to increase capability and capacity; after completion of these modifications, it expects to increase self-manufacturing.[26]:16 In June 2013, Herbalife announced the opening of a plant in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, in a facility previously occupied by Dell; the facility was expected to open in 2014 and employ 500 people.[27]
In October 2010, Herbalife held a groundbreaking ceremony in Changsha, Hunan Province, China, for a botanical extraction facility for its inner and outer nutrition products. The new facility opened in early 2013.[28] It purchases botanicals directly from farms in Hunan province, China, and other regions; performs extraction and other conversion processes; and then sends the processed raw materials directly to Herbalife's manufacturing facilities in Suzhou, China, and Lake Forest, California, or to its third-party manufacturers throughout the world. The new extraction plant produces botanical extracts, including teas, guarana, chamomile, broccoli, and bilberry, for use in many of the company's products.[29]
The specialists of the German Society for Nutrition (de) concluded that the use of Herbalife products alone does not solve weight problems.[30] In independent studies made by the German magazine Konsument (Zeitschrift Ökotest 11/2003), the products of Herbalife were found to be among the most expensive "healthy eating" products.[31]
Adverse effects[edit]
Ephedrine[edit]
Some of the original Herbalife weight loss products included herbs containing ephedrine, Ephedra sinica (ma huang) and Sida cordifolia. Ephedrine suppresses appetite; it is closely related to pseudoephedrine, and, like the latter compound, it acts as a nasal decongestant and can increase the heart rate. Plant sources of ephedrine were removed from Herbalife products in 2002 after several U.S. states banned supplements containing such herbs.[32]:15[33] The U.S. Food and Drug Administration banned supplements containing ephedrine in 2004.[34]
Allegations of lead contamination[edit]
In May 2009, an organization known as the Fraud Discovery Institute reported that laboratory test results of Herbalife products showed lead levels in excess of limits established by law in California under Proposition 65.[35] The Fraud Discovery Institute was founded by Barry Minkow; it dissolved in 2011 after Minkow pleaded guilty to an insider trading charge not related to Herbalife.[36]
Multiple independent labs reported finding lead in Herbalife products.[37][38][39][40] Herbalife responded by stating its products met federal FDA requirements[41][42] and claimed that they had commissioned independent laboratory tests showing that the products did not exceed Proposition 65 limits.[36] According to court documents, Herbalife settled with Minkow and paid him US$300,000.[43] In August 2008, Minkow retracted all accusations against Herbalife and removed any mention of the company from his web site.[44]
On May 10, 2008, a civil lawsuit was filed on behalf of a woman who developed lead-related liver complaints that she claimed were a reaction to a combination of Herbalife products.[36][45] The suit was filed by lawyer Christopher Grell, cofounder of the Dietary Supplement Safety Committee and an ally of Barry Minkow.[36] On June 17, 2008, the suit was expanded to add distributors who had supplied the woman with the Herbalife products, with Grell launching a website to offer persons who believe they were harmed by Herbalife products the chance of redress.[46]
Herbalife and liver disease inquiries[edit]
In 2004, Israel's Health Minister began an investigation into Herbalife's products after four persons using Herbalife's products were found to have liver problems.[47]
Herbalife was accused of selling products containing toxic ingredients such as Qua-qua, Kompri, and Kraska. The products were sent to Bio-Medical Research Design LTD (B.R.D), to a private U.S. laboratory, and to Israel's Forensic research laboratory. A study of the cases funded by the Israeli Ministry of Health concluded that a causative relationship[48] is suggested by the evidence, which included the temporal association between exposure to Herbalife products and the development of liver injury, the negative evaluation of other potential causes of liver injury, the normalization of liver function when Herbalife products were discontinued, and the return of liver injury symptoms in three patients who resumed using Herbalife products after recovery. Herbalife withdrew one product, which was only marketed in Israel, but not all of the Israeli patients had consumed this specific Herbalife product.[49] Herbalife's SEC 10-Q filings state that the Israeli Ministry of Health did not establish a causal relationship between the product and liver ailments. The Israeli Ministry of Health advises individuals with compromised liver function to avoid dietary supplements.[50] In 2009, an Israeli woman sued Herbalife International and Herbalife Israel, claiming that her liver damage resulted from the use of Herbalife products.[51]
Scientific studies in 2007 by doctors at the University Hospital of Bern in Switzerland and the Liver Unit of the Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center in Israel found an association between consumption of Herbalife products and hepatitis.[47][52] In response, the Spanish Ministry of Health issued an alert asking for caution in consuming Herbalife products.[53] Herbalife stated they were cooperating fully with Spanish authorities,[54] and after investigation, the agency determined no action was required and removed the alert.
Hospitals in Israel, Spain, Switzerland, Iceland, Argentina, and the United States had reported liver damage in a number of patients, some of whom had used Herbalife products.[47][52][55][56][57][58][59][60][61] Some patients recovered after they had stopped taking the products, while in others the disease continued, and two patients died. Several authors considered it “certain” that Herbalife products were the cause of the observed liver disease because of a positive re-challenge, while most of the remaining cases were scored as “probable.”[62] Herbalife employees claim there is no definitive proof that Herbalife products cause hepatotoxicity or other liver problems.[63]
In January 2009, the Scientific Committee of the Spanish Agency for Food Safety and Nutrition (AESAN) reached the same conclusion. After reviewing cases implicating Herbalife products in Spain, Switzerland, Israel, Finland, France, Italy, Iceland and Portugal, the 12-member scientific panel issued a report concluding: "The analyses of these cases and information regarding their circumstances have not allowed us to establish a causal relationship" between liver anomalies and Herbalife's dietary supplements. The panel attributed the cases to metabolic changes from overzealous and unsupervised dieting.[64] However, neither a 2005 American Association for the Study of the Liver position paper[65] on the management of acute liver failure nor a 2013 review in the New England Journal of Medicine[66] lists "overzealous dieting" among the recognized causes of acute liver failure.
A July 2013 peer-reviewed study published in the World Journal of Hepatology reexamined known cases of hepatoxicity that had previously been linked to consumption of Herbalife products and concluded that using "the liver specific Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences scale, causality was probable in 1 case, unlikely and excluded in the other cases. Thus, causality levels were much lower than hitherto proposed."[67] In a separate review published less than a year earlier, the same author described the relationship between Herbalife products and reported hepatoxicity cases as "highly probable".[68]
Business model[edit]




A car decorated with Herbalife branding, parked in London


Herbalife is a pyramid (sometimes called pyramid scheme or network marketing) company. In addition to profits from product sales, Herbalife distributors can earn additional commissions from sales by other distributors they recruited, called their downline distributors. Supporters of MLM contend this is a fair compensation system, while critics contend that it is a pyramid scheme.[69][70] Critics also argue that the company does not make enough effort to curb abuses by individual distributors, though Herbalife has consistently denied such allegations.[71] Herbalife is a member of the Direct Selling Association in most countries in which it operates. In its filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), company management note problems with inappropriate business practices in the past, their subsequent long-lasting effects and the need to avoid any repetition.
Company management considers the number and retention of distributors a key parameter and tracks it closely in financial reports. By January of each year, sales leaders are required to requalify. In February of each year, individuals who did not satisfy the sales leader qualification requirements during the preceding 12 months are removed from that rank. For the latest 12-month requalification period ending January 2011, approximately 48.9 percent of the eligible sales leaders requalified, an improvement from 43 percent in 2009.[72] The company was cited as one of the most profitable companies in Los Angeles County.[73]
A 2004 settlement resolved a class action suit on behalf of 8,700 former and current distributors who accused the company and distributors of "essentially running a pyramid scheme." A total of $6 million was to be paid out, with defendants not admitting guilt.
In a California class action suit (Minton v. Herbalife International, et al.) filed on February 17, 2005, the plaintiff challenged "the marketing practices of certain Herbalife International independent distributors and Herbalife International under various state laws prohibiting "endless chain schemes", insufficient disclosure in assisted marketing plans, unfair and deceptive business practices, and fraud and deceit".[74]
In a West Virginia class action suit (Mey v. Herbalife International, Inc., et al.) filed on July 16, 2003, the plaintiffs allege that some

telemarketing practices of certain Herbalife International distributors violate the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, or TCPA, and seeks to hold Herbalife International vicariously liable for the practices of these distributors. More specifically, the plaintiffs' complaint alleges that several of Herbalife International's distributors used pre-recorded telephone messages and autodialers to contact prospective customers in violation of the TCPA's prohibition of such practices

Herbalife management insisted they have meritorious defenses in both cases and that, in the West Virginia case, any such distributor actions also went against Herbalife's own policies. Management also contends that any adverse legal outcomes Herbalife might suffer would not significantly affect their financial condition, particularly since they have already set aside an amount that they "believe represents the likely outcome of the resolution of these disputes".[74] The case was resolved with Herbalife and its distributors paying $7 million into a fund for class members part of the suit.[75]:42 Herbalife International did not acknowledge wrongdoing or admit culpability for the actions of its distributors.
As of April 2008, a series of commercials featuring a large red animated fox advertising home-based business opportunities has been running on American television. The advertisements typically feature testimonials from actors playing individuals who have made sums of money between US$5,000 and US$15,000 per month as a result of participating in an undescribed business program. The advertisements direct viewers to a website that allows them to purchase a "success kit". The kit also provides no information about how the business opportunity works. These advertisements have been found to be run by independent Herbalife distributors, as a method of recruiting new downline distributors.[76] While it is not illegal, critics of this type of advertising prefer advertisers to be up-front about their company associations.
Herbalife Nutrition Clubs[edit]
While there are many ways to do the Herbalife business, earlier methods have fallen out of favor over time (i.e. direct mail and internet “lead generation"). One of the most popular current ways of doing the business is through what is called a "Nutrition Club." These clubs are usually storefront shops in densely populated areas, often predominantly Latino.[77]
Some Herbalife distributors complain they have no way of knowing if other clubs are already open in the area. One of the reasons for this is that Herbalife Nutrition Clubs can be hard to find,[78] since the company doesn’t allow the shop owner/manager to advertise, to have awnings, to have any visible interior, to have an open / closed sign, to have a public facing website, or indicate in any other way that they are a business. They also cannot use the word “Herbalife” or "shop" on the club's exterior.
Furthermore, distributors are disallowed from selling the products directly at the club; instead they are to sell a daily "membership" that entitles the customer to a shake, a cup of aloe water, and a tea in a styrofoam cup. A daily "member" typically pays $5 to $7 in cash for the membership. Herbalife rules also dictate that no one can leave the club with these products; they must be consumed in the club.[79]
Pyramid scheme allegations[edit]
On December 3, 2013, a Belgian appeals court overturned[80] a November 2011 ruling by the Commercial Court in Brussels, Belgium that Herbalife was an illegal pyramid scheme.[81]
Herbalife responded to the original Belgium decision by stating:

"Herbalife believes the judgment contains factual errors and is based on misinterpretations of the law and its direct-selling sales model. Herbalife remains committed to its pyramid direct-selling sales model and is confident that, with clarifications in certain aspects of its business, there will be no doubt as to its compliance with all applicable Belgian laws."[82]

The company filed an appeal on March 8, 2012.[83] In response to the ruling being overturned, Herbalife said in a statement that it welcomed:

"the judgment by a Belgian Appeal Court that states the company’s sales model is in full compliance with Belgian law. This judgment overturns a previous ruling by the lower court, in response to claims brought by Belgian consumer organization Test-Aankoop, that Herbalife was operating a pyramid scheme. Herbalife always believed that the first judgment contained factual errors and was based on misinterpretations of its direct-selling sales method, and was confident that the original judgment would be overturned on appeal."[84]

Short sales[edit]
On May 1, 2012, a well-known short seller David Einhorn asked pointed questions about the company’s business and sales models during the Q1 earnings call, setting off suspicions that Einhorn had a short position.[85][86] These suspicions were proved correct in January 2013 when at an investor meeting Einhorn revealed that he had profited through a short position against the company. Einhorn said the short had been closed before the end of 2012.[87]
Allegations of running a 'pyramid scheme'[edit]
On December 20, 2012, Bill Ackman (of Pershing Square Capital) presented a series of arguments outlining why his firm believed that Herbalife operates a "sophisticated pyramid scheme".[8][10] Ackman has alleged after a year-long investigation that the majority of distributors lose money, that the chance of making the testimonial-implied headline income is approximately one in five thousand, and that the company materially overstates its distributors' retail sales and understates their recruiting rewards, to the point that he concludes it is a pyramid scheme.[88]
According to Reuters:

"The sales method, under which some people get more money for recruiting new distributors than selling products, has attracted criticism."[89]

Ackman claimed that Herbalife distributors "primarily obtain their monetary benefits from recruitment rather than the sale of goods and services to consumers." His firm estimates that, since 1980, the scheme has led to more than $3.5 billion of total net losses suffered by those at the bottom of the Herbalife chain. He said on CNBC that millions of low income people around the world, hoping to become millionaires, are being duped with this scheme, and if they knew that the probability is less than 1% of making a hundred thousand dollars, what Herbalife calls the "millionaires team", no one would sign up for it.[90]
Herbalife responded to Ackman's 2012 presentation saying:

"[It] was a malicious attack on Herbalife's business model based largely on outdated, distorted and inaccurate information. Herbalife operates with the highest ethical and quality standards, and our management and our board are constantly reviewing our business practices and products. Herbalife also hires independent, outside experts to ensure our operations are in full compliance with laws and regulations. Herbalife is not an illegal pyramid scheme."[91]

Herbalife also countered that Ackman based his accusations on a misunderstanding of the company's distributor base. At an investor conference in January 2013, the company released results of a Nielsen Research International survey showing 73 percent of Herbalife distributors never intended to make money by reselling the product. Instead, they wanted to buy products at a discount for personal use.[92] To make the distinction clearer, the company announced on its June 2013 earnings call that it would begin referring to these discount buyers as "members" rather than "distributors." [93]
According to a number of financial commentators, Ackman bet roughly $1 billion against the company;[94] soon after remarks to the press, the price of the stock decreased such that Ackman would have made $300 million if he had closed his short position then.[95] Ackman stated that he will donate all of his profits from the trade to charity, taking the financial incentive out of the equation.[90][96] A few months after Ackman's initial comments, billionaire investor Carl Icahn refuted Ackman's comment in a very public spat on national TV. Shortly thereafter, Icahn bought shares of Herbalife Intl. As Icahn continued to buy up HLF shares, the stock price continued to show strength.[97] By May 2013, Icahn owned 16.5% of the company.[98] That number had declined to 6.4 by November 2013.[99] Investor George Soros and Post Foods CEO William Stiritz also bought large shares of Herbalife. Ackman acknowledged losing $400–500 million on his short position in November 2013.[100] By November 2014, Soros had sold 2.8 million shares, 60% of his stake, while Perry Capital had purchased 1.6 million shares.[101][102]
By December 2, 2014 stock prices had fallen nearly 50% to $42.08 from their January 8 high of $83.48.[103] On 17 December 2014 Pershing Square Capital released a 2005 video of a Herbalife training conference in which Stephan Gratziani, a member of Herbalife's Chairman's Club sales team, was recorded telling an audience of high-level distributors "We sell people on a dream business that they can make it, yet deep down inside we know that most of them aren't going to," along with other statements that Pershing described as implying that the business model was not sustainable.[104][105][106] According to an unnamed source speaking to the New York Post, the video had previously been subpoenaed by federal investigators.[105] In an interview with Bloomberg, Ackman predicted that the company would experience an "implosion" in 2015 or early 2016, citing federal scrutiny and debt.[106][107]
FTC investigation[edit]
Based on information from a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, the New York Post reported on February 4, 2013, that HerbaLife was subject to a pending probe from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC released 729 pages containing 192 complaints received over a 7-year period in regards to the New York Post's FOIA request. After reviewing the now-public complaints, which the FTC put on its website, Ackman told the New York Post: “I have a lot more confidence in our government’s regulators than those who own the stock.” [108] The FTC stated that the wording it used in its response to the FOIA request was incorrect; the FTC could not confirm or deny an investigation into Herbalife.[109]
In March 2014, the FTC opened an investigation into Herbalife in response to calls from consumer groups and members in both houses of Congress. Herbalife responded to the probe by saying it “welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace, and will co-operate fully with the FTC. We are confident that Herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.” The investigation process that is required for alleged pyramid schemes takes 12 to 18 months. In cases like the Herbalife investigation, the FTC often seeks to impose changes to a company’s practices—known as injunctive relief—in order to stop misconduct that it sees as harming consumers. In May 2016 a spokesperson from the FTC told Bloomberg that “Injunctive relief can be just as significant as the money obtained for consumers and even more influential on a company’s future operations”, in response to speculation that Herbalife was close to a resolution with the FTC.[11][110][111][112]
In July 2016, Herbalife agreed to change its business model and pay $200 million in a settlement with the FTC.[12][113][114][115] Partial refund checks were mailed to roughly 350,000 Herbalife distributors in January 2017.[116][117]
The lawsuit alleged that Herbalife deceived consumers into believing they could earn substantial income from the business opportunity or big money from the retail sale of the company’s products. In addition, the complaint charged that one of the fundamental principles of Herbalife’s business model—incentivizing distributors to buy products and to recruit others to join and buy products so they could advance in the company’s marketing program, rather than in response to actual consumer demand—is an unfair practice in violation of the FTC Act.[118]
As part of the settlement, Herbalife agreed to pay distributors based only on actual retail sales of products, rather than for recruiting other distributors. The FTC had noted that the overwhelming majority of Herbalife's distributors earn very little or nothing.

Herbalife International is a global multi-level marketing corporation that develops, markets and sells nutrition supplements, weight management, sports nutrition and personal-care products. The company was founded by entrepreneur Mark Hughes in 1980, and it employs around 7,800 people worldwide. Herbalife reported net sales of US$4.488 billion in 2016, flat with 2015, and net income of $260.0 million, down 23% from the year prior.[4] The business is incorporated in the Cayman Islands,[2] and its corporate headquarters are there.[5]
The company operates internationally and distributes its products in 95 countries (as of July 2015) through a network of approximately 3.2 million independent distributors,[2] some of whom earn profit on product sales and additional commission from a network marketing compensation structure. The MLM compensation structure consists of commissions, royalties and bonuses on sales done by a distributor's downline (the people they have sponsored as new recruits). Out of about 526,000 total members in the US at the beginning of 2014, about 62,000 received bonuses of some kind from Herbalife: 7,385 (1.4%) received over $5,000 in bonuses per year (this translates to an average of $417 per month) and 1,304 (0.25%) received over $50,000 ($4,167 per month average). These figures do not include income from product sales nor do they include any costs incurred by distributors.[6]
The company has been criticized by, among others, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Capital, who claimed that Herbalife operates a "sophisticated pyramid scheme"[7][8] after taking a $1-billion short position in Herbalife stock.[9] The company denies the allegations.[10] However, in March 2014, Herbalife came under investigation by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the state of Illinois.[11] In July 2016, Herbalife agreed to change its business model and pay $200 million in a settlement with the FTC.[12]

History[edit]
In February 1980, Mark Hughes began selling the original Herbalife weight management product from the trunk of his car. Hughes often stated that the genesis of his product and program stemmed from the weight loss concerns of his mother Joanne, whose premature death he attributed to an eating disorder and an unhealthy approach to weight loss (though, according to an article from Los Angeles Times, this depiction of the story is not accurate [13]). His stated goal was to change the nutritional habits of the world.[14]
His first product was a protein shake designed to help people manage their weight. He structured his company using a direct-selling, pyramid marketing model.
In 1985, the California Attorney General sued the company for making inflated claims about the efficacy of its products. The company settled the suit for $850,000 without admitting wrongdoing.[15] In 1986, Herbalife became a publicly traded company on the NASDAQ, and in 1996 Herbalife reached US$1 billion in annual sales.
Mark Hughes died at age 44 on May 20, 2000.[16] The Los Angeles County Coroner autopsy results ruled that the entrepreneur had died of an accidental overdose of alcohol and doxepin, an anti-depressant.[17] The company continued to grow after his death and in 2002 was acquired for US$685 million by J.H. Whitney & Company and Golden Gate Capital, which took the company private again.
In April 2003, Michael O. Johnson joined Herbalife as CEO following a 17-year career with The Walt Disney Company, most recently as president of Walt Disney International.[15] On December 16, 2004, the company had an initial public offering on the NYSE of 14,500,000 common shares at $14 per share. 2004 net sales were reported as $1.3 billion.
On April 9, 2013, the company's long-time auditor, KPMG, resigned after the KPMG executive who oversaw Herbalife audits admitted to providing insider information to a golfing friend about at least five companies, including Herbalife and Skechers.[18][19] The company hired PricewaterhouseCoopers as its auditor on May 21, 2013.[20]
On May 7, 2014, the company announced that it entered into a deal with Bank of America Merrill Lynch to repurchase $266 million of its stock.[21]
The company announced in November 2016 that Chief Operating Officer Richard Goudis would take over the position of CEO in June 2017 and Johnson would transition to executive chairman.[22]
Products[edit]
Herbalife's products include protein shakes; protein snacks; nutrition, energy and fitness supplements; and personal care products.[23] The Formula 1 protein shake, a soy-based meal-replacement shake, is the company's number one product and was one of the first products it sold. Other products include products for heart health, digestive health, skin care, and the new 24 sports line released in 2011. Some products are vegetarian, kosher, allergen free,[24] or halal, and Herbalife provides testimonials and advice from health professionals as part of their product marketing.
According to the 2009 Form 10-K, many of Herbalife's weight management, nutritional and personal care products are manufactured by third-party manufacturing companies, with the exception of products distributed in and sourced from China, where they have their own manufacturing facility, and several products are produced in its manufacturing facility in Lake Forest, California (renovated in 2011[25]). Herbalife is modifying its recently acquired manufacturing facility in order to increase capability and capacity; after completion of these modifications, it expects to increase self-manufacturing.[26]:16 In June 2013, Herbalife announced the opening of a plant in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, in a facility previously occupied by Dell; the facility was expected to open in 2014 and employ 500 people.[27]
In October 2010, Herbalife held a groundbreaking ceremony in Changsha, Hunan Province, China, for a botanical extraction facility for its inner and outer nutrition products. The new facility opened in early 2013.[28] It purchases botanicals directly from farms in Hunan province, China, and other regions; performs extraction and other conversion processes; and then sends the processed raw materials directly to Herbalife's manufacturing facilities in Suzhou, China, and Lake Forest, California, or to its third-party manufacturers throughout the world. The new extraction plant produces botanical extracts, including teas, guarana, chamomile, broccoli, and bilberry, for use in many of the company's products.[29]
The specialists of the German Society for Nutrition (de) concluded that the use of Herbalife products alone does not solve weight problems.[30] In independent studies made by the German magazine Konsument (Zeitschrift Ökotest 11/2003), the products of Herbalife were found to be among the most expensive "healthy eating" products.[31]
Adverse effects[edit]
Ephedrine[edit]
Some of the original Herbalife weight loss products included herbs containing ephedrine, Ephedra sinica (ma huang) and Sida cordifolia. Ephedrine suppresses appetite; it is closely related to pseudoephedrine, and, like the latter compound, it acts as a nasal decongestant and can increase the heart rate. Plant sources of ephedrine were removed from Herbalife products in 2002 after several U.S. states banned supplements containing such herbs.[32]:15[33] The U.S. Food and Drug Administration banned supplements containing ephedrine in 2004.[34]
Allegations of lead contamination[edit]
In May 2009, an organization known as the Fraud Discovery Institute reported that laboratory test results of Herbalife products showed lead levels in excess of limits established by law in California under Proposition 65.[35] The Fraud Discovery Institute was founded by Barry Minkow; it dissolved in 2011 after Minkow pleaded guilty to an insider trading charge not related to Herbalife.[36]
Multiple independent labs reported finding lead in Herbalife products.[37][38][39][40] Herbalife responded by stating its products met federal FDA requirements[41][42] and claimed that they had commissioned independent laboratory tests showing that the products did not exceed Proposition 65 limits.[36] According to court documents, Herbalife settled with Minkow and paid him US$300,000.[43] In August 2008, Minkow retracted all accusations against Herbalife and removed any mention of the company from his web site.[44]
On May 10, 2008, a civil lawsuit was filed on behalf of a woman who developed lead-related liver complaints that she claimed were a reaction to a combination of Herbalife products.[36][45] The suit was filed by lawyer Christopher Grell, cofounder of the Dietary Supplement Safety Committee and an ally of Barry Minkow.[36] On June 17, 2008, the suit was expanded to add distributors who had supplied the woman with the Herbalife products, with Grell launching a website to offer persons who believe they were harmed by Herbalife products the chance of redress.[46]
Herbalife and liver disease inquiries[edit]
In 2004, Israel's Health Minister began an investigation into Herbalife's products after four persons using Herbalife's products were found to have liver problems.[47]
Herbalife was accused of selling products containing toxic ingredients such as Qua-qua, Kompri, and Kraska. The products were sent to Bio-Medical Research Design LTD (B.R.D), to a private U.S. laboratory, and to Israel's Forensic research laboratory. A study of the cases funded by the Israeli Ministry of Health concluded that a causative relationship[48] is suggested by the evidence, which included the temporal association between exposure to Herbalife products and the development of liver injury, the negative evaluation of other potential causes of liver injury, the normalization of liver function when Herbalife products were discontinued, and the return of liver injury symptoms in three patients who resumed using Herbalife products after recovery. Herbalife withdrew one product, which was only marketed in Israel, but not all of the Israeli patients had consumed this specific Herbalife product.[49] Herbalife's SEC 10-Q filings state that the Israeli Ministry of Health did not establish a causal relationship between the product and liver ailments. The Israeli Ministry of Health advises individuals with compromised liver function to avoid dietary supplements.[50] In 2009, an Israeli woman sued Herbalife International and Herbalife Israel, claiming that her liver damage resulted from the use of Herbalife products.[51]
Scientific studies in 2007 by doctors at the University Hospital of Bern in Switzerland and the Liver Unit of the Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center in Israel found an association between consumption of Herbalife products and hepatitis.[47][52] In response, the Spanish Ministry of Health issued an alert asking for caution in consuming Herbalife products.[53] Herbalife stated they were cooperating fully with Spanish authorities,[54] and after investigation, the agency determined no action was required and removed the alert.
Hospitals in Israel, Spain, Switzerland, Iceland, Argentina, and the United States had reported liver damage in a number of patients, some of whom had used Herbalife products.[47][52][55][56][57][58][59][60][61] Some patients recovered after they had stopped taking the products, while in others the disease continued, and two patients died. Several authors considered it “certain” that Herbalife products were the cause of the observed liver disease because of a positive re-challenge, while most of the remaining cases were scored as “probable.”[62] Herbalife employees claim there is no definitive proof that Herbalife products cause hepatotoxicity or other liver problems.[63]
In January 2009, the Scientific Committee of the Spanish Agency for Food Safety and Nutrition (AESAN) reached the same conclusion. After reviewing cases implicating Herbalife products in Spain, Switzerland, Israel, Finland, France, Italy, Iceland and Portugal, the 12-member scientific panel issued a report concluding: "The analyses of these cases and information regarding their circumstances have not allowed us to establish a causal relationship" between liver anomalies and Herbalife's dietary supplements. The panel attributed the cases to metabolic changes from overzealous and unsupervised dieting.[64] However, neither a 2005 American Association for the Study of the Liver position paper[65] on the management of acute liver failure nor a 2013 review in the New England Journal of Medicine[66] lists "overzealous dieting" among the recognized causes of acute liver failure.
A July 2013 peer-reviewed study published in the World Journal of Hepatology reexamined known cases of hepatoxicity that had previously been linked to consumption of Herbalife products and concluded that using "the liver specific Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences scale, causality was probable in 1 case, unlikely and excluded in the other cases. Thus, causality levels were much lower than hitherto proposed."[67] In a separate review published less than a year earlier, the same author described the relationship between Herbalife products and reported hepatoxicity cases as "highly probable".[68]
Business model[edit]

Herbalife is a pyramid (sometimes called pyramid scheme or network marketing) company. In addition to profits from product sales, Herbalife distributors can earn additional commissions from sales by other distributors they recruited, called their downline distributors. Supporters of MLM contend this is a fair compensation system, while critics contend that it is a pyramid scheme.[69][70] Critics also argue that the company does not make enough effort to curb abuses by individual distributors, though Herbalife has consistently denied such allegations.[71] Herbalife is a member of the Direct Selling Association in most countries in which it operates. In its filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), company management note problems with inappropriate business practices in the past, their subsequent long-lasting effects and the need to avoid any repetition.
Company management considers the number and retention of distributors a key parameter and tracks it closely in financial reports. By January of each year, sales leaders are required to requalify. In February of each year, individuals who did not satisfy the sales leader qualification requirements during the preceding 12 months are removed from that rank. For the latest 12-month requalification period ending January 2011, approximately 48.9 percent of the eligible sales leaders requalified, an improvement from 43 percent in 2009.[72] The company was cited as one of the most profitable companies in Los Angeles County.[73]
A 2004 settlement resolved a class action suit on behalf of 8,700 former and current distributors who accused the company and distributors of "essentially running a pyramid scheme." A total of $6 million was to be paid out, with defendants not admitting guilt.
In a California class action suit (Minton v. Herbalife International, et al.) filed on February 17, 2005, the plaintiff challenged "the marketing practices of certain Herbalife International independent distributors and Herbalife International under various state laws prohibiting "endless chain schemes", insufficient disclosure in assisted marketing plans, unfair and deceptive business practices, and fraud and deceit".[74]
In a West Virginia class action suit (Mey v. Herbalife International, Inc., et al.) filed on July 16, 2003, the plaintiffs allege that some

telemarketing practices of certain Herbalife International distributors violate the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, or TCPA, and seeks to hold Herbalife International vicariously liable for the practices of these distributors. More specifically, the plaintiffs' complaint alleges that several of Herbalife International's distributors used pre-recorded telephone messages and autodialers to contact prospective customers in violation of the TCPA's prohibition of such practices

Herbalife management insisted they have meritorious defenses in both cases and that, in the West Virginia case, any such distributor actions also went against Herbalife's own policies. Management also contends that any adverse legal outcomes Herbalife might suffer would not significantly affect their financial condition, particularly since they have already set aside an amount that they "believe represents the likely outcome of the resolution of these disputes".[74] The case was resolved with Herbalife and its distributors paying $7 million into a fund for class members part of the suit.[75]:42 Herbalife International did not acknowledge wrongdoing or admit culpability for the actions of its distributors.
As of April 2008, a series of commercials featuring a large red animated fox advertising home-based business opportunities has been running on American television. The advertisements typically feature testimonials from actors playing individuals who have made sums of money between US$5,000 and US$15,000 per month as a result of participating in an undescribed business program. The advertisements direct viewers to a website that allows them to purchase a "success kit". The kit also provides no information about how the business opportunity works. These advertisements have been found to be run by independent Herbalife distributors, as a method of recruiting new downline distributors.[76] While it is not illegal, critics of this type of advertising prefer advertisers to be up-front about their company associations.
Herbalife Nutrition Clubs[edit]
While there are many ways to do the Herbalife business, earlier methods have fallen out of favor over time (i.e. direct mail and internet “lead generation"). One of the most popular current ways of doing the business is through what is called a "Nutrition Club." These clubs are usually storefront shops in densely populated areas, often predominantly Latino.[77]
Some Herbalife distributors complain they have no way of knowing if other clubs are already open in the area. One of the reasons for this is that Herbalife Nutrition Clubs can be hard to find,[78] since the company doesn’t allow the shop owner/manager to advertise, to have awnings, to have any visible interior, to have an open / closed sign, to have a public facing website, or indicate in any other way that they are a business. They also cannot use the word “Herbalife” or "shop" on the club's exterior.
Furthermore, distributors are disallowed from selling the products directly at the club; instead they are to sell a daily "membership" that entitles the customer to a shake, a cup of aloe water, and a tea in a styrofoam cup. A daily "member" typically pays $5 to $7 in cash for the membership. Herbalife rules also dictate that no one can leave the club with these products; they must be consumed in the club.[79]
Pyramid scheme allegations[edit]
On December 3, 2013, a Belgian appeals court overturned[80] a November 2011 ruling by the Commercial Court in Brussels, Belgium that Herbalife was an illegal pyramid scheme.[81]
Herbalife responded to the original Belgium decision by stating:

"Herbalife believes the judgment contains factual errors and is based on misinterpretations of the law and its direct-selling sales model. Herbalife remains committed to its pyramid direct-selling sales model and is confident that, with clarifications in certain aspects of its business, there will be no doubt as to its compliance with all applicable Belgian laws."[82]

The company filed an appeal on March 8, 2012.[83] In response to the ruling being overturned, Herbalife said in a statement that it welcomed:

"the judgment by a Belgian Appeal Court that states the company’s sales model is in full compliance with Belgian law. This judgment overturns a previous ruling by the lower court, in response to claims brought by Belgian consumer organization Test-Aankoop, that Herbalife was operating a pyramid scheme. Herbalife always believed that the first judgment contained factual errors and was based on misinterpretations of its direct-selling sales method, and was confident that the original judgment would be overturned on appeal."[84]

Short sales[edit]
On May 1, 2012, a well-known short seller David Einhorn asked pointed questions about the company’s business and sales models during the Q1 earnings call, setting off suspicions that Einhorn had a short position.[85][86] These suspicions were proved correct in January 2013 when at an investor meeting Einhorn revealed that he had profited through a short position against the company. Einhorn said the short had been closed before the end of 2012.[87]
Allegations of running a 'pyramid scheme'[edit]
On December 20, 2012, Bill Ackman (of Pershing Square Capital) presented a series of arguments outlining why his firm believed that Herbalife operates a "sophisticated pyramid scheme".[8][10] Ackman has alleged after a year-long investigation that the majority of distributors lose money, that the chance of making the testimonial-implied headline income is approximately one in five thousand, and that the company materially overstates its distributors' retail sales and understates their recruiting rewards, to the point that he concludes it is a pyramid scheme.[88]
According to Reuters:

"The sales method, under which some people get more money for recruiting new distributors than selling products, has attracted criticism."[89]

Ackman claimed that Herbalife distributors "primarily obtain their monetary benefits from recruitment rather than the sale of goods and services to consumers." His firm estimates that, since 1980, the scheme has led to more than $3.5 billion of total net losses suffered by those at the bottom of the Herbalife chain. He said on CNBC that millions of low income people around the world, hoping to become millionaires, are being duped with this scheme, and if they knew that the probability is less than 1% of making a hundred thousand dollars, what Herbalife calls the "millionaires team", no one would sign up for it.[90]
Herbalife responded to Ackman's 2012 presentation saying:

"[It] was a malicious attack on Herbalife's business model based largely on outdated, distorted and inaccurate information. Herbalife operates with the highest ethical and quality standards, and our management and our board are constantly reviewing our business practices and products. Herbalife also hires independent, outside experts to ensure our operations are in full compliance with laws and regulations. Herbalife is not an illegal pyramid scheme."[91]

Herbalife also countered that Ackman based his accusations on a misunderstanding of the company's distributor base. At an investor conference in January 2013, the company released results of a Nielsen Research International survey showing 73 percent of Herbalife distributors never intended to make money by reselling the product. Instead, they wanted to buy products at a discount for personal use.[92] To make the distinction clearer, the company announced on its June 2013 earnings call that it would begin referring to these discount buyers as "members" rather than "distributors." [93]
According to a number of financial commentators, Ackman bet roughly $1 billion against the company;[94] soon after remarks to the press, the price of the stock decreased such that Ackman would have made $300 million if he had closed his short position then.[95] Ackman stated that he will donate all of his profits from the trade to charity, taking the financial incentive out of the equation.[90][96] A few months after Ackman's initial comments, billionaire investor Carl Icahn refuted Ackman's comment in a very public spat on national TV. Shortly thereafter, Icahn bought shares of Herbalife Intl. As Icahn continued to buy up HLF shares, the stock price continued to show strength.[97] By May 2013, Icahn owned 16.5% of the company.[98] That number had declined to 6.4 by November 2013.[99] Investor George Soros and Post Foods CEO William Stiritz also bought large shares of Herbalife. Ackman acknowledged losing $400–500 million on his short position in November 2013.[100] By November 2014, Soros had sold 2.8 million shares, 60% of his stake, while Perry Capital had purchased 1.6 million shares.[101][102]
By December 2, 2014 stock prices had fallen nearly 50% to $42.08 from their January 8 high of $83.48.[103] On 17 December 2014 Pershing Square Capital released a 2005 video of a Herbalife training conference in which Stephan Gratziani, a member of Herbalife's Chairman's Club sales team, was recorded telling an audience of high-level distributors "We sell people on a dream business that they can make it, yet deep down inside we know that most of them aren't going to," along with other statements that Pershing described as implying that the business model was not sustainable.[104][105][106] According to an unnamed source speaking to the New York Post, the video had previously been subpoenaed by federal investigators.[105] In an interview with Bloomberg, Ackman predicted that the company would experience an "implosion" in 2015 or early 2016, citing federal scrutiny and debt.[106][107]
FTC investigation[edit]
Based on information from a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, the New York Post reported on February 4, 2013, that HerbaLife was subject to a pending probe from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC released 729 pages containing 192 complaints received over a 7-year period in regards to the New York Post's FOIA request. After reviewing the now-public complaints, which the FTC put on its website, Ackman told the New York Post: “I have a lot more confidence in our government’s regulators than those who own the stock.” [108] The FTC stated that the wording it used in its response to the FOIA request was incorrect; the FTC could not confirm or deny an investigation into Herbalife.[109]
In March 2014, the FTC opened an investigation into Herbalife in response to calls from consumer groups and members in both houses of Congress. Herbalife responded to the probe by saying it “welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace, and will co-operate fully with the FTC. We are confident that Herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.” The investigation process that is required for alleged pyramid schemes takes 12 to 18 months. In cases like the Herbalife investigation, the FTC often seeks to impose changes to a company’s practices—known as injunctive relief—in order to stop misconduct that it sees as harming consumers. In May 2016 a spokesperson from the FTC told Bloomberg that “Injunctive relief can be just as significant as the money obtained for consumers and even more influential on a company’s future operations”, in response to speculation that Herbalife was close to a resolution with the FTC.[11][110][111][112]
In July 2016, Herbalife agreed to change its business model and pay $200 million in a settlement with the FTC.[12][113][114][115] Partial refund checks were mailed to roughly 350,000 Herbalife distributors in January 2017.[116][117]
The lawsuit alleged that Herbalife deceived consumers into believing they could earn substantial income from the business opportunity or big money from the retail sale of the company’s products. In addition, the complaint charged that one of the fundamental principles of Herbalife’s business model—incentivizing distributors to buy products and to recruit others to join and buy products so they could advance in the company’s marketing program, rather than in response to actual consumer demand—is an unfair practice in violation of the FTC Act.[118]
As part of the settlement, Herbalife agreed to pay distributors based only on actual retail sales of products, rather than for recruiting other distributors. The FTC had noted that the overwhelming majority of Herbalife's distributors earn very little or nothing.

Herbalife International is a global multi-level marketing corporation that develops, markets and sells nutrition supplements, weight management, sports nutrition and personal-care products. The company was founded by entrepreneur Mark Hughes in 1980, and it employs around 7,800 people worldwide. Herbalife reported net sales of US$4.488 billion in 2016, flat with 2015, and net income of $260.0 million, down 23% from the year prior.[4] The business is incorporated in the Cayman Islands,[2] and its corporate headquarters are there.[5]
The company operates internationally and distributes its products in 95 countries (as of July 2015) through a network of approximately 3.2 million independent distributors,[2] some of whom earn profit on product sales and additional commission from a network marketing compensation structure. The MLM compensation structure consists of commissions, royalties and bonuses on sales done by a distributor's downline (the people they have sponsored as new recruits). Out of about 526,000 total members in the US at the beginning of 2014, about 62,000 received bonuses of some kind from Herbalife: 7,385 (1.4%) received over $5,000 in bonuses per year (this translates to an average of $417 per month) and 1,304 (0.25%) received over $50,000 ($4,167 per month average). These figures do not include income from product sales nor do they include any costs incurred by distributors.[6]
The company has been criticized by, among others, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Capital, who claimed that Herbalife operates a "sophisticated pyramid scheme"[7][8] after taking a $1-billion short position in Herbalife stock.[9] The company denies the allegations.[10] However, in March 2014, Herbalife came under investigation by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the state of Illinois.[11] In July 2016, Herbalife agreed to change its business model and pay $200 million in a settlement with the FTC.[12]

History[edit]
In February 1980, Mark Hughes began selling the original Herbalife weight management product from the trunk of his car. Hughes often stated that the genesis of his product and program stemmed from the weight loss concerns of his mother Joanne, whose premature death he attributed to an eating disorder and an unhealthy approach to weight loss (though, according to an article from Los Angeles Times, this depiction of the story is not accurate [13]). His stated goal was to change the nutritional habits of the world.[14]
His first product was a protein shake designed to help people manage their weight. He structured his company using a direct-selling, pyramid marketing model.
In 1985, the California Attorney General sued the company for making inflated claims about the efficacy of its products. The company settled the suit for $850,000 without admitting wrongdoing.[15] In 1986, Herbalife became a publicly traded company on the NASDAQ, and in 1996 Herbalife reached US$1 billion in annual sales.
Mark Hughes died at age 44 on May 20, 2000.[16] The Los Angeles County Coroner autopsy results ruled that the entrepreneur had died of an accidental overdose of alcohol and doxepin, an anti-depressant.[17] The company continued to grow after his death and in 2002 was acquired for US$685 million by J.H. Whitney & Company and Golden Gate Capital, which took the company private again.
In April 2003, Michael O. Johnson joined Herbalife as CEO following a 17-year career with The Walt Disney Company, most recently as president of Walt Disney International.[15] On December 16, 2004, the company had an initial public offering on the NYSE of 14,500,000 common shares at $14 per share. 2004 net sales were reported as $1.3 billion.
On April 9, 2013, the company's long-time auditor, KPMG, resigned after the KPMG executive who oversaw Herbalife audits admitted to providing insider information to a golfing friend about at least five companies, including Herbalife and Skechers.[18][19] The company hired PricewaterhouseCoopers as its auditor on May 21, 2013.[20]
On May 7, 2014, the company announced that it entered into a deal with Bank of America Merrill Lynch to repurchase $266 million of its stock.[21]
The company announced in November 2016 that Chief Operating Officer Richard Goudis would take over the position of CEO in June 2017 and Johnson would transition to executive chairman.[22]
Products[edit]
Herbalife's products include protein shakes; protein snacks; nutrition, energy and fitness supplements; and personal care products.[23] The Formula 1 protein shake, a soy-based meal-replacement shake, is the company's number one product and was one of the first products it sold. Other products include products for heart health, digestive health, skin care, and the new 24 sports line released in 2011. Some products are vegetarian, kosher, allergen free,[24] or halal, and Herbalife provides testimonials and advice from health professionals as part of their product marketing.
According to the 2009 Form 10-K, many of Herbalife's weight management, nutritional and personal care products are manufactured by third-party manufacturing companies, with the exception of products distributed in and sourced from China, where they have their own manufacturing facility, and several products are produced in its manufacturing facility in Lake Forest, California (renovated in 2011[25]). Herbalife is modifying its recently acquired manufacturing facility in order to increase capability and capacity; after completion of these modifications, it expects to increase self-manufacturing.[26]:16 In June 2013, Herbalife announced the opening of a plant in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, in a facility previously occupied by Dell; the facility was expected to open in 2014 and employ 500 people.[27]
In October 2010, Herbalife held a groundbreaking ceremony in Changsha, Hunan Province, China, for a botanical extraction facility for its inner and outer nutrition products. The new facility opened in early 2013.[28] It purchases botanicals directly from farms in Hunan province, China, and other regions; performs extraction and other conversion processes; and then sends the processed raw materials directly to Herbalife's manufacturing facilities in Suzhou, China, and Lake Forest, California, or to its third-party manufacturers throughout the world. The new extraction plant produces botanical extracts, including teas, guarana, chamomile, broccoli, and bilberry, for use in many of the company's products.[29]
The specialists of the German Society for Nutrition (de) concluded that the use of Herbalife products alone does not solve weight problems.[30] In independent studies made by the German magazine Konsument (Zeitschrift Ökotest 11/2003), the products of Herbalife were found to be among the most expensive "healthy eating" products.[31]
Adverse effects[edit]
Ephedrine[edit]
Some of the original Herbalife weight loss products included herbs containing ephedrine, Ephedra sinica (ma huang) and Sida cordifolia. Ephedrine suppresses appetite; it is closely related to pseudoephedrine, and, like the latter compound, it acts as a nasal decongestant and can increase the heart rate. Plant sources of ephedrine were removed from Herbalife products in 2002 after several U.S. states banned supplements containing such herbs.[32]:15[33] The U.S. Food and Drug Administration banned supplements containing ephedrine in 2004.[34]
Allegations of lead contamination[edit]
In May 2009, an organization known as the Fraud Discovery Institute reported that laboratory test results of Herbalife products showed lead levels in excess of limits established by law in California under Proposition 65.[35] The Fraud Discovery Institute was founded by Barry Minkow; it dissolved in 2011 after Minkow pleaded guilty to an insider trading charge not related to Herbalife.[36]
Multiple independent labs reported finding lead in Herbalife products.[37][38][39][40] Herbalife responded by stating its products met federal FDA requirements[41][42] and claimed that they had commissioned independent laboratory tests showing that the products did not exceed Proposition 65 limits.[36] According to court documents, Herbalife settled with Minkow and paid him US$300,000.[43] In August 2008, Minkow retracted all accusations against Herbalife and removed any mention of the company from his web site.[44]
On May 10, 2008, a civil lawsuit was filed on behalf of a woman who developed lead-related liver complaints that she claimed were a reaction to a combination of Herbalife products.[36][45] The suit was filed by lawyer Christopher Grell, cofounder of the Dietary Supplement Safety Committee and an ally of Barry Minkow.[36] On June 17, 2008, the suit was expanded to add distributors who had supplied the woman with the Herbalife products, with Grell launching a website to offer persons who believe they were harmed by Herbalife products the chance of redress.[46]
Herbalife and liver disease inquiries[edit]
In 2004, Israel's Health Minister began an investigation into Herbalife's products after four persons using Herbalife's products were found to have liver problems.[47]
Herbalife was accused of selling products containing toxic ingredients such as Qua-qua, Kompri, and Kraska. The products were sent to Bio-Medical Research Design LTD (B.R.D), to a private U.S. laboratory, and to Israel's Forensic research laboratory. A study of the cases funded by the Israeli Ministry of Health concluded that a causative relationship[48] is suggested by the evidence, which included the temporal association between exposure to Herbalife products and the development of liver injury, the negative evaluation of other potential causes of liver injury, the normalization of liver function when Herbalife products were discontinued, and the return of liver injury symptoms in three patients who resumed using Herbalife products after recovery. Herbalife withdrew one product, which was only marketed in Israel, but not all of the Israeli patients had consumed this specific Herbalife product.[49] Herbalife's SEC 10-Q filings state that the Israeli Ministry of Health did not establish a causal relationship between the product and liver ailments. The Israeli Ministry of Health advises individuals with compromised liver function to avoid dietary supplements.[50] In 2009, an Israeli woman sued Herbalife International and Herbalife Israel, claiming that her liver damage resulted from the use of Herbalife products.[51]
Scientific studies in 2007 by doctors at the University Hospital of Bern in Switzerland and the Liver Unit of the Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center in Israel found an association between consumption of Herbalife products and hepatitis.[47][52] In response, the Spanish Ministry of Health issued an alert asking for caution in consuming Herbalife products.[53] Herbalife stated they were cooperating fully with Spanish authorities,[54] and after investigation, the agency determined no action was required and removed the alert.
Hospitals in Israel, Spain, Switzerland, Iceland, Argentina, and the United States had reported liver damage in a number of patients, some of whom had used Herbalife products.[47][52][55][56][57][58][59][60][61] Some patients recovered after they had stopped taking the products, while in others the disease continued, and two patients died. Several authors considered it “certain” that Herbalife products were the cause of the observed liver disease because of a positive re-challenge, while most of the remaining cases were scored as “probable.”[62] Herbalife employees claim there is no definitive proof that Herbalife products cause hepatotoxicity or other liver problems.[63]
In January 2009, the Scientific Committee of the Spanish Agency for Food Safety and Nutrition (AESAN) reached the same conclusion. After reviewing cases implicating Herbalife products in Spain, Switzerland, Israel, Finland, France, Italy, Iceland and Portugal, the 12-member scientific panel issued a report concluding: "The analyses of these cases and information regarding their circumstances have not allowed us to establish a causal relationship" between liver anomalies and Herbalife's dietary supplements. The panel attributed the cases to metabolic changes from overzealous and unsupervised dieting.[64] However, neither a 2005 American Association for the Study of the Liver position paper[65] on the management of acute liver failure nor a 2013 review in the New England Journal of Medicine[66] lists "overzealous dieting" among the recognized causes of acute liver failure.
A July 2013 peer-reviewed study published in the World Journal of Hepatology reexamined known cases of hepatoxicity that had previously been linked to consumption of Herbalife products and concluded that using "the liver specific Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences scale, causality was probable in 1 case, unlikely and excluded in the other cases. Thus, causality levels were much lower than hitherto proposed."[67] In a separate review published less than a year earlier, the same author described the relationship between Herbalife products and reported hepatoxicity cases as "highly probable".[68]
Business model[edit]




A car decorated with Herbalife branding, parked in London


Herbalife is a pyramid (sometimes called pyramid scheme or network marketing) company. In addition to profits from product sales, Herbalife distributors can earn additional commissions from sales by other distributors they recruited, called their downline distributors. Supporters of MLM contend this is a fair compensation system, while critics contend that it is a pyramid scheme.[69][70] Critics also argue that the company does not make enough effort to curb abuses by individual distributors, though Herbalife has consistently denied such allegations.[71] Herbalife is a member of the Direct Selling Association in most countries in which it operates. In its filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), company management note problems with inappropriate business practices in the past, their subsequent long-lasting effects and the need to avoid any repetition.
Company management considers the number and retention of distributors a key parameter and tracks it closely in financial reports. By January of each year, sales leaders are required to requalify. In February of each year, individuals who did not satisfy the sales leader qualification requirements during the preceding 12 months are removed from that rank. For the latest 12-month requalification period ending January 2011, approximately 48.9 percent of the eligible sales leaders requalified, an improvement from 43 percent in 2009.[72] The company was cited as one of the most profitable companies in Los Angeles County.[73]
A 2004 settlement resolved a class action suit on behalf of 8,700 former and current distributors who accused the company and distributors of "essentially running a pyramid scheme." A total of $6 million was to be paid out, with defendants not admitting guilt.
In a California class action suit (Minton v. Herbalife International, et al.) filed on February 17, 2005, the plaintiff challenged "the marketing practices of certain Herbalife International independent distributors and Herbalife International under various state laws prohibiting "endless chain schemes", insufficient disclosure in assisted marketing plans, unfair and deceptive business practices, and fraud and deceit".[74]
In a West Virginia class action suit (Mey v. Herbalife International, Inc., et al.) filed on July 16, 2003, the plaintiffs allege that some

telemarketing practices of certain Herbalife International distributors violate the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, or TCPA, and seeks to hold Herbalife International vicariously liable for the practices of these distributors. More specifically, the plaintiffs' complaint alleges that several of Herbalife International's distributors used pre-recorded telephone messages and autodialers to contact prospective customers in violation of the TCPA's prohibition of such practices

Herbalife management insisted they have meritorious defenses in both cases and that, in the West Virginia case, any such distributor actions also went against Herbalife's own policies. Management also contends that any adverse legal outcomes Herbalife might suffer would not significantly affect their financial condition, particularly since they have already set aside an amount that they "believe represents the likely outcome of the resolution of these disputes".[74] The case was resolved with Herbalife and its distributors paying $7 million into a fund for class members part of the suit.[75]:42 Herbalife International did not acknowledge wrongdoing or admit culpability for the actions of its distributors.
As of April 2008, a series of commercials featuring a large red animated fox advertising home-based business opportunities has been running on American television. The advertisements typically feature testimonials from actors playing individuals who have made sums of money between US$5,000 and US$15,000 per month as a result of participating in an undescribed business program. The advertisements direct viewers to a website that allows them to purchase a "success kit". The kit also provides no information about how the business opportunity works. These advertisements have been found to be run by independent Herbalife distributors, as a method of recruiting new downline distributors.[76] While it is not illegal, critics of this type of advertising prefer advertisers to be up-front about their company associations.
Herbalife Nutrition Clubs[edit]
While there are many ways to do the Herbalife business, earlier methods have fallen out of favor over time (i.e. direct mail and internet “lead generation"). One of the most popular current ways of doing the business is through what is called a "Nutrition Club." These clubs are usually storefront shops in densely populated areas, often predominantly Latino.[77]
Some Herbalife distributors complain they have no way of knowing if other clubs are already open in the area. One of the reasons for this is that Herbalife Nutrition Clubs can be hard to find,[78] since the company doesn’t allow the shop owner/manager to advertise, to have awnings, to have any visible interior, to have an open / closed sign, to have a public facing website, or indicate in any other way that they are a business. They also cannot use the word “Herbalife” or "shop" on the club's exterior.
Furthermore, distributors are disallowed from selling the products directly at the club; instead they are to sell a daily "membership" that entitles the customer to a shake, a cup of aloe water, and a tea in a styrofoam cup. A daily "member" typically pays $5 to $7 in cash for the membership. Herbalife rules also dictate that no one can leave the club with these products; they must be consumed in the club.[79]
Pyramid scheme allegations[edit]
On December 3, 2013, a Belgian appeals court overturned[80] a November 2011 ruling by the Commercial Court in Brussels, Belgium that Herbalife was an illegal pyramid scheme.[81]
Herbalife responded to the original Belgium decision by stating:

"Herbalife believes the judgment contains factual errors and is based on misinterpretations of the law and its direct-selling sales model. Herbalife remains committed to its pyramid direct-selling sales model and is confident that, with clarifications in certain aspects of its business, there will be no doubt as to its compliance with all applicable Belgian laws."[82]

The company filed an appeal on March 8, 2012.[83] In response to the ruling being overturned, Herbalife said in a statement that it welcomed:

"the judgment by a Belgian Appeal Court that states the company’s sales model is in full compliance with Belgian law. This judgment overturns a previous ruling by the lower court, in response to claims brought by Belgian consumer organization Test-Aankoop, that Herbalife was operating a pyramid scheme. Herbalife always believed that the first judgment contained factual errors and was based on misinterpretations of its direct-selling sales method, and was confident that the original judgment would be overturned on appeal."[84]

Short sales[edit]
On May 1, 2012, a well-known short seller David Einhorn asked pointed questions about the company’s business and sales models during the Q1 earnings call, setting off suspicions that Einhorn had a short position.[85][86] These suspicions were proved correct in January 2013 when at an investor meeting Einhorn revealed that he had profited through a short position against the company. Einhorn said the short had been closed before the end of 2012.[87]
Allegations of running a 'pyramid scheme'[edit]
On December 20, 2012, Bill Ackman (of Pershing Square Capital) presented a series of arguments outlining why his firm believed that Herbalife operates a "sophisticated pyramid scheme".[8][10] Ackman has alleged after a year-long investigation that the majority of distributors lose money, that the chance of making the testimonial-implied headline income is approximately one in five thousand, and that the company materially overstates its distributors' retail sales and understates their recruiting rewards, to the point that he concludes it is a pyramid scheme.[88]
According to Reuters:

"The sales method, under which some people get more money for recruiting new distributors than selling products, has attracted criticism."[89]

Ackman claimed that Herbalife distributors "primarily obtain their monetary benefits from recruitment rather than the sale of goods and services to consumers." His firm estimates that, since 1980, the scheme has led to more than $3.5 billion of total net losses suffered by those at the bottom of the Herbalife chain. He said on CNBC that millions of low income people around the world, hoping to become millionaires, are being duped with this scheme, and if they knew that the probability is less than 1% of making a hundred thousand dollars, what Herbalife calls the "millionaires team", no one would sign up for it.[90]
Herbalife responded to Ackman's 2012 presentation saying:

"[It] was a malicious attack on Herbalife's business model based largely on outdated, distorted and inaccurate information. Herbalife operates with the highest ethical and quality standards, and our management and our board are constantly reviewing our business practices and products. Herbalife also hires independent, outside experts to ensure our operations are in full compliance with laws and regulations. Herbalife is not an illegal pyramid scheme."[91]

Herbalife also countered that Ackman based his accusations on a misunderstanding of the company's distributor base. At an investor conference in January 2013, the company released results of a Nielsen Research International survey showing 73 percent of Herbalife distributors never intended to make money by reselling the product. Instead, they wanted to buy products at a discount for personal use.[92] To make the distinction clearer, the company announced on its June 2013 earnings call that it would begin referring to these discount buyers as "members" rather than "distributors." [93]
According to a number of financial commentators, Ackman bet roughly $1 billion against the company;[94] soon after remarks to the press, the price of the stock decreased such that Ackman would have made $300 million if he had closed his short position then.[95] Ackman stated that he will donate all of his profits from the trade to charity, taking the financial incentive out of the equation.[90][96] A few months after Ackman's initial comments, billionaire investor Carl Icahn refuted Ackman's comment in a very public spat on national TV. Shortly thereafter, Icahn bought shares of Herbalife Intl. As Icahn continued to buy up HLF shares, the stock price continued to show strength.[97] By May 2013, Icahn owned 16.5% of the company.[98] That number had declined to 6.4 by November 2013.[99] Investor George Soros and Post Foods CEO William Stiritz also bought large shares of Herbalife. Ackman acknowledged losing $400–500 million on his short position in November 2013.[100] By November 2014, Soros had sold 2.8 million shares, 60% of his stake, while Perry Capital had purchased 1.6 million shares.[101][102]
By December 2, 2014 stock prices had fallen nearly 50% to $42.08 from their January 8 high of $83.48.[103] On 17 December 2014 Pershing Square Capital released a 2005 video of a Herbalife training conference in which Stephan Gratziani, a member of Herbalife's Chairman's Club sales team, was recorded telling an audience of high-level distributors "We sell people on a dream business that they can make it, yet deep down inside we know that most of them aren't going to," along with other statements that Pershing described as implying that the business model was not sustainable.[104][105][106] According to an unnamed source speaking to the New York Post, the video had previously been subpoenaed by federal investigators.[105] In an interview with Bloomberg, Ackman predicted that the company would experience an "implosion" in 2015 or early 2016, citing federal scrutiny and debt.[106][107]
FTC investigation[edit]
Based on information from a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, the New York Post reported on February 4, 2013, that HerbaLife was subject to a pending probe from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC released 729 pages containing 192 complaints received over a 7-year period in regards to the New York Post's FOIA request. After reviewing the now-public complaints, which the FTC put on its website, Ackman told the New York Post: “I have a lot more confidence in our government’s regulators than those who own the stock.” [108] The FTC stated that the wording it used in its response to the FOIA request was incorrect; the FTC could not confirm or deny an investigation into Herbalife.[109]
In March 2014, the FTC opened an investigation into Herbalife in response to calls from consumer groups and members in both houses of Congress. Herbalife responded to the probe by saying it “welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace, and will co-operate fully with the FTC. We are confident that Herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.” The investigation process that is required for alleged pyramid schemes takes 12 to 18 months. In cases like the Herbalife investigation, the FTC often seeks to impose changes to a company’s practices—known as injunctive relief—in order to stop misconduct that it sees as harming consumers. In May 2016 a spokesperson from the FTC told Bloomberg that “Injunctive relief can be just as significant as the money obtained for consumers and even more influential on a company’s future operations”, in response to speculation that Herbalife was close to a resolution with the FTC.[11][110][111][112]
In July 2016, Herbalife agreed to change its business model and pay $200 million in a settlement with the FTC.[12][113][114][115] Partial refund checks were mailed to roughly 350,000 Herbalife distributors in January 2017.[116][117]
The lawsuit alleged that Herbalife deceived consumers into believing they could earn substantial income from the business opportunity or big money from the retail sale of the company’s products. In addition, the complaint charged that one of the fundamental principles of Herbalife’s business model—incentivizing distributors to buy products and to recruit others to join and buy products so they could advance in the company’s marketing program, rather than in response to actual consumer demand—is an unfair practice in violation of the FTC Act.[118]
As part of the settlement, Herbalife agreed to pay distributors based only on actual retail sales of products, rather than for recruiting other distributors. The FTC had noted that the overwhelming majority of Herbalife's distributors earn very little or nothing.

Herbalife International is a global multi-level marketing corporation that develops, markets and sells nutrition supplements, weight management, sports nutrition and personal-care products. The company was founded by entrepreneur Mark Hughes in 1980, and it employs around 7,800 people worldwide. Herbalife reported net sales of US$4.488 billion in 2016, flat with 2015, and net income of $260.0 million, down 23% from the year prior.[4] The business is incorporated in the Cayman Islands,[2] and its corporate headquarters are there.[5]
The company operates internationally and distributes its products in 95 countries (as of July 2015) through a network of approximately 3.2 million independent distributors,[2] some of whom earn profit on product sales and additional commission from a network marketing compensation structure. The MLM compensation structure consists of commissions, royalties and bonuses on sales done by a distributor's downline (the people they have sponsored as new recruits). Out of about 526,000 total members in the US at the beginning of 2014, about 62,000 received bonuses of some kind from Herbalife: 7,385 (1.4%) received over $5,000 in bonuses per year (this translates to an average of $417 per month) and 1,304 (0.25%) received over $50,000 ($4,167 per month average). These figures do not include income from product sales nor do they include any costs incurred by distributors.[6]
The company has been criticized by, among others, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Capital, who claimed that Herbalife operates a "sophisticated pyramid scheme"[7][8] after taking a $1-billion short position in Herbalife stock.[9] The company denies the allegations.[10] However, in March 2014, Herbalife came under investigation by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the state of Illinois.[11] In July 2016, Herbalife agreed to change its business model and pay $200 million in a settlement with the FTC.[12]

History[edit]
In February 1980, Mark Hughes began selling the original Herbalife weight management product from the trunk of his car. Hughes often stated that the genesis of his product and program stemmed from the weight loss concerns of his mother Joanne, whose premature death he attributed to an eating disorder and an unhealthy approach to weight loss (though, according to an article from Los Angeles Times, this depiction of the story is not accurate [13]). His stated goal was to change the nutritional habits of the world.[14]
His first product was a protein shake designed to help people manage their weight. He structured his company using a direct-selling, pyramid marketing model.
In 1985, the California Attorney General sued the company for making inflated claims about the efficacy of its products. The company settled the suit for $850,000 without admitting wrongdoing.[15] In 1986, Herbalife became a publicly traded company on the NASDAQ, and in 1996 Herbalife reached US$1 billion in annual sales.
Mark Hughes died at age 44 on May 20, 2000.[16] The Los Angeles County Coroner autopsy results ruled that the entrepreneur had died of an accidental overdose of alcohol and doxepin, an anti-depressant.[17] The company continued to grow after his death and in 2002 was acquired for US$685 million by J.H. Whitney & Company and Golden Gate Capital, which took the company private again.
In April 2003, Michael O. Johnson joined Herbalife as CEO following a 17-year career with The Walt Disney Company, most recently as president of Walt Disney International.[15] On December 16, 2004, the company had an initial public offering on the NYSE of 14,500,000 common shares at $14 per share. 2004 net sales were reported as $1.3 billion.
On April 9, 2013, the company's long-time auditor, KPMG, resigned after the KPMG executive who oversaw Herbalife audits admitted to providing insider information to a golfing friend about at least five companies, including Herbalife and Skechers.[18][19] The company hired PricewaterhouseCoopers as its auditor on May 21, 2013.[20]
On May 7, 2014, the company announced that it entered into a deal with Bank of America Merrill Lynch to repurchase $266 million of its stock.[21]
The company announced in November 2016 that Chief Operating Officer Richard Goudis would take over the position of CEO in June 2017 and Johnson would transition to executive chairman.[22]
Products[edit]
Herbalife's products include protein shakes; protein snacks; nutrition, energy and fitness supplements; and personal care products.[23] The Formula 1 protein shake, a soy-based meal-replacement shake, is the company's number one product and was one of the first products it sold. Other products include products for heart health, digestive health, skin care, and the new 24 sports line released in 2011. Some products are vegetarian, kosher, allergen free,[24] or halal, and Herbalife provides testimonials and advice from health professionals as part of their product marketing.
According to the 2009 Form 10-K, many of Herbalife's weight management, nutritional and personal care products are manufactured by third-party manufacturing companies, with the exception of products distributed in and sourced from China, where they have their own manufacturing facility, and several products are produced in its manufacturing facility in Lake Forest, California (renovated in 2011[25]). Herbalife is modifying its recently acquired manufacturing facility in order to increase capability and capacity; after completion of these modifications, it expects to increase self-manufacturing.[26]:16 In June 2013, Herbalife announced the opening of a plant in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, in a facility previously occupied by Dell; the facility was expected to open in 2014 and employ 500 people.[27]
In October 2010, Herbalife held a groundbreaking ceremony in Changsha, Hunan Province, China, for a botanical extraction facility for its inner and outer nutrition products. The new facility opened in early 2013.[28] It purchases botanicals directly from farms in Hunan province, China, and other regions; performs extraction and other conversion processes; and then sends the processed raw materials directly to Herbalife's manufacturing facilities in Suzhou, China, and Lake Forest, California, or to its third-party manufacturers throughout the world. The new extraction plant produces botanical extracts, including teas, guarana, chamomile, broccoli, and bilberry, for use in many of the company's products.[29]
The specialists of the German Society for Nutrition (de) concluded that the use of Herbalife products alone does not solve weight problems.[30] In independent studies made by the German magazine Konsument (Zeitschrift Ökotest 11/2003), the products of Herbalife were found to be among the most expensive "healthy eating" products.[31]
Adverse effects[edit]
Ephedrine[edit]
Some of the original Herbalife weight loss products included herbs containing ephedrine, Ephedra sinica (ma huang) and Sida cordifolia. Ephedrine suppresses appetite; it is closely related to pseudoephedrine, and, like the latter compound, it acts as a nasal decongestant and can increase the heart rate. Plant sources of ephedrine were removed from Herbalife products in 2002 after several U.S. states banned supplements containing such herbs.[32]:15[33] The U.S. Food and Drug Administration banned supplements containing ephedrine in 2004.[34]
Allegations of lead contamination[edit]
In May 2009, an organization known as the Fraud Discovery Institute reported that laboratory test results of Herbalife products showed lead levels in excess of limits established by law in California under Proposition 65.[35] The Fraud Discovery Institute was founded by Barry Minkow; it dissolved in 2011 after Minkow pleaded guilty to an insider trading charge not related to Herbalife.[36]
Multiple independent labs reported finding lead in Herbalife products.[37][38][39][40] Herbalife responded by stating its products met federal FDA requirements[41][42] and claimed that they had commissioned independent laboratory tests showing that the products did not exceed Proposition 65 limits.[36] According to court documents, Herbalife settled with Minkow and paid him US$300,000.[43] In August 2008, Minkow retracted all accusations against Herbalife and removed any mention of the company from his web site.[44]
On May 10, 2008, a civil lawsuit was filed on behalf of a woman who developed lead-related liver complaints that she claimed were a reaction to a combination of Herbalife products.[36][45] The suit was filed by lawyer Christopher Grell, cofounder of the Dietary Supplement Safety Committee and an ally of Barry Minkow.[36] On June 17, 2008, the suit was expanded to add distributors who had supplied the woman with the Herbalife products, with Grell launching a website to offer persons who believe they were harmed by Herbalife products the chance of redress.[46]
Herbalife and liver disease inquiries[edit]
In 2004, Israel's Health Minister began an investigation into Herbalife's products after four persons using Herbalife's products were found to have liver problems.[47]
Herbalife was accused of selling products containing toxic ingredients such as Qua-qua, Kompri, and Kraska. The products were sent to Bio-Medical Research Design LTD (B.R.D), to a private U.S. laboratory, and to Israel's Forensic research laboratory. A study of the cases funded by the Israeli Ministry of Health concluded that a causative relationship[48] is suggested by the evidence, which included the temporal association between exposure to Herbalife products and the development of liver injury, the negative evaluation of other potential causes of liver injury, the normalization of liver function when Herbalife products were discontinued, and the return of liver injury symptoms in three patients who resumed using Herbalife products after recovery. Herbalife withdrew one product, which was only marketed in Israel, but not all of the Israeli patients had consumed this specific Herbalife product.[49] Herbalife's SEC 10-Q filings state that the Israeli Ministry of Health did not establish a causal relationship between the product and liver ailments. The Israeli Ministry of Health advises individuals with compromised liver function to avoid dietary supplements.[50] In 2009, an Israeli woman sued Herbalife International and Herbalife Israel, claiming that her liver damage resulted from the use of Herbalife products.[51]
Scientific studies in 2007 by doctors at the University Hospital of Bern in Switzerland and the Liver Unit of the Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center in Israel found an association between consumption of Herbalife products and hepatitis.[47][52] In response, the Spanish Ministry of Health issued an alert asking for caution in consuming Herbalife products.[53] Herbalife stated they were cooperating fully with Spanish authorities,[54] and after investigation, the agency determined no action was required and removed the alert.
Hospitals in Israel, Spain, Switzerland, Iceland, Argentina, and the United States had reported liver damage in a number of patients, some of whom had used Herbalife products.[47][52][55][56][57][58][59][60][61] Some patients recovered after they had stopped taking the products, while in others the disease continued, and two patients died. Several authors considered it “certain” that Herbalife products were the cause of the observed liver disease because of a positive re-challenge, while most of the remaining cases were scored as “probable.”[62] Herbalife employees claim there is no definitive proof that Herbalife products cause hepatotoxicity or other liver problems.[63]
In January 2009, the Scientific Committee of the Spanish Agency for Food Safety and Nutrition (AESAN) reached the same conclusion. After reviewing cases implicating Herbalife products in Spain, Switzerland, Israel, Finland, France, Italy, Iceland and Portugal, the 12-member scientific panel issued a report concluding: "The analyses of these cases and information regarding their circumstances have not allowed us to establish a causal relationship" between liver anomalies and Herbalife's dietary supplements. The panel attributed the cases to metabolic changes from overzealous and unsupervised dieting.[64] However, neither a 2005 American Association for the Study of the Liver position paper[65] on the management of acute liver failure nor a 2013 review in the New England Journal of Medicine[66] lists "overzealous dieting" among the recognized causes of acute liver failure.
A July 2013 peer-reviewed study published in the World Journal of Hepatology reexamined known cases of hepatoxicity that had previously been linked to consumption of Herbalife products and concluded that using "the liver specific Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences scale, causality was probable in 1 case, unlikely and excluded in the other cases. Thus, causality levels were much lower than hitherto proposed."[67] In a separate review published less than a year earlier, the same author described the relationship between Herbalife products and reported hepatoxicity cases as "highly probable".[68]

Herbalife is a pyramid (sometimes called pyramid scheme or network marketing) company. In addition to profits from product sales, Herbalife distributors can earn additional commissions from sales by other distributors they recruited, called their downline distributors. Supporters of MLM contend this is a fair compensation system, while critics contend that it is a pyramid scheme.[69][70] Critics also argue that the company does not make enough effort to curb abuses by individual distributors, though Herbalife has consistently denied such allegations.[71] Herbalife is a member of the Direct Selling Association in most countries in which it operates. In its filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), company management note problems with inappropriate business practices in the past, their subsequent long-lasting effects and the need to avoid any repetition.
Company management considers the number and retention of distributors a key parameter and tracks it closely in financial reports. By January of each year, sales leaders are required to requalify. In February of each year, individuals who did not satisfy the sales leader qualification requirements during the preceding 12 months are removed from that rank. For the latest 12-month requalification period ending January 2011, approximately 48.9 percent of the eligible sales leaders requalified, an improvement from 43 percent in 2009.[72] The company was cited as one of the most profitable companies in Los Angeles County.[73]
A 2004 settlement resolved a class action suit on behalf of 8,700 former and current distributors who accused the company and distributors of "essentially running a pyramid scheme." A total of $6 million was to be paid out, with defendants not admitting guilt.
In a California class action suit (Minton v. Herbalife International, et al.) filed on February 17, 2005, the plaintiff challenged "the marketing practices of certain Herbalife International independent distributors and Herbalife International under various state laws prohibiting "endless chain schemes", insufficient disclosure in assisted marketing plans, unfair and deceptive business practices, and fraud and deceit".[74]
In a West Virginia class action suit (Mey v. Herbalife International, Inc., et al.) filed on July 16, 2003, the plaintiffs allege that some

telemarketing practices of certain Herbalife International distributors violate the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, or TCPA, and seeks to hold Herbalife International vicariously liable for the practices of these distributors. More specifically, the plaintiffs' complaint alleges that several of Herbalife International's distributors used pre-recorded telephone messages and autodialers to contact prospective customers in violation of the TCPA's prohibition of such practices

Herbalife management insisted they have meritorious defenses in both cases and that, in the West Virginia case, any such distributor actions also went against Herbalife's own policies. Management also contends that any adverse legal outcomes Herbalife might suffer would not significantly affect their financial condition, particularly since they have already set aside an amount that they "believe represents the likely outcome of the resolution of these disputes".[74] The case was resolved with Herbalife and its distributors paying $7 million into a fund for class members part of the suit.[75]:42 Herbalife International did not acknowledge wrongdoing or admit culpability for the actions of its distributors.
As of April 2008, a series of commercials featuring a large red animated fox advertising home-based business opportunities has been running on American television. The advertisements typically feature testimonials from actors playing individuals who have made sums of money between US$5,000 and US$15,000 per month as a result of participating in an undescribed business program. The advertisements direct viewers to a website that allows them to purchase a "success kit". The kit also provides no information about how the business opportunity works. These advertisements have been found to be run by independent Herbalife distributors, as a method of recruiting new downline distributors.[76] While it is not illegal, critics of this type of advertising prefer advertisers to be up-front about their company associations.
Herbalife Nutrition Clubs[edit]
While there are many ways to do the Herbalife business, earlier methods have fallen out of favor over time (i.e. direct mail and internet “lead generation"). One of the most popular current ways of doing the business is through what is called a "Nutrition Club." These clubs are usually storefront shops in densely populated areas, often predominantly Latino.[77]
Some Herbalife distributors complain they have no way of knowing if other clubs are already open in the area. One of the reasons for this is that Herbalife Nutrition Clubs can be hard to find,[78] since the company doesn’t allow the shop owner/manager to advertise, to have awnings, to have any visible interior, to have an open / closed sign, to have a public facing website, or indicate in any other way that they are a business. They also cannot use the word “Herbalife” or "shop" on the club's exterior.
Furthermore, distributors are disallowed from selling the products directly at the club; instead they are to sell a daily "membership" that entitles the customer to a shake, a cup of aloe water, and a tea in a styrofoam cup. A daily "member" typically pays $5 to $7 in cash for the membership. Herbalife rules also dictate that no one can leave the club with these products; they must be consumed in the club.[79]
Pyramid scheme allegations[edit]
On December 3, 2013, a Belgian appeals court overturned[80] a November 2011 ruling by the Commercial Court in Brussels, Belgium that Herbalife was an illegal pyramid scheme.[81]
Herbalife responded to the original Belgium decision by stating:

"Herbalife believes the judgment contains factual errors and is based on misinterpretations of the law and its direct-selling sales model. Herbalife remains committed to its pyramid direct-selling sales model and is confident that, with clarifications in certain aspects of its business, there will be no doubt as to its compliance with all applicable Belgian laws."[82]

The company filed an appeal on March 8, 2012.[83] In response to the ruling being overturned, Herbalife said in a statement that it welcomed:

"the judgment by a Belgian Appeal Court that states the company’s sales model is in full compliance with Belgian law. This judgment overturns a previous ruling by the lower court, in response to claims brought by Belgian consumer organization Test-Aankoop, that Herbalife was operating a pyramid scheme. Herbalife always believed that the first judgment contained factual errors and was based on misinterpretations of its direct-selling sales method, and was confident that the original judgment would be overturned on appeal."[84]

Short sales[edit]
On May 1, 2012, a well-known short seller David Einhorn asked pointed questions about the company’s business and sales models during the Q1 earnings call, setting off suspicions that Einhorn had a short position.[85][86] These suspicions were proved correct in January 2013 when at an investor meeting Einhorn revealed that he had profited through a short position against the company. Einhorn said the short had been closed before the end of 2012.[87]
Allegations of running a 'pyramid scheme'[edit]
On December 20, 2012, Bill Ackman (of Pershing Square Capital) presented a series of arguments outlining why his firm believed that Herbalife operates a "sophisticated pyramid scheme".[8][10] Ackman has alleged after a year-long investigation that the majority of distributors lose money, that the chance of making the testimonial-implied headline income is approximately one in five thousand, and that the company materially overstates its distributors' retail sales and understates their recruiting rewards, to the point that he concludes it is a pyramid scheme.[88]
According to Reuters:

"The sales method, under which some people get more money for recruiting new distributors than selling products, has attracted criticism."[89]

Ackman claimed that Herbalife distributors "primarily obtain their monetary benefits from recruitment rather than the sale of goods and services to consumers." His firm estimates that, since 1980, the scheme has led to more than $3.5 billion of total net losses suffered by those at the bottom of the Herbalife chain. He said on CNBC that millions of low income people around the world, hoping to become millionaires, are being duped with this scheme, and if they knew that the probability is less than 1% of making a hundred thousand dollars, what Herbalife calls the "millionaires team", no one would sign up for it.[90]
Herbalife responded to Ackman's 2012 presentation saying:

"[It] was a malicious attack on Herbalife's business model based largely on outdated, distorted and inaccurate information. Herbalife operates with the highest ethical and quality standards, and our management and our board are constantly reviewing our business practices and products. Herbalife also hires independent, outside experts to ensure our operations are in full compliance with laws and regulations. Herbalife is not an illegal pyramid scheme."[91]

Herbalife also countered that Ackman based his accusations on a misunderstanding of the company's distributor base. At an investor conference in January 2013, the company released results of a Nielsen Research International survey showing 73 percent of Herbalife distributors never intended to make money by reselling the product. Instead, they wanted to buy products at a discount for personal use.[92] To make the distinction clearer, the company announced on its June 2013 earnings call that it would begin referring to these discount buyers as "members" rather than "distributors." [93]
According to a number of financial commentators, Ackman bet roughly $1 billion against the company;[94] soon after remarks to the press, the price of the stock decreased such that Ackman would have made $300 million if he had closed his short position then.[95] Ackman stated that he will donate all of his profits from the trade to charity, taking the financial incentive out of the equation.[90][96] A few months after Ackman's initial comments, billionaire investor Carl Icahn refuted Ackman's comment in a very public spat on national TV. Shortly thereafter, Icahn bought shares of Herbalife Intl. As Icahn continued to buy up HLF shares, the stock price continued to show strength.[97] By May 2013, Icahn owned 16.5% of the company.[98] That number had declined to 6.4 by November 2013.[99] Investor George Soros and Post Foods CEO William Stiritz also bought large shares of Herbalife. Ackman acknowledged losing $400–500 million on his short position in November 2013.[100] By November 2014, Soros had sold 2.8 million shares, 60% of his stake, while Perry Capital had purchased 1.6 million shares.[101][102]
By December 2, 2014 stock prices had fallen nearly 50% to $42.08 from their January 8 high of $83.48.[103] On 17 December 2014 Pershing Square Capital released a 2005 video of a Herbalife training conference in which Stephan Gratziani, a member of Herbalife's Chairman's Club sales team, was recorded telling an audience of high-level distributors "We sell people on a dream business that they can make it, yet deep down inside we know that most of them aren't going to," along with other statements that Pershing described as implying that the business model was not sustainable.[104][105][106] According to an unnamed source speaking to the New York Post, the video had previously been subpoenaed by federal investigators.[105] In an interview with Bloomberg, Ackman predicted that the company would experience an "implosion" in 2015 or early 2016, citing federal scrutiny and debt.[106][107]
FTC investigation[edit]
Based on information from a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, the New York Post reported on February 4, 2013, that HerbaLife was subject to a pending probe from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC released 729 pages containing 192 complaints received over a 7-year period in regards to the New York Post's FOIA request. After reviewing the now-public complaints, which the FTC put on its website, Ackman told the New York Post: “I have a lot more confidence in our government’s regulators than those who own the stock.” [108] The FTC stated that the wording it used in its response to the FOIA request was incorrect; the FTC could not confirm or deny an investigation into Herbalife.[109]
In March 2014, the FTC opened an investigation into Herbalife in response to calls from consumer groups and members in both houses of Congress. Herbalife responded to the probe by saying it “welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace, and will co-operate fully with the FTC. We are confident that Herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.” The investigation process that is required for alleged pyramid schemes takes 12 to 18 months. In cases like the Herbalife investigation, the FTC often seeks to impose changes to a company’s practices—known as injunctive relief—in order to stop misconduct that it sees as harming consumers. In May 2016 a spokesperson from the FTC told Bloomberg that “Injunctive relief can be just as significant as the money obtained for consumers and even more influential on a company’s future operations”, in response to speculation that Herbalife was close to a resolution with the FTC.[11][110][111][112]
In July 2016, Herbalife agreed to change its business model and pay $200 million in a settlement with the FTC.[12][113][114][115] Partial refund checks were mailed to roughly 350,000 Herbalife distributors in January 2017.[116][117]
The lawsuit alleged that Herbalife deceived consumers into believing they could earn substantial income from the business opportunity or big money from the retail sale of the company’s products. In addition, the complaint charged that one of the fundamental principles of Herbalife’s business model—incentivizing distributors to buy products and to recruit others to join and buy products so they could advance in the company’s marketing program, rather than in response to actual consumer demand—is an unfair practice in violation of the FTC Act.[118]
As part of the settlement, Herbalife agreed to pay distributors based only on actual retail sales of products, rather than for recruiting other distributors. The FTC had noted that the overwhelming majority of Herbalife's distributors earn very little or nothing.

Herbalife International is a global multi-level marketing corporation that develops, markets and sells nutrition supplements, weight management, sports nutrition and personal-care products. The company was founded by entrepreneur Mark Hughes in 1980, and it employs around 7,800 people worldwide. Herbalife reported net sales of US$4.488 billion in 2016, flat with 2015, and net income of $260.0 million, down 23% from the year prior.[4] The business is incorporated in the Cayman Islands,[2] and its corporate headquarters are there.[5]
The company operates internationally and distributes its products in 95 countries (as of July 2015) through a network of approximately 3.2 million independent distributors,[2] some of whom earn profit on product sales and additional commission from a network marketing compensation structure. The MLM compensation structure consists of commissions, royalties and bonuses on sales done by a distributor's downline (the people they have sponsored as new recruits). Out of about 526,000 total members in the US at the beginning of 2014, about 62,000 received bonuses of some kind from Herbalife: 7,385 (1.4%) received over $5,000 in bonuses per year (this translates to an average of $417 per month) and 1,304 (0.25%) received over $50,000 ($4,167 per month average). These figures do not include income from product sales nor do they include any costs incurred by distributors.[6]
The company has been criticized by, among others, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Capital, who claimed that Herbalife operates a "sophisticated pyramid scheme"[7][8] after taking a $1-billion short position in Herbalife stock.[9] The company denies the allegations.[10] However, in March 2014, Herbalife came under investigation by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the state of Illinois.[11] In July 2016, Herbalife agreed to change its business model and pay $200 million in a settlement with the FTC.[12]

History[edit]
In February 1980, Mark Hughes began selling the original Herbalife weight management product from the trunk of his car. Hughes often stated that the genesis of his product and program stemmed from the weight loss concerns of his mother Joanne, whose premature death he attributed to an eating disorder and an unhealthy approach to weight loss (though, according to an article from Los Angeles Times, this depiction of the story is not accurate [13]). His stated goal was to change the nutritional habits of the world.[14]
His first product was a protein shake designed to help people manage their weight. He structured his company using a direct-selling, pyramid marketing model.
In 1985, the California Attorney General sued the company for making inflated claims about the efficacy of its products. The company settled the suit for $850,000 without admitting wrongdoing.[15] In 1986, Herbalife became a publicly traded company on the NASDAQ, and in 1996 Herbalife reached US$1 billion in annual sales.
Mark Hughes died at age 44 on May 20, 2000.[16] The Los Angeles County Coroner autopsy results ruled that the entrepreneur had died of an accidental overdose of alcohol and doxepin, an anti-depressant.[17] The company continued to grow after his death and in 2002 was acquired for US$685 million by J.H. Whitney & Company and Golden Gate Capital, which took the company private again.
In April 2003, Michael O. Johnson joined Herbalife as CEO following a 17-year career with The Walt Disney Company, most recently as president of Walt Disney International.[15] On December 16, 2004, the company had an initial public offering on the NYSE of 14,500,000 common shares at $14 per share. 2004 net sales were reported as $1.3 billion.
On April 9, 2013, the company's long-time auditor, KPMG, resigned after the KPMG executive who oversaw Herbalife audits admitted to providing insider information to a golfing friend about at least five companies, including Herbalife and Skechers.[18][19] The company hired PricewaterhouseCoopers as its auditor on May 21, 2013.[20]
On May 7, 2014, the company announced that it entered into a deal with Bank of America Merrill Lynch to repurchase $266 million of its stock.[21]
The company announced in November 2016 that Chief Operating Officer Richard Goudis would take over the position of CEO in June 2017 and Johnson would transition to executive chairman.[22]
Products[edit]
Herbalife's products include protein shakes; protein snacks; nutrition, energy and fitness supplements; and personal care products.[23] The Formula 1 protein shake, a soy-based meal-replacement shake, is the company's number one product and was one of the first products it sold. Other products include products for heart health, digestive health, skin care, and the new 24 sports line released in 2011. Some products are vegetarian, kosher, allergen free,[24] or halal, and Herbalife provides testimonials and advice from health professionals as part of their product marketing.
According to the 2009 Form 10-K, many of Herbalife's weight management, nutritional and personal care products are manufactured by third-party manufacturing companies, with the exception of products distributed in and sourced from China, where they have their own manufacturing facility, and several products are produced in its manufacturing facility in Lake Forest, California (renovated in 2011[25]). Herbalife is modifying its recently acquired manufacturing facility in order to increase capability and capacity; after completion of these modifications, it expects to increase self-manufacturing.[26]:16 In June 2013, Herbalife announced the opening of a plant in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, in a facility previously occupied by Dell; the facility was expected to open in 2014 and employ 500 people.[27]
In October 2010, Herbalife held a groundbreaking ceremony in Changsha, Hunan Province, China, for a botanical extraction facility for its inner and outer nutrition products. The new facility opened in early 2013.[28] It purchases botanicals directly from farms in Hunan province, China, and other regions; performs extraction and other conversion processes; and then sends the processed raw materials directly to Herbalife's manufacturing facilities in Suzhou, China, and Lake Forest, California, or to its third-party manufacturers throughout the world. The new extraction plant produces botanical extracts, including teas, guarana, chamomile, broccoli, and bilberry, for use in many of the company's products.[29]
The specialists of the German Society for Nutrition (de) concluded that the use of Herbalife products alone does not solve weight problems.[30] In independent studies made by the German magazine Konsument (Zeitschrift Ökotest 11/2003), the products of Herbalife were found to be among the most expensive "healthy eating" products.[31]
Adverse effects[edit]
Ephedrine[edit]
Some of the original Herbalife weight loss products included herbs containing ephedrine, Ephedra sinica (ma huang) and Sida cordifolia. Ephedrine suppresses appetite; it is closely related to pseudoephedrine, and, like the latter compound, it acts as a nasal decongestant and can increase the heart rate. Plant sources of ephedrine were removed from Herbalife products in 2002 after several U.S. states banned supplements containing such herbs.[32]:15[33] The U.S. Food and Drug Administration banned supplements containing ephedrine in 2004.[34]
Allegations of lead contamination[edit]
In May 2009, an organization known as the Fraud Discovery Institute reported that laboratory test results of Herbalife products showed lead levels in excess of limits established by law in California under Proposition 65.[35] The Fraud Discovery Institute was founded by Barry Minkow; it dissolved in 2011 after Minkow pleaded guilty to an insider trading charge not related to Herbalife.[36]
Multiple independent labs reported finding lead in Herbalife products.[37][38][39][40] Herbalife responded by stating its products met federal FDA requirements[41][42] and claimed that they had commissioned independent laboratory tests showing that the products did not exceed Proposition 65 limits.[36] According to court documents, Herbalife settled with Minkow and paid him US$300,000.[43] In August 2008, Minkow retracted all accusations against Herbalife and removed any mention of the company from his web site.[44]
On May 10, 2008, a civil lawsuit was filed on behalf of a woman who developed lead-related liver complaints that she claimed were a reaction to a combination of Herbalife products.[36][45] The suit was filed by lawyer Christopher Grell, cofounder of the Dietary Supplement Safety Committee and an ally of Barry Minkow.[36] On June 17, 2008, the suit was expanded to add distributors who had supplied the woman with the Herbalife products, with Grell launching a website to offer persons who believe they were harmed by Herbalife products the chance of redress.[46]
Herbalife and liver disease inquiries[edit]
In 2004, Israel's Health Minister began an investigation into Herbalife's products after four persons using Herbalife's products were found to have liver problems.[47]
Herbalife was accused of selling products containing toxic ingredients such as Qua-qua, Kompri, and Kraska. The products were sent to Bio-Medical Research Design LTD (B.R.D), to a private U.S. laboratory, and to Israel's Forensic research laboratory. A study of the cases funded by the Israeli Ministry of Health concluded that a causative relationship[48] is suggested by the evidence, which included the temporal association between exposure to Herbalife products and the development of liver injury, the negative evaluation of other potential causes of liver injury, the normalization of liver function when Herbalife products were discontinued, and the return of liver injury symptoms in three patients who resumed using Herbalife products after recovery. Herbalife withdrew one product, which was only marketed in Israel, but not all of the Israeli patients had consumed this specific Herbalife product.[49] Herbalife's SEC 10-Q filings state that the Israeli Ministry of Health did not establish a causal relationship between the product and liver ailments. The Israeli Ministry of Health advises individuals with compromised liver function to avoid dietary supplements.[50] In 2009, an Israeli woman sued Herbalife International and Herbalife Israel, claiming that her liver damage resulted from the use of Herbalife products.[51]
Scientific studies in 2007 by doctors at the University Hospital of Bern in Switzerland and the Liver Unit of the Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center in Israel found an association between consumption of Herbalife products and hepatitis.[47][52] In response, the Spanish Ministry of Health issued an alert asking for caution in consuming Herbalife products.[53] Herbalife stated they were cooperating fully with Spanish authorities,[54] and after investigation, the agency determined no action was required and removed the alert.
Hospitals in Israel, Spain, Switzerland, Iceland, Argentina, and the United States had reported liver damage in a number of patients, some of whom had used Herbalife products.[47][52][55][56][57][58][59][60][61] Some patients recovered after they had stopped taking the products, while in others the disease continued, and two patients died. Several authors considered it “certain” that Herbalife products were the cause of the observed liver disease because of a positive re-challenge, while most of the remaining cases were scored as “probable.”[62] Herbalife employees claim there is no definitive proof that Herbalife products cause hepatotoxicity or other liver problems.[63]
In January 2009, the Scientific Committee of the Spanish Agency for Food Safety and Nutrition (AESAN) reached the same conclusion. After reviewing cases implicating Herbalife products in Spain, Switzerland, Israel, Finland, France, Italy, Iceland and Portugal, the 12-member scientific panel issued a report concluding: "The analyses of these cases and information regarding their circumstances have not allowed us to establish a causal relationship" between liver anomalies and Herbalife's dietary supplements. The panel attributed the cases to metabolic changes from overzealous and unsupervised dieting.[64] However, neither a 2005 American Association for the Study of the Liver position paper[65] on the management of acute liver failure nor a 2013 review in the New England Journal of Medicine[66] lists "overzealous dieting" among the recognized causes of acute liver failure.
A July 2013 peer-reviewed study published in the World Journal of Hepatology reexamined known cases of hepatoxicity that had previously been linked to consumption of Herbalife products and concluded that using "the liver specific Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences scale, causality was probable in 1 case, unlikely and excluded in the other cases. Thus, causality levels were much lower than hitherto proposed."[67] In a separate review published less than a year earlier, the same author described the relationship between Herbalife products and reported hepatoxicity cases as "highly probable".[68]
Business model[edit]




A car decorated with Herbalife branding, parked in London


Herbalife is a pyramid (sometimes called pyramid scheme or network marketing) company. In addition to profits from product sales, Herbalife distributors can earn additional commissions from sales by other distributors they recruited, called their downline distributors. Supporters of MLM contend this is a fair compensation system, while critics contend that it is a pyramid scheme.[69][70] Critics also argue that the company does not make enough effort to curb abuses by individual distributors, though Herbalife has consistently denied such allegations.[71] Herbalife is a member of the Direct Selling Association in most countries in which it operates. In its filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), company management note problems with inappropriate business practices in the past, their subsequent long-lasting effects and the need to avoid any repetition.
Company management considers the number and retention of distributors a key parameter and tracks it closely in financial reports. By January of each year, sales leaders are required to requalify. In February of each year, individuals who did not satisfy the sales leader qualification requirements during the preceding 12 months are removed from that rank. For the latest 12-month requalification period ending January 2011, approximately 48.9 percent of the eligible sales leaders requalified, an improvement from 43 percent in 2009.[72] The company was cited as one of the most profitable companies in Los Angeles County.[73]
A 2004 settlement resolved a class action suit on behalf of 8,700 former and current distributors who accused the company and distributors of "essentially running a pyramid scheme." A total of $6 million was to be paid out, with defendants not admitting guilt.
In a California class action suit (Minton v. Herbalife International, et al.) filed on February 17, 2005, the plaintiff challenged "the marketing practices of certain Herbalife International independent distributors and Herbalife International under various state laws prohibiting "endless chain schemes", insufficient disclosure in assisted marketing plans, unfair and deceptive business practices, and fraud and deceit".[74]
In a West Virginia class action suit (Mey v. Herbalife International, Inc., et al.) filed on July 16, 2003, the plaintiffs allege that some

telemarketing practices of certain Herbalife International distributors violate the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, or TCPA, and seeks to hold Herbalife International vicariously liable for the practices of these distributors. More specifically, the plaintiffs' complaint alleges that several of Herbalife International's distributors used pre-recorded telephone messages and autodialers to contact prospective customers in violation of the TCPA's prohibition of such practices

Herbalife management insisted they have meritorious defenses in both cases and that, in the West Virginia case, any such distributor actions also went against Herbalife's own policies. Management also contends that any adverse legal outcomes Herbalife might suffer would not significantly affect their financial condition, particularly since they have already set aside an amount that they "believe represents the likely outcome of the resolution of these disputes".[74] The case was resolved with Herbalife and its distributors paying $7 million into a fund for class members part of the suit.[75]:42 Herbalife International did not acknowledge wrongdoing or admit culpability for the actions of its distributors.
As of April 2008, a series of commercials featuring a large red animated fox advertising home-based business opportunities has been running on American television. The advertisements typically feature testimonials from actors playing individuals who have made sums of money between US$5,000 and US$15,000 per month as a result of participating in an undescribed business program. The advertisements direct viewers to a website that allows them to purchase a "success kit". The kit also provides no information about how the business opportunity works. These advertisements have been found to be run by independent Herbalife distributors, as a method of recruiting new downline distributors.[76] While it is not illegal, critics of this type of advertising prefer advertisers to be up-front about their company associations.
Herbalife Nutrition Clubs[edit]
While there are many ways to do the Herbalife business, earlier methods have fallen out of favor over time (i.e. direct mail and internet “lead generation"). One of the most popular current ways of doing the business is through what is called a "Nutrition Club." These clubs are usually storefront shops in densely populated areas, often predominantly Latino.[77]
Some Herbalife distributors complain they have no way of knowing if other clubs are already open in the area. One of the reasons for this is that Herbalife Nutrition Clubs can be hard to find,[78] since the company doesn’t allow the shop owner/manager to advertise, to have awnings, to have any visible interior, to have an open / closed sign, to have a public facing website, or indicate in any other way that they are a business. They also cannot use the word “Herbalife” or "shop" on the club's exterior.
Furthermore, distributors are disallowed from selling the products directly at the club; instead they are to sell a daily "membership" that entitles the customer to a shake, a cup of aloe water, and a tea in a styrofoam cup. A daily "member" typically pays $5 to $7 in cash for the membership. Herbalife rules also dictate that no one can leave the club with these products; they must be consumed in the club.[79]
Pyramid scheme allegations[edit]
On December 3, 2013, a Belgian appeals court overturned[80] a November 2011 ruling by the Commercial Court in Brussels, Belgium that Herbalife was an illegal pyramid scheme.[81]
Herbalife responded to the original Belgium decision by stating:

"Herbalife believes the judgment contains factual errors and is based on misinterpretations of the law and its direct-selling sales model. Herbalife remains committed to its pyramid direct-selling sales model and is confident that, with clarifications in certain aspects of its business, there will be no doubt as to its compliance with all applicable Belgian laws."[82]

The company filed an appeal on March 8, 2012.[83] In response to the ruling being overturned, Herbalife said in a statement that it welcomed:

"the judgment by a Belgian Appeal Court that states the company’s sales model is in full compliance with Belgian law. This judgment overturns a previous ruling by the lower court, in response to claims brought by Belgian consumer organization Test-Aankoop, that Herbalife was operating a pyramid scheme. Herbalife always believed that the first judgment contained factual errors and was based on misinterpretations of its direct-selling sales method, and was confident that the original judgment would be overturned on appeal."[84]

Short sales[edit]
On May 1, 2012, a well-known short seller David Einhorn asked pointed questions about the company’s business and sales models during the Q1 earnings call, setting off suspicions that Einhorn had a short position.[85][86] These suspicions were proved correct in January 2013 when at an investor meeting Einhorn revealed that he had profited through a short position against the company. Einhorn said the short had been closed before the end of 2012.[87]
Allegations of running a 'pyramid scheme'[edit]
On December 20, 2012, Bill Ackman (of Pershing Square Capital) presented a series of arguments outlining why his firm believed that Herbalife operates a "sophisticated pyramid scheme".[8][10] Ackman has alleged after a year-long investigation that the majority of distributors lose money, that the chance of making the testimonial-implied headline income is approximately one in five thousand, and that the company materially overstates its distributors' retail sales and understates their recruiting rewards, to the point that he concludes it is a pyramid scheme.[88]
According to Reuters:

"The sales method, under which some people get more money for recruiting new distributors than selling products, has attracted criticism."[89]

Ackman claimed that Herbalife distributors "primarily obtain their monetary benefits from recruitment rather than the sale of goods and services to consumers." His firm estimates that, since 1980, the scheme has led to more than $3.5 billion of total net losses suffered by those at the bottom of the Herbalife chain. He said on CNBC that millions of low income people around the world, hoping to become millionaires, are being duped with this scheme, and if they knew that the probability is less than 1% of making a hundred thousand dollars, what Herbalife calls the "millionaires team", no one would sign up for it.[90]
Herbalife responded to Ackman's 2012 presentation saying:

"[It] was a malicious attack on Herbalife's business model based largely on outdated, distorted and inaccurate information. Herbalife operates with the highest ethical and quality standards, and our management and our board are constantly reviewing our business practices and products. Herbalife also hires independent, outside experts to ensure our operations are in full compliance with laws and regulations. Herbalife is not an illegal pyramid scheme."[91]

Herbalife also countered that Ackman based his accusations on a misunderstanding of the company's distributor base. At an investor conference in January 2013, the company released results of a Nielsen Research International survey showing 73 percent of Herbalife distributors never intended to make money by reselling the product. Instead, they wanted to buy products at a discount for personal use.[92] To make the distinction clearer, the company announced on its June 2013 earnings call that it would begin referring to these discount buyers as "members" rather than "distributors." [93]
According to a number of financial commentators, Ackman bet roughly $1 billion against the company;[94] soon after remarks to the press, the price of the stock decreased such that Ackman would have made $300 million if he had closed his short position then.[95] Ackman stated that he will donate all of his profits from the trade to charity, taking the financial incentive out of the equation.[90][96] A few months after Ackman's initial comments, billionaire investor Carl Icahn refuted Ackman's comment in a very public spat on national TV. Shortly thereafter, Icahn bought shares of Herbalife Intl. As Icahn continued to buy up HLF shares, the stock price continued to show strength.[97] By May 2013, Icahn owned 16.5% of the company.[98] That number had declined to 6.4 by November 2013.[99] Investor George Soros and Post Foods CEO William Stiritz also bought large shares of Herbalife. Ackman acknowledged losing $400–500 million on his short position in November 2013.[100] By November 2014, Soros had sold 2.8 million shares, 60% of his stake, while Perry Capital had purchased 1.6 million shares.[101][102]
By December 2, 2014 stock prices had fallen nearly 50% to $42.08 from their January 8 high of $83.48.[103] On 17 December 2014 Pershing Square Capital released a 2005 video of a Herbalife training conference in which Stephan Gratziani, a member of Herbalife's Chairman's Club sales team, was recorded telling an audience of high-level distributors "We sell people on a dream business that they can make it, yet deep down inside we know that most of them aren't going to," along with other statements that Pershing described as implying that the business model was not sustainable.[104][105][106] According to an unnamed source speaking to the New York Post, the video had previously been subpoenaed by federal investigators.[105] In an interview with Bloomberg, Ackman predicted that the company would experience an "implosion" in 2015 or early 2016, citing federal scrutiny and debt.[106][107]
FTC investigation[edit]
Based on information from a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, the New York Post reported on February 4, 2013, that HerbaLife was subject to a pending probe from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC released 729 pages containing 192 complaints received over a 7-year period in regards to the New York Post's FOIA request. After reviewing the now-public complaints, which the FTC put on its website, Ackman told the New York Post: “I have a lot more confidence in our government’s regulators than those who own the stock.” [108] The FTC stated that the wording it used in its response to the FOIA request was incorrect; the FTC could not confirm or deny an investigation into Herbalife.[109]
In March 2014, the FTC opened an investigation into Herbalife in response to calls from consumer groups and members in both houses of Congress. Herbalife responded to the probe by saying it “welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace, and will co-operate fully with the FTC. We are confident that Herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.” The investigation process that is required for alleged pyramid schemes takes 12 to 18 months. In cases like the Herbalife investigation, the FTC often seeks to impose changes to a company’s practices—known as injunctive relief—in order to stop misconduct that it sees as harming consumers. In May 2016 a spokesperson from the FTC told Bloomberg that “Injunctive relief can be just as significant as the money obtained for consumers and even more influential on a company’s future operations”, in response to speculation that Herbalife was close to a resolution with the FTC.[11][110][111][112]
In July 2016, Herbalife agreed to change its business model and pay $200 million in a settlement with the FTC.[12][113][114][115] Partial refund checks were mailed to roughly 350,000 Herbalife distributors in January 2017.[116][117]
The lawsuit alleged that Herbalife deceived consumers into believing they could earn substantial income from the business opportunity or big money from the retail sale of the company’s products. In addition, the complaint charged that one of the fundamental principles of Herbalife’s business model—incentivizing distributors to buy products and to recruit others to join and buy products so they could advance in the company’s marketing program, rather than in response to actual consumer demand—is an unfair practice in violation of the FTC Act.[118]
As part of the settlement, Herbalife agreed to pay distributors based only on actual retail sales of products, rather than for recruiting other distributors. The FTC had noted that the overwhelming majority of Herbalife's distributors earn very little or nothing.

Herbalife's stock drops after sales warning
Shares of Herbalife Ltd.  tumbled 5.6% in premarket trade Monday, after the weight management and nutritional supplement company cut its sales outlook, citing disruption from the implementation of new processes to document retail sales transactions. The company said late Sunday that it now expects second-quarter sales to decline 6% to 2% from a year ago, compared with the guidance provided on May 4 for a decline of 4.5% to 0.5%. Volume point growth is expected to be down 8% to down 4%, compared with previous guidance of down 5% to down 1%. "The Company's distributors have successfully utilized the full array of new tools and processes necessary to document retail sales transactions. Yet, as is typical with any change, the new technology and processes have taken time for distributors to learn, then teach and implement in their organizations," the company said in a statement. Meanwhile, adjusted earnings per share is now expected to be 95 cents to $1.15, up from previous guidance of 85 cents to $1.05. Separately, the company said 90% of U.S. sales in May were documented purchases by consumers, exceeded the 80% threshold required by the company's agreement with the Federal Trade Commission. The stock has soared 54% year to date through Friday, while the S&P 500  has gained 8.9%.

Herbalife's stock pulls back sharply after report of sudden removal of China president
Shares of Herbalife Ltd.  slumped 5.2% in afternoon trade Tuesday, pulling back from a more than 3-year closing high in the previous session, amid reports that the nutritional supplements company's president of China operations was suddenly removed. The company was not immediately available for comment. China Securities Journal reported, based on a Google translation, that Herbalife China President Li Yanliang was removed after a decade in charge. The report said the removal was "sudden," as Herbalife's first-quarter report released late on May 4 showed that China-region sales grew the fastest at 17%, compared with the worldwide total growth of 1%. Through Monday, the stock had run up 18% since May 4 to close Monday at the highest level since Jan. 22, 2014. The stock has now soared 44% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 7.1%.

Herbalife: A Viable Short - Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Herbalife: A Viable ShortJul.18.17 | About: Herbalife Ltd. (HLF) Brian Sanders Value, long/short equity, medium-term horizon, contrarianSummaryHerbalife's products are expensive relative to other health supplements available; inventory turnover is collapsing.Operating margins are continuously declining due to inflating SG&A costs.Debt costs are also increasing year-over-year.Stock trades at record valuation multiples, e.g. 24x TTM FCF.If you go to Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) (US domestic), many of Herbalife's (HLF) products are available. Two big factors that drive sales for supplemental food products are pricing and brand value. For one thing, Herbalife's brand has been under scrutiny for sometime, which has had some impact on the company's sales, particular since regulatory authorities around the world have looked into the company's MLM strategy. However, one core issue that strikes me is the company's pricing strategy. If you look at Herbalife's protein shakes, the main ingredient is soy protein isolate, which is a very common ingredient. If you do some quick web scraping, you will find that comparable products are priced substantially lower. For example, Herbalife's vanilla protein shake prices at ~$1.50-1.75/oz. This compares to $1.38/oz for Gold Standard whey protein, a #1 seller, and $0.68/oz for Orgain Organic plant protein, another top seller. Many other off-brand names also average around $1.00/oz. In other words, Herbalife is marking up their products, and with supplements, prices certainly matter. It seems like this behavior is impacting their long term strategy. Interestingly enough, management has increased prices across multiple geographies as disclosed in its latest 10-Q, which includes Mexico, Central and South America, EMEA (European countries), Asia Pacific, and China. Price increases are common to keep up with inflation, but the problem for Herbalife is that net sales for all geographies have been in low single digit decline, except for EMEA. North America was the only region spared from a price increase, but its net sales have suffered the worst at mid single digit declines. It appears that TTM revenue has stabilized somewhat, and management's 2017 sales guidance of LSD growth actually suggests a reversal of its multi-year decline. However, it's unclear if the company can actually achieve this goal. One good indicator for Herbalife is the pace at which it turns inventory:
 

HLF Inventory Turnover (TTM) data by YCharts This downward trend is likely due to weaker consumer demand. It also appears that both North America and Central/South America will remain as net negatives to worldwide sales. In Q1, North America and Central/South America reported 5.3% and 13.8% declines in volumes. This was mostly offset by gains in China. The issue however is that these two geographies are the company's most mature markets, which paints an ugly picture for the company's future. Sales in China and Europe are relatively healthy, but those trends are likely only temporary. Cost Structure Herbalife has built manufacturing facilities over the last few years with the hopes of generating better economies of scale. Management has referenced some benefits at the gross margin level, but how much success can be attributed to this strategy? 

HLF Asset Utilization (TTM) data by YCharts What is even more curious is that the sell-side is modeling for material SG&A cost reductions, even in the light of that fact that regulators have required higher sales commissions and other structural costs for its "operational reorganization".  Management also refinanced its long term credit facility last quarter (albeit at a higher rate) and still holds its convertible debt, bringing total debt to approximately $2.3 billion. Along with this, quarterly net interest expenses came out to approximately $30 million, a modest year over year increase from $25 million. The primary driver of its higher costs is due to US prime lending rates. If we run-rate this figure, net interest expenses should approximate $120 million, up from $100 million last year. 
 It seems that the only analysts covering the stock are more bullish than Herbalife management. For us, there's a possibility that 2017 and 2018 EPS estimates may need to be revised lower.  Valuation Herbalife's valuation multiples have hit all time highs, and effectively price in a reasonable amount of earnings growth going forward: 

HLF EV to EBIT (TTM) data by YCharts We are skeptical that all of these adverse events are legitimately "one-off" issues. With such a compressed yield, we think it is worth shorting the equity. Bottom Line Herbalife will not "blow up" overnight given it is a structured enterprise with a very motivated sales-force. Further, management has fully complied with regulators over the last few years, which effectively ends the idea that operations will be shut down by force.  Nonetheless, a broken business model is not necessarily required for a lucrative short opportunity. If management fails to execute well over the next twelve months, even a modest guidance shortfall should reverse bullish sentiment. Short interest is at a 12 month low and borrowing costs are <2% at the time of writing. Thank you for reading and please comment below.

Herbalife International is a global multi-level marketing corporation that develops, markets and sells nutrition supplements, weight management, sports nutrition and personal-care products. The company was founded by entrepreneur Mark Hughes in 1980, and it employs around 7,800 people worldwide. Herbalife reported net sales of US$4.488 billion in 2016, flat with 2015, and net income of $260.0 million, down 23% from the year prior.[4] The business is incorporated in the Cayman Islands,[2] and its corporate headquarters are there.[5]
The company operates internationally and distributes its products in 95 countries (as of July 2015) through a network of approximately 3.2 million independent distributors,[2] some of whom earn profit on product sales and additional commission from a network marketing compensation structure. The MLM compensation structure consists of commissions, royalties and bonuses on sales done by a distributor's downline (the people they have sponsored as new recruits). Out of about 526,000 total members in the US at the beginning of 2014, about 62,000 received bonuses of some kind from Herbalife: 7,385 (1.4%) received over $5,000 in bonuses per year (this translates to an average of $417 per month) and 1,304 (0.25%) received over $50,000 ($4,167 per month average). These figures do not include income from product sales nor do they include any costs incurred by distributors.[6]
The company has been criticized by, among others, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Capital, who claimed that Herbalife operates a "sophisticated pyramid scheme"[7][8] after taking a $1-billion short position in Herbalife stock.[9] The company denies the allegations.[10] However, in March 2014, Herbalife came under investigation by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the state of Illinois.[11] In July 2016, Herbalife agreed to change its business model and pay $200 million in a settlement with the FTC.[12]

History[edit]
In February 1980, Mark Hughes began selling the original Herbalife weight management product from the trunk of his car. Hughes often stated that the genesis of his product and program stemmed from the weight loss concerns of his mother Joanne, whose premature death he attributed to an eating disorder and an unhealthy approach to weight loss (though, according to an article from Los Angeles Times, this depiction of the story is not accurate [13]). His stated goal was to change the nutritional habits of the world.[14]
His first product was a protein shake designed to help people manage their weight. He structured his company using a direct-selling, pyramid marketing model.
In 1985, the California Attorney General sued the company for making inflated claims about the efficacy of its products. The company settled the suit for $850,000 without admitting wrongdoing.[15] In 1986, Herbalife became a publicly traded company on the NASDAQ, and in 1996 Herbalife reached US$1 billion in annual sales.
Mark Hughes died at age 44 on May 20, 2000.[16] The Los Angeles County Coroner autopsy results ruled that the entrepreneur had died of an accidental overdose of alcohol and doxepin, an anti-depressant.[17] The company continued to grow after his death and in 2002 was acquired for US$685 million by J.H. Whitney & Company and Golden Gate Capital, which took the company private again.
In April 2003, Michael O. Johnson joined Herbalife as CEO following a 17-year career with The Walt Disney Company, most recently as president of Walt Disney International.[15] On December 16, 2004, the company had an initial public offering on the NYSE of 14,500,000 common shares at $14 per share. 2004 net sales were reported as $1.3 billion.
On April 9, 2013, the company's long-time auditor, KPMG, resigned after the KPMG executive who oversaw Herbalife audits admitted to providing insider information to a golfing friend about at least five companies, including Herbalife and Skechers.[18][19] The company hired PricewaterhouseCoopers as its auditor on May 21, 2013.[20]
On May 7, 2014, the company announced that it entered into a deal with Bank of America Merrill Lynch to repurchase $266 million of its stock.[21]
The company announced in November 2016 that Chief Operating Officer Richard Goudis would take over the position of CEO in June 2017 and Johnson would transition to executive chairman.[22]
Products[edit]
Herbalife's products include protein shakes; protein snacks; nutrition, energy and fitness supplements; and personal care products.[23] The Formula 1 protein shake, a soy-based meal-replacement shake, is the company's number one product and was one of the first products it sold. Other products include products for heart health, digestive health, skin care, and the new 24 sports line released in 2011. Some products are vegetarian, kosher, allergen free,[24] or halal, and Herbalife provides testimonials and advice from health professionals as part of their product marketing.
According to the 2009 Form 10-K, many of Herbalife's weight management, nutritional and personal care products are manufactured by third-party manufacturing companies, with the exception of products distributed in and sourced from China, where they have their own manufacturing facility, and several products are produced in its manufacturing facility in Lake Forest, California (renovated in 2011[25]). Herbalife is modifying its recently acquired manufacturing facility in order to increase capability and capacity; after completion of these modifications, it expects to increase self-manufacturing.[26]:16 In June 2013, Herbalife announced the opening of a plant in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, in a facility previously occupied by Dell; the facility was expected to open in 2014 and employ 500 people.[27]
In October 2010, Herbalife held a groundbreaking ceremony in Changsha, Hunan Province, China, for a botanical extraction facility for its inner and outer nutrition products. The new facility opened in early 2013.[28] It purchases botanicals directly from farms in Hunan province, China, and other regions; performs extraction and other conversion processes; and then sends the processed raw materials directly to Herbalife's manufacturing facilities in Suzhou, China, and Lake Forest, California, or to its third-party manufacturers throughout the world. The new extraction plant produces botanical extracts, including teas, guarana, chamomile, broccoli, and bilberry, for use in many of the company's products.[29]
The specialists of the German Society for Nutrition (de) concluded that the use of Herbalife products alone does not solve weight problems.[30] In independent studies made by the German magazine Konsument (Zeitschrift Ökotest 11/2003), the products of Herbalife were found to be among the most expensive "healthy eating" products.[31]
Adverse effects[edit]
Ephedrine[edit]
Some of the original Herbalife weight loss products included herbs containing ephedrine, Ephedra sinica (ma huang) and Sida cordifolia. Ephedrine suppresses appetite; it is closely related to pseudoephedrine, and, like the latter compound, it acts as a nasal decongestant and can increase the heart rate. Plant sources of ephedrine were removed from Herbalife products in 2002 after several U.S. states banned supplements containing such herbs.[32]:15[33] The U.S. Food and Drug Administration banned supplements containing ephedrine in 2004.[34]
Allegations of lead contamination[edit]
In May 2009, an organization known as the Fraud Discovery Institute reported that laboratory test results of Herbalife products showed lead levels in excess of limits established by law in California under Proposition 65.[35] The Fraud Discovery Institute was founded by Barry Minkow; it dissolved in 2011 after Minkow pleaded guilty to an insider trading charge not related to Herbalife.[36]
Multiple independent labs reported finding lead in Herbalife products.[37][38][39][40] Herbalife responded by stating its products met federal FDA requirements[41][42] and claimed that they had commissioned independent laboratory tests showing that the products did not exceed Proposition 65 limits.[36] According to court documents, Herbalife settled with Minkow and paid him US$300,000.[43] In August 2008, Minkow retracted all accusations against Herbalife and removed any mention of the company from his web site.[44]
On May 10, 2008, a civil lawsuit was filed on behalf of a woman who developed lead-related liver complaints that she claimed were a reaction to a combination of Herbalife products.[36][45] The suit was filed by lawyer Christopher Grell, cofounder of the Dietary Supplement Safety Committee and an ally of Barry Minkow.[36] On June 17, 2008, the suit was expanded to add distributors who had supplied the woman with the Herbalife products, with Grell launching a website to offer persons who believe they were harmed by Herbalife products the chance of redress.[46]
Herbalife and liver disease inquiries[edit]
In 2004, Israel's Health Minister began an investigation into Herbalife's products after four persons using Herbalife's products were found to have liver problems.[47]
Herbalife was accused of selling products containing toxic ingredients such as Qua-qua, Kompri, and Kraska. The products were sent to Bio-Medical Research Design LTD (B.R.D), to a private U.S. laboratory, and to Israel's Forensic research laboratory. A study of the cases funded by the Israeli Ministry of Health concluded that a causative relationship[48] is suggested by the evidence, which included the temporal association between exposure to Herbalife products and the development of liver injury, the negative evaluation of other potential causes of liver injury, the normalization of liver function when Herbalife products were discontinued, and the return of liver injury symptoms in three patients who resumed using Herbalife products after recovery. Herbalife withdrew one product, which was only marketed in Israel, but not all of the Israeli patients had consumed this specific Herbalife product.[49] Herbalife's SEC 10-Q filings state that the Israeli Ministry of Health did not establish a causal relationship between the product and liver ailments. The Israeli Ministry of Health advises individuals with compromised liver function to avoid dietary supplements.[50] In 2009, an Israeli woman sued Herbalife International and Herbalife Israel, claiming that her liver damage resulted from the use of Herbalife products.[51]
Scientific studies in 2007 by doctors at the University Hospital of Bern in Switzerland and the Liver Unit of the Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center in Israel found an association between consumption of Herbalife products and hepatitis.[47][52] In response, the Spanish Ministry of Health issued an alert asking for caution in consuming Herbalife products.[53] Herbalife stated they were cooperating fully with Spanish authorities,[54] and after investigation, the agency determined no action was required and removed the alert.
Hospitals in Israel, Spain, Switzerland, Iceland, Argentina, and the United States had reported liver damage in a number of patients, some of whom had used Herbalife products.[47][52][55][56][57][58][59][60][61] Some patients recovered after they had stopped taking the products, while in others the disease continued, and two patients died. Several authors considered it “certain” that Herbalife products were the cause of the observed liver disease because of a positive re-challenge, while most of the remaining cases were scored as “probable.”[62] Herbalife employees claim there is no definitive proof that Herbalife products cause hepatotoxicity or other liver problems.[63]
In January 2009, the Scientific Committee of the Spanish Agency for Food Safety and Nutrition (AESAN) reached the same conclusion. After reviewing cases implicating Herbalife products in Spain, Switzerland, Israel, Finland, France, Italy, Iceland and Portugal, the 12-member scientific panel issued a report concluding: "The analyses of these cases and information regarding their circumstances have not allowed us to establish a causal relationship" between liver anomalies and Herbalife's dietary supplements. The panel attributed the cases to metabolic changes from overzealous and unsupervised dieting.[64] However, neither a 2005 American Association for the Study of the Liver position paper[65] on the management of acute liver failure nor a 2013 review in the New England Journal of Medicine[66] lists "overzealous dieting" among the recognized causes of acute liver failure.
A July 2013 peer-reviewed study published in the World Journal of Hepatology reexamined known cases of hepatoxicity that had previously been linked to consumption of Herbalife products and concluded that using "the liver specific Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences scale, causality was probable in 1 case, unlikely and excluded in the other cases. Thus, causality levels were much lower than hitherto proposed."[67] In a separate review published less than a year earlier, the same author described the relationship between Herbalife products and reported hepatoxicity cases as "highly probable".[68]
Business model[edit]

Herbalife is a pyramid (sometimes called pyramid scheme or network marketing) company. In addition to profits from product sales, Herbalife distributors can earn additional commissions from sales by other distributors they recruited, called their downline distributors. Supporters of MLM contend this is a fair compensation system, while critics contend that it is a pyramid scheme.[69][70] Critics also argue that the company does not make enough effort to curb abuses by individual distributors, though Herbalife has consistently denied such allegations.[71] Herbalife is a member of the Direct Selling Association in most countries in which it operates. In its filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), company management note problems with inappropriate business practices in the past, their subsequent long-lasting effects and the need to avoid any repetition.
Company management considers the number and retention of distributors a key parameter and tracks it closely in financial reports. By January of each year, sales leaders are required to requalify. In February of each year, individuals who did not satisfy the sales leader qualification requirements during the preceding 12 months are removed from that rank. For the latest 12-month requalification period ending January 2011, approximately 48.9 percent of the eligible sales leaders requalified, an improvement from 43 percent in 2009.[72] The company was cited as one of the most profitable companies in Los Angeles County.[73]
A 2004 settlement resolved a class action suit on behalf of 8,700 former and current distributors who accused the company and distributors of "essentially running a pyramid scheme." A total of $6 million was to be paid out, with defendants not admitting guilt.
In a California class action suit (Minton v. Herbalife International, et al.) filed on February 17, 2005, the plaintiff challenged "the marketing practices of certain Herbalife International independent distributors and Herbalife International under various state laws prohibiting "endless chain schemes", insufficient disclosure in assisted marketing plans, unfair and deceptive business practices, and fraud and deceit".[74]
In a West Virginia class action suit (Mey v. Herbalife International, Inc., et al.) filed on July 16, 2003, the plaintiffs allege that some

telemarketing practices of certain Herbalife International distributors violate the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, or TCPA, and seeks to hold Herbalife International vicariously liable for the practices of these distributors. More specifically, the plaintiffs' complaint alleges that several of Herbalife International's distributors used pre-recorded telephone messages and autodialers to contact prospective customers in violation of the TCPA's prohibition of such practices

Herbalife management insisted they have meritorious defenses in both cases and that, in the West Virginia case, any such distributor actions also went against Herbalife's own policies. Management also contends that any adverse legal outcomes Herbalife might suffer would not significantly affect their financial condition, particularly since they have already set aside an amount that they "believe represents the likely outcome of the resolution of these disputes".[74] The case was resolved with Herbalife and its distributors paying $7 million into a fund for class members part of the suit.[75]:42 Herbalife International did not acknowledge wrongdoing or admit culpability for the actions of its distributors.
As of April 2008, a series of commercials featuring a large red animated fox advertising home-based business opportunities has been running on American television. The advertisements typically feature testimonials from actors playing individuals who have made sums of money between US$5,000 and US$15,000 per month as a result of participating in an undescribed business program. The advertisements direct viewers to a website that allows them to purchase a "success kit". The kit also provides no information about how the business opportunity works. These advertisements have been found to be run by independent Herbalife distributors, as a method of recruiting new downline distributors.[76] While it is not illegal, critics of this type of advertising prefer advertisers to be up-front about their company associations.
Herbalife Nutrition Clubs[edit]
While there are many ways to do the Herbalife business, earlier methods have fallen out of favor over time (i.e. direct mail and internet “lead generation"). One of the most popular current ways of doing the business is through what is called a "Nutrition Club." These clubs are usually storefront shops in densely populated areas, often predominantly Latino.[77]
Some Herbalife distributors complain they have no way of knowing if other clubs are already open in the area. One of the reasons for this is that Herbalife Nutrition Clubs can be hard to find,[78] since the company doesn’t allow the shop owner/manager to advertise, to have awnings, to have any visible interior, to have an open / closed sign, to have a public facing website, or indicate in any other way that they are a business. They also cannot use the word “Herbalife” or "shop" on the club's exterior.
Furthermore, distributors are disallowed from selling the products directly at the club; instead they are to sell a daily "membership" that entitles the customer to a shake, a cup of aloe water, and a tea in a styrofoam cup. A daily "member" typically pays $5 to $7 in cash for the membership. Herbalife rules also dictate that no one can leave the club with these products; they must be consumed in the club.[79]
Pyramid scheme allegations[edit]
On December 3, 2013, a Belgian appeals court overturned[80] a November 2011 ruling by the Commercial Court in Brussels, Belgium that Herbalife was an illegal pyramid scheme.[81]
Herbalife responded to the original Belgium decision by stating:

"Herbalife believes the judgment contains factual errors and is based on misinterpretations of the law and its direct-selling sales model. Herbalife remains committed to its pyramid direct-selling sales model and is confident that, with clarifications in certain aspects of its business, there will be no doubt as to its compliance with all applicable Belgian laws."[82]

The company filed an appeal on March 8, 2012.[83] In response to the ruling being overturned, Herbalife said in a statement that it welcomed:

"the judgment by a Belgian Appeal Court that states the company’s sales model is in full compliance with Belgian law. This judgment overturns a previous ruling by the lower court, in response to claims brought by Belgian consumer organization Test-Aankoop, that Herbalife was operating a pyramid scheme. Herbalife always believed that the first judgment contained factual errors and was based on misinterpretations of its direct-selling sales method, and was confident that the original judgment would be overturned on appeal."[84]

Short sales[edit]
On May 1, 2012, a well-known short seller David Einhorn asked pointed questions about the company’s business and sales models during the Q1 earnings call, setting off suspicions that Einhorn had a short position.[85][86] These suspicions were proved correct in January 2013 when at an investor meeting Einhorn revealed that he had profited through a short position against the company. Einhorn said the short had been closed before the end of 2012.[87]
Allegations of running a 'pyramid scheme'[edit]
On December 20, 2012, Bill Ackman (of Pershing Square Capital) presented a series of arguments outlining why his firm believed that Herbalife operates a "sophisticated pyramid scheme".[8][10] Ackman has alleged after a year-long investigation that the majority of distributors lose money, that the chance of making the testimonial-implied headline income is approximately one in five thousand, and that the company materially overstates its distributors' retail sales and understates their recruiting rewards, to the point that he concludes it is a pyramid scheme.[88]
According to Reuters:

"The sales method, under which some people get more money for recruiting new distributors than selling products, has attracted criticism."[89]

Ackman claimed that Herbalife distributors "primarily obtain their monetary benefits from recruitment rather than the sale of goods and services to consumers." His firm estimates that, since 1980, the scheme has led to more than $3.5 billion of total net losses suffered by those at the bottom of the Herbalife chain. He said on CNBC that millions of low income people around the world, hoping to become millionaires, are being duped with this scheme, and if they knew that the probability is less than 1% of making a hundred thousand dollars, what Herbalife calls the "millionaires team", no one would sign up for it.[90]
Herbalife responded to Ackman's 2012 presentation saying:

"[It] was a malicious attack on Herbalife's business model based largely on outdated, distorted and inaccurate information. Herbalife operates with the highest ethical and quality standards, and our management and our board are constantly reviewing our business practices and products. Herbalife also hires independent, outside experts to ensure our operations are in full compliance with laws and regulations. Herbalife is not an illegal pyramid scheme."[91]

Herbalife also countered that Ackman based his accusations on a misunderstanding of the company's distributor base. At an investor conference in January 2013, the company released results of a Nielsen Research International survey showing 73 percent of Herbalife distributors never intended to make money by reselling the product. Instead, they wanted to buy products at a discount for personal use.[92] To make the distinction clearer, the company announced on its June 2013 earnings call that it would begin referring to these discount buyers as "members" rather than "distributors." [93]
According to a number of financial commentators, Ackman bet roughly $1 billion against the company;[94] soon after remarks to the press, the price of the stock decreased such that Ackman would have made $300 million if he had closed his short position then.[95] Ackman stated that he will donate all of his profits from the trade to charity, taking the financial incentive out of the equation.[90][96] A few months after Ackman's initial comments, billionaire investor Carl Icahn refuted Ackman's comment in a very public spat on national TV. Shortly thereafter, Icahn bought shares of Herbalife Intl. As Icahn continued to buy up HLF shares, the stock price continued to show strength.[97] By May 2013, Icahn owned 16.5% of the company.[98] That number had declined to 6.4 by November 2013.[99] Investor George Soros and Post Foods CEO William Stiritz also bought large shares of Herbalife. Ackman acknowledged losing $400–500 million on his short position in November 2013.[100] By November 2014, Soros had sold 2.8 million shares, 60% of his stake, while Perry Capital had purchased 1.6 million shares.[101][102]
By December 2, 2014 stock prices had fallen nearly 50% to $42.08 from their January 8 high of $83.48.[103] On 17 December 2014 Pershing Square Capital released a 2005 video of a Herbalife training conference in which Stephan Gratziani, a member of Herbalife's Chairman's Club sales team, was recorded telling an audience of high-level distributors "We sell people on a dream business that they can make it, yet deep down inside we know that most of them aren't going to," along with other statements that Pershing described as implying that the business model was not sustainable.[104][105][106] According to an unnamed source speaking to the New York Post, the video had previously been subpoenaed by federal investigators.[105] In an interview with Bloomberg, Ackman predicted that the company would experience an "implosion" in 2015 or early 2016, citing federal scrutiny and debt.[106][107]
FTC investigation[edit]
Based on information from a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, the New York Post reported on February 4, 2013, that HerbaLife was subject to a pending probe from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC released 729 pages containing 192 complaints received over a 7-year period in regards to the New York Post's FOIA request. After reviewing the now-public complaints, which the FTC put on its website, Ackman told the New York Post: “I have a lot more confidence in our government’s regulators than those who own the stock.” [108] The FTC stated that the wording it used in its response to the FOIA request was incorrect; the FTC could not confirm or deny an investigation into Herbalife.[109]
In March 2014, the FTC opened an investigation into Herbalife in response to calls from consumer groups and members in both houses of Congress. Herbalife responded to the probe by saying it “welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace, and will co-operate fully with the FTC. We are confident that Herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.” The investigation process that is required for alleged pyramid schemes takes 12 to 18 months. In cases like the Herbalife investigation, the FTC often seeks to impose changes to a company’s practices—known as injunctive relief—in order to stop misconduct that it sees as harming consumers. In May 2016 a spokesperson from the FTC told Bloomberg that “Injunctive relief can be just as significant as the money obtained for consumers and even more influential on a company’s future operations”, in response to speculation that Herbalife was close to a resolution with the FTC.[11][110][111][112]
In July 2016, Herbalife agreed to change its business model and pay $200 million in a settlement with the FTC.[12][113][114][115] Partial refund checks were mailed to roughly 350,000 Herbalife distributors in January 2017.[116][117]
The lawsuit alleged that Herbalife deceived consumers into believing they could earn substantial income from the business opportunity or big money from the retail sale of the company’s products. In addition, the complaint charged that one of the fundamental principles of Herbalife’s business model—incentivizing distributors to buy products and to recruit others to join and buy products so they could advance in the company’s marketing program, rather than in response to actual consumer demand—is an unfair practice in violation of the FTC Act.[118]
As part of the settlement, Herbalife agreed to pay distributors based only on actual retail sales of products, rather than for recruiting other distributors. The FTC had noted that the overwhelming majority of Herbalife's distributors earn very little or nothing.

Herbalife International is a global multi-level marketing corporation that develops, markets and sells nutrition supplements, weight management, sports nutrition and personal-care products. The company was founded by entrepreneur Mark Hughes in 1980, and it employs around 7,800 people worldwide. Herbalife reported net sales of US$4.488 billion in 2016, flat with 2015, and net income of $260.0 million, down 23% from the year prior.[4] The business is incorporated in the Cayman Islands,[2] and its corporate headquarters are there.[5]
The company operates internationally and distributes its products in 95 countries (as of July 2015) through a network of approximately 3.2 million independent distributors,[2] some of whom earn profit on product sales and additional commission from a network marketing compensation structure. The MLM compensation structure consists of commissions, royalties and bonuses on sales done by a distributor's downline (the people they have sponsored as new recruits). Out of about 526,000 total members in the US at the beginning of 2014, about 62,000 received bonuses of some kind from Herbalife: 7,385 (1.4%) received over $5,000 in bonuses per year (this translates to an average of $417 per month) and 1,304 (0.25%) received over $50,000 ($4,167 per month average). These figures do not include income from product sales nor do they include any costs incurred by distributors.[6]
The company has been criticized by, among others, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Capital, who claimed that Herbalife operates a "sophisticated pyramid scheme"[7][8] after taking a $1-billion short position in Herbalife stock.[9] The company denies the allegations.[10] However, in March 2014, Herbalife came under investigation by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the state of Illinois.[11] In July 2016, Herbalife agreed to change its business model and pay $200 million in a settlement with the FTC.[12]

History[edit]
In February 1980, Mark Hughes began selling the original Herbalife weight management product from the trunk of his car. Hughes often stated that the genesis of his product and program stemmed from the weight loss concerns of his mother Joanne, whose premature death he attributed to an eating disorder and an unhealthy approach to weight loss (though, according to an article from Los Angeles Times, this depiction of the story is not accurate [13]). His stated goal was to change the nutritional habits of the world.[14]
His first product was a protein shake designed to help people manage their weight. He structured his company using a direct-selling, pyramid marketing model.
In 1985, the California Attorney General sued the company for making inflated claims about the efficacy of its products. The company settled the suit for $850,000 without admitting wrongdoing.[15] In 1986, Herbalife became a publicly traded company on the NASDAQ, and in 1996 Herbalife reached US$1 billion in annual sales.
Mark Hughes died at age 44 on May 20, 2000.[16] The Los Angeles County Coroner autopsy results ruled that the entrepreneur had died of an accidental overdose of alcohol and doxepin, an anti-depressant.[17] The company continued to grow after his death and in 2002 was acquired for US$685 million by J.H. Whitney & Company and Golden Gate Capital, which took the company private again.
In April 2003, Michael O. Johnson joined Herbalife as CEO following a 17-year career with The Walt Disney Company, most recently as president of Walt Disney International.[15] On December 16, 2004, the company had an initial public offering on the NYSE of 14,500,000 common shares at $14 per share. 2004 net sales were reported as $1.3 billion.
On April 9, 2013, the company's long-time auditor, KPMG, resigned after the KPMG executive who oversaw Herbalife audits admitted to providing insider information to a golfing friend about at least five companies, including Herbalife and Skechers.[18][19] The company hired PricewaterhouseCoopers as its auditor on May 21, 2013.[20]
On May 7, 2014, the company announced that it entered into a deal with Bank of America Merrill Lynch to repurchase $266 million of its stock.[21]
The company announced in November 2016 that Chief Operating Officer Richard Goudis would take over the position of CEO in June 2017 and Johnson would transition to executive chairman.[22]
Products[edit]
Herbalife's products include protein shakes; protein snacks; nutrition, energy and fitness supplements; and personal care products.[23] The Formula 1 protein shake, a soy-based meal-replacement shake, is the company's number one product and was one of the first products it sold. Other products include products for heart health, digestive health, skin care, and the new 24 sports line released in 2011. Some products are vegetarian, kosher, allergen free,[24] or halal, and Herbalife provides testimonials and advice from health professionals as part of their product marketing.
According to the 2009 Form 10-K, many of Herbalife's weight management, nutritional and personal care products are manufactured by third-party manufacturing companies, with the exception of products distributed in and sourced from China, where they have their own manufacturing facility, and several products are produced in its manufacturing facility in Lake Forest, California (renovated in 2011[25]). Herbalife is modifying its recently acquired manufacturing facility in order to increase capability and capacity; after completion of these modifications, it expects to increase self-manufacturing.[26]:16 In June 2013, Herbalife announced the opening of a plant in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, in a facility previously occupied by Dell; the facility was expected to open in 2014 and employ 500 people.[27]
In October 2010, Herbalife held a groundbreaking ceremony in Changsha, Hunan Province, China, for a botanical extraction facility for its inner and outer nutrition products. The new facility opened in early 2013.[28] It purchases botanicals directly from farms in Hunan province, China, and other regions; performs extraction and other conversion processes; and then sends the processed raw materials directly to Herbalife's manufacturing facilities in Suzhou, China, and Lake Forest, California, or to its third-party manufacturers throughout the world. The new extraction plant produces botanical extracts, including teas, guarana, chamomile, broccoli, and bilberry, for use in many of the company's products.[29]
The specialists of the German Society for Nutrition (de) concluded that the use of Herbalife products alone does not solve weight problems.[30] In independent studies made by the German magazine Konsument (Zeitschrift Ökotest 11/2003), the products of Herbalife were found to be among the most expensive "healthy eating" products.[31]
Adverse effects[edit]
Ephedrine[edit]
Some of the original Herbalife weight loss products included herbs containing ephedrine, Ephedra sinica (ma huang) and Sida cordifolia. Ephedrine suppresses appetite; it is closely related to pseudoephedrine, and, like the latter compound, it acts as a nasal decongestant and can increase the heart rate. Plant sources of ephedrine were removed from Herbalife products in 2002 after several U.S. states banned supplements containing such herbs.[32]:15[33] The U.S. Food and Drug Administration banned supplements containing ephedrine in 2004.[34]
Allegations of lead contamination[edit]
In May 2009, an organization known as the Fraud Discovery Institute reported that laboratory test results of Herbalife products showed lead levels in excess of limits established by law in California under Proposition 65.[35] The Fraud Discovery Institute was founded by Barry Minkow; it dissolved in 2011 after Minkow pleaded guilty to an insider trading charge not related to Herbalife.[36]
Multiple independent labs reported finding lead in Herbalife products.[37][38][39][40] Herbalife responded by stating its products met federal FDA requirements[41][42] and claimed that they had commissioned independent laboratory tests showing that the products did not exceed Proposition 65 limits.[36] According to court documents, Herbalife settled with Minkow and paid him US$300,000.[43] In August 2008, Minkow retracted all accusations against Herbalife and removed any mention of the company from his web site.[44]
On May 10, 2008, a civil lawsuit was filed on behalf of a woman who developed lead-related liver complaints that she claimed were a reaction to a combination of Herbalife products.[36][45] The suit was filed by lawyer Christopher Grell, cofounder of the Dietary Supplement Safety Committee and an ally of Barry Minkow.[36] On June 17, 2008, the suit was expanded to add distributors who had supplied the woman with the Herbalife products, with Grell launching a website to offer persons who believe they were harmed by Herbalife products the chance of redress.[46]
Herbalife and liver disease inquiries[edit]
In 2004, Israel's Health Minister began an investigation into Herbalife's products after four persons using Herbalife's products were found to have liver problems.[47]
Herbalife was accused of selling products containing toxic ingredients such as Qua-qua, Kompri, and Kraska. The products were sent to Bio-Medical Research Design LTD (B.R.D), to a private U.S. laboratory, and to Israel's Forensic research laboratory. A study of the cases funded by the Israeli Ministry of Health concluded that a causative relationship[48] is suggested by the evidence, which included the temporal association between exposure to Herbalife products and the development of liver injury, the negative evaluation of other potential causes of liver injury, the normalization of liver function when Herbalife products were discontinued, and the return of liver injury symptoms in three patients who resumed using Herbalife products after recovery. Herbalife withdrew one product, which was only marketed in Israel, but not all of the Israeli patients had consumed this specific Herbalife product.[49] Herbalife's SEC 10-Q filings state that the Israeli Ministry of Health did not establish a causal relationship between the product and liver ailments. The Israeli Ministry of Health advises individuals with compromised liver function to avoid dietary supplements.[50] In 2009, an Israeli woman sued Herbalife International and Herbalife Israel, claiming that her liver damage resulted from the use of Herbalife products.[51]
Scientific studies in 2007 by doctors at the University Hospital of Bern in Switzerland and the Liver Unit of the Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center in Israel found an association between consumption of Herbalife products and hepatitis.[47][52] In response, the Spanish Ministry of Health issued an alert asking for caution in consuming Herbalife products.[53] Herbalife stated they were cooperating fully with Spanish authorities,[54] and after investigation, the agency determined no action was required and removed the alert.
Hospitals in Israel, Spain, Switzerland, Iceland, Argentina, and the United States had reported liver damage in a number of patients, some of whom had used Herbalife products.[47][52][55][56][57][58][59][60][61] Some patients recovered after they had stopped taking the products, while in others the disease continued, and two patients died. Several authors considered it “certain” that Herbalife products were the cause of the observed liver disease because of a positive re-challenge, while most of the remaining cases were scored as “probable.”[62] Herbalife employees claim there is no definitive proof that Herbalife products cause hepatotoxicity or other liver problems.[63]
In January 2009, the Scientific Committee of the Spanish Agency for Food Safety and Nutrition (AESAN) reached the same conclusion. After reviewing cases implicating Herbalife products in Spain, Switzerland, Israel, Finland, France, Italy, Iceland and Portugal, the 12-member scientific panel issued a report concluding: "The analyses of these cases and information regarding their circumstances have not allowed us to establish a causal relationship" between liver anomalies and Herbalife's dietary supplements. The panel attributed the cases to metabolic changes from overzealous and unsupervised dieting.[64] However, neither a 2005 American Association for the Study of the Liver position paper[65] on the management of acute liver failure nor a 2013 review in the New England Journal of Medicine[66] lists "overzealous dieting" among the recognized causes of acute liver failure.
A July 2013 peer-reviewed study published in the World Journal of Hepatology reexamined known cases of hepatoxicity that had previously been linked to consumption of Herbalife products and concluded that using "the liver specific Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences scale, causality was probable in 1 case, unlikely and excluded in the other cases. Thus, causality levels were much lower than hitherto proposed."[67] In a separate review published less than a year earlier, the same author described the relationship between Herbalife products and reported hepatoxicity cases as "highly probable".[68]
Business model[edit]

Herbalife is a pyramid (sometimes called pyramid scheme or network marketing) company. In addition to profits from product sales, Herbalife distributors can earn additional commissions from sales by other distributors they recruited, called their downline distributors. Supporters of MLM contend this is a fair compensation system, while critics contend that it is a pyramid scheme.[69][70] Critics also argue that the company does not make enough effort to curb abuses by individual distributors, though Herbalife has consistently denied such allegations.[71] Herbalife is a member of the Direct Selling Association in most countries in which it operates. In its filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), company management note problems with inappropriate business practices in the past, their subsequent long-lasting effects and the need to avoid any repetition.
Company management considers the number and retention of distributors a key parameter and tracks it closely in financial reports. By January of each year, sales leaders are required to requalify. In February of each year, individuals who did not satisfy the sales leader qualification requirements during the preceding 12 months are removed from that rank. For the latest 12-month requalification period ending January 2011, approximately 48.9 percent of the eligible sales leaders requalified, an improvement from 43 percent in 2009.[72] The company was cited as one of the most profitable companies in Los Angeles County.[73]
A 2004 settlement resolved a class action suit on behalf of 8,700 former and current distributors who accused the company and distributors of "essentially running a pyramid scheme." A total of $6 million was to be paid out, with defendants not admitting guilt.
In a California class action suit (Minton v. Herbalife International, et al.) filed on February 17, 2005, the plaintiff challenged "the marketing practices of certain Herbalife International independent distributors and Herbalife International under various state laws prohibiting "endless chain schemes", insufficient disclosure in assisted marketing plans, unfair and deceptive business practices, and fraud and deceit".[74]
In a West Virginia class action suit (Mey v. Herbalife International, Inc., et al.) filed on July 16, 2003, the plaintiffs allege that some

telemarketing practices of certain Herbalife International distributors violate the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, or TCPA, and seeks to hold Herbalife International vicariously liable for the practices of these distributors. More specifically, the plaintiffs' complaint alleges that several of Herbalife International's distributors used pre-recorded telephone messages and autodialers to contact prospective customers in violation of the TCPA's prohibition of such practices

Herbalife management insisted they have meritorious defenses in both cases and that, in the West Virginia case, any such distributor actions also went against Herbalife's own policies. Management also contends that any adverse legal outcomes Herbalife might suffer would not significantly affect their financial condition, particularly since they have already set aside an amount that they "believe represents the likely outcome of the resolution of these disputes".[74] The case was resolved with Herbalife and its distributors paying $7 million into a fund for class members part of the suit.[75]:42 Herbalife International did not acknowledge wrongdoing or admit culpability for the actions of its distributors.
As of April 2008, a series of commercials featuring a large red animated fox advertising home-based business opportunities has been running on American television. The advertisements typically feature testimonials from actors playing individuals who have made sums of money between US$5,000 and US$15,000 per month as a result of participating in an undescribed business program. The advertisements direct viewers to a website that allows them to purchase a "success kit". The kit also provides no information about how the business opportunity works. These advertisements have been found to be run by independent Herbalife distributors, as a method of recruiting new downline distributors.[76] While it is not illegal, critics of this type of advertising prefer advertisers to be up-front about their company associations.
Herbalife Nutrition Clubs[edit]
While there are many ways to do the Herbalife business, earlier methods have fallen out of favor over time (i.e. direct mail and internet “lead generation"). One of the most popular current ways of doing the business is through what is called a "Nutrition Club." These clubs are usually storefront shops in densely populated areas, often predominantly Latino.[77]
Some Herbalife distributors complain they have no way of knowing if other clubs are already open in the area. One of the reasons for this is that Herbalife Nutrition Clubs can be hard to find,[78] since the company doesn’t allow the shop owner/manager to advertise, to have awnings, to have any visible interior, to have an open / closed sign, to have a public facing website, or indicate in any other way that they are a business. They also cannot use the word “Herbalife” or "shop" on the club's exterior.
Furthermore, distributors are disallowed from selling the products directly at the club; instead they are to sell a daily "membership" that entitles the customer to a shake, a cup of aloe water, and a tea in a styrofoam cup. A daily "member" typically pays $5 to $7 in cash for the membership. Herbalife rules also dictate that no one can leave the club with these products; they must be consumed in the club.[79]
Pyramid scheme allegations[edit]
On December 3, 2013, a Belgian appeals court overturned[80] a November 2011 ruling by the Commercial Court in Brussels, Belgium that Herbalife was an illegal pyramid scheme.[81]
Herbalife responded to the original Belgium decision by stating:

"Herbalife believes the judgment contains factual errors and is based on misinterpretations of the law and its direct-selling sales model. Herbalife remains committed to its pyramid direct-selling sales model and is confident that, with clarifications in certain aspects of its business, there will be no doubt as to its compliance with all applicable Belgian laws."[82]

The company filed an appeal on March 8, 2012.[83] In response to the ruling being overturned, Herbalife said in a statement that it welcomed:

"the judgment by a Belgian Appeal Court that states the company’s sales model is in full compliance with Belgian law. This judgment overturns a previous ruling by the lower court, in response to claims brought by Belgian consumer organization Test-Aankoop, that Herbalife was operating a pyramid scheme. Herbalife always believed that the first judgment contained factual errors and was based on misinterpretations of its direct-selling sales method, and was confident that the original judgment would be overturned on appeal."[84]

Short sales[edit]
On May 1, 2012, a well-known short seller David Einhorn asked pointed questions about the company’s business and sales models during the Q1 earnings call, setting off suspicions that Einhorn had a short position.[85][86] These suspicions were proved correct in January 2013 when at an investor meeting Einhorn revealed that he had profited through a short position against the company. Einhorn said the short had been closed before the end of 2012.[87]
Allegations of running a 'pyramid scheme'[edit]
On December 20, 2012, Bill Ackman (of Pershing Square Capital) presented a series of arguments outlining why his firm believed that Herbalife operates a "sophisticated pyramid scheme".[8][10] Ackman has alleged after a year-long investigation that the majority of distributors lose money, that the chance of making the testimonial-implied headline income is approximately one in five thousand, and that the company materially overstates its distributors' retail sales and understates their recruiting rewards, to the point that he concludes it is a pyramid scheme.[88]
According to Reuters:

"The sales method, under which some people get more money for recruiting new distributors than selling products, has attracted criticism."[89]

Ackman claimed that Herbalife distributors "primarily obtain their monetary benefits from recruitment rather than the sale of goods and services to consumers." His firm estimates that, since 1980, the scheme has led to more than $3.5 billion of total net losses suffered by those at the bottom of the Herbalife chain. He said on CNBC that millions of low income people around the world, hoping to become millionaires, are being duped with this scheme, and if they knew that the probability is less than 1% of making a hundred thousand dollars, what Herbalife calls the "millionaires team", no one would sign up for it.[90]
Herbalife responded to Ackman's 2012 presentation saying:

"[It] was a malicious attack on Herbalife's business model based largely on outdated, distorted and inaccurate information. Herbalife operates with the highest ethical and quality standards, and our management and our board are constantly reviewing our business practices and products. Herbalife also hires independent, outside experts to ensure our operations are in full compliance with laws and regulations. Herbalife is not an illegal pyramid scheme."[91]

Herbalife also countered that Ackman based his accusations on a misunderstanding of the company's distributor base. At an investor conference in January 2013, the company released results of a Nielsen Research International survey showing 73 percent of Herbalife distributors never intended to make money by reselling the product. Instead, they wanted to buy products at a discount for personal use.[92] To make the distinction clearer, the company announced on its June 2013 earnings call that it would begin referring to these discount buyers as "members" rather than "distributors." [93]
According to a number of financial commentators, Ackman bet roughly $1 billion against the company;[94] soon after remarks to the press, the price of the stock decreased such that Ackman would have made $300 million if he had closed his short position then.[95] Ackman stated that he will donate all of his profits from the trade to charity, taking the financial incentive out of the equation.[90][96] A few months after Ackman's initial comments, billionaire investor Carl Icahn refuted Ackman's comment in a very public spat on national TV. Shortly thereafter, Icahn bought shares of Herbalife Intl. As Icahn continued to buy up HLF shares, the stock price continued to show strength.[97] By May 2013, Icahn owned 16.5% of the company.[98] That number had declined to 6.4 by November 2013.[99] Investor George Soros and Post Foods CEO William Stiritz also bought large shares of Herbalife. Ackman acknowledged losing $400–500 million on his short position in November 2013.[100] By November 2014, Soros had sold 2.8 million shares, 60% of his stake, while Perry Capital had purchased 1.6 million shares.[101][102]
By December 2, 2014 stock prices had fallen nearly 50% to $42.08 from their January 8 high of $83.48.[103] On 17 December 2014 Pershing Square Capital released a 2005 video of a Herbalife training conference in which Stephan Gratziani, a member of Herbalife's Chairman's Club sales team, was recorded telling an audience of high-level distributors "We sell people on a dream business that they can make it, yet deep down inside we know that most of them aren't going to," along with other statements that Pershing described as implying that the business model was not sustainable.[104][105][106] According to an unnamed source speaking to the New York Post, the video had previously been subpoenaed by federal investigators.[105] In an interview with Bloomberg, Ackman predicted that the company would experience an "implosion" in 2015 or early 2016, citing federal scrutiny and debt.[106][107]
FTC investigation[edit]
Based on information from a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, the New York Post reported on February 4, 2013, that HerbaLife was subject to a pending probe from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC released 729 pages containing 192 complaints received over a 7-year period in regards to the New York Post's FOIA request. After reviewing the now-public complaints, which the FTC put on its website, Ackman told the New York Post: “I have a lot more confidence in our government’s regulators than those who own the stock.” [108] The FTC stated that the wording it used in its response to the FOIA request was incorrect; the FTC could not confirm or deny an investigation into Herbalife.[109]
In March 2014, the FTC opened an investigation into Herbalife in response to calls from consumer groups and members in both houses of Congress. Herbalife responded to the probe by saying it “welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace, and will co-operate fully with the FTC. We are confident that Herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.” The investigation process that is required for alleged pyramid schemes takes 12 to 18 months. In cases like the Herbalife investigation, the FTC often seeks to impose changes to a company’s practices—known as injunctive relief—in order to stop misconduct that it sees as harming consumers. In May 2016 a spokesperson from the FTC told Bloomberg that “Injunctive relief can be just as significant as the money obtained for consumers and even more influential on a company’s future operations”, in response to speculation that Herbalife was close to a resolution with the FTC.[11][110][111][112]
In July 2016, Herbalife agreed to change its business model and pay $200 million in a settlement with the FTC.[12][113][114][115] Partial refund checks were mailed to roughly 350,000 Herbalife distributors in January 2017.[116][117]
The lawsuit alleged that Herbalife deceived consumers into believing they could earn substantial income from the business opportunity or big money from the retail sale of the company’s products. In addition, the complaint charged that one of the fundamental principles of Herbalife’s business model—incentivizing distributors to buy products and to recruit others to join and buy products so they could advance in the company’s marketing program, rather than in response to actual consumer demand—is an unfair practice in violation of the FTC Act.[118]
As part of the settlement, Herbalife agreed to pay distributors based only on actual retail sales of products, rather than for recruiting other distributors. The FTC had noted that the overwhelming majority of Herbalife's distributors earn very little or nothing.

Herbalife International is a global multi-level marketing corporation that develops, markets and sells nutrition supplements, weight management, sports nutrition and personal-care products. The company was founded by entrepreneur Mark Hughes in 1980, and it employs around 7,800 people worldwide. Herbalife reported net sales of US$4.488 billion in 2016, flat with 2015, and net income of $260.0 million, down 23% from the year prior.[4] The business is incorporated in the Cayman Islands,[2] and its corporate headquarters are there.[5]
The company operates internationally and distributes its products in 95 countries (as of July 2015) through a network of approximately 3.2 million independent distributors,[2] some of whom earn profit on product sales and additional commission from a network marketing compensation structure. The MLM compensation structure consists of commissions, royalties and bonuses on sales done by a distributor's downline (the people they have sponsored as new recruits). Out of about 526,000 total members in the US at the beginning of 2014, about 62,000 received bonuses of some kind from Herbalife: 7,385 (1.4%) received over $5,000 in bonuses per year (this translates to an average of $417 per month) and 1,304 (0.25%) received over $50,000 ($4,167 per month average). These figures do not include income from product sales nor do they include any costs incurred by distributors.[6]
The company has been criticized by, among others, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Capital, who claimed that Herbalife operates a "sophisticated pyramid scheme"[7][8] after taking a $1-billion short position in Herbalife stock.[9] The company denies the allegations.[10] However, in March 2014, Herbalife came under investigation by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the state of Illinois.[11] In July 2016, Herbalife agreed to change its business model and pay $200 million in a settlement with the FTC.[12]

History[edit]
In February 1980, Mark Hughes began selling the original Herbalife weight management product from the trunk of his car. Hughes often stated that the genesis of his product and program stemmed from the weight loss concerns of his mother Joanne, whose premature death he attributed to an eating disorder and an unhealthy approach to weight loss (though, according to an article from Los Angeles Times, this depiction of the story is not accurate [13]). His stated goal was to change the nutritional habits of the world.[14]
His first product was a protein shake designed to help people manage their weight. He structured his company using a direct-selling, pyramid marketing model.
In 1985, the California Attorney General sued the company for making inflated claims about the efficacy of its products. The company settled the suit for $850,000 without admitting wrongdoing.[15] In 1986, Herbalife became a publicly traded company on the NASDAQ, and in 1996 Herbalife reached US$1 billion in annual sales.
Mark Hughes died at age 44 on May 20, 2000.[16] The Los Angeles County Coroner autopsy results ruled that the entrepreneur had died of an accidental overdose of alcohol and doxepin, an anti-depressant.[17] The company continued to grow after his death and in 2002 was acquired for US$685 million by J.H. Whitney & Company and Golden Gate Capital, which took the company private again.
In April 2003, Michael O. Johnson joined Herbalife as CEO following a 17-year career with The Walt Disney Company, most recently as president of Walt Disney International.[15] On December 16, 2004, the company had an initial public offering on the NYSE of 14,500,000 common shares at $14 per share. 2004 net sales were reported as $1.3 billion.
On April 9, 2013, the company's long-time auditor, KPMG, resigned after the KPMG executive who oversaw Herbalife audits admitted to providing insider information to a golfing friend about at least five companies, including Herbalife and Skechers.[18][19] The company hired PricewaterhouseCoopers as its auditor on May 21, 2013.[20]
On May 7, 2014, the company announced that it entered into a deal with Bank of America Merrill Lynch to repurchase $266 million of its stock.[21]
The company announced in November 2016 that Chief Operating Officer Richard Goudis would take over the position of CEO in June 2017 and Johnson would transition to executive chairman.[22]
Products[edit]
Herbalife's products include protein shakes; protein snacks; nutrition, energy and fitness supplements; and personal care products.[23] The Formula 1 protein shake, a soy-based meal-replacement shake, is the company's number one product and was one of the first products it sold. Other products include products for heart health, digestive health, skin care, and the new 24 sports line released in 2011. Some products are vegetarian, kosher, allergen free,[24] or halal, and Herbalife provides testimonials and advice from health professionals as part of their product marketing.
According to the 2009 Form 10-K, many of Herbalife's weight management, nutritional and personal care products are manufactured by third-party manufacturing companies, with the exception of products distributed in and sourced from China, where they have their own manufacturing facility, and several products are produced in its manufacturing facility in Lake Forest, California (renovated in 2011[25]). Herbalife is modifying its recently acquired manufacturing facility in order to increase capability and capacity; after completion of these modifications, it expects to increase self-manufacturing.[26]:16 In June 2013, Herbalife announced the opening of a plant in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, in a facility previously occupied by Dell; the facility was expected to open in 2014 and employ 500 people.[27]
In October 2010, Herbalife held a groundbreaking ceremony in Changsha, Hunan Province, China, for a botanical extraction facility for its inner and outer nutrition products. The new facility opened in early 2013.[28] It purchases botanicals directly from farms in Hunan province, China, and other regions; performs extraction and other conversion processes; and then sends the processed raw materials directly to Herbalife's manufacturing facilities in Suzhou, China, and Lake Forest, California, or to its third-party manufacturers throughout the world. The new extraction plant produces botanical extracts, including teas, guarana, chamomile, broccoli, and bilberry, for use in many of the company's products.[29]
The specialists of the German Society for Nutrition (de) concluded that the use of Herbalife products alone does not solve weight problems.[30] In independent studies made by the German magazine Konsument (Zeitschrift Ökotest 11/2003), the products of Herbalife were found to be among the most expensive "healthy eating" products.[31]
Adverse effects[edit]
Ephedrine[edit]
Some of the original Herbalife weight loss products included herbs containing ephedrine, Ephedra sinica (ma huang) and Sida cordifolia. Ephedrine suppresses appetite; it is closely related to pseudoephedrine, and, like the latter compound, it acts as a nasal decongestant and can increase the heart rate. Plant sources of ephedrine were removed from Herbalife products in 2002 after several U.S. states banned supplements containing such herbs.[32]:15[33] The U.S. Food and Drug Administration banned supplements containing ephedrine in 2004.[34]
Allegations of lead contamination[edit]
In May 2009, an organization known as the Fraud Discovery Institute reported that laboratory test results of Herbalife products showed lead levels in excess of limits established by law in California under Proposition 65.[35] The Fraud Discovery Institute was founded by Barry Minkow; it dissolved in 2011 after Minkow pleaded guilty to an insider trading charge not related to Herbalife.[36]
Multiple independent labs reported finding lead in Herbalife products.[37][38][39][40] Herbalife responded by stating its products met federal FDA requirements[41][42] and claimed that they had commissioned independent laboratory tests showing that the products did not exceed Proposition 65 limits.[36] According to court documents, Herbalife settled with Minkow and paid him US$300,000.[43] In August 2008, Minkow retracted all accusations against Herbalife and removed any mention of the company from his web site.[44]
On May 10, 2008, a civil lawsuit was filed on behalf of a woman who developed lead-related liver complaints that she claimed were a reaction to a combination of Herbalife products.[36][45] The suit was filed by lawyer Christopher Grell, cofounder of the Dietary Supplement Safety Committee and an ally of Barry Minkow.[36] On June 17, 2008, the suit was expanded to add distributors who had supplied the woman with the Herbalife products, with Grell launching a website to offer persons who believe they were harmed by Herbalife products the chance of redress.[46]
Herbalife and liver disease inquiries[edit]
In 2004, Israel's Health Minister began an investigation into Herbalife's products after four persons using Herbalife's products were found to have liver problems.[47]
Herbalife was accused of selling products containing toxic ingredients such as Qua-qua, Kompri, and Kraska. The products were sent to Bio-Medical Research Design LTD (B.R.D), to a private U.S. laboratory, and to Israel's Forensic research laboratory. A study of the cases funded by the Israeli Ministry of Health concluded that a causative relationship[48] is suggested by the evidence, which included the temporal association between exposure to Herbalife products and the development of liver injury, the negative evaluation of other potential causes of liver injury, the normalization of liver function when Herbalife products were discontinued, and the return of liver injury symptoms in three patients who resumed using Herbalife products after recovery. Herbalife withdrew one product, which was only marketed in Israel, but not all of the Israeli patients had consumed this specific Herbalife product.[49] Herbalife's SEC 10-Q filings state that the Israeli Ministry of Health did not establish a causal relationship between the product and liver ailments. The Israeli Ministry of Health advises individuals with compromised liver function to avoid dietary supplements.[50] In 2009, an Israeli woman sued Herbalife International and Herbalife Israel, claiming that her liver damage resulted from the use of Herbalife products.[51]
Scientific studies in 2007 by doctors at the University Hospital of Bern in Switzerland and the Liver Unit of the Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center in Israel found an association between consumption of Herbalife products and hepatitis.[47][52] In response, the Spanish Ministry of Health issued an alert asking for caution in consuming Herbalife products.[53] Herbalife stated they were cooperating fully with Spanish authorities,[54] and after investigation, the agency determined no action was required and removed the alert.
Hospitals in Israel, Spain, Switzerland, Iceland, Argentina, and the United States had reported liver damage in a number of patients, some of whom had used Herbalife products.[47][52][55][56][57][58][59][60][61] Some patients recovered after they had stopped taking the products, while in others the disease continued, and two patients died. Several authors considered it “certain” that Herbalife products were the cause of the observed liver disease because of a positive re-challenge, while most of the remaining cases were scored as “probable.”[62] Herbalife employees claim there is no definitive proof that Herbalife products cause hepatotoxicity or other liver problems.[63]
In January 2009, the Scientific Committee of the Spanish Agency for Food Safety and Nutrition (AESAN) reached the same conclusion. After reviewing cases implicating Herbalife products in Spain, Switzerland, Israel, Finland, France, Italy, Iceland and Portugal, the 12-member scientific panel issued a report concluding: "The analyses of these cases and information regarding their circumstances have not allowed us to establish a causal relationship" between liver anomalies and Herbalife's dietary supplements. The panel attributed the cases to metabolic changes from overzealous and unsupervised dieting.[64] However, neither a 2005 American Association for the Study of the Liver position paper[65] on the management of acute liver failure nor a 2013 review in the New England Journal of Medicine[66] lists "overzealous dieting" among the recognized causes of acute liver failure.
A July 2013 peer-reviewed study published in the World Journal of Hepatology reexamined known cases of hepatoxicity that had previously been linked to consumption of Herbalife products and concluded that using "the liver specific Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences scale, causality was probable in 1 case, unlikely and excluded in the other cases. Thus, causality levels were much lower than hitherto proposed."[67] In a separate review published less than a year earlier, the same author described the relationship between Herbalife products and reported hepatoxicity cases as "highly probable".[68]
Business model[edit]




A car decorated with Herbalife branding, parked in London


Herbalife is a pyramid (sometimes called pyramid scheme or network marketing) company. In addition to profits from product sales, Herbalife distributors can earn additional commissions from sales by other distributors they recruited, called their downline distributors. Supporters of MLM contend this is a fair compensation system, while critics contend that it is a pyramid scheme.[69][70] Critics also argue that the company does not make enough effort to curb abuses by individual distributors, though Herbalife has consistently denied such allegations.[71] Herbalife is a member of the Direct Selling Association in most countries in which it operates. In its filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), company management note problems with inappropriate business practices in the past, their subsequent long-lasting effects and the need to avoid any repetition.
Company management considers the number and retention of distributors a key parameter and tracks it closely in financial reports. By January of each year, sales leaders are required to requalify. In February of each year, individuals who did not satisfy the sales leader qualification requirements during the preceding 12 months are removed from that rank. For the latest 12-month requalification period ending January 2011, approximately 48.9 percent of the eligible sales leaders requalified, an improvement from 43 percent in 2009.[72] The company was cited as one of the most profitable companies in Los Angeles County.[73]
A 2004 settlement resolved a class action suit on behalf of 8,700 former and current distributors who accused the company and distributors of "essentially running a pyramid scheme." A total of $6 million was to be paid out, with defendants not admitting guilt.
In a California class action suit (Minton v. Herbalife International, et al.) filed on February 17, 2005, the plaintiff challenged "the marketing practices of certain Herbalife International independent distributors and Herbalife International under various state laws prohibiting "endless chain schemes", insufficient disclosure in assisted marketing plans, unfair and deceptive business practices, and fraud and deceit".[74]
In a West Virginia class action suit (Mey v. Herbalife International, Inc., et al.) filed on July 16, 2003, the plaintiffs allege that some

telemarketing practices of certain Herbalife International distributors violate the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, or TCPA, and seeks to hold Herbalife International vicariously liable for the practices of these distributors. More specifically, the plaintiffs' complaint alleges that several of Herbalife International's distributors used pre-recorded telephone messages and autodialers to contact prospective customers in violation of the TCPA's prohibition of such practices

Herbalife management insisted they have meritorious defenses in both cases and that, in the West Virginia case, any such distributor actions also went against Herbalife's own policies. Management also contends that any adverse legal outcomes Herbalife might suffer would not significantly affect their financial condition, particularly since they have already set aside an amount that they "believe represents the likely outcome of the resolution of these disputes".[74] The case was resolved with Herbalife and its distributors paying $7 million into a fund for class members part of the suit.[75]:42 Herbalife International did not acknowledge wrongdoing or admit culpability for the actions of its distributors.
As of April 2008, a series of commercials featuring a large red animated fox advertising home-based business opportunities has been running on American television. The advertisements typically feature testimonials from actors playing individuals who have made sums of money between US$5,000 and US$15,000 per month as a result of participating in an undescribed business program. The advertisements direct viewers to a website that allows them to purchase a "success kit". The kit also provides no information about how the business opportunity works. These advertisements have been found to be run by independent Herbalife distributors, as a method of recruiting new downline distributors.[76] While it is not illegal, critics of this type of advertising prefer advertisers to be up-front about their company associations.
Herbalife Nutrition Clubs[edit]
While there are many ways to do the Herbalife business, earlier methods have fallen out of favor over time (i.e. direct mail and internet “lead generation"). One of the most popular current ways of doing the business is through what is called a "Nutrition Club." These clubs are usually storefront shops in densely populated areas, often predominantly Latino.[77]
Some Herbalife distributors complain they have no way of knowing if other clubs are already open in the area. One of the reasons for this is that Herbalife Nutrition Clubs can be hard to find,[78] since the company doesn’t allow the shop owner/manager to advertise, to have awnings, to have any visible interior, to have an open / closed sign, to have a public facing website, or indicate in any other way that they are a business. They also cannot use the word “Herbalife” or "shop" on the club's exterior.
Furthermore, distributors are disallowed from selling the products directly at the club; instead they are to sell a daily "membership" that entitles the customer to a shake, a cup of aloe water, and a tea in a styrofoam cup. A daily "member" typically pays $5 to $7 in cash for the membership. Herbalife rules also dictate that no one can leave the club with these products; they must be consumed in the club.[79]
Pyramid scheme allegations[edit]
On December 3, 2013, a Belgian appeals court overturned[80] a November 2011 ruling by the Commercial Court in Brussels, Belgium that Herbalife was an illegal pyramid scheme.[81]
Herbalife responded to the original Belgium decision by stating:

"Herbalife believes the judgment contains factual errors and is based on misinterpretations of the law and its direct-selling sales model. Herbalife remains committed to its pyramid direct-selling sales model and is confident that, with clarifications in certain aspects of its business, there will be no doubt as to its compliance with all applicable Belgian laws."[82]

The company filed an appeal on March 8, 2012.[83] In response to the ruling being overturned, Herbalife said in a statement that it welcomed:

"the judgment by a Belgian Appeal Court that states the company’s sales model is in full compliance with Belgian law. This judgment overturns a previous ruling by the lower court, in response to claims brought by Belgian consumer organization Test-Aankoop, that Herbalife was operating a pyramid scheme. Herbalife always believed that the first judgment contained factual errors and was based on misinterpretations of its direct-selling sales method, and was confident that the original judgment would be overturned on appeal."[84]

Short sales[edit]
On May 1, 2012, a well-known short seller David Einhorn asked pointed questions about the company’s business and sales models during the Q1 earnings call, setting off suspicions that Einhorn had a short position.[85][86] These suspicions were proved correct in January 2013 when at an investor meeting Einhorn revealed that he had profited through a short position against the company. Einhorn said the short had been closed before the end of 2012.[87]
Allegations of running a 'pyramid scheme'[edit]
On December 20, 2012, Bill Ackman (of Pershing Square Capital) presented a series of arguments outlining why his firm believed that Herbalife operates a "sophisticated pyramid scheme".[8][10] Ackman has alleged after a year-long investigation that the majority of distributors lose money, that the chance of making the testimonial-implied headline income is approximately one in five thousand, and that the company materially overstates its distributors' retail sales and understates their recruiting rewards, to the point that he concludes it is a pyramid scheme.[88]
According to Reuters:

"The sales method, under which some people get more money for recruiting new distributors than selling products, has attracted criticism."[89]

Ackman claimed that Herbalife distributors "primarily obtain their monetary benefits from recruitment rather than the sale of goods and services to consumers." His firm estimates that, since 1980, the scheme has led to more than $3.5 billion of total net losses suffered by those at the bottom of the Herbalife chain. He said on CNBC that millions of low income people around the world, hoping to become millionaires, are being duped with this scheme, and if they knew that the probability is less than 1% of making a hundred thousand dollars, what Herbalife calls the "millionaires team", no one would sign up for it.[90]
Herbalife responded to Ackman's 2012 presentation saying:

"[It] was a malicious attack on Herbalife's business model based largely on outdated, distorted and inaccurate information. Herbalife operates with the highest ethical and quality standards, and our management and our board are constantly reviewing our business practices and products. Herbalife also hires independent, outside experts to ensure our operations are in full compliance with laws and regulations. Herbalife is not an illegal pyramid scheme."[91]

Herbalife also countered that Ackman based his accusations on a misunderstanding of the company's distributor base. At an investor conference in January 2013, the company released results of a Nielsen Research International survey showing 73 percent of Herbalife distributors never intended to make money by reselling the product. Instead, they wanted to buy products at a discount for personal use.[92] To make the distinction clearer, the company announced on its June 2013 earnings call that it would begin referring to these discount buyers as "members" rather than "distributors." [93]
According to a number of financial commentators, Ackman bet roughly $1 billion against the company;[94] soon after remarks to the press, the price of the stock decreased such that Ackman would have made $300 million if he had closed his short position then.[95] Ackman stated that he will donate all of his profits from the trade to charity, taking the financial incentive out of the equation.[90][96] A few months after Ackman's initial comments, billionaire investor Carl Icahn refuted Ackman's comment in a very public spat on national TV. Shortly thereafter, Icahn bought shares of Herbalife Intl. As Icahn continued to buy up HLF shares, the stock price continued to show strength.[97] By May 2013, Icahn owned 16.5% of the company.[98] That number had declined to 6.4 by November 2013.[99] Investor George Soros and Post Foods CEO William Stiritz also bought large shares of Herbalife. Ackman acknowledged losing $400–500 million on his short position in November 2013.[100] By November 2014, Soros had sold 2.8 million shares, 60% of his stake, while Perry Capital had purchased 1.6 million shares.[101][102]
By December 2, 2014 stock prices had fallen nearly 50% to $42.08 from their January 8 high of $83.48.[103] On 17 December 2014 Pershing Square Capital released a 2005 video of a Herbalife training conference in which Stephan Gratziani, a member of Herbalife's Chairman's Club sales team, was recorded telling an audience of high-level distributors "We sell people on a dream business that they can make it, yet deep down inside we know that most of them aren't going to," along with other statements that Pershing described as implying that the business model was not sustainable.[104][105][106] According to an unnamed source speaking to the New York Post, the video had previously been subpoenaed by federal investigators.[105] In an interview with Bloomberg, Ackman predicted that the company would experience an "implosion" in 2015 or early 2016, citing federal scrutiny and debt.[106][107]
FTC investigation[edit]
Based on information from a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, the New York Post reported on February 4, 2013, that HerbaLife was subject to a pending probe from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC released 729 pages containing 192 complaints received over a 7-year period in regards to the New York Post's FOIA request. After reviewing the now-public complaints, which the FTC put on its website, Ackman told the New York Post: “I have a lot more confidence in our government’s regulators than those who own the stock.” [108] The FTC stated that the wording it used in its response to the FOIA request was incorrect; the FTC could not confirm or deny an investigation into Herbalife.[109]
In March 2014, the FTC opened an investigation into Herbalife in response to calls from consumer groups and members in both houses of Congress. Herbalife responded to the probe by saying it “welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace, and will co-operate fully with the FTC. We are confident that Herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.” The investigation process that is required for alleged pyramid schemes takes 12 to 18 months. In cases like the Herbalife investigation, the FTC often seeks to impose changes to a company’s practices—known as injunctive relief—in order to stop misconduct that it sees as harming consumers. In May 2016 a spokesperson from the FTC told Bloomberg that “Injunctive relief can be just as significant as the money obtained for consumers and even more influential on a company’s future operations”, in response to speculation that Herbalife was close to a resolution with the FTC.[11][110][111][112]
In July 2016, Herbalife agreed to change its business model and pay $200 million in a settlement with the FTC.[12][113][114][115] Partial refund checks were mailed to roughly 350,000 Herbalife distributors in January 2017.[116][117]
The lawsuit alleged that Herbalife deceived consumers into believing they could earn substantial income from the business opportunity or big money from the retail sale of the company’s products. In addition, the complaint charged that one of the fundamental principles of Herbalife’s business model—incentivizing distributors to buy products and to recruit others to join and buy products so they could advance in the company’s marketing program, rather than in response to actual consumer demand—is an unfair practice in violation of the FTC Act.[118]
As part of the settlement, Herbalife agreed to pay distributors based only on actual retail sales of products, rather than for recruiting other distributors. The FTC had noted that the overwhelming majority of Herbalife's distributors earn very little or nothing.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
