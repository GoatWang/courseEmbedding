HEALTH
We’ll help you prepare for the unexpected.
For years I heard the voice of a wise old sage (my mother) tell me, “If you have your health you have everything.“ It wasn’t until I hit the midcentury period of my own life that I truly appreciated that statement. So what do you do with this wisdom? “Plan for the best, but prepare for the worst.” Can you guess who made that statement? That’s right, my mom! 
According to cancer.org, in 2015 there will be an estimated 500 thousand cancer deaths in the United States alone. Alz.org estimates by 2050 the numbers of people age 65 and older who become afflicted with Alzheimer’s may nearly triple from 5 million to as many as 16 million. Heart disease is estimated to affect 611,105 U.S. citizens according to cdc.gov.
These numbers aren’t meant to scare, they are written to jolt you into seeing the need to prepare for the worst. Having the funds available for care if these health issues become yours to deal with, is critical in keeping the quality of life as high as possible for you and your loved ones.  
We’re here to help. Watch the video, read the case study and call.   







HOW WE'VE HELPED PEOPLE LIKE YOU!

A long-term client of SVA Plumb worked with trust and wealth management advisors throughout many major transitions in his life, including planning for management of his affairs during disability and transferring his assets to his children after his passing.
In their late 60s, a couple turned to SVA Plumb to help manage their finances. The husband, a busy professional, was still working and wanted help managing the significant assets they had accumulated over the years.
As the family’s lives changed in the next 15 years, SVA Plumb worked closely with the family to keep their financial and estate plans in sync.
SVA Plumb restructured the family’s financial plan several times. First, as the couple neared retirement, they created a new plan based on the selling of the family home, moving into an easier-to-care-for condominium and consolidating their various 401(k) and IRA plans.
A few years into retirement, the wife died unexpectedly. Several years later, the husband decided to travel more. With his advisors’ guidance, the client decided to move his assets into several trusts, naming SVA Plumb as agent. This gave the client the freedom to leave home when he wanted, knowing that SVA Plumb would handle routine financial duties, like paying bills, as well as continue to assist with regular wealth management tasks.
SVA Plumb overhauled the financial plan again as the client was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. Before his condition became too severe, they worked with the client to create concrete financial and health plans of action. The client decided to step down as trustee and appoint SVA Plumb Trust Company in his stead, meaning that SVA Plumb would take over all of his financial activities, including investments, bill paying, coordination with legal advisors, preparation of income taxes and real estate transactions.
In addition, the SVA Plumb team worked with the client’s attorneys to make sure that the client’s adult children had Powers of Attorney for health and financial matters. As the client’s health condition worsened, the children were in constant contact with SVA Plumb to make major decisions such as moving the client into a senior care facility and selling real estate.
Finally, after the client passed away, SVA Plumb worked with the family to transfer his assets to his beneficiaries. The client’s children continue to work with SVA Plumb today.

“During the major transitions of this client’s life, we were honored to be his partner and provide a peace of mind that his assets were being handled according to his wishes, and that they would be passed along to his family in the smoothest manner possible.”

HIGH INCOME EARNER
Let us help you reach your financial goals.
526,000 seems like a big number, but it’s not the amount of money you earn in a year, it’s the amount of minutes you have in a year. 
Now break that number down into how many minutes you spend sleeping, eating and working. Oh and don’t forget family and social commitments. In the minutes you have left at the end of the day – do you really want to spend them combing websites looking for the best investment deals and then risking your financial future on a stock you selected after an exhausting 12 hour day?
Below is a case study that reflects what SVA Plumb Financial was able to do for a doctor who finally decided to relinquish control of his finances. Take the 2-3 minutes (yes, your minutes) to see how many days in a year this physician no doubt saved while moving him closer to his financial goals in life. How would you spend that time? 







HOW WE'VE HELPED PEOPLE LIKE YOU!

A high-earning physician finally made the decision to streamline his financials and minimize his tax burden. That first year, he saved more than $30,000 in taxes. Now he has a consolidated view of his investments, an ongoing savings and investment strategy, and understands how he can use the money for his family’s future.
One of SVA Plumb’s clients, a successful, high-earning physician, likes to understand every aspect of a medical issue before proposing a solution. For years, this tendency had led him to avoid putting together a comprehensive wealth management plan simply because he didn’t have the time to dive deeply into the process. Finally, after much prompting from his tax advisor, the physician decided to take the plunge and talk to SVA Plumb’s wealth management team.
In an initial analysis, the wealth management team identified several potential risks in the way the doctor’s assets were structured. Fortunately, they also saw a lot of potential.
First, team members reduced his exposure by moving excess cash out of accounts that were only insured for up to $250,000 and invested the excess to provide inflation protection. Then, they helped find and consolidate several of the physician’s retirement plan accounts.  They advised the doctor to keep the high guaranteed rate plans and uncovered an opportunity for him to engage special “catch up” provisions on his contributions to two other plans. This strategy saved him more than $30,000 in taxes each year for the next three years.
Next, with SVA Plumb now managing the physician’s finances, the team coordinated with his attorney to draft new estate documents—documents that hadn’t been updated since his children, now in their 20s, were infants.
The doctor also wanted to establish a charitable foundation, but instead, SVA Plumb recommended putting a charitable gift fund in place, which is easier to administer and lower cost. The doctor agreed with the strategy. Now, in higher-earning years, he can allocate extra money into that fund, earn a tax deduction and later decide on the charity that will receive the funds. The doctor has chosen to fund his charitable giving for retirement during his high-income years, once again minimizing his taxable income.
Today, SVA Plumb regularly meets with the physician to update his plans based on his goals and income. They make everything as easy as possible for him by handling calls with his attorneys, retirement plan administrators and other institutions to keep his assets on the right track. 

“When I bring an idea to my client, he examines it down to the smallest detail. And then he tells us to go ahead with the plan. We’re completely transparent in our approach towards wealth management, and he trusts us because he knows we act in his best interests at all times. Our team brings him peace of mind so that he can focus on things most important to him.”

INHERITANCE
Are you prepared to manage a large sum of money?
Recently you inherited a sum of money, either expected or unexpected. It seems like managing this money should be pretty easy… right? Not right. 
Even Consumer Reports created a, Follow these 9 Steps to avoid making some common mistakes list when handling an inheritance. Problems occur more often than you may have originally thought. Interestingly enough, step #3 on this list is to “Consult a financial advisor.”
Along with seeking the counsel of an advisor, common sense also comes into play. However you handle, save, and invest your current finances will be a direct link to how you would naturally make choices on what to do with your inheritance. Is that good or bad? That’s up to you to decide, but either way, follow step #3 and give SVA Plumb a call to set up an appointment. The goal is to make this money work for you and move you toward achieving the financial freedom you are seeking.







HOW WE'VE HELPED PEOPLE LIKE YOU!

When a couple received a $15 million inheritance, they didn’t realize how complicated the process of sorting through and managing the assets could be. They also wanted to know which of their dreams they could afford now, and which needed a bit more thought before they could become a reality. SVA Plumb helped to answer these questions, and they developed a plan to achieve the couple’s goals.
Having just inherited a $15 million estate, this couple was referred to SVA Plumb by their law firm. They were excited to begin living their dreams, but also overwhelmed at the thought of managing the wide variety of assets and the tax and legal issues that were beginning to emerge.
SVA Plumb helped by effectively “quarterbacking” the process of comprehensive wealth management. SVA Plumb advisors coordinated with a wide range of specialists to consult on their tax issues, evaluate their estate documents, and organize and streamline the various assets of the estate, including individual equities, bonds, and even land and businesses in different states.
As the wealth management team helped organize this couple’s assets, they also worked with the couple to assess their lifestyle and prioritize their dreams for the future. After thorough evaluation, a plan was put in place to help the couple navigate how much they could spend every year, and when they could cut back on work and begin transitioning into retirement.
A large part of this couple’s plan was to leave money for their children, so they worked closely with the attorneys at SVA Plumb’s Trust Company. SVA Plumb worked in partnership with the couple’s lawyers to create a trust that appointed SVA Plumb Trust as a contingent trustee. This meant that after the couple’s passing, SVA Plumb would administer the trust for their children, saving their children from complex financial and legal dealings. The advance planning served as a valuable tool in outlining their goals, as well as removing the need for probate and keeping their financial affairs private.
Now that they have a firm grasp of how much they can spend each year and still meet the long-term goals for their family, they’ve started to enjoy life more. They recently bought their dream vacation home in Colorado and are currently easing into retirement. They regularly contact SVA Plumb Trust for ongoing general advice and formally meet with the members of their SVA Plumb Trust team two to three times a year. Now that the initial inheritance has been fully transferred and streamlined, they are able to focus on their newest project: charitable giving.

“We assembled a team of experts to make managing the inheritance as easy as possible. We work as real partners and advocates for our clients. As a fiduciary firm, we’re bound by law to make financial decisions that are in our clients’ best interest plus we truly do want what is best for them. We’re proud to have built the kind of trusting relationship to enable clients to enjoy their inheritance without worry.”
