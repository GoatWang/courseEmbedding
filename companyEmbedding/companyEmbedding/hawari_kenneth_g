Mr. Hawari earned his B.A. and a J.D. each from the University of Texas at Austin. We believe that Mr. Hawari is well qualified to serve on Nuvectra's Board of Directors due to his experience as a former corporate executive in the medical device industry and his understanding of the legal issues that impact the medical device industry generally given his experience as a general counsel and in private practice.
