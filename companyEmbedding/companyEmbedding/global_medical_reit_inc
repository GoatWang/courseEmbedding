(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements included herein, including the notes to those financial statements, included elsewhere in this Report, and the section entitled "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" in this Report. As discussed in more detail in the section entitled "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements," this discussion contains forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements.  Background  Global Medical REIT Inc. (the "Company," "us," "we," "our") was incorporated in the state of Nevada on March 18, 2011 and re-domiciled into a Maryland corporation, effective January 6, 2014. Our principal investment strategy is to develop and manage a portfolio of real estate assets in the healthcare industry, which includes surgery centers, specialty hospitals, and outpatient treatment centers.  We formed our Operating Partnership in March 2016 and contributed all of our then-owned healthcare facilities to the Operating Partnership in exchange for common units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership. We own Global Medical REIT GP, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, which is the sole general partner of our Operating Partnership. We intend to conduct all future acquisition activity and operations through our Operating Partnership.  On July 1, 2016, the Company closed its initial public offering and issued 15,000,000 shares of its common stock at a price of $10.00 per share resulting in net proceeds of $138,969,275.  Recent Developments  We Completed Eight Acquisitions During the Current Quarter  During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we completed eight acquisitions. A summary description of the facilities acquired is contained in Note 3 - "Property Portfolio," to the notes to consolidated financial statements.  Trends Which May Influence Results of Operations  We believe the following trends in the healthcare real estate market positively affect the acquisition, ownership, development and management of healthcare real estate:  � growing healthcare expenditures;  � an aging population;  � a continuing shift towards outpatient care;  � implementation of the Affordable Care Act;  � physician practice group and hospital consolidation;  � healthcare industry employment growth;  � expected monetization and modernization of healthcare real estate;  � a highly fragmented healthcare real estate market; and  � a limited new supply of healthcare real estate.  We believe the following trends in the healthcare real estate market may negatively impact our lease revenues and the ability to make distributions to our shareholders:  � changes in demand for and methods of delivering healthcare services;  � changes in third party reimbursement methods and policies; and  � increased scrutiny of billing, referral and other practices by U.S. federal and state authorities.  - 29 -  Components of the Company's Revenues, Expenses and Cash Flows  Revenue  Rental revenue  Our operations currently consist of rental revenue earned from our tenant-operators under leasing arrangements which provide for minimum rent and escalations. The leases have been accounted for as operating leases. For operating leases with contingent rental escalators, revenue is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due during the period. Revenue from leases with fixed annual rental escalators are recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease period, subject to a collectability assessment. If we determine that collectability of rents is not reasonably assured, future revenue recognition is limited to amounts contractually owed and paid, and, when appropriate, an allowance for estimated losses is established. Additionally, the capitalized above-market lease intangible is amortized as a reduction of rental revenue and the below-market lease intangible is amortized as an addition to rental revenue over the estimated remaining term of the respective leases.  Other income  Other income consists primarily of interest income earned on the net proceeds received from our initial public offering.  Expenses  Acquisition fees  Acquisition fees represent expenses incurred with unaffiliated entities related to the acquisition of a facility, primarily incurred with acquisitions that are accounted for as business combinations.  Acquisition fees - related party  Acquisition fees - related party represented a fee paid by us to our Advisor for facility acquisitions in connection with the terms of the original management agreement. In accordance with the provisions of the amended and restated management agreement, which became effective July 1, 2016, the Advisor ceased charging us this acquisition fee.  General and administrative  General and administrative expense primarily includes professional fees and services (legal and accounting), general office expenses, ground rent related to the Omaha facility, and travel and related expenses.  Management fees - related party  In accordance with the terms of the Company's initial management agreement between us and the Advisor, we owed the Advisor a base management fee equal to the greater of (a) 2.0% per annum of our net asset value (the value of our assets less the value of our liabilities), or (b) $30,000 per calendar month. Historically this fee has resulted in a monthly charge to us of $30,000. Upon completion of the Company's initial public offering on July 1, 2016, the Company's amended and restated management agreement, which was approved by the Board on June 13, 2016, became effective. Refer to Note 6 - "Related Party Transactions" for details regarding the amended and restated management agreement, the management fee expense incurred for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016, and accrued management fees owed to the Advisor as of those dates.  Depreciation expense  Depreciation expense is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the buildings, site improvements, and tenant improvements, which are generally between 4 and 40 years.  Amortization expense  Amortization expense is incurred on the Company's acquired lease intangible assets (consisting of in-place leases and leasing cost intangible assets) and is computed using the straight-line method over the remaining lives of the respective leases, which are generally between 4 and 10 years.  - 30 -  Interest expense  Interest expense is derived from interest incurred on our borrowings from third party institutional lenders as well as borrowings from related parties, the funds of which were primarily used to fund acquisitions. Additionally, the amortization of deferred financing costs (debt discount) incurred to obtain third party financing is classified as interest expense.  Cash Flow  Cash flows from operating activities  Cash flows from operating activities primarily represent activities related to us conducting our normal business activities and generally reflect the impact of transactions that enter into the determination of our net income or loss.  Cash flows from investing activities  Cash flows from investing activities primarily represent activities related to us acquiring healthcare facilities, plants, and equipment and making and collecting loans from other entities.  Cash flows from financing activities  Cash flows from financing activities primarily represent activities related to us borrowing and subsequently repaying funds from other entities as well as providing stockholders with a return on investment primarily in the form of a dividend payment.  Competition  Our healthcare facilities often face competition from nearby hospitals and other healthcare facilities that provide comparable services. Similarly, our tenant-operators face competition from other medical practices and service providers at nearby hospitals and other healthcare facilities. From time to time and for reasons beyond our control, managed-care organizations may change their lists of preferred hospitals or in-network physicians. Physicians also may change hospital affiliations. If competitors of our tenant-operators or competitors of the associated healthcare delivery systems with which our healthcare facilities are strategically aligned have greater geographic coverage, improve access and convenience to physicians and patients, provide or are perceived to provide higher quality services, recruit physicians to provide competing services at their facilities, expand or improve their services or obtain more favorable managed-care contracts, our tenant-operators may not be able to successfully compete. Any reduction in rental revenues resulting from the inability of our tenant-operators or the associated healthcare delivery systems with which our healthcare facilities are strategically aligned to compete in providing medical services and/or receiving sufficient rates of reimbursement for healthcare services rendered may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common stock.  Qualification as a REIT  Our business strategy is conducive to a more favorable tax structure whereby we may qualify and elect to be treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We plan to elect to be taxed as REIT under U.S. federal income tax laws commencing with our taxable year ending December 31, 2016. We believe that, commencing with 2016, we have organized and have operated in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a REIT under all of the U.S. federal income tax laws, and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner. However, we cannot provide assurances that we will operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT.  In order to qualify as a REIT, a substantial percentage of our assets must be qualifying real estate assets and a substantial percentage of our income must be rental revenue from real property or interest on mortgage loans. We must elect under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") to be treated as a REIT. Subject to a number of significant exceptions, a corporation that qualifies as a REIT generally is not subject to U.S. federal corporate income taxes on income and gains that it distributes to its stockholders, thereby reducing its corporate level taxes.  Management Agreement  On November 10, 2014, we entered into a Management Agreement, with an effective date of April 1, 2014, with Inter-American Management, LLC, our affiliate. This Management Agreement was amended and restated on July 1, 2016. See Note 6 - "Related Party Transactions" for additional information on these agreements.  - 31 -  Critical Accounting Policies  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base estimates on the best information available to us at the time, our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different, it is possible that different accounting would have been applied, resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. From time to time, we re-evaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. For a more detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 - "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in the footnotes to the accompanying financial statements. Below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Company's financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Purchase of Real Estate  Transactions in which real estate assets are purchased that are not subject to an existing lease are treated as asset acquisitions and are recorded at their purchase price, including capitalized acquisition costs, which is allocated to land and building based upon their relative fair values at the date of acquisition. Transactions in which real estate assets are acquired either subject to an existing lease or as part of a portfolio level transaction with significant leasing activity are treated as a business combination under Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 805, Business Combinations, and the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including identified intangible assets and liabilities, are recorded at their fair value. Fair value is determined based upon the guidance of ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures and generally are determined using Level 2 inputs, such as rent comparables, sales comparables, and broker indications. Although Level 3 Inputs are utilized, they are minor in comparison to the Level 2 data used for the primary assumptions. The determination of fair value involves the use of significant judgment and estimates. We make estimates to determine the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed using information obtained from multiple sources, including pre-acquisition due diligence, and we routinely utilize the assistance of a third party appraiser. Initial valuations are subject to change until the information is finalized, no later than 12 months from the acquisition date. We expense transaction costs associated with acquisitions accounted for as business combinations in the period incurred.  Details regarding the valuation of tangible assets:  The fair value of land is determined using the sales comparison approach whereby recent comparable land sales and listings are gathered and summarized. The available market data is analyzed and compared to the land being valued and adjustments are made for dissimilar characteristics such as market conditions, size, and location. We estimate the fair value of buildings acquired on an as-if-vacant basis and depreciate the building value over its estimated remaining life. We determine the fair value of site improvements (non-building improvements that include paving and other) using the cost approach, with a deduction for depreciation, and depreciate the site improvements over their estimated remaining useful lives. Tenant improvements represent fixed improvements to tenant spaces, the fair value of which is estimated using prevailing market tenant improvement allowances that would be given to attract a new tenant, estimated based on the assumption that it is a necessary cost of leasing up a vacant building. Tenant improvements are amortized over the remaining term of the lease.  Details regarding the valuation of intangible assets:  In determining the fair value of in-place leases (the avoided cost associated with existing in-place leases) management considers current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases in arriving at an estimate of the carrying costs during the expected lease-up period from vacant to existing occupancy. In estimating carrying costs, management includes reimbursable (based on market lease terms) real estate taxes, insurance, other operating expenses, as well as estimates of lost market rental revenue during the expected lease-up periods. The values assigned to in-place leases are amortized over the remaining term of the lease.  - 32 -  The fair value of above-or-below market leases is estimated based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflected the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between contractual amounts to be received pursuant to the leases and management's estimate of market lease rates measured over a period equal to the estimated remaining term of the lease. An above market lease is classified as an intangible asset and a below market lease is classified as an intangible liability. The capitalized above-market or below-market lease intangibles are amortized as a reduction of or an addition to rental income over the estimated remaining term of the respective leases. The capitalized above-market lease intangible is amortized as a reduction of rental revenue and the below-market lease intangible is amortized as an addition to rental revenue over the estimated remaining term of the respective leases.  Intangible assets related to leasing costs consist of leasing commissions and legal fees. Leasing commissions are estimated by multiplying the remaining contract rent associated with each lease by a market leasing commission. Legal fees represent legal costs associated with writing, reviewing, and sometimes negotiating various lease terms. Leasing costs are amortized over the remaining useful life of the respective leases.  Impairment of Long Lived Assets  The Company evaluates its real estate assets for impairment periodically or whenever events or circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. If an impairment indicator exists, we compare the expected future undiscounted cash flows against the carrying amount of an asset. If the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, we would record an impairment loss for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying amount of the asset.  Revenue Recognition  The Company's operations currently consist of rental revenue earned from tenants under leasing arrangements which provide for minimum rent and escalations. These leases are accounted for as operating leases. For operating leases with contingent rental escalators revenue is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due during the period. Revenue from leases with fixed annual rental escalators are recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease term, subject to a collectability assessment. If the Company determines that collectability of rents is not reasonably assured, future revenue recognition is limited to amounts contractually owed and paid, and, when appropriate, an allowance for estimated losses is established.  The Company consistently assesses the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts, including an allowance for operating lease straight-line rent receivables, for estimated losses resulting from tenant defaults, or the inability of tenants to make contractual rent and tenant recovery payments. The Company also monitors the liquidity and creditworthiness of its tenants and operators on a continuous basis. This evaluation considers industry and economic conditions, property performance, credit enhancements and other factors. For operating lease straight-line rent amounts, the Company's assessment is based on amounts estimated to be recoverable over the term of the lease. As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 no allowance was recorded as it was not deemed necessary.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  Fair value is a market-based measurement and should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. In accordance with ASC Topic 820, the valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. A financial instrument's categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three levels are defined as follows:   Level 1-Inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets;   Level 2-Inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument; and   Level 3-Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.  The Company considers the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, escrow deposits, accounts and other receivables, and accounts payable and accrued expenses to approximate the fair value for these financial instruments because of the short period of time since origination or the short period of time between origination of the instruments and their expected realization. Due to the short-term nature of these instruments, Level 1 and Level 2 inputs are utilized to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments. The fair values determined related to the Company's transactions that are accounted for as business combinations primarily utilizes Level 2 inputs since there is heavy reliance on market observable data such as rent comparables, sales comparables, and broker indications. Although some Level 3 inputs are utilized they are minor in comparison to the Level 2 date used for the primary assumptions as it relates to business combination valuations.  - 33 -  Stock-Based Compensation  The Company expenses the fair value of unit awards in accordance with the fair value recognition requirements of ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, and ASC Topic 505, Equity. Under ASC Topic 718, the Company's independent directors are deemed to be employees and therefore compensation expense for these units is recognized based on the price of $10.00 per unit, the closing share price for the Company's common stock at the closing date of the initial public offering on July 1, 2016, ratably over the 12-month service period, using the straight line method. Under ASC Topic 505, the employees of the Advisor and its affiliates are deemed to be non-employees of the Company and therefore compensation expense for these units is recognized using the share price of the Company's common stock at the end of the reporting period, ratably over the 41-month or 53-month service period, respectively, depending on the grant terms, using the straight line method. Annual performance awards will vest in equal portions at the end of the one-year performance period and one year from that date. Long-term performance awards vest in equal portions on the completion of the three-year performance period, and on the one-year anniversary of that date. Annual and long-term award targets were granted on February 28, 2017.  Consolidated Results of Operations  The major factor that resulted in variances in our results of operations for each revenue and expense category for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016 is the fact that as of March 31, 2017 our portfolio consisted of facilities from a total of 22 acquisitions, whereas as of March 31, 2016 only seven of the 22 acquisitions had occurred.  As of March 31, 2017, the Company had the following properties in its portfolio from 22 acquisitions:  � Oklahoma City Facility (acquired March 31, 2017)  � Great Bend Facility (acquired March 31, 2017)  � Sandusky Facility (one building - acquired March 10, 2017)  � Clermont Facility (acquired March 1, 2017)  � Prescott Facility (acquired February 9, 2017)  � Las Cruces Facility (acquired February 1, 2017)  � Cape Coral facility (acquired January 10, 2017)  � Lewisburg Facility (acquired January 12, 2017)  � HealthSouth facilities (acquired December 20, 2016)  � Ellijay facilities (acquired December 16, 2016)  � Carson City facilities (acquired October 31, 2016)  � Sandusky facilities (five buildings - acquired October 7, 2016)  � Watertown (acquired September 30, 2016)  � East Orange (acquired September 29, 2016)  � Reading (acquired July 20, 2016)  � Melbourne (acquired March 31, 2016)  � Westland (acquired March 31, 2016)  � Plano (acquired January 28, 2016)  � Tennessee facilities (acquired December 31, 2015)  � West Mifflin (acquired September 25, 2015)  � Asheville (acquired September 19, 2014)  � Omaha (acquired June 5, 2014)  As of March 31, 2016 the Company had the following properties in its portfolio from seven acquisitions:  � Melbourne (acquired March 31, 2016)  � Westland (acquired March 31, 2016)  � Plano (acquired January 28, 2016)  � Tennessee facilities (acquired December 31, 2015)  � West Mifflin (acquired September 25, 2015)  � Asheville (acquired September 19, 2014)  � Omaha (acquired June 5, 2014)  - 34 -  Revenues  Total revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $4,658,858, compared to $1,314,059 for the same period in 2016, an increase of $3,344,799. The increase is the result of rental revenue derived from the base rental receipts from the facilities acquired subsequent to the end of the first quarter of 2016 as well as from the recognition of a full quarter of rental revenue earned during the current quarter related to the Melbourne and Westland facilities that we acquired on March 31, 2016, and the Plano Facility that we acquired on January 28, 2016.  Acquisition Fees  Acquisition fees to unrelated parties for the three months ended March 31, 2017 were $942,473, compared to zero for the same period in 2016. These acquisition fees were primarily incurred on our acquisitions during the current quarter that were accounted for as business combinations. As discussed in the "acquisition fees - related party" discussion below, prior to the amended and restated management agreement between us and our Advisor, which became effective on July 1, 2016, acquisition fees were incurred and payable to our Advisor.  Acquisition Fees - related party  Related party acquisition fees for the three months ended March 31, 2017 were zero, compared with $754,000 for the same period in 2016. Acquisition fees for the three months ended March 31, 2016 consisted of $350,000, $309,000 and $95,000 that were expensed in connection with the acquisitions of the Plano Facility, the Melbourne Facility, and the Westland Facility, respectively. The acquisition fee was computed as 2% of the purchase price of the facility.  General and Administrative  General and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2017 were $2,840,807, compared with $888,529 for the same period in 2016, an increase of $1,952,278. The increase reflects a general increase in this expense category (insurance, legal, business development) as a result of the facilities acquired subsequent to the end of the first quarter of 2016. Additionally, during the current quarter a full quarter of general and administrative expense was incurred related to the Melbourne and Westland facilities that we acquired on March 31, 2016, and the Plano Facility that we acquired on January 28, 2016. The current quarter also includes non-cash compensation expense incurred related to the LTIP units that were granted in accordance with the Company's long-term incentive plan.  Management Fees - related party  Management fees for the three months ended March 31, 2017 were $627,147, compared with $90,000 for the same period in 2016, an increase of $537,147. The current quarter management fee was calculated based upon the terms of the amended and restated management agreement, which called for a base management fee equal to 1.5% of our stockholders' equity. The management fee for the same . . .  May 11, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

Global Medical REIT Is Poised To Profit - Global Medical REIT, Inc. (NYSEMKT:GMRE) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Global Medical REIT Is Poised To ProfitApr.21.17 | About: Global Medical (GMRE) Brad Thomas Dividend growth investing, REITs, newsletter provider, valueMarketplaceREIT BeatSummaryWhile the investment strategy is unique, Global Medical REIT is also considered an outlier for its strategy of sourcing capital both domestically and internationally.This newbie in REITdom appears to be ripe for reward.Although Global Medical REIT is externally managed, the company expects to internalize as soon as it reaches critical mass.I would expect the company to normalize its payout ratio in the low 80%'s range.Subscribers to REIT Beat had early access to this article. The author purchased shares prior to publishing this article at a price of $9.42 per share.  According to REIT.com, when Global Medical REIT (NYSEMKT:GMRE) "went public last summer, the company set its sights on a specific niche within the health care real estate sector: licensed medical treatment facilities." The company focuses on transactions in the range of $10-50 million, and CEO David Young sees a steady flow of acquisition opportunities coming from smaller cities and rural locations. The Bethesda, Maryland-based REIT focuses on medical practices that deliver core medical procedures, such as cardiovascular treatment, cosmetic plastic surgery, eye surgery, gastroenterology, oncology treatment and orthopedics. Some would argue that GMRE is a niche-based REIT that pursues an asset class that's "underserved" rather than more crowded categories such as assisted living, senior housing, and medical office. While the investment strategy is unique, GMRE is also considered an outlier for its strategy of sourcing capital both domestically and internationally. According to the company's CEO, David Young: There are no other REITs in our space that are sourcing capital internationally. I think that does give us a competitive edge, 


 Prior to listing shares, GMRE was established in 2014 when Hong Kong-based ZH International Holdings, Ltd. provided the first tranche of private equity. GMRE spent 18 months to build a portfolio worth about $110 million by using private equity and bank leverage. In 2016, the company raised $150 million through an IPO, and a few months later, it secured a $200 million syndicated bank line of credit and an accordion feature for an additional $50 million. At the end of 2016, GMRE had acquired $219 million of assets, and it purchased approximately $108 million of assets in the first quarter of 2017. This newbie in REITdom appears to be ripe for reward, and this is why I chose the article "Global Medical REIT Is Poised To Profit". 

 (Image Credit) Company Overview  GMRE is focused on the acquisition and leasing of state-of-the-art, purpose-built healthcare facilities. The facilities are built or adapted to contemporary best healthcare practices, and the company targets the "factory" where core medical procedures are delivered. GMRE leases to leading medical providers with dominant local market share. It also focuses on single-tenant, net lease real estate. The current portfolio consists of 31 facilities net-leased to fourteen tenants. The portfolio includes approximately 666,000 square feet of leasable area with leases averaging 10 years or remaining term (14 years average age of portfolio - the youngest of listed healthcare REITs). 


 The REIT's closes peer is Medical Properties Trust (NYSE:MPW), but GMRE does not invest in ambulatory properties like MPW. GMRE executives have robust relationships with healthcare providers, allowing for direct negotiation and generation of new long-term leases without broker intermediaries. Here's a snapshot of the company's portfolio (as of 12-31-16): 

 GMRE targets annual base rent of 7-9% of projected total investment cost, and leases typically have 2-3% annual rent escalations. Most leases are absolute NNN leases, with 10-20 year initial lease terms. Because the leases are NNN, there is minimal recurring capex exposure and minimal asset management expenses. The company also insists on credit enhancements to mitigate risks:  Subordination of tenant physician salaries and medical practice profit distributions to timely payment of rent Licenses, CONs (Certificates of Need) stay with the real estate in the event of change in occupancy Personal, corporate, sponsor guarantees and/or third-party letters of credit High rent coverage ratios (EBITDARM) required of tenant for security GMRE has right to evict and replace management of medical provider tenant Cross-collateralization for portfolio investments by GMRE with same operator Comprehensive tenant reporting requirements and annual audits  GMRE has the youngest assets of listed healthcare REIT peers, driving high-quality tenant retention. The portfolio has no lease rollovers until 2021, and the average annual base rent per square foot is $23.14. 


 Management Team Looks Solid I took a look at GMRE's Investor Deck, and I see that the management team has deep experience in healthcare. For example, the company's CEO has over 25 years of experience and was formerly VP at Windrose Medical Properties Trust (WRS), which was acquired by Welltower (NYSE:HCN). He was also an executive responsible for business development for Healthcare Property Investors (NYSE:HCP) and helped it grow from AUM of $300 million to over $3.5 billion. I also noticed there were a few heavy-hitting Board members, including Matthew Cypher, Ph.D., professor at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business, as the director of the Real Estate Finance Initiative. Another notable Board member includes Ronald Marston, founder and CEO of Healthcare Corporation of America (OTCPK:HCCA) Management Company, originally a subsidiary of Hospital Corporation of America (NYSE:HCA). 

 Latest Earnings GMRE has just one quarter of earnings under its belt, but the results were promising. The Q4-16 highlights included:  Total revenue increased to $3.1 million from $0.7 million. Net loss increased to $(1.9) million from $(0.8) million. Funds from Operations of $(0.06) per share. Adjusted Funds from Operations ("AFFO") of $0.06 per share. Occupancy rate of 100% at both December 31, 2016, and December 31, 2015.  During the first quarter, GMRE closed on acquisitions totaling approximately $33.5 million, bringing its gross investments to approximately $241 million (and an additional $75.1 million of acquisitions currently under contract). Clearly, the REIT is out of the gates with strong growth potential and likely strong shareholder returns. Although GMRE is externally managed, the company expects to internalize as soon as it reaches critical mass. It continues to reduce G&A, and the path to internalization (~$500 million) is obvious.
 

 A Small Cap Poised to Profit Here's a snapshot of GMRE's market cap, compared to the Healthcare REIT peers: 

 As you can see below, the dividend yield is attractive (8.5%): 

 While GMRE's dividend is not covered by current earnings (FFO/share)...: 

 ... the growth estimates provide a clear indication that the company will be able to cover its dividend in late 2017. Here's a snapshot of forecasted FFO (using F.A.S.T. Graph estimates): 

 Same data using %: 


 GMRE's dividend is currently $0.20 per, annualized at $0.80 per share. Based on estimates for 2018, the company is likely to generate ~$.86 per share, which translates into a forward-looking payout ratio of 93%. Given the composition of NNN leases in GMRE's portfolio, I would expect the company to normalize its payout ratio in the low 80%'s range. In summary, GMRE could be the underdog, and I am initiating a BUY. Keep in mind, small-cap companies are exposed to more volatility, and for that reason, I am maintaining speculative (1%) concentration. Clearly, the market has not picked up on GMRE, so I need to get a seat on the train before it chugs off!

Global Medical REIT Named Top Dividend Stock With Insider Buying and 9.04% Yield (GMRE)
In this series, we look through the most recent Dividend Channel ''DividendRank'' report, and then we cherry pick only those companies that have experienced insider buying within the past six months. The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both.

Global Medical REIT Inc. Announces Q2 2017 Cash Dividend Of $0.20 Per Share






Business Wire




Jun 16, 2017 8:30 AM EDT













 


















































  Global Medical REIT Inc. (NYSE:GMRE) (the "Company"), a Maryland corporation engaged primarily in the acquisition of licensed, state-of-the-art, purpose-built healthcare facilities and the leasing of these facilities to strong clinical operators with leading market share, today announced that its Board of Directors authorized a $0.20 per share cash dividend to stockholders of record as of June 27, 2017, to be paid on July 10, 2017. This dividend represents the Company's second quarter 2017 dividend payment to its stockholders.  About Global Medical REIT Inc.  Global Medical REIT Inc. is a Maryland corporation engaged primarily in the acquisition of licensed, state-of-the-art, purpose-built healthcare facilities and the leasing of these facilities to strong clinical operators with leading market share. The Company's strategy is to produce increasing, reliable rental revenue by expanding its portfolio, and leasing its healthcare facilities to market-leading operators under long-term, triple-net leases. The Company's management team has significant healthcare, real estate and public real estate investment trust, or REIT, experience and has long-established relationships with a wide range of healthcare providers. The Company intends to elect to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2016.  Forward-Looking Statements  This press release contains statements that are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as "anticipate", "believe", "expect", "estimate", "plan", "outlook", and "project" and other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results, and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by, which such performance or results will be achieved. Forward-looking statements are based on information available at the time those statements are made and/or management's good faith belief as of that time with respect to future events. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, not all of which are known to the Company and many of which are beyond the Company's control, which could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in or suggested by the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties are described in greater detail in the "Risk Factors" section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended by Amendment No. 2 thereto, for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on May 9, 2017, and elsewhere in the reports the Company has filed with the Commission, including that the Company may be unable to pay its second quarter dividend in a timely fashion or at all. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Unless legally required, the Company disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. The Company undertakes no obligation to update these statements after the date of this release.

Acquisition Strategy 












Acquire state-of-the-art, licensed medical facilities that through their technology and design enhance the quality of care provided and improve clinical outcomes for patients
Target facilities that are built and adapted to contemporary best healthcare practices
Target the “factory” where core medical procedures are delivered, not the discretionary or non-critical healthcare real estate where peripheral tasks or office rents are supporting the asset
Lease each facility to a single, local market leading medical provider that has sustained and is successfully managing an excellent clinical and business practice
Focus on practice types that are highly dependent on their purpose-built real estate to deliver core medical procedures, such as cardiovascular treatment, cosmetic plastic surgery, eye surgery, gastroenterology, oncology treatment and orthopedics
Originate the majority of our investments by working directly with the operating medical providers in our target markets



We believe that healthcare facilities with the following technological and design characteristics



Create value by negotiating new leases rather than acquiring leased fee returns via acquisition of already rented healthcare facilities
Lease the facilities under long-term triple-net leases with contractual rent escalations
Efficiently and rapidly grow our portfolio to drive economies of scale and diversification
State-of-the-art intensive care and operating room equipment and imaging technology
Efficient and contiguous patient treatment space for imaging, pre-operation, surgery, post-surgery and recovery phases of care
State-of-the-art infection control materials in patient treatment room surfaces
Specialized sub-micron filtration HVAC in operating rooms
High capacity and modern back-up emergency power generation
Highly durable and energy efficient internal and external construction materials, including membrane roofing
Fiber optic cabling incorporated in initial construction
Distinguish us from our peers

A Strategic Investment Opportunity
Specialized Medical Facilities
Serving the Future of Healthcare 
SPECIALIZED MEDICAL REAL ESTATE NICHE FOR SUPERIOR ASSET PERFORMANCE
GMRE acquires state-of-the-art, licensed medical facilities from market dominant healthcare providers. The advanced technology and design of these assets enhances the quality of care provided and improves clinical outcomes for patients. These benefits lead to higher value real estate with a stable tenant base.01 
Putting capital to workGMRE's experienced management team prides themselves on real estate acquisition and management expertise. Their long-established relationships with a wide range of healthcare providers offers a competitive advantage in sourcing growth opportunities to produce attractive risk-adjusted returns. GMRE has an understanding of the unique challenges and opportunities that exist for potential sellers and will work to tailor solutions for best outcomes.02 
PORTFOLIO AND ACQUISITION STRATEGY POSITIONED FOR SUSTAINABLE GROWTHGMRE purchases specialized licensed medical real estate and is addressing a market segment that is underserved and growing. Better patient outcomes and greater patient convenience have spurred on smaller specialized Outpatient Centers in place of older traditional hospital facilities. Aging U.S. demographics are causing demand for services provided at specialty care centers to increase. The purchase price for these facilities is relatively small and more likely to originate outside of large hospital systems, calling for a more agile and responsive buyer like GMRE.03CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
