CHAPEL HILL, N.C., Jan. 7, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- G1 Therapeutics, Inc. today announced that it has named Seth Rudnick, M.D. as executive chairman of its board of directors, effective immediately. Dr. Rudnick has been serving as the chair of G1's Scientific Advisory Board for the past year and will continue in this role with the company. 
Dr. Rudnick brings to G1 extensive expertise in oncology, drug discovery and development, and healthcare investments.

Many of the products Dr. Rudnick was instrumental in developing there are still generating significant revenues today. Earlier in his career, Dr. Rudnick worked at Schering-Plough and directed pharmaceutical development efforts at Biogen. 
"G1 Therapeutics is fortunate that Seth, with his tremendous background in hematopoiesis and oncology research and development, will take a hands-on leadership role as our lead product candidate moves toward IND status in the second half of 2014," said Christy Shaffer, Ph.D., former executive chair of G1 Therapeutics' board of directors and managing director of Hatteras Discovery, Hatteras Venture Partners. "Seth's proven track record as an innovative leader in the oncology space will help ensure the successful execution of G1's clinical development plans."
"I'm delighted to be joining G1 at such a transformational time for the company," said Dr. Rudnick. "Since I started working with Dr. Ned Sharpless about four years ago, I've been excited about the potential of G1's novel technology to fulfill major unmet needs for cancer patients. I look forward to helping the G1 team advance its product candidate for the potential treatment of chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression into clinical trials and expanding the company's novel CDK4/6 platform into other indications."  
Dr. Rudnick was a Yale Fellow in medical oncology where he was also a Robert Wood Johnson Scholar. He earned his medical degree at the University of Virginia and holds a BA in history from the University of Pennsylvania. He is a Clinical Professor of Medicine at University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, teaching and advising faculty members on biotechnology issues. He also currently serves as the chairman of Liquidia Technologies, Drug Innovation Ventures at Emory (DRIVE) and Meryx, and serves on the boards of VaxInnate, POZEN and Square 1 Financial.
