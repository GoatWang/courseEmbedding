                                            There were surprise musical guests, food trucks, and a star-studded roster of attendees -- but that's where the similarities with the Hollywood Oscar bashes stopped at the UTA United Voices rally, held Friday in lieu of the agency's usual swank after-party.                                        










                                            Actors, artists, musicians and humanitarians were joined by a crowd of around 1,500 people at the rally in Beverly Hills, to -- as comedian Keegan Michael Key put it -- "support the creative community's growing concern with anti-immigration sentiment in the United States of America and the potential chilling effect on the global exchange of ideas, not to mention freedom of expression."                                        





EXCLUSIVE: Ruth Negga and Joel Edgerton 'Cheers' to Continued Support of the ACLU and Fred Hollows Foundation 

                                            Two-time Academy Award winner Jodie Foster made a rare public appearance at the rally, admitting that she usually prefers to keep her activism out of the public eye. "As most of you know, I don't do this very often," the 54-year-old actress told the gathered crowd. "I'm not somebody that feels very comfortable using my public face for activism and so in my life, I've found the small ways -- much like most of you -- to serve, to show up, to give somebody a lift at the bottom of the hill when they're going to the top," she said.                                        

                                            "I've always found a subtle way, a quiet way, a personal way," Foster continued. "But this year is a different year and it's time to show up."                                        

                                            Foster also spoke of the good work done by the humanitarian and civil liberties agencies, the International Rescue Committee and the American Civil Liberties Union, both of which were present at the event and were recipients of more than $300,000 donated by UTA.                                        

                                            It was, perhaps, Wilmer Valderrama's speech that was the most heartfelt. The 37-year-old NCIS star recalled the struggles his Venezuelan immigrant parents went through to provide a better life for him and his siblings. In a voice choked with emotion, Valderrama recalled his father's poignant words. "He said that our only job when we got to America was to get the education he never had," Valderrama said. "My sisters and I were the first ones to speak English in our family."                                        

                                            The actor also recalled walking miles with his mother to get groceries from the 99 Cent store as a child, and noticing how her hands turned red and often hurt on those long journeys. "You see, my story is not my story. It's the story of millions that have come for generations to this land, and brick-by-brick made it a country," he continued, to loud cheers.

                                            "Because of them, we look out the window and we see the American flag and we know, that any minute, anything can happen. That at any minute we will all wake up to our own personal American dream," Valderrama said. "See, that's the immigrant story. We built a country where we can live with one another and thrive together and continue to move forward together, to celebrate our culture to celebrate one another as people."                                        

                                            Michael J. Fox, the beloved Back to the Future actor and Parkinson's activist, said his admiration for American principles and values was why he became an American citizen 20 years ago. "And it was a tough process," he revealed to the crowd. "It took about eight years from soup to nuts, from start to finish. And I complained about how long it took -- my visa, then my green card, and then finally I was sworn in as a proud American. And I think, like, what was I bitching about?" he joked.                                        

                                            As Fox continued, his tone turned serious. "There are people that are giving everything, that have lost everything they have and they're struggling to keep their families alive, and to keep food in their mouths and disease away from their bodies -- and at tremendous risk to get here, to this country. And then we say, 'No'?" he continued. "It's an insult on human dignity."                                        

                                            UTA cancelled its Oscars party this year in solidarity with its client, Oscar-nominated Iranian filmmaker Asghar Farhadi, who was temporarily prevented from re-entering the U.S. after President Donald Trump's controversial and much-contested travel ban suspended his visa along with those of people from seven Muslim-majority countries. The ban also temporarily halted the United States' entire refugee resettlement program.                                        

                                            In the wake of the ban, Farhadi announced on Jan. 29 that even if restrictions were lifted, he would not attend the Academy Awards on Feb. 26, where he is nominated for Best Foreign Language Film for The Salesman.

Mike is a member of the firm’s Financial Institutions and Business practices and focuses on structured finance and corporate securities/mergers and acquisitions.

Mike is an experienced securitization/structured finance lawyer who has concentrated in representing sponsors and underwriters in mortgage-backed securitizations (including subprime, Alt A and reverse mortgage loans and small balance commercial loans). He has extensive experience in advising sponsors/servicers as to their obligations under securitization documents to trustees, investors and pool and certificate insurers relating to repurchase demands based on alleged breaches of loan level representations and warranties, requests for access to loan level data and disagreements relating to audit rights and repurchase demands. This experience combined with the four month comprehensive review of the default management practices of a servicer client that he led has given Mike a unique perspective on issues arising during the loan origination process and servicing issues related to subprime and nonperforming mortgage loans. His experience also includes whole loan purchases and sales, agency transactions, purchases and sales of servicing rights and other secondary market mortgage transactions.
Mike has experience in initial public offerings, follow-on public offerings and 1934 Act work on behalf of both issuers and underwriters. He has substantial experience in mergers and acquisitions, institutional financing (private placements of debt and equity, real estate opportunity funds), venture financing (company counsel), representation of start-up and emerging growth companies (primarily technology companies) and general corporate counseling.
Mike was also recently singled out by the highly-regarded Chambers USA legal directory, which annually interviews firm clients. Chambers recognized Mike for conducting a large amount of work for banks, especially regarding loans and mortgage deals with one interviewee stating, “He is unfailingly thorough and prepared, and has great analytical and negotiating skills.”

While most celebrities are busy gearing for Oscar events this weekend, the likes of Jodie Foster, Michael J. Fox and Keegan Michael Key opted to protest in Hollywood over Donald Trump's recent immigration orders.The stars were among 1,200 people to take part in the rally organized by the United Talent Agency on Friday outside its headquarters in Beverly Hills.UTA, one of the world's largest talent agencies, chose to scrap its annual pre-Oscars party in protest at Trump's immigration travel ban and to show its support for freedom of speech and artistic expression.Scroll down for video   





 Jodie Foster was among the celebrities to address the 1,200 deep crowd outside the United Talent Agency  headquarters in Beverly Hills on Friday in protest over Trump's travel ban






Taking to the rally stage, Foster said she's never been comfortable using her public face for activism and has always found the small ways to serve, but that this year is different. 'It's time to show up,' she said. 'It's a singular time in history. It's time to engage. And as the very, very dead Frederick Douglass once said 'any time is a good time for illumination'.''It doesn't matter where you born, who you voted for... All the colors in the identity rainbow - this is our time to resist,' she said.'It is the time to show up and demand answers. It's all of us trying to tell our elected officials to do their job.'The rally also featured speeches from Michael J. Fox and Keegan-Michael Key and performances by DJ Cassidy and rock band the X Ambassadors. Fox, who became a United States citizen some 20 years ago, remembered being annoyed at the 8-year process to citizenship and now wonders what he was complaining about.  





 The rally also featured speeches from Michael J. Fox who spoke of those people who took a risk coming to the United States only to be told they couldn't enter  





 Keegan Michael Key said: 'We have the ability to effect change, to bring people together and to even, sometimes, bring light when there's a whole lot of darkness'  





 Wilmer Valderrama also took part in the rally, which was held on Friday instead of the talent agency's annual pre-Oscars party  





 About 1,200 people rallied outside the talent agency's headquarter in Beverly Hills on Friday'I'm proud to stand here today in support of values and principles that I admire,' Fox told the crowd. 'You have people who have given up everything, who have lost everything they have. They are struggling to keep their families alive and keep food in their mouths and disease away from their bodies and took tremendous risk to get to this country, and we say no?'Key said the event was intended to 'support the creative community's growing concern with anti-immigration sentiment in the United States of America and its potential chilling effect on the global exchange of ideas, not to mention freedom of expression.'

He welcomed all, including a handful of Trump supporters, because he said 'this is America, where you get to believe what you want.'One Trump supporter walked through the crowd in a Make America Great Again hat early on saying 'you're not going to block me.'For the most part, however, the crowd was subdued, civil and attentive to the celebrity speakers.The talent agency organized the nearly two-hour rally in lieu of its annual Oscars party.The Oscar-nominated Iranian filmmaker Asghar Farhadi also spoke via video from Tehran to praise the show of unity among the cinema community.   





 UTA, one of the world's largest talent agencies, chose to scrap its annual pre-Oscars party in protest at Trump's immigration travel ban  





 Wilmer Valderrama was spotted posing for photos among the huge crowd in Beverly Hills  





 A group of children held signs at the United Voices rally in support of immigration rightsFarhadi, who is represented by the agency in Hollywood, previously said he would not travel to Los Angeles for Sunday's ceremony as a result of  Trump's Muslim travel ban.The film's lead actress, Taraneh Alidoosti, is also boycotting the awards event.  'It is comforting to know that at a time when some politicians are trying to promote hate by creating divisions between cultures, religions and nationalities, the cinema community has joined the people in a common show of unity to show its opposition,' Farhadi said. 'I hope this unity will continue and spread to fight other injustices. Filmmakers can break stereotypes around the world by turning their cameras to capture shared human qualities.' UTA previously announced that it was donating $250,000 to the ACLU and the International Rescue Committee and has set up a crowd funding page to solicit more donations. At press time, over $320,000 had been raised.

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Texas:













Does Foster, Michael J carry a valid contracting license?



Only certain types of specialty contractors (e.g. HVAC, electrical) need to be licensed in Texas. There are no licensing requirements when it comes to hiring for a construction or major remodeling project.
Foster, Michael J currently holds license 33807, 237179 (Mn Maintenance Electrician), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Texas?



The Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) regulates HVAC and electrical contractors. You should verify their license status on the TDLR Website before hiring. General contractors and home builders are not licensed so you should do additional research before hiring one.











Your liability risk when hiring Foster, Michael J



Although it isn't a regulatory requirement, you can ask your general contractor to provide evidence of workers' compensation and general liability insurance prior to hiring them. 











Financial recourse when hiring Foster, Michael J



The Texas Department of Licensing Regulation does not require general contractors to carry a surety bond nor is there a state recovery fund.











What else should I know before hiring Foster, Michael J



There is no financial or criminal background check performed on general contractors by the TDLR. The State's Department of Public Safety does maintain a publicly accessible database so you can run your own background check prior to hiring. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



The information on BuildZoom is made available as a public service and should not be considered advertising. We collect client feedback and verify contractors' permitted history with dozens of local building departments in Texas, which saves you time and helps minimize your risk when hiring. 











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Texas Attorney General's office recommends getting several bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free).

The Associated Press 


BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) — As most of Hollywood gears up for the Oscars on Sunday and the whirlwind of events and parties this weekend, celebrities and top talent agents gathered in Beverly Hills to do something a little different: rally for immigration rights.
Jodie Foster, Michael J. Fox and Keegan-Michael Key were among the speakers at Friday’s rally, organized by the United Talent Agency outside their Beverly Hills headquarters. The talent agency, better known as UTA, planned the nearly two-hour United Voices rally in lieu of holding its annual Oscars party. Security officials estimated there were 1,200 people in attendance.
Key, who kicked things off, said the event was intended to “support the creative community’s growing concern with anti-immigration sentiment in the United States of America and its potential chilling effect on the global exchange of ideas, not to mention freedom of expression.”


He welcomed all, including a handful of Trump supporters, because “this is America, where you get to believe what you want.”

For the most part, however, the crowd was subdued, civil and attentive to the celebrity speakers.
Michael J. Fox, who became a United States citizen some 20 years ago, remembered being annoyed at the eight-year process to citizenship and now wonders what he was complaining about.
Turning immigrants away, Fox said, is an “assault on human dignity.”
One of the best-received was Jodie Foster, who enthusiastically yelled, “This is a great idea! Why didn’t I think of this?”
Foster said she’s never been comfortable using her public face for activism and has always found the small ways to serve, but that this year is different.
“It’s time to show up,” she said. “It’s a singular time in history. It’s time to engage. And as the very, very dead Frederick Douglass once said, ‘Any time is a good time for illumination.'”
The Oscar-nominated Iranian filmmaker Asghar Farhadi spoke via video from Tehran to praise the show of unity among the cinema community. Farhadi previously said he would boycott Sunday’s ceremony as a result of President Donald Trump’s travel ban.
“It is comforting to know that at a time when some politicians are trying to promote hate by creating divisions between cultures, religions and nationalities, the cinema community has joined the people in a common show of unity to announce its opposition,” Farhadi said. “I hope this unity will continue and spread to fight other injustices.”
California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, UTA CEO Jeremy Zimmer and Reza Aslan were among the others who took the podium during the event, which also included a DJ set and live performances from the X Ambassadors and Ben Harper.


UTA previously announced that it was donating $250,000 to the ACLU and the International Rescue Committee and has set up a crowd funding page to solicit more donations. It has raised over $320,000.
