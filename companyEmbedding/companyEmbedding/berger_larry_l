Patent number:  7108953
                                            

Abstract:  The invention relates to a photoresist composition comprising a polymeric binder; a photoactive component; and at least one dissolution inhibitor comprising a paraffinic or cycloparaffinic compound containing at least one functional group having the structure —C(Rf)(Rf?)OR wherein Rf and Rf? are the same or different fluoroalkyl groups of from one or taken together are (CF2)a wherein a is an integer ranging from 2 to about 10 and R is a hydrogen atom or an acid labile protecting group. Typically, the dissolution inhibitor has an absorption coefficient of less than about 4.0 ?m at a wavelength of 157 nm.
                        

Type: 
                                                    Grant

Abstract:  A fluorine-containing polymer prepared from at least a spacer group selected from the group consisting of ethylene, alpha-olefins, 1,1?-disubstituted olefins, vinyl alcohols, vinyl ethers, and 1,3-dienes; and a norbornyl radical containing a functional group containing the structure: —C(Rf)(Rf?)Orb wherein Rf and Rf? are the same or different fluoroalkyl groups of from 1 to about 10 carbon atoms or taken together are (CF2)n wherein n is an integer ranging from 2 to about 10 and Rb is a hydrogen atom or an acid- or base-labile protecting group; r is an integer ranging from 0-4. The fluorine-containing polymer has an absorption coefficient of less than 4.0 mm?1 at a wavelength of 157 nm. These polymers are useful in photoresist compositions for microlithography. They exhibit high transparency at this short wavelength and also possess other key properties, including good plasma etch resistance and adhesive properties.

Publication number:  20040013709
                                            

Abstract:  The instant invention is directed to a protective covering for application on livestock feedstuffs to prevent spoilage of the feedstuffs that is also edible by livestock, and includes a nutritive starch source to provide a nutritive aggregate ingredient, a salt to promote stability in a protective solution, a non-protein nitrogen source to act as a surfactant, and cement to promote spraying application of the protective solution formed from the covering. The instant invention is directed to a protective covering that includes a dry mixture, to which a sufficient amount of water is added to form an aqueous solution. The dry mixture includes a nutritive starch source, a salt source, a non-protein nitrogen source such as urea, and cement. Water is added to the dry mixture, resulting in the instant protective solution. The protective solution is then applied to various target surfaces, which include typical livestock feedstuffs such as silage, hay and grain.
