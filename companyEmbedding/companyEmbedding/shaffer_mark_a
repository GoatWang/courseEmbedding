PRINT











Mark is a trial attorney with significant courtroom experience. He has litigated throughout the United States with substantial experience in the state and
federal courts of Virginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia. Mark's familiarity with state and federal court practices enables him to frequently
dispose of claims brought against his clients early on in litigation.


Mark concentrates his litigation practice in eminent domain, construction, commercial litigation, contract disputes, financial services, and
landlord/tenant disputes. He also has significant experience involving business/partnership disputes, land use issues, and trust and estate disputes.
Regarding financial industry litigation, he has defended clients against claims related to the Federal Truth in Lending Act, Telephone Consumer Protection
Act, Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and Fair Credit Reporting Act, as well as various mortgage regulation, consumer protection and business tort laws.


Although he focuses on litigation, Mark has assisted clients on all levels of service, including advice, strategy, litigation and settlement negotiations.
Mark is also routinely called upon to present CLEs and legal seminars to clients on a variety of matters concerning condemnation procedures, land use, and
e-discovery. In 2015, he co-presented a seminar on the best litigation practices for prosecuting and defending asbestos claims at the Environmental
Information Association Annual Conference in Atlanta, Georgia.


Prior to joining McGuireWoods, Mark was a commercial litigator for an international law firm based in Pittsburgh. Before he attained his law degree, Mark
served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps and in the United States Marine Corps Reserves. He deployed twice to Iraq as a platoon sergeant and
platoon commander with the 4th Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion.
