Frequently Asked Questions


We try to anticipate questions you might have about our PRODUCT / SERVICE and provide the answers here. If you need additional information send an email to support@ft-beamray.com or beamray@lycos.com
 







1.

What products do you offer and what is the price?



We have 2 models available.
The Portable unit is $6000. It comes standard with a built in monitor, dual light assembly and fans, light stand, keyboard, instructional DVD and manual. 
The Non-Portable unit is $5000. It comes standard with a dual light assembly and fans, light stand, keyboard, instructional DVD and manual. You will need to supply your own VGA compatible monitor for this model. 
We also sell replacement bulbs for $150 each. 






2.

Does your generator come with frequencies loaded or do I have to do that?



Our units currently come loaded with 301 program listings. They are by name, alphabetically. You simply choose the program you want to run. There is also room for thousands more to be added, should you need/want to.  






3.

Do you have to listen to the volume while running the program?



No. You may turn down the volume and still get the same effect. The sound adjustment knob is there for those who enjoy hearing the frequencies.  






4.

How will I know when I need a new bulb?



When it no longer fully lights the tube or only partially lights. As long as your bulb is fully lit, it is fine. Due to the nature of the gasses, the glass will darken with use, that is perfectly fine and normal, nothing to be concerned about. 






5.

My bulb will not light, do I need a new one?



Possibly. However, first, check to make sure your power knob is turned up. Also, check the fuse in the back of the unit (black spring loaded knob labeled FUSE) to make sure it is not blown.  






6.

Do you ever have updates to the programming available?



Yes. We recommend you call or email our office once a year or so to check on anything new. If we've had an update, we'll be happy to send it to you. This is a service we offer free of charge to our clients. Those who have bought used equipment will only have to pay a small fee. We are currently running software V5.2. You can check the version that you are running by looking at the top and center of your menu screen.






7.

Do I have to be naked to use the unit?



Absolutely NOT. However, while you may wear whatever is comfortable to you, we recommend that you minimize any metal objects such as jewelry or belt buckles.






8.

How close should I be from the bulb?



For a single client, we recommend 3-5 feet away. For each additional client in the session, add an additional 1-2 feet away. For an entire room of clients, simply place the tube holder in the corner of the room to cover the entire space.






9.

Why is the light flashing on certain steps and solid on others?



On steps that are doing a 'sweep' of frequencies, the light will be solid. Steps that have a pulse (jackhammer effect on the target), will blink. Also, frequencies under 60hz, have a natural pulse, so those will also blink. 






10.

Can I run the unit while I sleep at night?



We do not generally recommend running the unit while you sleep. It can interfere with the circadian rhythm, as the body needs that sleeping time to rest and repair. However, everyone has their own preferences and some do use it during sleeping hours. 






11.

Do you sell used equipment or buy back used equipment?



We do not sell used units, however, from time to time we do have refurbished units for sale. We do not buy back used equipment but we can put you on our 'looking to sell' list. We give that list to people who call looking for used units. We also recommend you try selling on Ebay.






12.

My monitor says 'no input signal', what is wrong?



That is an issue with your monitor, it has nothing to do with the Beam Ray. Check to make sure the monitor is snuggly plugged into the back of the Beam Ray.






13.

What is the turn around time for repairs? 



On average, 10-14 business days.






14.

 What is the warranty on the unit and bulbs?



Our units come with a standard warranty: 1 year parts and 90 days labor. The bulbs are guaranteed for 6 months from purchase date.
 






15.

What forms of payment do you accept?



We accept Visa, MasterCard, Discover, PayPal or you can mail a Cashier/Certified Check.

Important Information



  All sales on house plans and customization/modifications are final. No refunds or exchanges can be given once your order has started the fulfillment process.


  All house plans from Houseplans are designed to conform to the local codes when and where the original house was constructed.


  In addition to the house plans you order, you may also need a site plan that shows where the house is going to be located on the property. You might also need beams sized to accommodate roof loads specific to your region. Your home builder can usually help you with this. You may also need a septic design unless your lot is served by a sanitary sewer system. Many areas now have area-specific energy codes that also have to be followed. This normally involves filling out a simple form providing documentation that your house plans are in compliance.


  In some regions, there is a second step you will need to take to insure your house plans are in compliance with local codes. Some areas of North America have very strict engineering requirements. Examples of this would be, but not limited to, earthquake-prone areas of California and the Pacific Coast, hurricane risk areas of the Florida, Gulf & Carolina Coasts. New York, New Jersey, Nevada, and parts of Illinois require review by a local professional as well. If you are building in these areas, it is most likely you will need to hire a state licensed structural engineer to analyze the design and provide additional drawings and calculations required by your building department. If you aren’t sure, building departments typically have a handout they will give you listing all of the items they require to submit for and obtain a building permit.


  Additionally, stock plans do not have a professional stamp attached. If your building department requires one, they will only accept a stamp from a professional licensed in the state where you plan to build. In this case, you will need to take your house plans to a local engineer or architect for review and stamping. In addition, plans which are used to construct homes in Nevada are required to be drawn by a licensed Nevada architect.

Best Price Policy



  Some of our plans are also available on other websites and in printed catalogs. We are committed to selling these plans at or below the lowest price available elsewhere. If you find a regularly priced plan (not “on-sale”) for a lower price, we'll beat the advertised price by 5%. We will match the price for any on-sale plans.


  Once our staff is able to verify that the same plan is offered at a lower published price, Houseplans will offer the plan for sale at the lower published price less 5%. Our discount is available for immediate plan purchase only. Please call us at 1-800-913-2350.


  The advertised item must be the same plan as the product being purchased, including set type (5-copy, 8-copy, Reproducible, or CAD Set), foundation options, and any miscellaneous details. Advertised prices must be in the same currency that the original product was purchased in. Our Price Guarantee does not apply to advertising errors or misprints, special prices, restricted offers, mail order offers, rebates, coupons, premiums, free or bonus offers, OEM products, limited or minimum quantity or limited time offers, close-outs, liquidations, clearances, and special financing offers.


  Full sets of plans only, such as PDF, 5-copy, 8-copy, Reproducible, or CAD, are eligible for this offer. 1-copy Sets, Study Sets, Additional Sets, Materials Lists are not eligible for this offer.
