FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Solar Energy


Solar energy is providing a significant form of clean renewable energy for the future. Solar 
thermal power plants are becoming cost-effective renewable power technologies and are expected 
to have increased emphasis as this technology develops.
Solar energy can be converted to electricity in two ways:

 Solar Thermal Power Plants generate electricity when heat from solar thermal collectors is used to heat a fluid which produces steam that is used to produce electric power. 

Photovoltaic (PV devices) or “solar cells” – change sunlight directly into electricity. PV systems can be residential or large scale generating stations, and may be used in remote locations not connected to an electric grid.


Thermon has a full range of heat trace technologies and engineering expertise to provide the heating requirements for any solar related application.
Solar Thermal Power

Solar thermal power concentrates heat from the sun. The concentrated solar power heats oil which is used to produce steam. 


         Oil is heated to 75°C (167°F) in the piping before being heated by the gathered solar energy to produce steam. 
Recommended heat trace system: Thermon MIQ mineral insulated heating cable. 

        Molten salt needs to be maintained at 220°C (428°F) to keep it from solidifying. 
Recommended heat trace system: Thermon MIQ mineral insulated heating cable.

         Freeze protection is required on all steam and cooling water piping.
Recommended heat trace system: Thermon BSX self-regulating heating cable for the cooling water and 
Thermon MIQ for the steam and condensate lines. 


Photovoltaic

Photovoltaic cells directly convert sunlight into electricity. Electrons in the cells become excited when they are struck by sunlight, generating DC power which is converted into AC power for distribution. 

          Photovoltaic cells are produced from raw material called polysilicon. Polysilicon production plants use water for cooling along with other chemicals to control by products. 
Recommended heat trace system: Thermon BSX self-regulating heating cable for freeze protection of the water piping and 
HTSX for process temperature maintenance.

               Thermon expands our line of High Performance HTSX self-regulating heating cable
               

               We have raised the maintenance temperature of the world's best monolithic coextruded self-regulating heating cable from 250°F (121°C) to 302°F (150°C) and at the same time raised the intermittent exposure temperature (power on or off) to 482°F (250°C).  
               HTSX has the highest temperature ratings in the industry for a monolithic coextruded self-regulating heating cable.

               Thermon expands our line of ThermTrac skin effect trace heating cables
               

               We have raised the maintenance temperature from 90°C (194°F) to 110°C (230°F) and raised the maximum exposure temperature (power off) to 150°C (302°F).  
               The modified XLPE of ThermTrac-XR has up to 10X the corona/partial discharge resistance as the old XLPE.  This is critical to maintain the reliability our customers have depended on for years when the cable is operating at voltages up to 5,000Vac.
