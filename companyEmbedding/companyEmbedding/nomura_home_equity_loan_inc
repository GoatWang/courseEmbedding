                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Term Snapshot 

This Week at the Court The court is now on its summer recess. The justices will meet next for their September 25 conference.

Recent Decisions Davila v. DavisThe ineffective assistance of postconviction counsel does not provide cause to excuse the procedural default of ineffective-assistance-of-appellate-counsel claims.California Public Employees' Retirement System v. ANZ Securities, Inc.The public pension fund's untimely filing of its individual complaint under Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933 more than three years after the relevant securities offering is ground for dismissal under Section 13 of the act.Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. ComerThe Missouri Department of Natural Resources' express policy of denying grants to any applicant owned or controlled by a church, sect or other religious entity violated the rights of Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc., under the free exercise clause of the First Amendment by denying the church an otherwise available public benefit on account of its religious status.Hernández v. Mesa(1) A Bivens remedy is not available when there are "special factors counselling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by Congress," and the court recently clarified in Ziglar v. Abbasi what constitutes a special factor counselling hesitation; the court of appeals should consider how the reasoning and analysis in Ziglar bear on the question whether the parents of a victim shot by a U.S. Border Patrol agent may recover damages for his death; (2) It would be imprudent for the Supreme Court to decide Jesus Hernandez’s Fourth Amendment claim when, in light of the intervening guidance provided in Abbasi, doing so may be unnecessary to resolve this particular case; and (3) with respect to Hernandez’s Fifth Amendment claim, because it is undisputed that the victim's nationality and the extent of his ties to the United States were unknown to the agent at the time of the shooting, the en banc court of appeals erred in granting qualified immunity based on those facts.see all this Term’s cases »

Nomura Home Equity Loan, Inc. Key Developments

Nomura Asset Acceptance Corporation and Nomura Home Equity Loan, Inc. Agree to Pay More Than $3 Million to Settle Claims with the NCUA
Nov 2 16
Nomura Asset Acceptance Corporation and Nomura Home Equity Loan, Inc. have agreed to pay more than $3 million to settle claims with the NCUA in connection with the sale of faulty residential mortgage-backed securities to two corporate credit unions. The settlement covers claims the NCUA board made in 2011 as the liquidation agent for the Western Corporate Federal Credit Union and U.S. Central Federal Credit Union. NCUA filed suit against the Nomura companies and will now dismiss those suits. Neither firm admitted fault as part of the settlement agreement. NCUA still has litigation pending against other financial institutions, including Credit Suisse and UBS Securities and against various residential mortgage-backed securities trustees and LIBOR banks related to corporate credit union losses.
