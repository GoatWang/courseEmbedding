The fund targets investments in energy stocks world wide to capture the emerging mega cycle in energy, where the increase in demand for oil might surpass supply of oil shortly unless huge investments are allocated to the sector.

Company Description


DNB AM is a GARP-oriented, occasionally contrarian investment manager which uses both active and passive investment processes to invest globally in a variety of asset classes including equity, debt, money market instruments, commodities and alternative investments.  They invest across market-caps and sectors, with the bulk of their assets in Norwegian blue chip equity. Research is shared with fellow asset management subsidiaries, in particular through a global program of company visits. Tactical asset allocation is based on a proprietary scenario-generating model developed jointly with academics.The firm's investment approach for fixed-income and money market instruments takes into accounts short-term trends and long-term strategy. Index funds are geared towards maximal cost effectiveness. Actively managed portfolios are diversified, uncorrelated and favor liquid markets. They use disciplined review and exit processes including stop-losses.Their equity investment process is top-down and consists of stock picking informed by market trend analysis and a macroeconomic view. The firm seeks to identify turning points in the evolution of key indicators. They manage diversified and uncorrelated equity portfolios and aim to invest in companies outperforming their peers on a global level. Their alternative portfolios are invested in equity following a long/short strategy.
