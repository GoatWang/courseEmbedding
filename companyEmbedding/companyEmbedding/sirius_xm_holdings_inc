(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  All amounts referenced in this Item 2 are in thousands, except per subscriber and per installation amounts, unless otherwise stated.  Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements The following cautionary statements identify important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in other reports and documents published by us from time to time. Any statements about our beliefs, plans, objectives, expectations, assumptions, future events or performance are not historical facts and may be forward-looking. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as "will likely result," "are expected to," "will continue," "is anticipated," "estimated," "intend," "plan," "projection" and "outlook." Any forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the factors discussed throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in other reports and documents published by us from time to time, particularly the risk factors described under "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" herein and in Part II, Item 7, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.  Among the significant factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements are:   our ability to attract and retain subscribers in the future is uncertain;   our service may experience harmful interference from new wireless operations;   consumer protection laws and their enforcement could damage our business;   the unfavorable outcome of pending or future litigation could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial condition;   the market for music rights is changing and is subject to significant uncertainties;   our business depends in large part upon the auto industry;   general economic conditions can affect our business;   if we fail to protect the security of personal information about our customers, we could be subject to costly government enforcement actions and private litigation and our reputation could suffer;   existing or future government laws and regulations could harm our business;   failure of our satellites would significantly damage our business;   interruption or failure of our information technology and communications systems could negatively impact our results and our brand;   we may not realize the benefits of acquisitions or other strategic investments and initiatives;   rapid technological and industry changes could adversely impact our services;   failure of third parties to perform could adversely affect our business;   failure to comply with FCC requirements could damage our business;  Table of Contents   we may from time to time modify our business plan, and these changes could adversely affect us and our financial condition;   we have a significant amount of indebtedness, and our debt contains certain covenants that restrict our operations;   our studios, terrestrial repeater networks, satellite uplink facilities or other ground facilities could be damaged by natural catastrophes or terrorist activities;   our principal stockholder has significant influence, including over actions requiring stockholder approval, and its interests may differ from the interests of other holders of our common stock;   we are a "controlled company" within the meaning of the NASDAQ listing rules and, as a result, qualify for, and rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements;   our business may be impaired by third-party intellectual property rights; and   while we currently pay a quarterly cash dividend to holders of our common stock, we may change our dividend policy at any time.  Because the risk factors referred to above could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf, you should not place undue reliance on any of these forward-looking statements. In addition, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement or statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made, to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events or otherwise, except as required by law. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict which will arise or to assess with any precision the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.  Executive Summary  Table of Contents  As of June 30, 2017, Liberty Media beneficially owned, directly and indirectly, approximately 68% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. As a result, we are a "controlled company" for the purposes of the NASDAQ corporate governance requirements. Liberty Media owns interests in a range of media, communications and entertainment businesses.  Recent Transactions  During the three months ended June 30, 2017, we entered into several strategic transactions.  Acquisition of Automatic Labs. On April 18, 2017, Sirius XM acquired Automatic Labs Inc. ("Automatic"), a connected vehicle device and mobile application company, for an aggregate purchase price of $107,488, net of cash and restricted cash acquired. Automatic is included in connected vehicle services.  Recapitalization of Sirius XM Canada. On May 25, 2017, Sirius XM completed a recapitalization (the "Transaction") of Sirius XM Canada Holdings Inc. ("Sirius XM Canada"), which is now a privately held corporation.  Following the Transaction, Sirius XM holds a 70% equity interest and 33% voting interest in Sirius XM Canada, with the remainder of the voting power and equity interest held by two of Sirius XM Canada's previous shareholders. The total consideration from Sirius XM to Sirius XM Canada, excluding transaction costs, during the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 was $308,526, which included $129,676 in cash and we issued 35,000 shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of $178,850 to the holders of the shares of Sirius XM Canada acquired in the Transaction. Sirius XM received common stock, non-voting common stock and preferred stock of Sirius XM Canada. Sirius XM now owns a total of 590,950 shares of preferred stock of Sirius XM Canada, which has a liquidation preference of one Canadian dollar per share. Future dividends on the common stock of Sirius XM Canada are expected to be declared on a 6.0% annual basis.  In connection with the Transaction, Sirius XM also made a contribution in the form of a loan to Sirius XM Canada in the aggregate amount of $130,794 on May 25, 2017. The loan is denominated in Canadian dollars and is considered a long-term investment with any unrealized gains or losses reported within Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income. Such loan has a term of fifteen years, bears interest at a rate of 7.62% per annum and includes customary covenants and events of default, including an event of default relating to Sirius XM Canada's failure to maintain specified leverage ratios. In addition, the terms of the loan require Sirius XM Canada to prepay a portion of the outstanding principal amount of the loan within sixty days of the end of each fiscal year in an amount equal to any cash on hand in excess of C$10,000 at the last day of the financial year if all target dividends have been paid in full.  In connection with the Transaction, Sirius XM also entered into a Services Agreement and an Advisory Services Agreement with Sirius XM Canada. Each agreement has a thirty year term. Pursuant to the Services Agreement, Sirius XM Canada will pay Sirius XM 25% of its gross revenues on a monthly basis through December 31, 2021 and 30% of its gross revenues on a monthly basis thereafter. Pursuant to the Advisory Services Agreement, Sirius XM Canada will pay Sirius XM 5% of its gross revenues on a monthly basis. These agreements supersede and replace the existing agreements between Sirius XM Canada and its predecessors and Sirius XM.  Sirius XM Canada is accounted for as an equity method investment, and its results are not consolidated in our consolidated financial statements. As we do not have the ability to direct the most significant activities that impact Sirius XM Canada's economic performance, we do not meet the requirements for consolidation.  Investment in Pandora Media, Inc. On June 9, 2017, Sirius XM entered into an agreement to purchase a 19% interest, or approximately 16% on an as converted basis, in Pandora Media, Inc. ("Pandora") for $480,000. Pandora operates an internet-based music discovery platform, offering a personalized experience for listeners.  The Investment Agreement with Pandora relates to the issuance and sale of 480 shares of Pandora's Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the "Series A Preferred Stock"), for an aggregate purchase price of $480,000, or one thousand dollars per share. In accordance with the Investment Agreement, Sirius XM purchased 172.5 shares of Series A Preferred Stock on June 9, 2017 for $172,500 (the "Initial Closing"), and will purchase the remaining 307.5 shares for $307,500 at a future date (the "Additional Closing"), subject to satisfaction of certain customary closing conditions, including, among others, obtaining clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.  Beginning on the date of the Additional Closing (or if the Investment Agreement is terminated prior to the Additional Closing, the date of such termination), the Series A Preferred Stock is convertible at the option of the holders at any time into shares of common stock of Pandora ("Pandora Common Stock") at an initial conversion price of $10.50 per share of Pandora Common Stock and an initial conversion rate of 95.2381 shares of Pandora Common Stock per share of Series A Preferred  Table of Contents  Stock, subject to certain customary anti-dilution adjustments. Holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to a cumulative dividend at the rate of 6.0% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears, if and when declared. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, we recognized $604 related to the dividend which was recorded to Other (expense) income in our unaudited consolidated statements of comprehensive income and Long-term investment within our unaudited consolidated balance sheets. Any conversion of Series A Preferred Stock may be settled by Pandora, at its option, in shares of Pandora Common Stock, cash or any combination thereof. However, unless and until Pandora's stockholders have approved the issuance of greater than 19.99% of the outstanding Pandora Common Stock, the Series A Preferred Stock may not be converted into more than 19.99% of Pandora's outstanding Pandora Common Stock as of the Initial Closing.  The investment includes a mandatory redemption feature on any date after the fifth anniversary of the Additional Closing (or, if the Additional Closing does not occur, the fifth anniversary of the Initial Closing) at 100% of the liquidation preference plus accrued and unpaid dividends and therefore the investment qualifies as a debt security under ASC 320. As the investment will include a conversion option upon the Additional Closing, we have elected to account for this investment under the fair value option to reduce the accounting asymmetry that would otherwise arise when recognizing the changes in the fair value of available-for-sale investments. Under the fair value option, any gains (losses) associated with the change in fair value will be recognized in Other (expense) income within our unaudited consolidated statements of comprehensive income. There was no gain or loss recognized during the three or six months ended June 30, 2017 associated with this investment.  Pursuant to the Investment Agreement, upon the Additional Closing, Pandora has agreed to appoint three individuals, including the Chairman, to be designated by us to Pandora's board of directors. Once this occurs, we will reclassify the investment to related parties.  Our right to designate directors will fall away once we and our affiliates fail to beneficially own shares of Series A Preferred Stock and/or Pandora Common Stock issued upon conversion thereof equal to (on an as-converted basis) at least 50% of the number of shares of Pandora Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock purchased under the Investment Agreement. Following the earlier to occur of (i) the second anniversary of the Additional Closing and (ii) the date on which we and our affiliates fail to beneficially own shares of Series A Preferred Stock and/or Pandora Common Stock that were issued upon conversion of Series A Preferred Stock equal to (on an as-converted basis) at least 75% of the number of shares of Pandora Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock purchased under the Investment Agreement, we have the right to designate only two directors.  We are subject to certain standstill restrictions, including, among other things, that we are restricted from acquiring additional securities of Pandora for eighteen months after the Initial Closing.  The Investment Agreement may be terminated by either party if the Additional Closing has not occurred by February 1, 2018, subject to extension in certain circumstances. However, if all applicable closing conditions have been satisfied as of such date other than with respect to the expiration or early termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, such termination date will be extended for an additional 60 days.  Beginning on the date of the Additional Closing, we are entitled to vote as a single class with the holders of Pandora Common Stock on an as-converted basis (up to a maximum of 19.99% of the Pandora Common Stock outstanding on the date of the Initial Closing, unless stockholder approval has been received). Effective as of the date of the Initial Closing, we are also entitled to a separate class vote with respect to certain amendments to Pandora's organizational documents, issuances by Pandora of securities that are senior to, or equal in priority with, the Series A Preferred Stock and the incurrence of certain indebtedness by Pandora.  Upon certain change of control events involving Pandora, Pandora is required to repurchase all of the Series A Preferred Stock at a price equal to the greater of (1) an amount in cash equal to 100% of the liquidation preference thereof plus all accrued but unpaid dividends through the fifth anniversary of the Initial Closing (assuming such shares of Series A Preferred Stock remain outstanding through such date) and (2) the consideration the holders would have received if they had converted their shares of Series A Preferred Stock into Pandora Common Stock immediately prior to the change of control event (disregarding the 19.99% cap).

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  All amounts referenced in this Item 2 are in thousands, except per subscriber and per installation amounts, unless otherwise stated.  Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements The following cautionary statements identify important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in other reports and documents published by us from time to time. Any statements about our beliefs, plans, objectives, expectations, assumptions, future events or performance are not historical facts and may be forward-looking. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as "will likely result," "are expected to," "will continue," "is anticipated," "estimated," "intend," "plan," "projection" and "outlook." Any forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the factors discussed throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in other reports and documents published by us from time to time, particularly the risk factors described under "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" herein and in Part II, Item 7, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.  Among the significant factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements are:   our ability to attract and retain subscribers in the future is uncertain;   our service may experience harmful interference from new wireless operations;   consumer protection laws and their enforcement could damage our business;   the unfavorable outcome of pending or future litigation could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial condition;   the market for music rights is changing and is subject to significant uncertainties;   our business depends in large part upon the auto industry;   general economic conditions can affect our business;   if we fail to protect the security of personal information about our customers, we could be subject to costly government enforcement actions and private litigation and our reputation could suffer;   existing or future government laws and regulations could harm our business;   failure of our satellites would significantly damage our business;   interruption or failure of our information technology and communications systems could negatively impact our results and our brand;   we may not realize the benefits of acquisitions or other strategic investments and initiatives;   rapid technological and industry changes could adversely impact our services;   failure of third parties to perform could adversely affect our business;   failure to comply with FCC requirements could damage our business;  Table of Contents   we may from time to time modify our business plan, and these changes could adversely affect us and our financial condition;   we have a significant amount of indebtedness, and our debt contains certain covenants that restrict our operations;   our studios, terrestrial repeater networks, satellite uplink facilities or other ground facilities could be damaged by natural catastrophes or terrorist activities;   our principal stockholder has significant influence, including over actions requiring stockholder approval, and its interests may differ from the interests of other holders of our common stock;   we are a "controlled company" within the meaning of the NASDAQ listing rules and, as a result, qualify for, and rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements;   our business may be impaired by third-party intellectual property rights; and   while we currently pay a quarterly cash dividend to holders of our common stock, we may change our dividend policy at any time.  Because the risk factors referred to above could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf, you should not place undue reliance on any of these forward-looking statements. In addition, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement or statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made, to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events or otherwise, except as required by law. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict which will arise or to assess with any precision the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.  Executive Summary  Table of Contents  As of June 30, 2017, Liberty Media beneficially owned, directly and indirectly, approximately 68% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. As a result, we are a "controlled company" for the purposes of the NASDAQ corporate governance requirements. Liberty Media owns interests in a range of media, communications and entertainment businesses.  Recent Transactions  During the three months ended June 30, 2017, we entered into several strategic transactions.  Acquisition of Automatic Labs. On April 18, 2017, Sirius XM acquired Automatic Labs Inc. ("Automatic"), a connected vehicle device and mobile application company, for an aggregate purchase price of $107,488, net of cash and restricted cash acquired. Automatic is included in connected vehicle services.  Recapitalization of Sirius XM Canada. On May 25, 2017, Sirius XM completed a recapitalization (the "Transaction") of Sirius XM Canada Holdings Inc. ("Sirius XM Canada"), which is now a privately held corporation.  Following the Transaction, Sirius XM holds a 70% equity interest and 33% voting interest in Sirius XM Canada, with the remainder of the voting power and equity interest held by two of Sirius XM Canada's previous shareholders. The total consideration from Sirius XM to Sirius XM Canada, excluding transaction costs, during the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 was $308,526, which included $129,676 in cash and we issued 35,000 shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of $178,850 to the holders of the shares of Sirius XM Canada acquired in the Transaction. Sirius XM received common stock, non-voting common stock and preferred stock of Sirius XM Canada. Sirius XM now owns a total of 590,950 shares of preferred stock of Sirius XM Canada, which has a liquidation preference of one Canadian dollar per share. Future dividends on the common stock of Sirius XM Canada are expected to be declared on a 6.0% annual basis.  In connection with the Transaction, Sirius XM also made a contribution in the form of a loan to Sirius XM Canada in the aggregate amount of $130,794 on May 25, 2017. The loan is denominated in Canadian dollars and is considered a long-term investment with any unrealized gains or losses reported within Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income. Such loan has a term of fifteen years, bears interest at a rate of 7.62% per annum and includes customary covenants and events of default, including an event of default relating to Sirius XM Canada's failure to maintain specified leverage ratios. In addition, the terms of the loan require Sirius XM Canada to prepay a portion of the outstanding principal amount of the loan within sixty days of the end of each fiscal year in an amount equal to any cash on hand in excess of C$10,000 at the last day of the financial year if all target dividends have been paid in full.  In connection with the Transaction, Sirius XM also entered into a Services Agreement and an Advisory Services Agreement with Sirius XM Canada. Each agreement has a thirty year term. Pursuant to the Services Agreement, Sirius XM Canada will pay Sirius XM 25% of its gross revenues on a monthly basis through December 31, 2021 and 30% of its gross revenues on a monthly basis thereafter. Pursuant to the Advisory Services Agreement, Sirius XM Canada will pay Sirius XM 5% of its gross revenues on a monthly basis. These agreements supersede and replace the existing agreements between Sirius XM Canada and its predecessors and Sirius XM.  Sirius XM Canada is accounted for as an equity method investment, and its results are not consolidated in our consolidated financial statements. As we do not have the ability to direct the most significant activities that impact Sirius XM Canada's economic performance, we do not meet the requirements for consolidation.  Investment in Pandora Media, Inc. On June 9, 2017, Sirius XM entered into an agreement to purchase a 19% interest, or approximately 16% on an as converted basis, in Pandora Media, Inc. ("Pandora") for $480,000. Pandora operates an internet-based music discovery platform, offering a personalized experience for listeners.  The Investment Agreement with Pandora relates to the issuance and sale of 480 shares of Pandora's Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the "Series A Preferred Stock"), for an aggregate purchase price of $480,000, or one thousand dollars per share. In accordance with the Investment Agreement, Sirius XM purchased 172.5 shares of Series A Preferred Stock on June 9, 2017 for $172,500 (the "Initial Closing"), and will purchase the remaining 307.5 shares for $307,500 at a future date (the "Additional Closing"), subject to satisfaction of certain customary closing conditions, including, among others, obtaining clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.  Beginning on the date of the Additional Closing (or if the Investment Agreement is terminated prior to the Additional Closing, the date of such termination), the Series A Preferred Stock is convertible at the option of the holders at any time into shares of common stock of Pandora ("Pandora Common Stock") at an initial conversion price of $10.50 per share of Pandora Common Stock and an initial conversion rate of 95.2381 shares of Pandora Common Stock per share of Series A Preferred  Table of Contents  Stock, subject to certain customary anti-dilution adjustments. Holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to a cumulative dividend at the rate of 6.0% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears, if and when declared. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, we recognized $604 related to the dividend which was recorded to Other (expense) income in our unaudited consolidated statements of comprehensive income and Long-term investment within our unaudited consolidated balance sheets. Any conversion of Series A Preferred Stock may be settled by Pandora, at its option, in shares of Pandora Common Stock, cash or any combination thereof. However, unless and until Pandora's stockholders have approved the issuance of greater than 19.99% of the outstanding Pandora Common Stock, the Series A Preferred Stock may not be converted into more than 19.99% of Pandora's outstanding Pandora Common Stock as of the Initial Closing.  The investment includes a mandatory redemption feature on any date after the fifth anniversary of the Additional Closing (or, if the Additional Closing does not occur, the fifth anniversary of the Initial Closing) at 100% of the liquidation preference plus accrued and unpaid dividends and therefore the investment qualifies as a debt security under ASC 320. As the investment will include a conversion option upon the Additional Closing, we have elected to account for this investment under the fair value option to reduce the accounting asymmetry that would otherwise arise when recognizing the changes in the fair value of available-for-sale investments. Under the fair value option, any gains (losses) associated with the change in fair value will be recognized in Other (expense) income within our unaudited consolidated statements of comprehensive income. There was no gain or loss recognized during the three or six months ended June 30, 2017 associated with this investment.  Pursuant to the Investment Agreement, upon the Additional Closing, Pandora has agreed to appoint three individuals, including the Chairman, to be designated by us to Pandora's board of directors. Once this occurs, we will reclassify the investment to related parties.  Our right to designate directors will fall away once we and our affiliates fail to beneficially own shares of Series A Preferred Stock and/or Pandora Common Stock issued upon conversion thereof equal to (on an as-converted basis) at least 50% of the number of shares of Pandora Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock purchased under the Investment Agreement. Following the earlier to occur of (i) the second anniversary of the Additional Closing and (ii) the date on which we and our affiliates fail to beneficially own shares of Series A Preferred Stock and/or Pandora Common Stock that were issued upon conversion of Series A Preferred Stock equal to (on an as-converted basis) at least 75% of the number of shares of Pandora Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock purchased under the Investment Agreement, we have the right to designate only two directors.  We are subject to certain standstill restrictions, including, among other things, that we are restricted from acquiring additional securities of Pandora for eighteen months after the Initial Closing.  The Investment Agreement may be terminated by either party if the Additional Closing has not occurred by February 1, 2018, subject to extension in certain circumstances. However, if all applicable closing conditions have been satisfied as of such date other than with respect to the expiration or early termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, such termination date will be extended for an additional 60 days.  Beginning on the date of the Additional Closing, we are entitled to vote as a single class with the holders of Pandora Common Stock on an as-converted basis (up to a maximum of 19.99% of the Pandora Common Stock outstanding on the date of the Initial Closing, unless stockholder approval has been received). Effective as of the date of the Initial Closing, we are also entitled to a separate class vote with respect to certain amendments to Pandora's organizational documents, issuances by Pandora of securities that are senior to, or equal in priority with, the Series A Preferred Stock and the incurrence of certain indebtedness by Pandora.  Upon certain change of control events involving Pandora, Pandora is required to repurchase all of the Series A Preferred Stock at a price equal to the greater of (1) an amount in cash equal to 100% of the liquidation preference thereof plus all accrued but unpaid dividends through the fifth anniversary of the Initial Closing (assuming such shares of Series A Preferred Stock remain outstanding through such date) and (2) the consideration the holders would have received if they had converted their shares of Series A Preferred Stock into Pandora Common Stock immediately prior to the change of control event (disregarding the 19.99% cap).  Beginning (i) after the third anniversary of the date of the Additional Closing (or, if the Additional Closing does not occur, the third anniversary of the Initial Closing) or (ii) after the Investment Agreement is terminated prior to the Additional Closing, if the volume weighted average price per share of Pandora Common Stock exceeds $18.375, as may be adjusted, for at least 20 trading days in any period of 30 consecutive trading days, Pandora may redeem all of the outstanding Series A Preferred Stock at 100% of the liquidation preference thereof plus all accrued but unpaid dividends for, at the election of  Table of Contents  Pandora, cash, shares of Pandora Common Stock or a combination thereof, provided that Pandora may not settle the redemption for shares of Pandora Common Stock to the extent the 19.99% cap would be exceeded.  Pursuant to a registration rights agreement entered into with Pandora, we have certain customary registration rights with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock and Pandora Common Stock issued upon conversion thereof.

Sirius XM Satellite Radio is an American broadcasting company that provides three satellite radio and online radio services operating in the United States: Sirius Satellite Radio, XM Satellite Radio, and Sirius XM Radio. The company also has a major investment in Canada called SiriusXM Canada, an affiliate company that provides Sirius and XM service in Canada. At the end of 2013, Sirius reorganized their corporate structure, which made Sirius XM Radio Inc. a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Sirius XM Holdings, Inc.[3]
Sirius XM Radio was formed after the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved the acquisition of XM Satellite Radio Holding, Inc. by Sirius Satellite Radio, Inc. on July 29, 2008, 17 months after the companies first proposed the merger.[4] The merger brought the combined companies a total of more than 18.5 million subscribers based on current subscriber numbers on the date of merging.[4] The deal was valued at $3.3 billion, not including debt.[5] Through Q3 2016, Sirius XM has 31 million subscribers.[6]
The proposed merger was opposed by those who felt a merger would create a monopoly. Sirius and XM argued that a merger was the only way that satellite radio could survive.[5]

Pre-merger[edit]
Early days of Sirius[edit]
Main article: Sirius Satellite Radio
Sirius Satellite Radio was founded by Martine Rothblatt, David Margolese, and Robert Briskman.[7][8] In 1990, Rothblatt founded Satellite CD Radio in Washington, DC.[7][9] The company was the first to petition the FCC to assign unused frequencies for satellite radio broadcast, which "provoked a furor among owners of both large and small [terrestrial] radio stations."[9] In April 1992, Rothblatt resigned as chairman and CEO to start a medical research foundation.[7] Former NASA engineer Briskman, who designed the company's satellite technology, was then appointed chairman and CEO.[10][11] Six months later, in November 1992, Rogers Wireless co-founder Margolese, who had provided financial backing for the venture, acquired control of the company and succeeded Briskman. Margolese renamed the company CD Radio, and spent the next five years lobbying the FCC to allow satellite radio to be deployed, and the following five years raising $1.6 billion, which was used to build and launch three satellites into elliptical orbit from Kazakhstan in July 2000.[11][12][13][14] In 1997, after Margolese had obtained regulatory clearance and "effectively created the industry," the FCC also sold a license to XM Satellite Radio, which followed Sirius' example.[15] In November 1999, marketing chief Ira Bahr convinced Margolese to again change the name of the company,[citation needed] this time to Sirius Satellite Radio, in order to avoid association with the soon-to-be-outdated CD technology.[8] Having secured installation deals with automakers, including BMW, Chrysler and Ford,[14] Sirius launched the initial phase of its service in four cities on February 14, 2002,[16] expanding to the rest of the contiguous United States on July 1, 2002.[17]
In November 2001, Margolese stepped down as CEO, remaining as chairman until November 2003, with Sirius issuing a statement thanking him "for his great vision, leadership and dedication in creating both Sirius and the satellite radio industry."[18] Joe Clayton, former CEO of Global Crossing, followed as CEO from November 2001 until November 2004; stayed on as chairman until July 2008.[19] Mel Karmazin, former president of Viacom, became CEO in November 2004 and remained in that position through the merger, until December 2012.[20][21]
Early days of XM[edit]
Main article: XM Satellite Radio
The origin of XM Satellite Radio was a Petition for Rulemaking filed at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) by regulatory attorney and Founder of Satellite CD Radio Martine Rothblatt, to establish frequencies and licensing rules for the world's first-ever Satellite Digital Audio Radio Service (SDARS).[22][23] On May 18, 1990, Satellite CD Radio, Inc. (SCDR) filed a Petition for Rule Making in which it requested spectrum to offer Compact Disc quality digital audio radio service to be delivered by satellites and complementary radio transmitters.[24] Following the Allocation NPRM, the FCC established a December 15, 1992 cut-off date for applications proposing satellite DARS to be considered in conjunction with CD Radio's application.[25][26] One such application came from American Mobile Radio Corporation (AMRC), the predecessor company to XM Satellite Radio.[27] XM Satellite Radio was founded by Lon Levin and Gary Parsons.[28][29] It has its origins in the 1988 formation of the American Mobile Satellite Corporation (AMSC), a consortium of several organizations originally dedicated to satellite broadcasting of telephone, fax, and data signals.[30] In 1992, AMSC established a unit called the American Mobile Radio Corporation, dedicated to developing a satellite-based digital radio service; this was spun off as XM Satellite Radio Holdings, Inc. in 1998.[31][32] Its planned financing was complete by July 2000, at which point XM had raised $1.26 billion and secured installation agreements with General Motors, Honda, and Toyota.[14][33] Initially scheduled for September 12, 2001, XM's service start date was postponed due to the September 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and The Pentagon.[34] XM Satellite Radio's first broadcast was on September 25, 2001, nearly four months before Sirius.[17]
Gary Parsons served as chairman of XM Satellite Radio from its inception through the merger, and resigned from the position in November 2009.[29] Hugh Panero served as XM's CEO from 1998 until July 2007, shortly after the merger with Sirius was proposed. Nate Davis was appointed interim CEO until the merger was completed, at which point Sirius CEO Mel Karmazin took over as CEO of the newly merged company, Sirius XM.[35]
Merger[edit]



Wikinews has related news: In depth: XM and Sirius merger


Announcement[edit]
After years of speculation (the New York Post first reported on a potential merger in January 2005)[20] and three months of serious negotiations, the $13 billion merger between Sirius and XM was officially announced on February 19, 2007.[36] At the time, the nation's only two satellite radio providers reported nearly 14 million combined subscribers (with nearly 8 million belonging to XM), with neither having turned an annual profit. Sirius was valued at $5.2 billion, and XM at $3.75 billion.[30] Each subscription was sold for $12.95 monthly.[37]
XM and Sirius executives felt the merger would lower programming costs by eliminating overlapping stations and duplicated marketing costs. According to their original operating licenses, the two companies were not allowed to ever own each other's license. In proceeding with the merger, Sirius CEO Mel Karmazin ignored this rule, gambling that the FCC would consider other audio entertainment to be competitors and allow the merger to proceed by waiving the rule.[36][38]
Approval[edit]
After a 57-week review process, the Justice Department approved the Sirius and XM merger on March 24, 2008, concluding that satellite radio competes with terrestrial radio, online streaming, and mp3 players and tablets.[38][39] On July 25, 2008, the FCC approved the merger with a 3–2 vote, determining that it was not a monopoly because of all the competition on the Internet. FCC chairman Kevin Martin stated, "The merger is in the public interest and will provide consumers with greater flexibility and choices."
The biggest challenge for the newly unified company was selling more subscriptions with the drop in the number of cars sold annually in the US, the subsequent reduced demand for cars equipped with satellite radio, as well as online radio-streaming competition. Conditions of the merger included allowing any third-party company to make satellite radio devices; producing new radios that can receive both XM and Sirius channels within one year; allowing consumers to choose which channels they would like to have; freezing subscription rates for three years; setting aside 8% of its channels for noncommercial programmers; and paying $19.7 million in fines for past rule violations.[40][41] Sirius and XM began merging their channels on November 12, 2008.[42]
Each share of XM stock was replaced with 4.6 shares of Sirius stock. Each company's stockholders initially retained approximately 50% of the joined company.[43]
At the time of the merger, Sirius' top programming included channels for NPR, Howard Stern, and Martha Stewart; live NBA and NFL games; and live NASCAR races. XM's programming included channels for Willie Nelson, Opie and Anthony, Snoop Dogg, and Oprah Winfrey; and live Major League Baseball games.[39]
Opposition[edit]
The National Association of Broadcasters was adamantly opposed to the merger, calling it a monopoly.[36] Shortly after the Justice Department gave its support to the merger without restrictions, attorneys general from 11 states (Connecticut, Iowa, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Utah, and Washington) urged the FCC to impose restrictions on the merger.[44] Several Congressional Democrats also opposed the merger, calling it anticompetitive and criticizing the Bush administration for allowing it to go through.[39]
Post-merger[edit]
Resurgence and growth[edit]
After coming close to filing for Chapter 11 only months after the 2008 merger, having gone so far as to hire lawyers to prepare a possible bankruptcy filing,[45] Sirius XM was able to avoid declaring bankruptcy with the assistance of a $530 million loan from Liberty Media in February 2009, which Mel Karmazin negotiated in exchange for a 40% equity stake in Sirius XM.[46][47]
In the fourth quarter of 2009, Sirius XM posted a profit for the first time, with a net income of $14.2 million. This came after net losses of $245.8 million in the year following the merger. The company's resurgence was owed in part to the loan from Liberty Media. Increased automobile sales in the US was also a factor. Sirius XM ended 2009 with 18.8 million subscribers.[46] By the end of 2012, Sirius XM's subscriber base had grown to 23.9 million, mostly due to an increase in partnerships with automakers and car dealers; a strong push in the used-car market; and continued improved car sales in the US in general. The renewal of radio show host Howard Stern's contract through 2015 ($400 million for five years, $100 million less than Stern's previous five-year deal) was also a factor in the company's steady growth; Stern's show attracted over 12 million listeners per week.[47][48]
As of 2012, Sirius XM had a 60% penetration rate in the new car market. Out of that 60%, approximately 45% became subscribers. The company has long-term deals with General Motors, Ford, Toyota, Kia, Bentley, BMW, Volkswagen, Nissan, Hyundai,Suzuki and Mitsubishi,along with assorted trucks, boats and recreational vehicles. As of August 2012, Sirius XM satellite radios were in 50 million cars. The company offers trial subscriptions to new car owners, and then tries to get them to purchase yearly subscriptions. By 2018, Sirius XM predicts over 100 million cars will have Sirius XM radios installed.[48][49]
After trying for four years, on December 21, 2010, Sirius XM received approval from the FCC to add service in Alaska and Hawaii. Sirius XM announced on January 17, 2011 that it would place repeaters in those states and adjust three of its satellites to cover those areas. The move gave Sirius XM coverage in all 50 states.[50]
On January 12, 2011, XM Satellite Radio, Inc. was dissolved as a separate entity and merged into Sirius XM Radio, Inc.[51] On April 11, 2011, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) approved the merger of Sirius and XM's Canadian affiliates in SiriusXM Canada.[52]
On April 11, 2013, a New York appeals court upheld a New York judge's ruling, from April 2012, that Howard Stern was not entitled to stock bonuses based on Sirius XM's exceeding subscriber target projections. The court ruled that subscribers to XM Satellite Radio from before the Sirius XM merger should not be counted as "Sirius subscribers" for the purposes of Stern's lawsuit. Stern argued the opposite, because his popularity had played an integral role in helping Sirius acquire XM. He had been seeking $330 million in stock bonuses.[53][54]
In April 2016, Sirius XM surpassed 30 million total subscribers.[55]
Executives[edit]
Following the merger, Sirius CEO Mel Karmazin became CEO of the combined company, and XM chairman Gary Parsons retained his role.[56] XM CEO and co-founder Hugh Panero stepped down in August 2007, shortly after the merger was first announced.[5]
XM Satellite Radio executives who were not offered jobs in the new combined company were assured golden parachute severance packages that had been approved in 2007. Former CEO Nate Davis received a severance package worth $10 million. Erik Toppenberg, executive vice president of programming, received a severance package worth $5.34 million. CFO Joseph Euteneuer received a severance package worth $4.9 million. Vernon Irvin, chief marketing officer, received a severance package worth $4.5 million.[57]
In November 2009, Parsons resigned as chairman of Sirius XM, receiving a payout of more than $9 million.[29][57] He was succeeded by Eddy Hartenstein, former publisher and CEO of the Los Angeles Times.[29] In December 2012, Mel Karmazin stepped down as Sirius XM CEO after Liberty Media gained control of 49.5% of the company. James E. Meyer was named interim CEO.[58] On April 30, 2013, he was named permanent CEO.[59] Also in April 2013, Liberty Media CEO Greg Maffei was named Sirius XM's chairman, succeeding Hartenstein.[60]
Internet and mobile[edit]
Sirius XM radio content is available to stream online either as an add-on to existing subscriptions or as an Internet-only option.[61] Internet and mobile services directly challenging Sirius XM include iHeartRadio, Pandora, and Spotify.[47]
In August 2011, SiriusXM announced that the company would start offering a personalized interactive online radio experience, similar to that offered by Pandora. The feature would allow listeners to replay, skip, and ban songs on certain channels.[62] MySXM debuted on April 15, 2013, allowing users to fine-tune over 50 existing Sirius XM channels. MySXM is available to all Sirius XM subscribers.[61][63]
On June 17, 2009, Sirius XM released an application for use on Apple's iPhone and iPod Touch, allowing its subscribers to listen to its programming on those devices. The app did not feature all of the programming available to satellite listeners.[64] On March 17, 2011, the app was also made available for the iPad.[65] In 2012, the app was updated for iOS and Android, featuring additional content, and the ability to pause, rewind, and fast-forward through audio streams.[66]




Sirius XM's mobile app (version 3.0), as seen on the iPad Mini


On February 4, 2010, the Sirius XM BlackBerry application was announced, for use on BlackBerry smartphones (the Bold, Curve, Storm, and Tour).[67] As of April 2013, the app featured over 150 channels.[68]
On May 28, 2010, the Sirius XM application for Android smartphones was announced.[69] As of April 2013, the app features over 130 channels.[70]
As part of Howard Stern's new five-year contract with Sirius XM, which he signed on December 9, 2010, The Howard Stern Show, which hadn't previously been made available on mobile devices, would now be a part of Sirius XM's mobile app package.[71]
On March 18, 2015, SiriusXM released a refreshed user interface of the application on Android and iOS.[72]
Subscriptions[edit]
Following the merger, Sirius XM jettisoned the simplicity of previous monthly subscription models and began offering numerous new options, including a la carte offerings, a family-friendly version, and "mostly music" or "news, sports, and talk" packages, ranging in price from $6.99 to $16.99 per month.[73] As of April 2013, almost all music, talk and news programming is available on both Sirius, XM and SiriusXM Internet Radio services.[74]
Prior to the merger, Sirius offered, for a one-time fee, a lifetime subscription (lasting the lifetime of the receiver, not the subscriber).[30] After the merger, due to changes in bundling policies, some customers who had purchased lifetime subscriptions had their service reduced or canceled, and were unable to obtain a refund.[75][76]
Legal settlement[edit]
On December 4, 2014, Sirius XM Holdings agreed to a $3.8 million USD settlement with 45 states and the District of Columbia, over a suit initiated by the Ohio Attorney General, Mike DeWine, stemming from the company's billing and service renewal practices. The suit alleged Sirius XM Holdings was engaged in "misleading, unfair and deceptive acts or practices in violation of state consumer protection laws," Attorney General DeWine said.[77]
Programming[edit]
Main article: List of Sirius XM Radio channels
From the outset, Sirius and XM each attracted celebrity personalities to host shows. Broadminded, Bob Dylan, Tony Hawk, Bam Margera, Opie and Anthony Tom Petty, Ron & Fez, Howard Stern, Martha Stewart, and Oprah Winfrey are among those who signed contracts with one of the two companies. Exclusive sports programming (Major League Soccer, NASCAR, and the Canadian Football League, National Football League, and Premier League on Sirius, and Indy Racing League, Major League Baseball, National Basketball Association, National Hockey League, and PGA Tour on XM) initially differentiated the networks from one another.
Internet[edit]
The internet player allows subscribers to customize most stations to their liking by adjusting settings like: familiar/hits or unfamiliar/depth, studio recordings or live performances, and new/recent or old/classic material. These customized stations also allow listeners to play music without DJ interruptions. Paid subscribers can skip as many tracks as they like and can replay songs.
Canadian counterparts[edit]
Main article: SiriusXM Canada
In Canada, Sirius Canada and XM Canada were partially owned by Sirius XM (20% and 23.3% respectively) in joint ventures with Canadian companies.[78] After the US merger, the two Canadian ventures did not immediately agree to a similar merger, but instead remained in competition as distinct services.[79] Complicating matters was that Sirius Canada has nearly 80% of the total satellite radio subscriber base in that country, and felt they deserved greater than a 50/50 split of the new company, whereas XM Canada felt their deal with the NHL—a particularly lucrative prize in Canadian sports broadcasting—also warranted a significant amount of value in the new company.[79]
On November 24, 2010, XM Radio Canada and Sirius Canada announced that they would merge their services.[80] On April 12, 2011, the CRTC approved the companies' merger into SiriusXM Canada.[81] John Bitove's Canadian Satellite Radio Holdings Inc., the licensee of XM Canada, gained a 30% share in the new company as its primary and controlling shareholder, while Slaight Communications and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the current owners of Sirius Canada, each retained 20% ownership. Sirius XM's American parent company would hold 25%.[52] The merger was completed on June 21, 2011.[82]
Technical[edit]
Receivers[edit]
XM and Sirius use different compression and conditional access systems, making their receivers incompatible with each other's service. A condition of the merger was that Sirius XM would bring to the market satellite radios that can receive both XM and Sirius channels within one year.[41] The interoperable radio, called the MiRGE, was made available beginning in March 2009.[83] but the receiver was soon discontinued after both services eliminated duplicate channels which obviated the need for this radio. As of February 2016[update], Sirius XM offers radios for home, office, automotive, marine, and aviation use.[84]
Satellites[edit]
As of May 2017[update], there are five satellites in orbit: two XM and two Sirius satellites and one spare.[85]XM-3 and XM-4 are the active satellites for the XM service and replaced the original XM-1 and XM-2 satellites which were placed into a disposal orbit. Sirius FM-5 and FM-6 function as the primaries for the Sirius side. FM-6 which was launched on October 25, 2013 and declared ready for service on December 2, 2013 initially served as an in orbit spare while the company worked to deploy repeaters for the Sirius side which were needed to transition to full geostationary operation. In 2016 FM-6 was put into active service and officially replaced Sirius originals FM1-4 which operated in elliptical orbit. FM1-3 were later placed into disposal orbits. With this change FM-5 and FM-6 exclusively serve the Sirius service mirroring XM-3 and 4. Before FM-6 was launched, XM-5 was sent into orbit by Proton from Kazakhstan, on October 14, 2010, and is capable of broadcasting to either service.[86].[87] XM-5 serves as the in orbit spare for the entire system and can function in place of either a Sirius or XM satellite. In late 2016 Sirius XM placed an order for two new satellites SXM-7 and SXM-8 which will replace XM-3 and XM-4. These are scheduled for launch in 2019 and 2020 respectively.
Sirius satellites broadcast within the S band frequencies from 2.3200–2.3325 GHz, while XM radio uses adjacent frequencies 2.3325–2.3450 GHz.[88][89]

Sirius XM Satellite Radio is an American broadcasting company that provides three satellite radio and online radio services operating in the United States: Sirius Satellite Radio, XM Satellite Radio, and Sirius XM Radio. The company also has a major investment in Canada called SiriusXM Canada, an affiliate company that provides Sirius and XM service in Canada. At the end of 2013, Sirius reorganized their corporate structure, which made Sirius XM Radio Inc. a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Sirius XM Holdings, Inc.[3]
Sirius XM Radio was formed after the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved the acquisition of XM Satellite Radio Holding, Inc. by Sirius Satellite Radio, Inc. on July 29, 2008, 17 months after the companies first proposed the merger.[4] The merger brought the combined companies a total of more than 18.5 million subscribers based on current subscriber numbers on the date of merging.[4] The deal was valued at $3.3 billion, not including debt.[5] Through Q3 2016, Sirius XM has 31 million subscribers.[6]
The proposed merger was opposed by those who felt a merger would create a monopoly. Sirius and XM argued that a merger was the only way that satellite radio could survive.[5]

Pre-merger[edit]
Early days of Sirius[edit]
Main article: Sirius Satellite Radio
Sirius Satellite Radio was founded by Martine Rothblatt, David Margolese, and Robert Briskman.[7][8] In 1990, Rothblatt founded Satellite CD Radio in Washington, DC.[7][9] The company was the first to petition the FCC to assign unused frequencies for satellite radio broadcast, which "provoked a furor among owners of both large and small [terrestrial] radio stations."[9] In April 1992, Rothblatt resigned as chairman and CEO to start a medical research foundation.[7] Former NASA engineer Briskman, who designed the company's satellite technology, was then appointed chairman and CEO.[10][11] Six months later, in November 1992, Rogers Wireless co-founder Margolese, who had provided financial backing for the venture, acquired control of the company and succeeded Briskman. Margolese renamed the company CD Radio, and spent the next five years lobbying the FCC to allow satellite radio to be deployed, and the following five years raising $1.6 billion, which was used to build and launch three satellites into elliptical orbit from Kazakhstan in July 2000.[11][12][13][14] In 1997, after Margolese had obtained regulatory clearance and "effectively created the industry," the FCC also sold a license to XM Satellite Radio, which followed Sirius' example.[15] In November 1999, marketing chief Ira Bahr convinced Margolese to again change the name of the company,[citation needed] this time to Sirius Satellite Radio, in order to avoid association with the soon-to-be-outdated CD technology.[8] Having secured installation deals with automakers, including BMW, Chrysler and Ford,[14] Sirius launched the initial phase of its service in four cities on February 14, 2002,[16] expanding to the rest of the contiguous United States on July 1, 2002.[17]
In November 2001, Margolese stepped down as CEO, remaining as chairman until November 2003, with Sirius issuing a statement thanking him "for his great vision, leadership and dedication in creating both Sirius and the satellite radio industry."[18] Joe Clayton, former CEO of Global Crossing, followed as CEO from November 2001 until November 2004; stayed on as chairman until July 2008.[19] Mel Karmazin, former president of Viacom, became CEO in November 2004 and remained in that position through the merger, until December 2012.[20][21]
Early days of XM[edit]
Main article: XM Satellite Radio
The origin of XM Satellite Radio was a Petition for Rulemaking filed at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) by regulatory attorney and Founder of Satellite CD Radio Martine Rothblatt, to establish frequencies and licensing rules for the world's first-ever Satellite Digital Audio Radio Service (SDARS).[22][23] On May 18, 1990, Satellite CD Radio, Inc. (SCDR) filed a Petition for Rule Making in which it requested spectrum to offer Compact Disc quality digital audio radio service to be delivered by satellites and complementary radio transmitters.[24] Following the Allocation NPRM, the FCC established a December 15, 1992 cut-off date for applications proposing satellite DARS to be considered in conjunction with CD Radio's application.[25][26] One such application came from American Mobile Radio Corporation (AMRC), the predecessor company to XM Satellite Radio.[27] XM Satellite Radio was founded by Lon Levin and Gary Parsons.[28][29] It has its origins in the 1988 formation of the American Mobile Satellite Corporation (AMSC), a consortium of several organizations originally dedicated to satellite broadcasting of telephone, fax, and data signals.[30] In 1992, AMSC established a unit called the American Mobile Radio Corporation, dedicated to developing a satellite-based digital radio service; this was spun off as XM Satellite Radio Holdings, Inc. in 1998.[31][32] Its planned financing was complete by July 2000, at which point XM had raised $1.26 billion and secured installation agreements with General Motors, Honda, and Toyota.[14][33] Initially scheduled for September 12, 2001, XM's service start date was postponed due to the September 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and The Pentagon.[34] XM Satellite Radio's first broadcast was on September 25, 2001, nearly four months before Sirius.[17]
Gary Parsons served as chairman of XM Satellite Radio from its inception through the merger, and resigned from the position in November 2009.[29] Hugh Panero served as XM's CEO from 1998 until July 2007, shortly after the merger with Sirius was proposed. Nate Davis was appointed interim CEO until the merger was completed, at which point Sirius CEO Mel Karmazin took over as CEO of the newly merged company, Sirius XM.[35]
Merger[edit]



Wikinews has related news: In depth: XM and Sirius merger


Announcement[edit]
After years of speculation (the New York Post first reported on a potential merger in January 2005)[20] and three months of serious negotiations, the $13 billion merger between Sirius and XM was officially announced on February 19, 2007.[36] At the time, the nation's only two satellite radio providers reported nearly 14 million combined subscribers (with nearly 8 million belonging to XM), with neither having turned an annual profit. Sirius was valued at $5.2 billion, and XM at $3.75 billion.[30] Each subscription was sold for $12.95 monthly.[37]
XM and Sirius executives felt the merger would lower programming costs by eliminating overlapping stations and duplicated marketing costs. According to their original operating licenses, the two companies were not allowed to ever own each other's license. In proceeding with the merger, Sirius CEO Mel Karmazin ignored this rule, gambling that the FCC would consider other audio entertainment to be competitors and allow the merger to proceed by waiving the rule.[36][38]
Approval[edit]
After a 57-week review process, the Justice Department approved the Sirius and XM merger on March 24, 2008, concluding that satellite radio competes with terrestrial radio, online streaming, and mp3 players and tablets.[38][39] On July 25, 2008, the FCC approved the merger with a 3–2 vote, determining that it was not a monopoly because of all the competition on the Internet. FCC chairman Kevin Martin stated, "The merger is in the public interest and will provide consumers with greater flexibility and choices."
The biggest challenge for the newly unified company was selling more subscriptions with the drop in the number of cars sold annually in the US, the subsequent reduced demand for cars equipped with satellite radio, as well as online radio-streaming competition. Conditions of the merger included allowing any third-party company to make satellite radio devices; producing new radios that can receive both XM and Sirius channels within one year; allowing consumers to choose which channels they would like to have; freezing subscription rates for three years; setting aside 8% of its channels for noncommercial programmers; and paying $19.7 million in fines for past rule violations.[40][41] Sirius and XM began merging their channels on November 12, 2008.[42]
Each share of XM stock was replaced with 4.6 shares of Sirius stock. Each company's stockholders initially retained approximately 50% of the joined company.[43]
At the time of the merger, Sirius' top programming included channels for NPR, Howard Stern, and Martha Stewart; live NBA and NFL games; and live NASCAR races. XM's programming included channels for Willie Nelson, Opie and Anthony, Snoop Dogg, and Oprah Winfrey; and live Major League Baseball games.[39]
Opposition[edit]
The National Association of Broadcasters was adamantly opposed to the merger, calling it a monopoly.[36] Shortly after the Justice Department gave its support to the merger without restrictions, attorneys general from 11 states (Connecticut, Iowa, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Utah, and Washington) urged the FCC to impose restrictions on the merger.[44] Several Congressional Democrats also opposed the merger, calling it anticompetitive and criticizing the Bush administration for allowing it to go through.[39]
Post-merger[edit]
Resurgence and growth[edit]
After coming close to filing for Chapter 11 only months after the 2008 merger, having gone so far as to hire lawyers to prepare a possible bankruptcy filing,[45] Sirius XM was able to avoid declaring bankruptcy with the assistance of a $530 million loan from Liberty Media in February 2009, which Mel Karmazin negotiated in exchange for a 40% equity stake in Sirius XM.[46][47]
In the fourth quarter of 2009, Sirius XM posted a profit for the first time, with a net income of $14.2 million. This came after net losses of $245.8 million in the year following the merger. The company's resurgence was owed in part to the loan from Liberty Media. Increased automobile sales in the US was also a factor. Sirius XM ended 2009 with 18.8 million subscribers.[46] By the end of 2012, Sirius XM's subscriber base had grown to 23.9 million, mostly due to an increase in partnerships with automakers and car dealers; a strong push in the used-car market; and continued improved car sales in the US in general. The renewal of radio show host Howard Stern's contract through 2015 ($400 million for five years, $100 million less than Stern's previous five-year deal) was also a factor in the company's steady growth; Stern's show attracted over 12 million listeners per week.[47][48]
As of 2012, Sirius XM had a 60% penetration rate in the new car market. Out of that 60%, approximately 45% became subscribers. The company has long-term deals with General Motors, Ford, Toyota, Kia, Bentley, BMW, Volkswagen, Nissan, Hyundai,Suzuki and Mitsubishi,along with assorted trucks, boats and recreational vehicles. As of August 2012, Sirius XM satellite radios were in 50 million cars. The company offers trial subscriptions to new car owners, and then tries to get them to purchase yearly subscriptions. By 2018, Sirius XM predicts over 100 million cars will have Sirius XM radios installed.[48][49]
After trying for four years, on December 21, 2010, Sirius XM received approval from the FCC to add service in Alaska and Hawaii. Sirius XM announced on January 17, 2011 that it would place repeaters in those states and adjust three of its satellites to cover those areas. The move gave Sirius XM coverage in all 50 states.[50]
On January 12, 2011, XM Satellite Radio, Inc. was dissolved as a separate entity and merged into Sirius XM Radio, Inc.[51] On April 11, 2011, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) approved the merger of Sirius and XM's Canadian affiliates in SiriusXM Canada.[52]
On April 11, 2013, a New York appeals court upheld a New York judge's ruling, from April 2012, that Howard Stern was not entitled to stock bonuses based on Sirius XM's exceeding subscriber target projections. The court ruled that subscribers to XM Satellite Radio from before the Sirius XM merger should not be counted as "Sirius subscribers" for the purposes of Stern's lawsuit. Stern argued the opposite, because his popularity had played an integral role in helping Sirius acquire XM. He had been seeking $330 million in stock bonuses.[53][54]
In April 2016, Sirius XM surpassed 30 million total subscribers.[55]
Executives[edit]
Following the merger, Sirius CEO Mel Karmazin became CEO of the combined company, and XM chairman Gary Parsons retained his role.[56] XM CEO and co-founder Hugh Panero stepped down in August 2007, shortly after the merger was first announced.[5]
XM Satellite Radio executives who were not offered jobs in the new combined company were assured golden parachute severance packages that had been approved in 2007. Former CEO Nate Davis received a severance package worth $10 million. Erik Toppenberg, executive vice president of programming, received a severance package worth $5.34 million. CFO Joseph Euteneuer received a severance package worth $4.9 million. Vernon Irvin, chief marketing officer, received a severance package worth $4.5 million.[57]
In November 2009, Parsons resigned as chairman of Sirius XM, receiving a payout of more than $9 million.[29][57] He was succeeded by Eddy Hartenstein, former publisher and CEO of the Los Angeles Times.[29] In December 2012, Mel Karmazin stepped down as Sirius XM CEO after Liberty Media gained control of 49.5% of the company. James E. Meyer was named interim CEO.[58] On April 30, 2013, he was named permanent CEO.[59] Also in April 2013, Liberty Media CEO Greg Maffei was named Sirius XM's chairman, succeeding Hartenstein.[60]
Internet and mobile[edit]
Sirius XM radio content is available to stream online either as an add-on to existing subscriptions or as an Internet-only option.[61] Internet and mobile services directly challenging Sirius XM include iHeartRadio, Pandora, and Spotify.[47]
In August 2011, SiriusXM announced that the company would start offering a personalized interactive online radio experience, similar to that offered by Pandora. The feature would allow listeners to replay, skip, and ban songs on certain channels.[62] MySXM debuted on April 15, 2013, allowing users to fine-tune over 50 existing Sirius XM channels. MySXM is available to all Sirius XM subscribers.[61][63]
On June 17, 2009, Sirius XM released an application for use on Apple's iPhone and iPod Touch, allowing its subscribers to listen to its programming on those devices. The app did not feature all of the programming available to satellite listeners.[64] On March 17, 2011, the app was also made available for the iPad.[65] In 2012, the app was updated for iOS and Android, featuring additional content, and the ability to pause, rewind, and fast-forward through audio streams.[66]




Sirius XM's mobile app (version 3.0), as seen on the iPad Mini


On February 4, 2010, the Sirius XM BlackBerry application was announced, for use on BlackBerry smartphones (the Bold, Curve, Storm, and Tour).[67] As of April 2013, the app featured over 150 channels.[68]
On May 28, 2010, the Sirius XM application for Android smartphones was announced.[69] As of April 2013, the app features over 130 channels.[70]
As part of Howard Stern's new five-year contract with Sirius XM, which he signed on December 9, 2010, The Howard Stern Show, which hadn't previously been made available on mobile devices, would now be a part of Sirius XM's mobile app package.[71]
On March 18, 2015, SiriusXM released a refreshed user interface of the application on Android and iOS.[72]
Subscriptions[edit]
Following the merger, Sirius XM jettisoned the simplicity of previous monthly subscription models and began offering numerous new options, including a la carte offerings, a family-friendly version, and "mostly music" or "news, sports, and talk" packages, ranging in price from $6.99 to $16.99 per month.[73] As of April 2013, almost all music, talk and news programming is available on both Sirius, XM and SiriusXM Internet Radio services.[74]
Prior to the merger, Sirius offered, for a one-time fee, a lifetime subscription (lasting the lifetime of the receiver, not the subscriber).[30] After the merger, due to changes in bundling policies, some customers who had purchased lifetime subscriptions had their service reduced or canceled, and were unable to obtain a refund.[75][76]
Legal settlement[edit]
On December 4, 2014, Sirius XM Holdings agreed to a $3.8 million USD settlement with 45 states and the District of Columbia, over a suit initiated by the Ohio Attorney General, Mike DeWine, stemming from the company's billing and service renewal practices. The suit alleged Sirius XM Holdings was engaged in "misleading, unfair and deceptive acts or practices in violation of state consumer protection laws," Attorney General DeWine said.[77]
Programming[edit]
Main article: List of Sirius XM Radio channels
From the outset, Sirius and XM each attracted celebrity personalities to host shows. Broadminded, Bob Dylan, Tony Hawk, Bam Margera, Opie and Anthony Tom Petty, Ron & Fez, Howard Stern, Martha Stewart, and Oprah Winfrey are among those who signed contracts with one of the two companies. Exclusive sports programming (Major League Soccer, NASCAR, and the Canadian Football League, National Football League, and Premier League on Sirius, and Indy Racing League, Major League Baseball, National Basketball Association, National Hockey League, and PGA Tour on XM) initially differentiated the networks from one another.
Internet[edit]
The internet player allows subscribers to customize most stations to their liking by adjusting settings like: familiar/hits or unfamiliar/depth, studio recordings or live performances, and new/recent or old/classic material. These customized stations also allow listeners to play music without DJ interruptions. Paid subscribers can skip as many tracks as they like and can replay songs.
Canadian counterparts[edit]
Main article: SiriusXM Canada
In Canada, Sirius Canada and XM Canada were partially owned by Sirius XM (20% and 23.3% respectively) in joint ventures with Canadian companies.[78] After the US merger, the two Canadian ventures did not immediately agree to a similar merger, but instead remained in competition as distinct services.[79] Complicating matters was that Sirius Canada has nearly 80% of the total satellite radio subscriber base in that country, and felt they deserved greater than a 50/50 split of the new company, whereas XM Canada felt their deal with the NHL—a particularly lucrative prize in Canadian sports broadcasting—also warranted a significant amount of value in the new company.[79]
On November 24, 2010, XM Radio Canada and Sirius Canada announced that they would merge their services.[80] On April 12, 2011, the CRTC approved the companies' merger into SiriusXM Canada.[81] John Bitove's Canadian Satellite Radio Holdings Inc., the licensee of XM Canada, gained a 30% share in the new company as its primary and controlling shareholder, while Slaight Communications and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the current owners of Sirius Canada, each retained 20% ownership. Sirius XM's American parent company would hold 25%.[52] The merger was completed on June 21, 2011.[82]
Technical[edit]
Receivers[edit]
XM and Sirius use different compression and conditional access systems, making their receivers incompatible with each other's service. A condition of the merger was that Sirius XM would bring to the market satellite radios that can receive both XM and Sirius channels within one year.[41] The interoperable radio, called the MiRGE, was made available beginning in March 2009.[83] but the receiver was soon discontinued after both services eliminated duplicate channels which obviated the need for this radio. As of February 2016[update], Sirius XM offers radios for home, office, automotive, marine, and aviation use.[84]
Satellites[edit]
As of May 2017[update], there are five satellites in orbit: two XM and two Sirius satellites and one spare.[85]XM-3 and XM-4 are the active satellites for the XM service and replaced the original XM-1 and XM-2 satellites which were placed into a disposal orbit. Sirius FM-5 and FM-6 function as the primaries for the Sirius side. FM-6 which was launched on October 25, 2013 and declared ready for service on December 2, 2013 initially served as an in orbit spare while the company worked to deploy repeaters for the Sirius side which were needed to transition to full geostationary operation. In 2016 FM-6 was put into active service and officially replaced Sirius originals FM1-4 which operated in elliptical orbit. FM1-3 were later placed into disposal orbits. With this change FM-5 and FM-6 exclusively serve the Sirius service mirroring XM-3 and 4. Before FM-6 was launched, XM-5 was sent into orbit by Proton from Kazakhstan, on October 14, 2010, and is capable of broadcasting to either service.[86].[87] XM-5 serves as the in orbit spare for the entire system and can function in place of either a Sirius or XM satellite. In late 2016 Sirius XM placed an order for two new satellites SXM-7 and SXM-8 which will replace XM-3 and XM-4. These are scheduled for launch in 2019 and 2020 respectively.
Sirius satellites broadcast within the S band frequencies from 2.3200–2.3325 GHz, while XM radio uses adjacent frequencies 2.3325–2.3450 GHz.[88][89]

Sirius XM Satellite Radio is an American broadcasting company that provides three satellite radio and online radio services operating in the United States: Sirius Satellite Radio, XM Satellite Radio, and Sirius XM Radio. The company also has a major investment in Canada called SiriusXM Canada, an affiliate company that provides Sirius and XM service in Canada. At the end of 2013, Sirius reorganized their corporate structure, which made Sirius XM Radio Inc. a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Sirius XM Holdings, Inc.[3]
Sirius XM Radio was formed after the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved the acquisition of XM Satellite Radio Holding, Inc. by Sirius Satellite Radio, Inc. on July 29, 2008, 17 months after the companies first proposed the merger.[4] The merger brought the combined companies a total of more than 18.5 million subscribers based on current subscriber numbers on the date of merging.[4] The deal was valued at $3.3 billion, not including debt.[5] Through Q3 2016, Sirius XM has 31 million subscribers.[6]
The proposed merger was opposed by those who felt a merger would create a monopoly. Sirius and XM argued that a merger was the only way that satellite radio could survive.[5]

Pre-merger[edit]
Early days of Sirius[edit]
Main article: Sirius Satellite Radio
Sirius Satellite Radio was founded by Martine Rothblatt, David Margolese, and Robert Briskman.[7][8] In 1990, Rothblatt founded Satellite CD Radio in Washington, DC.[7][9] The company was the first to petition the FCC to assign unused frequencies for satellite radio broadcast, which "provoked a furor among owners of both large and small [terrestrial] radio stations."[9] In April 1992, Rothblatt resigned as chairman and CEO to start a medical research foundation.[7] Former NASA engineer Briskman, who designed the company's satellite technology, was then appointed chairman and CEO.[10][11] Six months later, in November 1992, Rogers Wireless co-founder Margolese, who had provided financial backing for the venture, acquired control of the company and succeeded Briskman. Margolese renamed the company CD Radio, and spent the next five years lobbying the FCC to allow satellite radio to be deployed, and the following five years raising $1.6 billion, which was used to build and launch three satellites into elliptical orbit from Kazakhstan in July 2000.[11][12][13][14] In 1997, after Margolese had obtained regulatory clearance and "effectively created the industry," the FCC also sold a license to XM Satellite Radio, which followed Sirius' example.[15] In November 1999, marketing chief Ira Bahr convinced Margolese to again change the name of the company,[citation needed] this time to Sirius Satellite Radio, in order to avoid association with the soon-to-be-outdated CD technology.[8] Having secured installation deals with automakers, including BMW, Chrysler and Ford,[14] Sirius launched the initial phase of its service in four cities on February 14, 2002,[16] expanding to the rest of the contiguous United States on July 1, 2002.[17]
In November 2001, Margolese stepped down as CEO, remaining as chairman until November 2003, with Sirius issuing a statement thanking him "for his great vision, leadership and dedication in creating both Sirius and the satellite radio industry."[18] Joe Clayton, former CEO of Global Crossing, followed as CEO from November 2001 until November 2004; stayed on as chairman until July 2008.[19] Mel Karmazin, former president of Viacom, became CEO in November 2004 and remained in that position through the merger, until December 2012.[20][21]
Early days of XM[edit]
Main article: XM Satellite Radio
The origin of XM Satellite Radio was a Petition for Rulemaking filed at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) by regulatory attorney and Founder of Satellite CD Radio Martine Rothblatt, to establish frequencies and licensing rules for the world's first-ever Satellite Digital Audio Radio Service (SDARS).[22][23] On May 18, 1990, Satellite CD Radio, Inc. (SCDR) filed a Petition for Rule Making in which it requested spectrum to offer Compact Disc quality digital audio radio service to be delivered by satellites and complementary radio transmitters.[24] Following the Allocation NPRM, the FCC established a December 15, 1992 cut-off date for applications proposing satellite DARS to be considered in conjunction with CD Radio's application.[25][26] One such application came from American Mobile Radio Corporation (AMRC), the predecessor company to XM Satellite Radio.[27] XM Satellite Radio was founded by Lon Levin and Gary Parsons.[28][29] It has its origins in the 1988 formation of the American Mobile Satellite Corporation (AMSC), a consortium of several organizations originally dedicated to satellite broadcasting of telephone, fax, and data signals.[30] In 1992, AMSC established a unit called the American Mobile Radio Corporation, dedicated to developing a satellite-based digital radio service; this was spun off as XM Satellite Radio Holdings, Inc. in 1998.[31][32] Its planned financing was complete by July 2000, at which point XM had raised $1.26 billion and secured installation agreements with General Motors, Honda, and Toyota.[14][33] Initially scheduled for September 12, 2001, XM's service start date was postponed due to the September 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and The Pentagon.[34] XM Satellite Radio's first broadcast was on September 25, 2001, nearly four months before Sirius.[17]
Gary Parsons served as chairman of XM Satellite Radio from its inception through the merger, and resigned from the position in November 2009.[29] Hugh Panero served as XM's CEO from 1998 until July 2007, shortly after the merger with Sirius was proposed. Nate Davis was appointed interim CEO until the merger was completed, at which point Sirius CEO Mel Karmazin took over as CEO of the newly merged company, Sirius XM.[35]
Merger[edit]



Wikinews has related news: In depth: XM and Sirius merger


Announcement[edit]
After years of speculation (the New York Post first reported on a potential merger in January 2005)[20] and three months of serious negotiations, the $13 billion merger between Sirius and XM was officially announced on February 19, 2007.[36] At the time, the nation's only two satellite radio providers reported nearly 14 million combined subscribers (with nearly 8 million belonging to XM), with neither having turned an annual profit. Sirius was valued at $5.2 billion, and XM at $3.75 billion.[30] Each subscription was sold for $12.95 monthly.[37]
XM and Sirius executives felt the merger would lower programming costs by eliminating overlapping stations and duplicated marketing costs. According to their original operating licenses, the two companies were not allowed to ever own each other's license. In proceeding with the merger, Sirius CEO Mel Karmazin ignored this rule, gambling that the FCC would consider other audio entertainment to be competitors and allow the merger to proceed by waiving the rule.[36][38]
Approval[edit]
After a 57-week review process, the Justice Department approved the Sirius and XM merger on March 24, 2008, concluding that satellite radio competes with terrestrial radio, online streaming, and mp3 players and tablets.[38][39] On July 25, 2008, the FCC approved the merger with a 3–2 vote, determining that it was not a monopoly because of all the competition on the Internet. FCC chairman Kevin Martin stated, "The merger is in the public interest and will provide consumers with greater flexibility and choices."
The biggest challenge for the newly unified company was selling more subscriptions with the drop in the number of cars sold annually in the US, the subsequent reduced demand for cars equipped with satellite radio, as well as online radio-streaming competition. Conditions of the merger included allowing any third-party company to make satellite radio devices; producing new radios that can receive both XM and Sirius channels within one year; allowing consumers to choose which channels they would like to have; freezing subscription rates for three years; setting aside 8% of its channels for noncommercial programmers; and paying $19.7 million in fines for past rule violations.[40][41] Sirius and XM began merging their channels on November 12, 2008.[42]
Each share of XM stock was replaced with 4.6 shares of Sirius stock. Each company's stockholders initially retained approximately 50% of the joined company.[43]
At the time of the merger, Sirius' top programming included channels for NPR, Howard Stern, and Martha Stewart; live NBA and NFL games; and live NASCAR races. XM's programming included channels for Willie Nelson, Opie and Anthony, Snoop Dogg, and Oprah Winfrey; and live Major League Baseball games.[39]
Opposition[edit]
The National Association of Broadcasters was adamantly opposed to the merger, calling it a monopoly.[36] Shortly after the Justice Department gave its support to the merger without restrictions, attorneys general from 11 states (Connecticut, Iowa, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Utah, and Washington) urged the FCC to impose restrictions on the merger.[44] Several Congressional Democrats also opposed the merger, calling it anticompetitive and criticizing the Bush administration for allowing it to go through.[39]
Post-merger[edit]
Resurgence and growth[edit]
After coming close to filing for Chapter 11 only months after the 2008 merger, having gone so far as to hire lawyers to prepare a possible bankruptcy filing,[45] Sirius XM was able to avoid declaring bankruptcy with the assistance of a $530 million loan from Liberty Media in February 2009, which Mel Karmazin negotiated in exchange for a 40% equity stake in Sirius XM.[46][47]
In the fourth quarter of 2009, Sirius XM posted a profit for the first time, with a net income of $14.2 million. This came after net losses of $245.8 million in the year following the merger. The company's resurgence was owed in part to the loan from Liberty Media. Increased automobile sales in the US was also a factor. Sirius XM ended 2009 with 18.8 million subscribers.[46] By the end of 2012, Sirius XM's subscriber base had grown to 23.9 million, mostly due to an increase in partnerships with automakers and car dealers; a strong push in the used-car market; and continued improved car sales in the US in general. The renewal of radio show host Howard Stern's contract through 2015 ($400 million for five years, $100 million less than Stern's previous five-year deal) was also a factor in the company's steady growth; Stern's show attracted over 12 million listeners per week.[47][48]
As of 2012, Sirius XM had a 60% penetration rate in the new car market. Out of that 60%, approximately 45% became subscribers. The company has long-term deals with General Motors, Ford, Toyota, Kia, Bentley, BMW, Volkswagen, Nissan, Hyundai,Suzuki and Mitsubishi,along with assorted trucks, boats and recreational vehicles. As of August 2012, Sirius XM satellite radios were in 50 million cars. The company offers trial subscriptions to new car owners, and then tries to get them to purchase yearly subscriptions. By 2018, Sirius XM predicts over 100 million cars will have Sirius XM radios installed.[48][49]
After trying for four years, on December 21, 2010, Sirius XM received approval from the FCC to add service in Alaska and Hawaii. Sirius XM announced on January 17, 2011 that it would place repeaters in those states and adjust three of its satellites to cover those areas. The move gave Sirius XM coverage in all 50 states.[50]
On January 12, 2011, XM Satellite Radio, Inc. was dissolved as a separate entity and merged into Sirius XM Radio, Inc.[51] On April 11, 2011, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) approved the merger of Sirius and XM's Canadian affiliates in SiriusXM Canada.[52]
On April 11, 2013, a New York appeals court upheld a New York judge's ruling, from April 2012, that Howard Stern was not entitled to stock bonuses based on Sirius XM's exceeding subscriber target projections. The court ruled that subscribers to XM Satellite Radio from before the Sirius XM merger should not be counted as "Sirius subscribers" for the purposes of Stern's lawsuit. Stern argued the opposite, because his popularity had played an integral role in helping Sirius acquire XM. He had been seeking $330 million in stock bonuses.[53][54]
In April 2016, Sirius XM surpassed 30 million total subscribers.[55]
Executives[edit]
Following the merger, Sirius CEO Mel Karmazin became CEO of the combined company, and XM chairman Gary Parsons retained his role.[56] XM CEO and co-founder Hugh Panero stepped down in August 2007, shortly after the merger was first announced.[5]
XM Satellite Radio executives who were not offered jobs in the new combined company were assured golden parachute severance packages that had been approved in 2007. Former CEO Nate Davis received a severance package worth $10 million. Erik Toppenberg, executive vice president of programming, received a severance package worth $5.34 million. CFO Joseph Euteneuer received a severance package worth $4.9 million. Vernon Irvin, chief marketing officer, received a severance package worth $4.5 million.[57]
In November 2009, Parsons resigned as chairman of Sirius XM, receiving a payout of more than $9 million.[29][57] He was succeeded by Eddy Hartenstein, former publisher and CEO of the Los Angeles Times.[29] In December 2012, Mel Karmazin stepped down as Sirius XM CEO after Liberty Media gained control of 49.5% of the company. James E. Meyer was named interim CEO.[58] On April 30, 2013, he was named permanent CEO.[59] Also in April 2013, Liberty Media CEO Greg Maffei was named Sirius XM's chairman, succeeding Hartenstein.[60]
Internet and mobile[edit]
Sirius XM radio content is available to stream online either as an add-on to existing subscriptions or as an Internet-only option.[61] Internet and mobile services directly challenging Sirius XM include iHeartRadio, Pandora, and Spotify.[47]
In August 2011, SiriusXM announced that the company would start offering a personalized interactive online radio experience, similar to that offered by Pandora. The feature would allow listeners to replay, skip, and ban songs on certain channels.[62] MySXM debuted on April 15, 2013, allowing users to fine-tune over 50 existing Sirius XM channels. MySXM is available to all Sirius XM subscribers.[61][63]
On June 17, 2009, Sirius XM released an application for use on Apple's iPhone and iPod Touch, allowing its subscribers to listen to its programming on those devices. The app did not feature all of the programming available to satellite listeners.[64] On March 17, 2011, the app was also made available for the iPad.[65] In 2012, the app was updated for iOS and Android, featuring additional content, and the ability to pause, rewind, and fast-forward through audio streams.[66]




Sirius XM's mobile app (version 3.0), as seen on the iPad Mini


On February 4, 2010, the Sirius XM BlackBerry application was announced, for use on BlackBerry smartphones (the Bold, Curve, Storm, and Tour).[67] As of April 2013, the app featured over 150 channels.[68]
On May 28, 2010, the Sirius XM application for Android smartphones was announced.[69] As of April 2013, the app features over 130 channels.[70]
As part of Howard Stern's new five-year contract with Sirius XM, which he signed on December 9, 2010, The Howard Stern Show, which hadn't previously been made available on mobile devices, would now be a part of Sirius XM's mobile app package.[71]
On March 18, 2015, SiriusXM released a refreshed user interface of the application on Android and iOS.[72]
Subscriptions[edit]
Following the merger, Sirius XM jettisoned the simplicity of previous monthly subscription models and began offering numerous new options, including a la carte offerings, a family-friendly version, and "mostly music" or "news, sports, and talk" packages, ranging in price from $6.99 to $16.99 per month.[73] As of April 2013, almost all music, talk and news programming is available on both Sirius, XM and SiriusXM Internet Radio services.[74]
Prior to the merger, Sirius offered, for a one-time fee, a lifetime subscription (lasting the lifetime of the receiver, not the subscriber).[30] After the merger, due to changes in bundling policies, some customers who had purchased lifetime subscriptions had their service reduced or canceled, and were unable to obtain a refund.[75][76]
Legal settlement[edit]
On December 4, 2014, Sirius XM Holdings agreed to a $3.8 million USD settlement with 45 states and the District of Columbia, over a suit initiated by the Ohio Attorney General, Mike DeWine, stemming from the company's billing and service renewal practices. The suit alleged Sirius XM Holdings was engaged in "misleading, unfair and deceptive acts or practices in violation of state consumer protection laws," Attorney General DeWine said.[77]
Programming[edit]
Main article: List of Sirius XM Radio channels
From the outset, Sirius and XM each attracted celebrity personalities to host shows. Broadminded, Bob Dylan, Tony Hawk, Bam Margera, Opie and Anthony Tom Petty, Ron & Fez, Howard Stern, Martha Stewart, and Oprah Winfrey are among those who signed contracts with one of the two companies. Exclusive sports programming (Major League Soccer, NASCAR, and the Canadian Football League, National Football League, and Premier League on Sirius, and Indy Racing League, Major League Baseball, National Basketball Association, National Hockey League, and PGA Tour on XM) initially differentiated the networks from one another.
Internet[edit]
The internet player allows subscribers to customize most stations to their liking by adjusting settings like: familiar/hits or unfamiliar/depth, studio recordings or live performances, and new/recent or old/classic material. These customized stations also allow listeners to play music without DJ interruptions. Paid subscribers can skip as many tracks as they like and can replay songs.
Canadian counterparts[edit]
Main article: SiriusXM Canada
In Canada, Sirius Canada and XM Canada were partially owned by Sirius XM (20% and 23.3% respectively) in joint ventures with Canadian companies.[78] After the US merger, the two Canadian ventures did not immediately agree to a similar merger, but instead remained in competition as distinct services.[79] Complicating matters was that Sirius Canada has nearly 80% of the total satellite radio subscriber base in that country, and felt they deserved greater than a 50/50 split of the new company, whereas XM Canada felt their deal with the NHL—a particularly lucrative prize in Canadian sports broadcasting—also warranted a significant amount of value in the new company.[79]
On November 24, 2010, XM Radio Canada and Sirius Canada announced that they would merge their services.[80] On April 12, 2011, the CRTC approved the companies' merger into SiriusXM Canada.[81] John Bitove's Canadian Satellite Radio Holdings Inc., the licensee of XM Canada, gained a 30% share in the new company as its primary and controlling shareholder, while Slaight Communications and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the current owners of Sirius Canada, each retained 20% ownership. Sirius XM's American parent company would hold 25%.[52] The merger was completed on June 21, 2011.[82]
Technical[edit]
Receivers[edit]
XM and Sirius use different compression and conditional access systems, making their receivers incompatible with each other's service. A condition of the merger was that Sirius XM would bring to the market satellite radios that can receive both XM and Sirius channels within one year.[41] The interoperable radio, called the MiRGE, was made available beginning in March 2009.[83] but the receiver was soon discontinued after both services eliminated duplicate channels which obviated the need for this radio. As of February 2016[update], Sirius XM offers radios for home, office, automotive, marine, and aviation use.[84]
Satellites[edit]
As of May 2017[update], there are five satellites in orbit: two XM and two Sirius satellites and one spare.[85]XM-3 and XM-4 are the active satellites for the XM service and replaced the original XM-1 and XM-2 satellites which were placed into a disposal orbit. Sirius FM-5 and FM-6 function as the primaries for the Sirius side. FM-6 which was launched on October 25, 2013 and declared ready for service on December 2, 2013 initially served as an in orbit spare while the company worked to deploy repeaters for the Sirius side which were needed to transition to full geostationary operation. In 2016 FM-6 was put into active service and officially replaced Sirius originals FM1-4 which operated in elliptical orbit. FM1-3 were later placed into disposal orbits. With this change FM-5 and FM-6 exclusively serve the Sirius service mirroring XM-3 and 4. Before FM-6 was launched, XM-5 was sent into orbit by Proton from Kazakhstan, on October 14, 2010, and is capable of broadcasting to either service.[86].[87] XM-5 serves as the in orbit spare for the entire system and can function in place of either a Sirius or XM satellite. In late 2016 Sirius XM placed an order for two new satellites SXM-7 and SXM-8 which will replace XM-3 and XM-4. These are scheduled for launch in 2019 and 2020 respectively.
Sirius satellites broadcast within the S band frequencies from 2.3200–2.3325 GHz, while XM radio uses adjacent frequencies 2.3325–2.3450 GHz.[88][89]

Sirius XM Satellite Radio is an American broadcasting company that provides three satellite radio and online radio services operating in the United States: Sirius Satellite Radio, XM Satellite Radio, and Sirius XM Radio. The company also has a major investment in Canada called SiriusXM Canada, an affiliate company that provides Sirius and XM service in Canada. At the end of 2013, Sirius reorganized their corporate structure, which made Sirius XM Radio Inc. a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Sirius XM Holdings, Inc.[3]
Sirius XM Radio was formed after the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved the acquisition of XM Satellite Radio Holding, Inc. by Sirius Satellite Radio, Inc. on July 29, 2008, 17 months after the companies first proposed the merger.[4] The merger brought the combined companies a total of more than 18.5 million subscribers based on current subscriber numbers on the date of merging.[4] The deal was valued at $3.3 billion, not including debt.[5] Through Q3 2016, Sirius XM has 31 million subscribers.[6]
The proposed merger was opposed by those who felt a merger would create a monopoly. Sirius and XM argued that a merger was the only way that satellite radio could survive.[5]

Pre-merger[edit]
Early days of Sirius[edit]
Main article: Sirius Satellite Radio
Sirius Satellite Radio was founded by Martine Rothblatt, David Margolese, and Robert Briskman.[7][8] In 1990, Rothblatt founded Satellite CD Radio in Washington, DC.[7][9] The company was the first to petition the FCC to assign unused frequencies for satellite radio broadcast, which "provoked a furor among owners of both large and small [terrestrial] radio stations."[9] In April 1992, Rothblatt resigned as chairman and CEO to start a medical research foundation.[7] Former NASA engineer Briskman, who designed the company's satellite technology, was then appointed chairman and CEO.[10][11] Six months later, in November 1992, Rogers Wireless co-founder Margolese, who had provided financial backing for the venture, acquired control of the company and succeeded Briskman. Margolese renamed the company CD Radio, and spent the next five years lobbying the FCC to allow satellite radio to be deployed, and the following five years raising $1.6 billion, which was used to build and launch three satellites into elliptical orbit from Kazakhstan in July 2000.[11][12][13][14] In 1997, after Margolese had obtained regulatory clearance and "effectively created the industry," the FCC also sold a license to XM Satellite Radio, which followed Sirius' example.[15] In November 1999, marketing chief Ira Bahr convinced Margolese to again change the name of the company,[citation needed] this time to Sirius Satellite Radio, in order to avoid association with the soon-to-be-outdated CD technology.[8] Having secured installation deals with automakers, including BMW, Chrysler and Ford,[14] Sirius launched the initial phase of its service in four cities on February 14, 2002,[16] expanding to the rest of the contiguous United States on July 1, 2002.[17]
In November 2001, Margolese stepped down as CEO, remaining as chairman until November 2003, with Sirius issuing a statement thanking him "for his great vision, leadership and dedication in creating both Sirius and the satellite radio industry."[18] Joe Clayton, former CEO of Global Crossing, followed as CEO from November 2001 until November 2004; stayed on as chairman until July 2008.[19] Mel Karmazin, former president of Viacom, became CEO in November 2004 and remained in that position through the merger, until December 2012.[20][21]
Early days of XM[edit]
Main article: XM Satellite Radio
The origin of XM Satellite Radio was a Petition for Rulemaking filed at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) by regulatory attorney and Founder of Satellite CD Radio Martine Rothblatt, to establish frequencies and licensing rules for the world's first-ever Satellite Digital Audio Radio Service (SDARS).[22][23] On May 18, 1990, Satellite CD Radio, Inc. (SCDR) filed a Petition for Rule Making in which it requested spectrum to offer Compact Disc quality digital audio radio service to be delivered by satellites and complementary radio transmitters.[24] Following the Allocation NPRM, the FCC established a December 15, 1992 cut-off date for applications proposing satellite DARS to be considered in conjunction with CD Radio's application.[25][26] One such application came from American Mobile Radio Corporation (AMRC), the predecessor company to XM Satellite Radio.[27] XM Satellite Radio was founded by Lon Levin and Gary Parsons.[28][29] It has its origins in the 1988 formation of the American Mobile Satellite Corporation (AMSC), a consortium of several organizations originally dedicated to satellite broadcasting of telephone, fax, and data signals.[30] In 1992, AMSC established a unit called the American Mobile Radio Corporation, dedicated to developing a satellite-based digital radio service; this was spun off as XM Satellite Radio Holdings, Inc. in 1998.[31][32] Its planned financing was complete by July 2000, at which point XM had raised $1.26 billion and secured installation agreements with General Motors, Honda, and Toyota.[14][33] Initially scheduled for September 12, 2001, XM's service start date was postponed due to the September 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and The Pentagon.[34] XM Satellite Radio's first broadcast was on September 25, 2001, nearly four months before Sirius.[17]
Gary Parsons served as chairman of XM Satellite Radio from its inception through the merger, and resigned from the position in November 2009.[29] Hugh Panero served as XM's CEO from 1998 until July 2007, shortly after the merger with Sirius was proposed. Nate Davis was appointed interim CEO until the merger was completed, at which point Sirius CEO Mel Karmazin took over as CEO of the newly merged company, Sirius XM.[35]
Merger[edit]



Wikinews has related news: In depth: XM and Sirius merger


Announcement[edit]
After years of speculation (the New York Post first reported on a potential merger in January 2005)[20] and three months of serious negotiations, the $13 billion merger between Sirius and XM was officially announced on February 19, 2007.[36] At the time, the nation's only two satellite radio providers reported nearly 14 million combined subscribers (with nearly 8 million belonging to XM), with neither having turned an annual profit. Sirius was valued at $5.2 billion, and XM at $3.75 billion.[30] Each subscription was sold for $12.95 monthly.[37]
XM and Sirius executives felt the merger would lower programming costs by eliminating overlapping stations and duplicated marketing costs. According to their original operating licenses, the two companies were not allowed to ever own each other's license. In proceeding with the merger, Sirius CEO Mel Karmazin ignored this rule, gambling that the FCC would consider other audio entertainment to be competitors and allow the merger to proceed by waiving the rule.[36][38]
Approval[edit]
After a 57-week review process, the Justice Department approved the Sirius and XM merger on March 24, 2008, concluding that satellite radio competes with terrestrial radio, online streaming, and mp3 players and tablets.[38][39] On July 25, 2008, the FCC approved the merger with a 3–2 vote, determining that it was not a monopoly because of all the competition on the Internet. FCC chairman Kevin Martin stated, "The merger is in the public interest and will provide consumers with greater flexibility and choices."
The biggest challenge for the newly unified company was selling more subscriptions with the drop in the number of cars sold annually in the US, the subsequent reduced demand for cars equipped with satellite radio, as well as online radio-streaming competition. Conditions of the merger included allowing any third-party company to make satellite radio devices; producing new radios that can receive both XM and Sirius channels within one year; allowing consumers to choose which channels they would like to have; freezing subscription rates for three years; setting aside 8% of its channels for noncommercial programmers; and paying $19.7 million in fines for past rule violations.[40][41] Sirius and XM began merging their channels on November 12, 2008.[42]
Each share of XM stock was replaced with 4.6 shares of Sirius stock. Each company's stockholders initially retained approximately 50% of the joined company.[43]
At the time of the merger, Sirius' top programming included channels for NPR, Howard Stern, and Martha Stewart; live NBA and NFL games; and live NASCAR races. XM's programming included channels for Willie Nelson, Opie and Anthony, Snoop Dogg, and Oprah Winfrey; and live Major League Baseball games.[39]
Opposition[edit]
The National Association of Broadcasters was adamantly opposed to the merger, calling it a monopoly.[36] Shortly after the Justice Department gave its support to the merger without restrictions, attorneys general from 11 states (Connecticut, Iowa, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Utah, and Washington) urged the FCC to impose restrictions on the merger.[44] Several Congressional Democrats also opposed the merger, calling it anticompetitive and criticizing the Bush administration for allowing it to go through.[39]
Post-merger[edit]
Resurgence and growth[edit]
After coming close to filing for Chapter 11 only months after the 2008 merger, having gone so far as to hire lawyers to prepare a possible bankruptcy filing,[45] Sirius XM was able to avoid declaring bankruptcy with the assistance of a $530 million loan from Liberty Media in February 2009, which Mel Karmazin negotiated in exchange for a 40% equity stake in Sirius XM.[46][47]
In the fourth quarter of 2009, Sirius XM posted a profit for the first time, with a net income of $14.2 million. This came after net losses of $245.8 million in the year following the merger. The company's resurgence was owed in part to the loan from Liberty Media. Increased automobile sales in the US was also a factor. Sirius XM ended 2009 with 18.8 million subscribers.[46] By the end of 2012, Sirius XM's subscriber base had grown to 23.9 million, mostly due to an increase in partnerships with automakers and car dealers; a strong push in the used-car market; and continued improved car sales in the US in general. The renewal of radio show host Howard Stern's contract through 2015 ($400 million for five years, $100 million less than Stern's previous five-year deal) was also a factor in the company's steady growth; Stern's show attracted over 12 million listeners per week.[47][48]
As of 2012, Sirius XM had a 60% penetration rate in the new car market. Out of that 60%, approximately 45% became subscribers. The company has long-term deals with General Motors, Ford, Toyota, Kia, Bentley, BMW, Volkswagen, Nissan, Hyundai,Suzuki and Mitsubishi,along with assorted trucks, boats and recreational vehicles. As of August 2012, Sirius XM satellite radios were in 50 million cars. The company offers trial subscriptions to new car owners, and then tries to get them to purchase yearly subscriptions. By 2018, Sirius XM predicts over 100 million cars will have Sirius XM radios installed.[48][49]
After trying for four years, on December 21, 2010, Sirius XM received approval from the FCC to add service in Alaska and Hawaii. Sirius XM announced on January 17, 2011 that it would place repeaters in those states and adjust three of its satellites to cover those areas. The move gave Sirius XM coverage in all 50 states.[50]
On January 12, 2011, XM Satellite Radio, Inc. was dissolved as a separate entity and merged into Sirius XM Radio, Inc.[51] On April 11, 2011, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) approved the merger of Sirius and XM's Canadian affiliates in SiriusXM Canada.[52]
On April 11, 2013, a New York appeals court upheld a New York judge's ruling, from April 2012, that Howard Stern was not entitled to stock bonuses based on Sirius XM's exceeding subscriber target projections. The court ruled that subscribers to XM Satellite Radio from before the Sirius XM merger should not be counted as "Sirius subscribers" for the purposes of Stern's lawsuit. Stern argued the opposite, because his popularity had played an integral role in helping Sirius acquire XM. He had been seeking $330 million in stock bonuses.[53][54]
In April 2016, Sirius XM surpassed 30 million total subscribers.[55]
Executives[edit]
Following the merger, Sirius CEO Mel Karmazin became CEO of the combined company, and XM chairman Gary Parsons retained his role.[56] XM CEO and co-founder Hugh Panero stepped down in August 2007, shortly after the merger was first announced.[5]
XM Satellite Radio executives who were not offered jobs in the new combined company were assured golden parachute severance packages that had been approved in 2007. Former CEO Nate Davis received a severance package worth $10 million. Erik Toppenberg, executive vice president of programming, received a severance package worth $5.34 million. CFO Joseph Euteneuer received a severance package worth $4.9 million. Vernon Irvin, chief marketing officer, received a severance package worth $4.5 million.[57]
In November 2009, Parsons resigned as chairman of Sirius XM, receiving a payout of more than $9 million.[29][57] He was succeeded by Eddy Hartenstein, former publisher and CEO of the Los Angeles Times.[29] In December 2012, Mel Karmazin stepped down as Sirius XM CEO after Liberty Media gained control of 49.5% of the company. James E. Meyer was named interim CEO.[58] On April 30, 2013, he was named permanent CEO.[59] Also in April 2013, Liberty Media CEO Greg Maffei was named Sirius XM's chairman, succeeding Hartenstein.[60]
Internet and mobile[edit]
Sirius XM radio content is available to stream online either as an add-on to existing subscriptions or as an Internet-only option.[61] Internet and mobile services directly challenging Sirius XM include iHeartRadio, Pandora, and Spotify.[47]
In August 2011, SiriusXM announced that the company would start offering a personalized interactive online radio experience, similar to that offered by Pandora. The feature would allow listeners to replay, skip, and ban songs on certain channels.[62] MySXM debuted on April 15, 2013, allowing users to fine-tune over 50 existing Sirius XM channels. MySXM is available to all Sirius XM subscribers.[61][63]
On June 17, 2009, Sirius XM released an application for use on Apple's iPhone and iPod Touch, allowing its subscribers to listen to its programming on those devices. The app did not feature all of the programming available to satellite listeners.[64] On March 17, 2011, the app was also made available for the iPad.[65] In 2012, the app was updated for iOS and Android, featuring additional content, and the ability to pause, rewind, and fast-forward through audio streams.[66]




Sirius XM's mobile app (version 3.0), as seen on the iPad Mini


On February 4, 2010, the Sirius XM BlackBerry application was announced, for use on BlackBerry smartphones (the Bold, Curve, Storm, and Tour).[67] As of April 2013, the app featured over 150 channels.[68]
On May 28, 2010, the Sirius XM application for Android smartphones was announced.[69] As of April 2013, the app features over 130 channels.[70]
As part of Howard Stern's new five-year contract with Sirius XM, which he signed on December 9, 2010, The Howard Stern Show, which hadn't previously been made available on mobile devices, would now be a part of Sirius XM's mobile app package.[71]
On March 18, 2015, SiriusXM released a refreshed user interface of the application on Android and iOS.[72]
Subscriptions[edit]
Following the merger, Sirius XM jettisoned the simplicity of previous monthly subscription models and began offering numerous new options, including a la carte offerings, a family-friendly version, and "mostly music" or "news, sports, and talk" packages, ranging in price from $6.99 to $16.99 per month.[73] As of April 2013, almost all music, talk and news programming is available on both Sirius, XM and SiriusXM Internet Radio services.[74]
Prior to the merger, Sirius offered, for a one-time fee, a lifetime subscription (lasting the lifetime of the receiver, not the subscriber).[30] After the merger, due to changes in bundling policies, some customers who had purchased lifetime subscriptions had their service reduced or canceled, and were unable to obtain a refund.[75][76]
Legal settlement[edit]
On December 4, 2014, Sirius XM Holdings agreed to a $3.8 million USD settlement with 45 states and the District of Columbia, over a suit initiated by the Ohio Attorney General, Mike DeWine, stemming from the company's billing and service renewal practices. The suit alleged Sirius XM Holdings was engaged in "misleading, unfair and deceptive acts or practices in violation of state consumer protection laws," Attorney General DeWine said.[77]
Programming[edit]
Main article: List of Sirius XM Radio channels
From the outset, Sirius and XM each attracted celebrity personalities to host shows. Broadminded, Bob Dylan, Tony Hawk, Bam Margera, Opie and Anthony Tom Petty, Ron & Fez, Howard Stern, Martha Stewart, and Oprah Winfrey are among those who signed contracts with one of the two companies. Exclusive sports programming (Major League Soccer, NASCAR, and the Canadian Football League, National Football League, and Premier League on Sirius, and Indy Racing League, Major League Baseball, National Basketball Association, National Hockey League, and PGA Tour on XM) initially differentiated the networks from one another.
Internet[edit]
The internet player allows subscribers to customize most stations to their liking by adjusting settings like: familiar/hits or unfamiliar/depth, studio recordings or live performances, and new/recent or old/classic material. These customized stations also allow listeners to play music without DJ interruptions. Paid subscribers can skip as many tracks as they like and can replay songs.
Canadian counterparts[edit]
Main article: SiriusXM Canada
In Canada, Sirius Canada and XM Canada were partially owned by Sirius XM (20% and 23.3% respectively) in joint ventures with Canadian companies.[78] After the US merger, the two Canadian ventures did not immediately agree to a similar merger, but instead remained in competition as distinct services.[79] Complicating matters was that Sirius Canada has nearly 80% of the total satellite radio subscriber base in that country, and felt they deserved greater than a 50/50 split of the new company, whereas XM Canada felt their deal with the NHL—a particularly lucrative prize in Canadian sports broadcasting—also warranted a significant amount of value in the new company.[79]
On November 24, 2010, XM Radio Canada and Sirius Canada announced that they would merge their services.[80] On April 12, 2011, the CRTC approved the companies' merger into SiriusXM Canada.[81] John Bitove's Canadian Satellite Radio Holdings Inc., the licensee of XM Canada, gained a 30% share in the new company as its primary and controlling shareholder, while Slaight Communications and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the current owners of Sirius Canada, each retained 20% ownership. Sirius XM's American parent company would hold 25%.[52] The merger was completed on June 21, 2011.[82]
Technical[edit]
Receivers[edit]
XM and Sirius use different compression and conditional access systems, making their receivers incompatible with each other's service. A condition of the merger was that Sirius XM would bring to the market satellite radios that can receive both XM and Sirius channels within one year.[41] The interoperable radio, called the MiRGE, was made available beginning in March 2009.[83] but the receiver was soon discontinued after both services eliminated duplicate channels which obviated the need for this radio. As of February 2016[update], Sirius XM offers radios for home, office, automotive, marine, and aviation use.[84]
Satellites[edit]
As of May 2017[update], there are five satellites in orbit: two XM and two Sirius satellites and one spare.[85]XM-3 and XM-4 are the active satellites for the XM service and replaced the original XM-1 and XM-2 satellites which were placed into a disposal orbit. Sirius FM-5 and FM-6 function as the primaries for the Sirius side. FM-6 which was launched on October 25, 2013 and declared ready for service on December 2, 2013 initially served as an in orbit spare while the company worked to deploy repeaters for the Sirius side which were needed to transition to full geostationary operation. In 2016 FM-6 was put into active service and officially replaced Sirius originals FM1-4 which operated in elliptical orbit. FM1-3 were later placed into disposal orbits. With this change FM-5 and FM-6 exclusively serve the Sirius service mirroring XM-3 and 4. Before FM-6 was launched, XM-5 was sent into orbit by Proton from Kazakhstan, on October 14, 2010, and is capable of broadcasting to either service.[86].[87] XM-5 serves as the in orbit spare for the entire system and can function in place of either a Sirius or XM satellite. In late 2016 Sirius XM placed an order for two new satellites SXM-7 and SXM-8 which will replace XM-3 and XM-4. These are scheduled for launch in 2019 and 2020 respectively.
Sirius satellites broadcast within the S band frequencies from 2.3200–2.3325 GHz, while XM radio uses adjacent frequencies 2.3325–2.3450 GHz.[88][89]

Sirius XM Satellite Radio is an American broadcasting company that provides three satellite radio and online radio services operating in the United States: Sirius Satellite Radio, XM Satellite Radio, and Sirius XM Radio. The company also has a major investment in Canada called SiriusXM Canada, an affiliate company that provides Sirius and XM service in Canada. At the end of 2013, Sirius reorganized their corporate structure, which made Sirius XM Radio Inc. a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Sirius XM Holdings, Inc.[3]
Sirius XM Radio was formed after the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved the acquisition of XM Satellite Radio Holding, Inc. by Sirius Satellite Radio, Inc. on July 29, 2008, 17 months after the companies first proposed the merger.[4] The merger brought the combined companies a total of more than 18.5 million subscribers based on current subscriber numbers on the date of merging.[4] The deal was valued at $3.3 billion, not including debt.[5] Through Q3 2016, Sirius XM has 31 million subscribers.[6]
The proposed merger was opposed by those who felt a merger would create a monopoly. Sirius and XM argued that a merger was the only way that satellite radio could survive.[5]

Pre-merger[edit]
Early days of Sirius[edit]
Main article: Sirius Satellite Radio
Sirius Satellite Radio was founded by Martine Rothblatt, David Margolese, and Robert Briskman.[7][8] In 1990, Rothblatt founded Satellite CD Radio in Washington, DC.[7][9] The company was the first to petition the FCC to assign unused frequencies for satellite radio broadcast, which "provoked a furor among owners of both large and small [terrestrial] radio stations."[9] In April 1992, Rothblatt resigned as chairman and CEO to start a medical research foundation.[7] Former NASA engineer Briskman, who designed the company's satellite technology, was then appointed chairman and CEO.[10][11] Six months later, in November 1992, Rogers Wireless co-founder Margolese, who had provided financial backing for the venture, acquired control of the company and succeeded Briskman. Margolese renamed the company CD Radio, and spent the next five years lobbying the FCC to allow satellite radio to be deployed, and the following five years raising $1.6 billion, which was used to build and launch three satellites into elliptical orbit from Kazakhstan in July 2000.[11][12][13][14] In 1997, after Margolese had obtained regulatory clearance and "effectively created the industry," the FCC also sold a license to XM Satellite Radio, which followed Sirius' example.[15] In November 1999, marketing chief Ira Bahr convinced Margolese to again change the name of the company,[citation needed] this time to Sirius Satellite Radio, in order to avoid association with the soon-to-be-outdated CD technology.[8] Having secured installation deals with automakers, including BMW, Chrysler and Ford,[14] Sirius launched the initial phase of its service in four cities on February 14, 2002,[16] expanding to the rest of the contiguous United States on July 1, 2002.[17]
In November 2001, Margolese stepped down as CEO, remaining as chairman until November 2003, with Sirius issuing a statement thanking him "for his great vision, leadership and dedication in creating both Sirius and the satellite radio industry."[18] Joe Clayton, former CEO of Global Crossing, followed as CEO from November 2001 until November 2004; stayed on as chairman until July 2008.[19] Mel Karmazin, former president of Viacom, became CEO in November 2004 and remained in that position through the merger, until December 2012.[20][21]
Early days of XM[edit]
Main article: XM Satellite Radio
The origin of XM Satellite Radio was a Petition for Rulemaking filed at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) by regulatory attorney and Founder of Satellite CD Radio Martine Rothblatt, to establish frequencies and licensing rules for the world's first-ever Satellite Digital Audio Radio Service (SDARS).[22][23] On May 18, 1990, Satellite CD Radio, Inc. (SCDR) filed a Petition for Rule Making in which it requested spectrum to offer Compact Disc quality digital audio radio service to be delivered by satellites and complementary radio transmitters.[24] Following the Allocation NPRM, the FCC established a December 15, 1992 cut-off date for applications proposing satellite DARS to be considered in conjunction with CD Radio's application.[25][26] One such application came from American Mobile Radio Corporation (AMRC), the predecessor company to XM Satellite Radio.[27] XM Satellite Radio was founded by Lon Levin and Gary Parsons.[28][29] It has its origins in the 1988 formation of the American Mobile Satellite Corporation (AMSC), a consortium of several organizations originally dedicated to satellite broadcasting of telephone, fax, and data signals.[30] In 1992, AMSC established a unit called the American Mobile Radio Corporation, dedicated to developing a satellite-based digital radio service; this was spun off as XM Satellite Radio Holdings, Inc. in 1998.[31][32] Its planned financing was complete by July 2000, at which point XM had raised $1.26 billion and secured installation agreements with General Motors, Honda, and Toyota.[14][33] Initially scheduled for September 12, 2001, XM's service start date was postponed due to the September 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and The Pentagon.[34] XM Satellite Radio's first broadcast was on September 25, 2001, nearly four months before Sirius.[17]
Gary Parsons served as chairman of XM Satellite Radio from its inception through the merger, and resigned from the position in November 2009.[29] Hugh Panero served as XM's CEO from 1998 until July 2007, shortly after the merger with Sirius was proposed. Nate Davis was appointed interim CEO until the merger was completed, at which point Sirius CEO Mel Karmazin took over as CEO of the newly merged company, Sirius XM.[35]
Merger[edit]



Wikinews has related news: In depth: XM and Sirius merger


Announcement[edit]
After years of speculation (the New York Post first reported on a potential merger in January 2005)[20] and three months of serious negotiations, the $13 billion merger between Sirius and XM was officially announced on February 19, 2007.[36] At the time, the nation's only two satellite radio providers reported nearly 14 million combined subscribers (with nearly 8 million belonging to XM), with neither having turned an annual profit. Sirius was valued at $5.2 billion, and XM at $3.75 billion.[30] Each subscription was sold for $12.95 monthly.[37]
XM and Sirius executives felt the merger would lower programming costs by eliminating overlapping stations and duplicated marketing costs. According to their original operating licenses, the two companies were not allowed to ever own each other's license. In proceeding with the merger, Sirius CEO Mel Karmazin ignored this rule, gambling that the FCC would consider other audio entertainment to be competitors and allow the merger to proceed by waiving the rule.[36][38]
Approval[edit]
After a 57-week review process, the Justice Department approved the Sirius and XM merger on March 24, 2008, concluding that satellite radio competes with terrestrial radio, online streaming, and mp3 players and tablets.[38][39] On July 25, 2008, the FCC approved the merger with a 3–2 vote, determining that it was not a monopoly because of all the competition on the Internet. FCC chairman Kevin Martin stated, "The merger is in the public interest and will provide consumers with greater flexibility and choices."
The biggest challenge for the newly unified company was selling more subscriptions with the drop in the number of cars sold annually in the US, the subsequent reduced demand for cars equipped with satellite radio, as well as online radio-streaming competition. Conditions of the merger included allowing any third-party company to make satellite radio devices; producing new radios that can receive both XM and Sirius channels within one year; allowing consumers to choose which channels they would like to have; freezing subscription rates for three years; setting aside 8% of its channels for noncommercial programmers; and paying $19.7 million in fines for past rule violations.[40][41] Sirius and XM began merging their channels on November 12, 2008.[42]
Each share of XM stock was replaced with 4.6 shares of Sirius stock. Each company's stockholders initially retained approximately 50% of the joined company.[43]
At the time of the merger, Sirius' top programming included channels for NPR, Howard Stern, and Martha Stewart; live NBA and NFL games; and live NASCAR races. XM's programming included channels for Willie Nelson, Opie and Anthony, Snoop Dogg, and Oprah Winfrey; and live Major League Baseball games.[39]
Opposition[edit]
The National Association of Broadcasters was adamantly opposed to the merger, calling it a monopoly.[36] Shortly after the Justice Department gave its support to the merger without restrictions, attorneys general from 11 states (Connecticut, Iowa, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Utah, and Washington) urged the FCC to impose restrictions on the merger.[44] Several Congressional Democrats also opposed the merger, calling it anticompetitive and criticizing the Bush administration for allowing it to go through.[39]
Post-merger[edit]
Resurgence and growth[edit]
After coming close to filing for Chapter 11 only months after the 2008 merger, having gone so far as to hire lawyers to prepare a possible bankruptcy filing,[45] Sirius XM was able to avoid declaring bankruptcy with the assistance of a $530 million loan from Liberty Media in February 2009, which Mel Karmazin negotiated in exchange for a 40% equity stake in Sirius XM.[46][47]
In the fourth quarter of 2009, Sirius XM posted a profit for the first time, with a net income of $14.2 million. This came after net losses of $245.8 million in the year following the merger. The company's resurgence was owed in part to the loan from Liberty Media. Increased automobile sales in the US was also a factor. Sirius XM ended 2009 with 18.8 million subscribers.[46] By the end of 2012, Sirius XM's subscriber base had grown to 23.9 million, mostly due to an increase in partnerships with automakers and car dealers; a strong push in the used-car market; and continued improved car sales in the US in general. The renewal of radio show host Howard Stern's contract through 2015 ($400 million for five years, $100 million less than Stern's previous five-year deal) was also a factor in the company's steady growth; Stern's show attracted over 12 million listeners per week.[47][48]
As of 2012, Sirius XM had a 60% penetration rate in the new car market. Out of that 60%, approximately 45% became subscribers. The company has long-term deals with General Motors, Ford, Toyota, Kia, Bentley, BMW, Volkswagen, Nissan, Hyundai,Suzuki and Mitsubishi,along with assorted trucks, boats and recreational vehicles. As of August 2012, Sirius XM satellite radios were in 50 million cars. The company offers trial subscriptions to new car owners, and then tries to get them to purchase yearly subscriptions. By 2018, Sirius XM predicts over 100 million cars will have Sirius XM radios installed.[48][49]
After trying for four years, on December 21, 2010, Sirius XM received approval from the FCC to add service in Alaska and Hawaii. Sirius XM announced on January 17, 2011 that it would place repeaters in those states and adjust three of its satellites to cover those areas. The move gave Sirius XM coverage in all 50 states.[50]
On January 12, 2011, XM Satellite Radio, Inc. was dissolved as a separate entity and merged into Sirius XM Radio, Inc.[51] On April 11, 2011, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) approved the merger of Sirius and XM's Canadian affiliates in SiriusXM Canada.[52]
On April 11, 2013, a New York appeals court upheld a New York judge's ruling, from April 2012, that Howard Stern was not entitled to stock bonuses based on Sirius XM's exceeding subscriber target projections. The court ruled that subscribers to XM Satellite Radio from before the Sirius XM merger should not be counted as "Sirius subscribers" for the purposes of Stern's lawsuit. Stern argued the opposite, because his popularity had played an integral role in helping Sirius acquire XM. He had been seeking $330 million in stock bonuses.[53][54]
In April 2016, Sirius XM surpassed 30 million total subscribers.[55]
Executives[edit]
Following the merger, Sirius CEO Mel Karmazin became CEO of the combined company, and XM chairman Gary Parsons retained his role.[56] XM CEO and co-founder Hugh Panero stepped down in August 2007, shortly after the merger was first announced.[5]
XM Satellite Radio executives who were not offered jobs in the new combined company were assured golden parachute severance packages that had been approved in 2007. Former CEO Nate Davis received a severance package worth $10 million. Erik Toppenberg, executive vice president of programming, received a severance package worth $5.34 million. CFO Joseph Euteneuer received a severance package worth $4.9 million. Vernon Irvin, chief marketing officer, received a severance package worth $4.5 million.[57]
In November 2009, Parsons resigned as chairman of Sirius XM, receiving a payout of more than $9 million.[29][57] He was succeeded by Eddy Hartenstein, former publisher and CEO of the Los Angeles Times.[29] In December 2012, Mel Karmazin stepped down as Sirius XM CEO after Liberty Media gained control of 49.5% of the company. James E. Meyer was named interim CEO.[58] On April 30, 2013, he was named permanent CEO.[59] Also in April 2013, Liberty Media CEO Greg Maffei was named Sirius XM's chairman, succeeding Hartenstein.[60]
Internet and mobile[edit]
Sirius XM radio content is available to stream online either as an add-on to existing subscriptions or as an Internet-only option.[61] Internet and mobile services directly challenging Sirius XM include iHeartRadio, Pandora, and Spotify.[47]
In August 2011, SiriusXM announced that the company would start offering a personalized interactive online radio experience, similar to that offered by Pandora. The feature would allow listeners to replay, skip, and ban songs on certain channels.[62] MySXM debuted on April 15, 2013, allowing users to fine-tune over 50 existing Sirius XM channels. MySXM is available to all Sirius XM subscribers.[61][63]
On June 17, 2009, Sirius XM released an application for use on Apple's iPhone and iPod Touch, allowing its subscribers to listen to its programming on those devices. The app did not feature all of the programming available to satellite listeners.[64] On March 17, 2011, the app was also made available for the iPad.[65] In 2012, the app was updated for iOS and Android, featuring additional content, and the ability to pause, rewind, and fast-forward through audio streams.[66]




Sirius XM's mobile app (version 3.0), as seen on the iPad Mini


On February 4, 2010, the Sirius XM BlackBerry application was announced, for use on BlackBerry smartphones (the Bold, Curve, Storm, and Tour).[67] As of April 2013, the app featured over 150 channels.[68]
On May 28, 2010, the Sirius XM application for Android smartphones was announced.[69] As of April 2013, the app features over 130 channels.[70]
As part of Howard Stern's new five-year contract with Sirius XM, which he signed on December 9, 2010, The Howard Stern Show, which hadn't previously been made available on mobile devices, would now be a part of Sirius XM's mobile app package.[71]
On March 18, 2015, SiriusXM released a refreshed user interface of the application on Android and iOS.[72]
Subscriptions[edit]
Following the merger, Sirius XM jettisoned the simplicity of previous monthly subscription models and began offering numerous new options, including a la carte offerings, a family-friendly version, and "mostly music" or "news, sports, and talk" packages, ranging in price from $6.99 to $16.99 per month.[73] As of April 2013, almost all music, talk and news programming is available on both Sirius, XM and SiriusXM Internet Radio services.[74]
Prior to the merger, Sirius offered, for a one-time fee, a lifetime subscription (lasting the lifetime of the receiver, not the subscriber).[30] After the merger, due to changes in bundling policies, some customers who had purchased lifetime subscriptions had their service reduced or canceled, and were unable to obtain a refund.[75][76]
Legal settlement[edit]
On December 4, 2014, Sirius XM Holdings agreed to a $3.8 million USD settlement with 45 states and the District of Columbia, over a suit initiated by the Ohio Attorney General, Mike DeWine, stemming from the company's billing and service renewal practices. The suit alleged Sirius XM Holdings was engaged in "misleading, unfair and deceptive acts or practices in violation of state consumer protection laws," Attorney General DeWine said.[77]
Programming[edit]
Main article: List of Sirius XM Radio channels
From the outset, Sirius and XM each attracted celebrity personalities to host shows. Broadminded, Bob Dylan, Tony Hawk, Bam Margera, Opie and Anthony Tom Petty, Ron & Fez, Howard Stern, Martha Stewart, and Oprah Winfrey are among those who signed contracts with one of the two companies. Exclusive sports programming (Major League Soccer, NASCAR, and the Canadian Football League, National Football League, and Premier League on Sirius, and Indy Racing League, Major League Baseball, National Basketball Association, National Hockey League, and PGA Tour on XM) initially differentiated the networks from one another.
Internet[edit]
The internet player allows subscribers to customize most stations to their liking by adjusting settings like: familiar/hits or unfamiliar/depth, studio recordings or live performances, and new/recent or old/classic material. These customized stations also allow listeners to play music without DJ interruptions. Paid subscribers can skip as many tracks as they like and can replay songs.
Canadian counterparts[edit]
Main article: SiriusXM Canada
In Canada, Sirius Canada and XM Canada were partially owned by Sirius XM (20% and 23.3% respectively) in joint ventures with Canadian companies.[78] After the US merger, the two Canadian ventures did not immediately agree to a similar merger, but instead remained in competition as distinct services.[79] Complicating matters was that Sirius Canada has nearly 80% of the total satellite radio subscriber base in that country, and felt they deserved greater than a 50/50 split of the new company, whereas XM Canada felt their deal with the NHL—a particularly lucrative prize in Canadian sports broadcasting—also warranted a significant amount of value in the new company.[79]
On November 24, 2010, XM Radio Canada and Sirius Canada announced that they would merge their services.[80] On April 12, 2011, the CRTC approved the companies' merger into SiriusXM Canada.[81] John Bitove's Canadian Satellite Radio Holdings Inc., the licensee of XM Canada, gained a 30% share in the new company as its primary and controlling shareholder, while Slaight Communications and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the current owners of Sirius Canada, each retained 20% ownership. Sirius XM's American parent company would hold 25%.[52] The merger was completed on June 21, 2011.[82]
Technical[edit]
Receivers[edit]
XM and Sirius use different compression and conditional access systems, making their receivers incompatible with each other's service. A condition of the merger was that Sirius XM would bring to the market satellite radios that can receive both XM and Sirius channels within one year.[41] The interoperable radio, called the MiRGE, was made available beginning in March 2009.[83] but the receiver was soon discontinued after both services eliminated duplicate channels which obviated the need for this radio. As of February 2016[update], Sirius XM offers radios for home, office, automotive, marine, and aviation use.[84]
Satellites[edit]
As of May 2017[update], there are five satellites in orbit: two XM and two Sirius satellites and one spare.[85]XM-3 and XM-4 are the active satellites for the XM service and replaced the original XM-1 and XM-2 satellites which were placed into a disposal orbit. Sirius FM-5 and FM-6 function as the primaries for the Sirius side. FM-6 which was launched on October 25, 2013 and declared ready for service on December 2, 2013 initially served as an in orbit spare while the company worked to deploy repeaters for the Sirius side which were needed to transition to full geostationary operation. In 2016 FM-6 was put into active service and officially replaced Sirius originals FM1-4 which operated in elliptical orbit. FM1-3 were later placed into disposal orbits. With this change FM-5 and FM-6 exclusively serve the Sirius service mirroring XM-3 and 4. Before FM-6 was launched, XM-5 was sent into orbit by Proton from Kazakhstan, on October 14, 2010, and is capable of broadcasting to either service.[86].[87] XM-5 serves as the in orbit spare for the entire system and can function in place of either a Sirius or XM satellite. In late 2016 Sirius XM placed an order for two new satellites SXM-7 and SXM-8 which will replace XM-3 and XM-4. These are scheduled for launch in 2019 and 2020 respectively.
Sirius satellites broadcast within the S band frequencies from 2.3200–2.3325 GHz, while XM radio uses adjacent frequencies 2.3325–2.3450 GHz.[88][89]

Sirius XM Satellite Radio is an American broadcasting company that provides three satellite radio and online radio services operating in the United States: Sirius Satellite Radio, XM Satellite Radio, and Sirius XM Radio. The company also has a major investment in Canada called SiriusXM Canada, an affiliate company that provides Sirius and XM service in Canada. At the end of 2013, Sirius reorganized their corporate structure, which made Sirius XM Radio Inc. a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Sirius XM Holdings, Inc.[3]
Sirius XM Radio was formed after the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved the acquisition of XM Satellite Radio Holding, Inc. by Sirius Satellite Radio, Inc. on July 29, 2008, 17 months after the companies first proposed the merger.[4] The merger brought the combined companies a total of more than 18.5 million subscribers based on current subscriber numbers on the date of merging.[4] The deal was valued at $3.3 billion, not including debt.[5] Through Q3 2016, Sirius XM has 31 million subscribers.[6]
The proposed merger was opposed by those who felt a merger would create a monopoly. Sirius and XM argued that a merger was the only way that satellite radio could survive.[5]

Pre-merger[edit]
Early days of Sirius[edit]
Main article: Sirius Satellite Radio
Sirius Satellite Radio was founded by Martine Rothblatt, David Margolese, and Robert Briskman.[7][8] In 1990, Rothblatt founded Satellite CD Radio in Washington, DC.[7][9] The company was the first to petition the FCC to assign unused frequencies for satellite radio broadcast, which "provoked a furor among owners of both large and small [terrestrial] radio stations."[9] In April 1992, Rothblatt resigned as chairman and CEO to start a medical research foundation.[7] Former NASA engineer Briskman, who designed the company's satellite technology, was then appointed chairman and CEO.[10][11] Six months later, in November 1992, Rogers Wireless co-founder Margolese, who had provided financial backing for the venture, acquired control of the company and succeeded Briskman. Margolese renamed the company CD Radio, and spent the next five years lobbying the FCC to allow satellite radio to be deployed, and the following five years raising $1.6 billion, which was used to build and launch three satellites into elliptical orbit from Kazakhstan in July 2000.[11][12][13][14] In 1997, after Margolese had obtained regulatory clearance and "effectively created the industry," the FCC also sold a license to XM Satellite Radio, which followed Sirius' example.[15] In November 1999, marketing chief Ira Bahr convinced Margolese to again change the name of the company,[citation needed] this time to Sirius Satellite Radio, in order to avoid association with the soon-to-be-outdated CD technology.[8] Having secured installation deals with automakers, including BMW, Chrysler and Ford,[14] Sirius launched the initial phase of its service in four cities on February 14, 2002,[16] expanding to the rest of the contiguous United States on July 1, 2002.[17]
In November 2001, Margolese stepped down as CEO, remaining as chairman until November 2003, with Sirius issuing a statement thanking him "for his great vision, leadership and dedication in creating both Sirius and the satellite radio industry."[18] Joe Clayton, former CEO of Global Crossing, followed as CEO from November 2001 until November 2004; stayed on as chairman until July 2008.[19] Mel Karmazin, former president of Viacom, became CEO in November 2004 and remained in that position through the merger, until December 2012.[20][21]
Early days of XM[edit]
Main article: XM Satellite Radio
The origin of XM Satellite Radio was a Petition for Rulemaking filed at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) by regulatory attorney and Founder of Satellite CD Radio Martine Rothblatt, to establish frequencies and licensing rules for the world's first-ever Satellite Digital Audio Radio Service (SDARS).[22][23] On May 18, 1990, Satellite CD Radio, Inc. (SCDR) filed a Petition for Rule Making in which it requested spectrum to offer Compact Disc quality digital audio radio service to be delivered by satellites and complementary radio transmitters.[24] Following the Allocation NPRM, the FCC established a December 15, 1992 cut-off date for applications proposing satellite DARS to be considered in conjunction with CD Radio's application.[25][26] One such application came from American Mobile Radio Corporation (AMRC), the predecessor company to XM Satellite Radio.[27] XM Satellite Radio was founded by Lon Levin and Gary Parsons.[28][29] It has its origins in the 1988 formation of the American Mobile Satellite Corporation (AMSC), a consortium of several organizations originally dedicated to satellite broadcasting of telephone, fax, and data signals.[30] In 1992, AMSC established a unit called the American Mobile Radio Corporation, dedicated to developing a satellite-based digital radio service; this was spun off as XM Satellite Radio Holdings, Inc. in 1998.[31][32] Its planned financing was complete by July 2000, at which point XM had raised $1.26 billion and secured installation agreements with General Motors, Honda, and Toyota.[14][33] Initially scheduled for September 12, 2001, XM's service start date was postponed due to the September 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and The Pentagon.[34] XM Satellite Radio's first broadcast was on September 25, 2001, nearly four months before Sirius.[17]
Gary Parsons served as chairman of XM Satellite Radio from its inception through the merger, and resigned from the position in November 2009.[29] Hugh Panero served as XM's CEO from 1998 until July 2007, shortly after the merger with Sirius was proposed. Nate Davis was appointed interim CEO until the merger was completed, at which point Sirius CEO Mel Karmazin took over as CEO of the newly merged company, Sirius XM.[35]
Merger[edit]



Wikinews has related news: In depth: XM and Sirius merger


Announcement[edit]
After years of speculation (the New York Post first reported on a potential merger in January 2005)[20] and three months of serious negotiations, the $13 billion merger between Sirius and XM was officially announced on February 19, 2007.[36] At the time, the nation's only two satellite radio providers reported nearly 14 million combined subscribers (with nearly 8 million belonging to XM), with neither having turned an annual profit. Sirius was valued at $5.2 billion, and XM at $3.75 billion.[30] Each subscription was sold for $12.95 monthly.[37]
XM and Sirius executives felt the merger would lower programming costs by eliminating overlapping stations and duplicated marketing costs. According to their original operating licenses, the two companies were not allowed to ever own each other's license. In proceeding with the merger, Sirius CEO Mel Karmazin ignored this rule, gambling that the FCC would consider other audio entertainment to be competitors and allow the merger to proceed by waiving the rule.[36][38]
Approval[edit]
After a 57-week review process, the Justice Department approved the Sirius and XM merger on March 24, 2008, concluding that satellite radio competes with terrestrial radio, online streaming, and mp3 players and tablets.[38][39] On July 25, 2008, the FCC approved the merger with a 3–2 vote, determining that it was not a monopoly because of all the competition on the Internet. FCC chairman Kevin Martin stated, "The merger is in the public interest and will provide consumers with greater flexibility and choices."
The biggest challenge for the newly unified company was selling more subscriptions with the drop in the number of cars sold annually in the US, the subsequent reduced demand for cars equipped with satellite radio, as well as online radio-streaming competition. Conditions of the merger included allowing any third-party company to make satellite radio devices; producing new radios that can receive both XM and Sirius channels within one year; allowing consumers to choose which channels they would like to have; freezing subscription rates for three years; setting aside 8% of its channels for noncommercial programmers; and paying $19.7 million in fines for past rule violations.[40][41] Sirius and XM began merging their channels on November 12, 2008.[42]
Each share of XM stock was replaced with 4.6 shares of Sirius stock. Each company's stockholders initially retained approximately 50% of the joined company.[43]
At the time of the merger, Sirius' top programming included channels for NPR, Howard Stern, and Martha Stewart; live NBA and NFL games; and live NASCAR races. XM's programming included channels for Willie Nelson, Opie and Anthony, Snoop Dogg, and Oprah Winfrey; and live Major League Baseball games.[39]
Opposition[edit]
The National Association of Broadcasters was adamantly opposed to the merger, calling it a monopoly.[36] Shortly after the Justice Department gave its support to the merger without restrictions, attorneys general from 11 states (Connecticut, Iowa, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Utah, and Washington) urged the FCC to impose restrictions on the merger.[44] Several Congressional Democrats also opposed the merger, calling it anticompetitive and criticizing the Bush administration for allowing it to go through.[39]
Post-merger[edit]
Resurgence and growth[edit]
After coming close to filing for Chapter 11 only months after the 2008 merger, having gone so far as to hire lawyers to prepare a possible bankruptcy filing,[45] Sirius XM was able to avoid declaring bankruptcy with the assistance of a $530 million loan from Liberty Media in February 2009, which Mel Karmazin negotiated in exchange for a 40% equity stake in Sirius XM.[46][47]
In the fourth quarter of 2009, Sirius XM posted a profit for the first time, with a net income of $14.2 million. This came after net losses of $245.8 million in the year following the merger. The company's resurgence was owed in part to the loan from Liberty Media. Increased automobile sales in the US was also a factor. Sirius XM ended 2009 with 18.8 million subscribers.[46] By the end of 2012, Sirius XM's subscriber base had grown to 23.9 million, mostly due to an increase in partnerships with automakers and car dealers; a strong push in the used-car market; and continued improved car sales in the US in general. The renewal of radio show host Howard Stern's contract through 2015 ($400 million for five years, $100 million less than Stern's previous five-year deal) was also a factor in the company's steady growth; Stern's show attracted over 12 million listeners per week.[47][48]
As of 2012, Sirius XM had a 60% penetration rate in the new car market. Out of that 60%, approximately 45% became subscribers. The company has long-term deals with General Motors, Ford, Toyota, Kia, Bentley, BMW, Volkswagen, Nissan, Hyundai,Suzuki and Mitsubishi,along with assorted trucks, boats and recreational vehicles. As of August 2012, Sirius XM satellite radios were in 50 million cars. The company offers trial subscriptions to new car owners, and then tries to get them to purchase yearly subscriptions. By 2018, Sirius XM predicts over 100 million cars will have Sirius XM radios installed.[48][49]
After trying for four years, on December 21, 2010, Sirius XM received approval from the FCC to add service in Alaska and Hawaii. Sirius XM announced on January 17, 2011 that it would place repeaters in those states and adjust three of its satellites to cover those areas. The move gave Sirius XM coverage in all 50 states.[50]
On January 12, 2011, XM Satellite Radio, Inc. was dissolved as a separate entity and merged into Sirius XM Radio, Inc.[51] On April 11, 2011, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) approved the merger of Sirius and XM's Canadian affiliates in SiriusXM Canada.[52]
On April 11, 2013, a New York appeals court upheld a New York judge's ruling, from April 2012, that Howard Stern was not entitled to stock bonuses based on Sirius XM's exceeding subscriber target projections. The court ruled that subscribers to XM Satellite Radio from before the Sirius XM merger should not be counted as "Sirius subscribers" for the purposes of Stern's lawsuit. Stern argued the opposite, because his popularity had played an integral role in helping Sirius acquire XM. He had been seeking $330 million in stock bonuses.[53][54]
In April 2016, Sirius XM surpassed 30 million total subscribers.[55]
Executives[edit]
Following the merger, Sirius CEO Mel Karmazin became CEO of the combined company, and XM chairman Gary Parsons retained his role.[56] XM CEO and co-founder Hugh Panero stepped down in August 2007, shortly after the merger was first announced.[5]
XM Satellite Radio executives who were not offered jobs in the new combined company were assured golden parachute severance packages that had been approved in 2007. Former CEO Nate Davis received a severance package worth $10 million. Erik Toppenberg, executive vice president of programming, received a severance package worth $5.34 million. CFO Joseph Euteneuer received a severance package worth $4.9 million. Vernon Irvin, chief marketing officer, received a severance package worth $4.5 million.[57]
In November 2009, Parsons resigned as chairman of Sirius XM, receiving a payout of more than $9 million.[29][57] He was succeeded by Eddy Hartenstein, former publisher and CEO of the Los Angeles Times.[29] In December 2012, Mel Karmazin stepped down as Sirius XM CEO after Liberty Media gained control of 49.5% of the company. James E. Meyer was named interim CEO.[58] On April 30, 2013, he was named permanent CEO.[59] Also in April 2013, Liberty Media CEO Greg Maffei was named Sirius XM's chairman, succeeding Hartenstein.[60]
Internet and mobile[edit]
Sirius XM radio content is available to stream online either as an add-on to existing subscriptions or as an Internet-only option.[61] Internet and mobile services directly challenging Sirius XM include iHeartRadio, Pandora, and Spotify.[47]
In August 2011, SiriusXM announced that the company would start offering a personalized interactive online radio experience, similar to that offered by Pandora. The feature would allow listeners to replay, skip, and ban songs on certain channels.[62] MySXM debuted on April 15, 2013, allowing users to fine-tune over 50 existing Sirius XM channels. MySXM is available to all Sirius XM subscribers.[61][63]
On June 17, 2009, Sirius XM released an application for use on Apple's iPhone and iPod Touch, allowing its subscribers to listen to its programming on those devices. The app did not feature all of the programming available to satellite listeners.[64] On March 17, 2011, the app was also made available for the iPad.[65] In 2012, the app was updated for iOS and Android, featuring additional content, and the ability to pause, rewind, and fast-forward through audio streams.[66]

On February 4, 2010, the Sirius XM BlackBerry application was announced, for use on BlackBerry smartphones (the Bold, Curve, Storm, and Tour).[67] As of April 2013, the app featured over 150 channels.[68]
On May 28, 2010, the Sirius XM application for Android smartphones was announced.[69] As of April 2013, the app features over 130 channels.[70]
As part of Howard Stern's new five-year contract with Sirius XM, which he signed on December 9, 2010, The Howard Stern Show, which hadn't previously been made available on mobile devices, would now be a part of Sirius XM's mobile app package.[71]
On March 18, 2015, SiriusXM released a refreshed user interface of the application on Android and iOS.[72]
Subscriptions[edit]
Following the merger, Sirius XM jettisoned the simplicity of previous monthly subscription models and began offering numerous new options, including a la carte offerings, a family-friendly version, and "mostly music" or "news, sports, and talk" packages, ranging in price from $6.99 to $16.99 per month.[73] As of April 2013, almost all music, talk and news programming is available on both Sirius, XM and SiriusXM Internet Radio services.[74]
Prior to the merger, Sirius offered, for a one-time fee, a lifetime subscription (lasting the lifetime of the receiver, not the subscriber).[30] After the merger, due to changes in bundling policies, some customers who had purchased lifetime subscriptions had their service reduced or canceled, and were unable to obtain a refund.[75][76]
Legal settlement[edit]
On December 4, 2014, Sirius XM Holdings agreed to a $3.8 million USD settlement with 45 states and the District of Columbia, over a suit initiated by the Ohio Attorney General, Mike DeWine, stemming from the company's billing and service renewal practices. The suit alleged Sirius XM Holdings was engaged in "misleading, unfair and deceptive acts or practices in violation of state consumer protection laws," Attorney General DeWine said.[77]
Programming[edit]
Main article: List of Sirius XM Radio channels
From the outset, Sirius and XM each attracted celebrity personalities to host shows. Broadminded, Bob Dylan, Tony Hawk, Bam Margera, Opie and Anthony Tom Petty, Ron & Fez, Howard Stern, Martha Stewart, and Oprah Winfrey are among those who signed contracts with one of the two companies. Exclusive sports programming (Major League Soccer, NASCAR, and the Canadian Football League, National Football League, and Premier League on Sirius, and Indy Racing League, Major League Baseball, National Basketball Association, National Hockey League, and PGA Tour on XM) initially differentiated the networks from one another.
Internet[edit]
The internet player allows subscribers to customize most stations to their liking by adjusting settings like: familiar/hits or unfamiliar/depth, studio recordings or live performances, and new/recent or old/classic material. These customized stations also allow listeners to play music without DJ interruptions. Paid subscribers can skip as many tracks as they like and can replay songs.
Canadian counterparts[edit]
Main article: SiriusXM Canada
In Canada, Sirius Canada and XM Canada were partially owned by Sirius XM (20% and 23.3% respectively) in joint ventures with Canadian companies.[78] After the US merger, the two Canadian ventures did not immediately agree to a similar merger, but instead remained in competition as distinct services.[79] Complicating matters was that Sirius Canada has nearly 80% of the total satellite radio subscriber base in that country, and felt they deserved greater than a 50/50 split of the new company, whereas XM Canada felt their deal with the NHL—a particularly lucrative prize in Canadian sports broadcasting—also warranted a significant amount of value in the new company.[79]
On November 24, 2010, XM Radio Canada and Sirius Canada announced that they would merge their services.[80] On April 12, 2011, the CRTC approved the companies' merger into SiriusXM Canada.[81] John Bitove's Canadian Satellite Radio Holdings Inc., the licensee of XM Canada, gained a 30% share in the new company as its primary and controlling shareholder, while Slaight Communications and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the current owners of Sirius Canada, each retained 20% ownership. Sirius XM's American parent company would hold 25%.[52] The merger was completed on June 21, 2011.[82]
Technical[edit]
Receivers[edit]
XM and Sirius use different compression and conditional access systems, making their receivers incompatible with each other's service. A condition of the merger was that Sirius XM would bring to the market satellite radios that can receive both XM and Sirius channels within one year.[41] The interoperable radio, called the MiRGE, was made available beginning in March 2009.[83] but the receiver was soon discontinued after both services eliminated duplicate channels which obviated the need for this radio. As of February 2016[update], Sirius XM offers radios for home, office, automotive, marine, and aviation use.[84]
Satellites[edit]
As of May 2017[update], there are five satellites in orbit: two XM and two Sirius satellites and one spare.[85]XM-3 and XM-4 are the active satellites for the XM service and replaced the original XM-1 and XM-2 satellites which were placed into a disposal orbit. Sirius FM-5 and FM-6 function as the primaries for the Sirius side. FM-6 which was launched on October 25, 2013 and declared ready for service on December 2, 2013 initially served as an in orbit spare while the company worked to deploy repeaters for the Sirius side which were needed to transition to full geostationary operation. In 2016 FM-6 was put into active service and officially replaced Sirius originals FM1-4 which operated in elliptical orbit. FM1-3 were later placed into disposal orbits. With this change FM-5 and FM-6 exclusively serve the Sirius service mirroring XM-3 and 4. Before FM-6 was launched, XM-5 was sent into orbit by Proton from Kazakhstan, on October 14, 2010, and is capable of broadcasting to either service.[86].[87] XM-5 serves as the in orbit spare for the entire system and can function in place of either a Sirius or XM satellite. In late 2016 Sirius XM placed an order for two new satellites SXM-7 and SXM-8 which will replace XM-3 and XM-4. These are scheduled for launch in 2019 and 2020 respectively.
Sirius satellites broadcast within the S band frequencies from 2.3200–2.3325 GHz, while XM radio uses adjacent frequencies 2.3325–2.3450 GHz.[88][89]

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.      Key Stock Data    P/E Ratio (TTM)  36.19 (07/28/17)      EPS (TTM)  $0.16      Market Cap $26.89 B     Shares Outstanding 4.67 B     Public Float 1.49 B     Yield 0.69% (07/28/17)      Latest Dividend $0.01 (08/31/17)      Ex-Dividend Date 08/08/17       ?    Shares Sold Short The total number of shares of a security that have been sold short and not yet repurchased. Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month. Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.      Short Interest (07/14/17)    Shares Sold Short 255.72 M     Change from Last  3.37%      Percent of Float 17.13%       ?    Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    0.59      Net Money Flow ($)  -4.71 M    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock. A ratio above one suggests greater buying pressure, below one suggests greater selling.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Sirius XM Holdings Inc.SIRI was a big mover last session, as its shares rose over 8% on the day. The move came on solid volume too with far more shares changing hands than in a normal session. This breaks the recent trend of the company, as the stock is now trading above the volatile price range $5.34 to $5.48 in the past one-month time frame.None of the estimates for this stock were revised over the past 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate also remained unchanged over the same time frame. Yesterday's price action is encouraging though, so make sure to keep a close watch on this firm in the near future.Sirius XM Holdings currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Sirius XM Holdings Inc. PriceSirius XM Holdings Inc. Price | Sirius XM Holdings Inc. QuoteAnother top-ranked stock in the Broadcast Radio and Television space is Gray Television, Inc. GTN , sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Is SIRI going up? Or down? Predict to see what others think: Up or DownThe Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All                 Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce "the world's first trillionaires," but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

Sirius XM Satellite Radio is an American broadcasting company that provides three satellite radio and online radio services operating in the United States: Sirius Satellite Radio, XM Satellite Radio, and Sirius XM Radio. The company also has a major investment in Canada called SiriusXM Canada, an affiliate company that provides Sirius and XM service in Canada. At the end of 2013, Sirius reorganized their corporate structure, which made Sirius XM Radio Inc. a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Sirius XM Holdings, Inc.[3]
Sirius XM Radio was formed after the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved the acquisition of XM Satellite Radio Holding, Inc. by Sirius Satellite Radio, Inc. on July 29, 2008, 17 months after the companies first proposed the merger.[4] The merger brought the combined companies a total of more than 18.5 million subscribers based on current subscriber numbers on the date of merging.[4] The deal was valued at $3.3 billion, not including debt.[5] Through Q3 2016, Sirius XM has 31 million subscribers.[6]
The proposed merger was opposed by those who felt a merger would create a monopoly. Sirius and XM argued that a merger was the only way that satellite radio could survive.[5]

Pre-merger[edit]
Early days of Sirius[edit]
Main article: Sirius Satellite Radio
Sirius Satellite Radio was founded by Martine Rothblatt, David Margolese, and Robert Briskman.[7][8] In 1990, Rothblatt founded Satellite CD Radio in Washington, DC.[7][9] The company was the first to petition the FCC to assign unused frequencies for satellite radio broadcast, which "provoked a furor among owners of both large and small [terrestrial] radio stations."[9] In April 1992, Rothblatt resigned as chairman and CEO to start a medical research foundation.[7] Former NASA engineer Briskman, who designed the company's satellite technology, was then appointed chairman and CEO.[10][11] Six months later, in November 1992, Rogers Wireless co-founder Margolese, who had provided financial backing for the venture, acquired control of the company and succeeded Briskman. Margolese renamed the company CD Radio, and spent the next five years lobbying the FCC to allow satellite radio to be deployed, and the following five years raising $1.6 billion, which was used to build and launch three satellites into elliptical orbit from Kazakhstan in July 2000.[11][12][13][14] In 1997, after Margolese had obtained regulatory clearance and "effectively created the industry," the FCC also sold a license to XM Satellite Radio, which followed Sirius' example.[15] In November 1999, marketing chief Ira Bahr convinced Margolese to again change the name of the company,[citation needed] this time to Sirius Satellite Radio, in order to avoid association with the soon-to-be-outdated CD technology.[8] Having secured installation deals with automakers, including BMW, Chrysler and Ford,[14] Sirius launched the initial phase of its service in four cities on February 14, 2002,[16] expanding to the rest of the contiguous United States on July 1, 2002.[17]
In November 2001, Margolese stepped down as CEO, remaining as chairman until November 2003, with Sirius issuing a statement thanking him "for his great vision, leadership and dedication in creating both Sirius and the satellite radio industry."[18] Joe Clayton, former CEO of Global Crossing, followed as CEO from November 2001 until November 2004; stayed on as chairman until July 2008.[19] Mel Karmazin, former president of Viacom, became CEO in November 2004 and remained in that position through the merger, until December 2012.[20][21]
Early days of XM[edit]
Main article: XM Satellite Radio
The origin of XM Satellite Radio was a Petition for Rulemaking filed at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) by regulatory attorney and Founder of Satellite CD Radio Martine Rothblatt, to establish frequencies and licensing rules for the world's first-ever Satellite Digital Audio Radio Service (SDARS).[22][23] On May 18, 1990, Satellite CD Radio, Inc. (SCDR) filed a Petition for Rule Making in which it requested spectrum to offer Compact Disc quality digital audio radio service to be delivered by satellites and complementary radio transmitters.[24] Following the Allocation NPRM, the FCC established a December 15, 1992 cut-off date for applications proposing satellite DARS to be considered in conjunction with CD Radio's application.[25][26] One such application came from American Mobile Radio Corporation (AMRC), the predecessor company to XM Satellite Radio.[27] XM Satellite Radio was founded by Lon Levin and Gary Parsons.[28][29] It has its origins in the 1988 formation of the American Mobile Satellite Corporation (AMSC), a consortium of several organizations originally dedicated to satellite broadcasting of telephone, fax, and data signals.[30] In 1992, AMSC established a unit called the American Mobile Radio Corporation, dedicated to developing a satellite-based digital radio service; this was spun off as XM Satellite Radio Holdings, Inc. in 1998.[31][32] Its planned financing was complete by July 2000, at which point XM had raised $1.26 billion and secured installation agreements with General Motors, Honda, and Toyota.[14][33] Initially scheduled for September 12, 2001, XM's service start date was postponed due to the September 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and The Pentagon.[34] XM Satellite Radio's first broadcast was on September 25, 2001, nearly four months before Sirius.[17]
Gary Parsons served as chairman of XM Satellite Radio from its inception through the merger, and resigned from the position in November 2009.[29] Hugh Panero served as XM's CEO from 1998 until July 2007, shortly after the merger with Sirius was proposed. Nate Davis was appointed interim CEO until the merger was completed, at which point Sirius CEO Mel Karmazin took over as CEO of the newly merged company, Sirius XM.[35]
Merger[edit]



Wikinews has related news: In depth: XM and Sirius merger


Announcement[edit]
After years of speculation (the New York Post first reported on a potential merger in January 2005)[20] and three months of serious negotiations, the $13 billion merger between Sirius and XM was officially announced on February 19, 2007.[36] At the time, the nation's only two satellite radio providers reported nearly 14 million combined subscribers (with nearly 8 million belonging to XM), with neither having turned an annual profit. Sirius was valued at $5.2 billion, and XM at $3.75 billion.[30] Each subscription was sold for $12.95 monthly.[37]
XM and Sirius executives felt the merger would lower programming costs by eliminating overlapping stations and duplicated marketing costs. According to their original operating licenses, the two companies were not allowed to ever own each other's license. In proceeding with the merger, Sirius CEO Mel Karmazin ignored this rule, gambling that the FCC would consider other audio entertainment to be competitors and allow the merger to proceed by waiving the rule.[36][38]
Approval[edit]
After a 57-week review process, the Justice Department approved the Sirius and XM merger on March 24, 2008, concluding that satellite radio competes with terrestrial radio, online streaming, and mp3 players and tablets.[38][39] On July 25, 2008, the FCC approved the merger with a 3–2 vote, determining that it was not a monopoly because of all the competition on the Internet. FCC chairman Kevin Martin stated, "The merger is in the public interest and will provide consumers with greater flexibility and choices."
The biggest challenge for the newly unified company was selling more subscriptions with the drop in the number of cars sold annually in the US, the subsequent reduced demand for cars equipped with satellite radio, as well as online radio-streaming competition. Conditions of the merger included allowing any third-party company to make satellite radio devices; producing new radios that can receive both XM and Sirius channels within one year; allowing consumers to choose which channels they would like to have; freezing subscription rates for three years; setting aside 8% of its channels for noncommercial programmers; and paying $19.7 million in fines for past rule violations.[40][41] Sirius and XM began merging their channels on November 12, 2008.[42]
Each share of XM stock was replaced with 4.6 shares of Sirius stock. Each company's stockholders initially retained approximately 50% of the joined company.[43]
At the time of the merger, Sirius' top programming included channels for NPR, Howard Stern, and Martha Stewart; live NBA and NFL games; and live NASCAR races. XM's programming included channels for Willie Nelson, Opie and Anthony, Snoop Dogg, and Oprah Winfrey; and live Major League Baseball games.[39]
Opposition[edit]
The National Association of Broadcasters was adamantly opposed to the merger, calling it a monopoly.[36] Shortly after the Justice Department gave its support to the merger without restrictions, attorneys general from 11 states (Connecticut, Iowa, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Utah, and Washington) urged the FCC to impose restrictions on the merger.[44] Several Congressional Democrats also opposed the merger, calling it anticompetitive and criticizing the Bush administration for allowing it to go through.[39]
Post-merger[edit]
Resurgence and growth[edit]
After coming close to filing for Chapter 11 only months after the 2008 merger, having gone so far as to hire lawyers to prepare a possible bankruptcy filing,[45] Sirius XM was able to avoid declaring bankruptcy with the assistance of a $530 million loan from Liberty Media in February 2009, which Mel Karmazin negotiated in exchange for a 40% equity stake in Sirius XM.[46][47]
In the fourth quarter of 2009, Sirius XM posted a profit for the first time, with a net income of $14.2 million. This came after net losses of $245.8 million in the year following the merger. The company's resurgence was owed in part to the loan from Liberty Media. Increased automobile sales in the US was also a factor. Sirius XM ended 2009 with 18.8 million subscribers.[46] By the end of 2012, Sirius XM's subscriber base had grown to 23.9 million, mostly due to an increase in partnerships with automakers and car dealers; a strong push in the used-car market; and continued improved car sales in the US in general. The renewal of radio show host Howard Stern's contract through 2015 ($400 million for five years, $100 million less than Stern's previous five-year deal) was also a factor in the company's steady growth; Stern's show attracted over 12 million listeners per week.[47][48]
As of 2012, Sirius XM had a 60% penetration rate in the new car market. Out of that 60%, approximately 45% became subscribers. The company has long-term deals with General Motors, Ford, Toyota, Kia, Bentley, BMW, Volkswagen, Nissan, Hyundai,Suzuki and Mitsubishi,along with assorted trucks, boats and recreational vehicles. As of August 2012, Sirius XM satellite radios were in 50 million cars. The company offers trial subscriptions to new car owners, and then tries to get them to purchase yearly subscriptions. By 2018, Sirius XM predicts over 100 million cars will have Sirius XM radios installed.[48][49]
After trying for four years, on December 21, 2010, Sirius XM received approval from the FCC to add service in Alaska and Hawaii. Sirius XM announced on January 17, 2011 that it would place repeaters in those states and adjust three of its satellites to cover those areas. The move gave Sirius XM coverage in all 50 states.[50]
On January 12, 2011, XM Satellite Radio, Inc. was dissolved as a separate entity and merged into Sirius XM Radio, Inc.[51] On April 11, 2011, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) approved the merger of Sirius and XM's Canadian affiliates in SiriusXM Canada.[52]
On April 11, 2013, a New York appeals court upheld a New York judge's ruling, from April 2012, that Howard Stern was not entitled to stock bonuses based on Sirius XM's exceeding subscriber target projections. The court ruled that subscribers to XM Satellite Radio from before the Sirius XM merger should not be counted as "Sirius subscribers" for the purposes of Stern's lawsuit. Stern argued the opposite, because his popularity had played an integral role in helping Sirius acquire XM. He had been seeking $330 million in stock bonuses.[53][54]
In April 2016, Sirius XM surpassed 30 million total subscribers.[55]
Executives[edit]
Following the merger, Sirius CEO Mel Karmazin became CEO of the combined company, and XM chairman Gary Parsons retained his role.[56] XM CEO and co-founder Hugh Panero stepped down in August 2007, shortly after the merger was first announced.[5]
XM Satellite Radio executives who were not offered jobs in the new combined company were assured golden parachute severance packages that had been approved in 2007. Former CEO Nate Davis received a severance package worth $10 million. Erik Toppenberg, executive vice president of programming, received a severance package worth $5.34 million. CFO Joseph Euteneuer received a severance package worth $4.9 million. Vernon Irvin, chief marketing officer, received a severance package worth $4.5 million.[57]
In November 2009, Parsons resigned as chairman of Sirius XM, receiving a payout of more than $9 million.[29][57] He was succeeded by Eddy Hartenstein, former publisher and CEO of the Los Angeles Times.[29] In December 2012, Mel Karmazin stepped down as Sirius XM CEO after Liberty Media gained control of 49.5% of the company. James E. Meyer was named interim CEO.[58] On April 30, 2013, he was named permanent CEO.[59] Also in April 2013, Liberty Media CEO Greg Maffei was named Sirius XM's chairman, succeeding Hartenstein.[60]
Internet and mobile[edit]
Sirius XM radio content is available to stream online either as an add-on to existing subscriptions or as an Internet-only option.[61] Internet and mobile services directly challenging Sirius XM include iHeartRadio, Pandora, and Spotify.[47]
In August 2011, SiriusXM announced that the company would start offering a personalized interactive online radio experience, similar to that offered by Pandora. The feature would allow listeners to replay, skip, and ban songs on certain channels.[62] MySXM debuted on April 15, 2013, allowing users to fine-tune over 50 existing Sirius XM channels. MySXM is available to all Sirius XM subscribers.[61][63]
On June 17, 2009, Sirius XM released an application for use on Apple's iPhone and iPod Touch, allowing its subscribers to listen to its programming on those devices. The app did not feature all of the programming available to satellite listeners.[64] On March 17, 2011, the app was also made available for the iPad.[65] In 2012, the app was updated for iOS and Android, featuring additional content, and the ability to pause, rewind, and fast-forward through audio streams.[66]




Sirius XM's mobile app (version 3.0), as seen on the iPad Mini


On February 4, 2010, the Sirius XM BlackBerry application was announced, for use on BlackBerry smartphones (the Bold, Curve, Storm, and Tour).[67] As of April 2013, the app featured over 150 channels.[68]
On May 28, 2010, the Sirius XM application for Android smartphones was announced.[69] As of April 2013, the app features over 130 channels.[70]
As part of Howard Stern's new five-year contract with Sirius XM, which he signed on December 9, 2010, The Howard Stern Show, which hadn't previously been made available on mobile devices, would now be a part of Sirius XM's mobile app package.[71]
On March 18, 2015, SiriusXM released a refreshed user interface of the application on Android and iOS.[72]
Subscriptions[edit]
Following the merger, Sirius XM jettisoned the simplicity of previous monthly subscription models and began offering numerous new options, including a la carte offerings, a family-friendly version, and "mostly music" or "news, sports, and talk" packages, ranging in price from $6.99 to $16.99 per month.[73] As of April 2013, almost all music, talk and news programming is available on both Sirius, XM and SiriusXM Internet Radio services.[74]
Prior to the merger, Sirius offered, for a one-time fee, a lifetime subscription (lasting the lifetime of the receiver, not the subscriber).[30] After the merger, due to changes in bundling policies, some customers who had purchased lifetime subscriptions had their service reduced or canceled, and were unable to obtain a refund.[75][76]
Legal settlement[edit]
On December 4, 2014, Sirius XM Holdings agreed to a $3.8 million USD settlement with 45 states and the District of Columbia, over a suit initiated by the Ohio Attorney General, Mike DeWine, stemming from the company's billing and service renewal practices. The suit alleged Sirius XM Holdings was engaged in "misleading, unfair and deceptive acts or practices in violation of state consumer protection laws," Attorney General DeWine said.[77]
Programming[edit]
Main article: List of Sirius XM Radio channels
From the outset, Sirius and XM each attracted celebrity personalities to host shows. Broadminded, Bob Dylan, Tony Hawk, Bam Margera, Opie and Anthony Tom Petty, Ron & Fez, Howard Stern, Martha Stewart, and Oprah Winfrey are among those who signed contracts with one of the two companies. Exclusive sports programming (Major League Soccer, NASCAR, and the Canadian Football League, National Football League, and Premier League on Sirius, and Indy Racing League, Major League Baseball, National Basketball Association, National Hockey League, and PGA Tour on XM) initially differentiated the networks from one another.
Internet[edit]
The internet player allows subscribers to customize most stations to their liking by adjusting settings like: familiar/hits or unfamiliar/depth, studio recordings or live performances, and new/recent or old/classic material. These customized stations also allow listeners to play music without DJ interruptions. Paid subscribers can skip as many tracks as they like and can replay songs.
Canadian counterparts[edit]
Main article: SiriusXM Canada
In Canada, Sirius Canada and XM Canada were partially owned by Sirius XM (20% and 23.3% respectively) in joint ventures with Canadian companies.[78] After the US merger, the two Canadian ventures did not immediately agree to a similar merger, but instead remained in competition as distinct services.[79] Complicating matters was that Sirius Canada has nearly 80% of the total satellite radio subscriber base in that country, and felt they deserved greater than a 50/50 split of the new company, whereas XM Canada felt their deal with the NHL—a particularly lucrative prize in Canadian sports broadcasting—also warranted a significant amount of value in the new company.[79]
On November 24, 2010, XM Radio Canada and Sirius Canada announced that they would merge their services.[80] On April 12, 2011, the CRTC approved the companies' merger into SiriusXM Canada.[81] John Bitove's Canadian Satellite Radio Holdings Inc., the licensee of XM Canada, gained a 30% share in the new company as its primary and controlling shareholder, while Slaight Communications and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the current owners of Sirius Canada, each retained 20% ownership. Sirius XM's American parent company would hold 25%.[52] The merger was completed on June 21, 2011.[82]
Technical[edit]
Receivers[edit]
XM and Sirius use different compression and conditional access systems, making their receivers incompatible with each other's service. A condition of the merger was that Sirius XM would bring to the market satellite radios that can receive both XM and Sirius channels within one year.[41] The interoperable radio, called the MiRGE, was made available beginning in March 2009.[83] but the receiver was soon discontinued after both services eliminated duplicate channels which obviated the need for this radio. As of February 2016[update], Sirius XM offers radios for home, office, automotive, marine, and aviation use.[84]
Satellites[edit]
As of May 2017[update], there are five satellites in orbit: two XM and two Sirius satellites and one spare.[85]XM-3 and XM-4 are the active satellites for the XM service and replaced the original XM-1 and XM-2 satellites which were placed into a disposal orbit. Sirius FM-5 and FM-6 function as the primaries for the Sirius side. FM-6 which was launched on October 25, 2013 and declared ready for service on December 2, 2013 initially served as an in orbit spare while the company worked to deploy repeaters for the Sirius side which were needed to transition to full geostationary operation. In 2016 FM-6 was put into active service and officially replaced Sirius originals FM1-4 which operated in elliptical orbit. FM1-3 were later placed into disposal orbits. With this change FM-5 and FM-6 exclusively serve the Sirius service mirroring XM-3 and 4. Before FM-6 was launched, XM-5 was sent into orbit by Proton from Kazakhstan, on October 14, 2010, and is capable of broadcasting to either service.[86].[87] XM-5 serves as the in orbit spare for the entire system and can function in place of either a Sirius or XM satellite. In late 2016 Sirius XM placed an order for two new satellites SXM-7 and SXM-8 which will replace XM-3 and XM-4. These are scheduled for launch in 2019 and 2020 respectively.
Sirius satellites broadcast within the S band frequencies from 2.3200–2.3325 GHz, while XM radio uses adjacent frequencies 2.3325–2.3450 GHz.[88][89]

Sirius XM Satellite Radio is an American broadcasting company that provides three satellite radio and online radio services operating in the United States: Sirius Satellite Radio, XM Satellite Radio, and Sirius XM Radio. The company also has a major investment in Canada called SiriusXM Canada, an affiliate company that provides Sirius and XM service in Canada. At the end of 2013, Sirius reorganized their corporate structure, which made Sirius XM Radio Inc. a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Sirius XM Holdings, Inc.[3]
Sirius XM Radio was formed after the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved the acquisition of XM Satellite Radio Holding, Inc. by Sirius Satellite Radio, Inc. on July 29, 2008, 17 months after the companies first proposed the merger.[4] The merger brought the combined companies a total of more than 18.5 million subscribers based on current subscriber numbers on the date of merging.[4] The deal was valued at $3.3 billion, not including debt.[5] Through Q3 2016, Sirius XM has 31 million subscribers.[6]
The proposed merger was opposed by those who felt a merger would create a monopoly. Sirius and XM argued that a merger was the only way that satellite radio could survive.[5]

Pre-merger[edit]
Early days of Sirius[edit]
Main article: Sirius Satellite Radio
Sirius Satellite Radio was founded by Martine Rothblatt, David Margolese, and Robert Briskman.[7][8] In 1990, Rothblatt founded Satellite CD Radio in Washington, DC.[7][9] The company was the first to petition the FCC to assign unused frequencies for satellite radio broadcast, which "provoked a furor among owners of both large and small [terrestrial] radio stations."[9] In April 1992, Rothblatt resigned as chairman and CEO to start a medical research foundation.[7] Former NASA engineer Briskman, who designed the company's satellite technology, was then appointed chairman and CEO.[10][11] Six months later, in November 1992, Rogers Wireless co-founder Margolese, who had provided financial backing for the venture, acquired control of the company and succeeded Briskman. Margolese renamed the company CD Radio, and spent the next five years lobbying the FCC to allow satellite radio to be deployed, and the following five years raising $1.6 billion, which was used to build and launch three satellites into elliptical orbit from Kazakhstan in July 2000.[11][12][13][14] In 1997, after Margolese had obtained regulatory clearance and "effectively created the industry," the FCC also sold a license to XM Satellite Radio, which followed Sirius' example.[15] In November 1999, marketing chief Ira Bahr convinced Margolese to again change the name of the company,[citation needed] this time to Sirius Satellite Radio, in order to avoid association with the soon-to-be-outdated CD technology.[8] Having secured installation deals with automakers, including BMW, Chrysler and Ford,[14] Sirius launched the initial phase of its service in four cities on February 14, 2002,[16] expanding to the rest of the contiguous United States on July 1, 2002.[17]
In November 2001, Margolese stepped down as CEO, remaining as chairman until November 2003, with Sirius issuing a statement thanking him "for his great vision, leadership and dedication in creating both Sirius and the satellite radio industry."[18] Joe Clayton, former CEO of Global Crossing, followed as CEO from November 2001 until November 2004; stayed on as chairman until July 2008.[19] Mel Karmazin, former president of Viacom, became CEO in November 2004 and remained in that position through the merger, until December 2012.[20][21]
Early days of XM[edit]
Main article: XM Satellite Radio
The origin of XM Satellite Radio was a Petition for Rulemaking filed at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) by regulatory attorney and Founder of Satellite CD Radio Martine Rothblatt, to establish frequencies and licensing rules for the world's first-ever Satellite Digital Audio Radio Service (SDARS).[22][23] On May 18, 1990, Satellite CD Radio, Inc. (SCDR) filed a Petition for Rule Making in which it requested spectrum to offer Compact Disc quality digital audio radio service to be delivered by satellites and complementary radio transmitters.[24] Following the Allocation NPRM, the FCC established a December 15, 1992 cut-off date for applications proposing satellite DARS to be considered in conjunction with CD Radio's application.[25][26] One such application came from American Mobile Radio Corporation (AMRC), the predecessor company to XM Satellite Radio.[27] XM Satellite Radio was founded by Lon Levin and Gary Parsons.[28][29] It has its origins in the 1988 formation of the American Mobile Satellite Corporation (AMSC), a consortium of several organizations originally dedicated to satellite broadcasting of telephone, fax, and data signals.[30] In 1992, AMSC established a unit called the American Mobile Radio Corporation, dedicated to developing a satellite-based digital radio service; this was spun off as XM Satellite Radio Holdings, Inc. in 1998.[31][32] Its planned financing was complete by July 2000, at which point XM had raised $1.26 billion and secured installation agreements with General Motors, Honda, and Toyota.[14][33] Initially scheduled for September 12, 2001, XM's service start date was postponed due to the September 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and The Pentagon.[34] XM Satellite Radio's first broadcast was on September 25, 2001, nearly four months before Sirius.[17]
Gary Parsons served as chairman of XM Satellite Radio from its inception through the merger, and resigned from the position in November 2009.[29] Hugh Panero served as XM's CEO from 1998 until July 2007, shortly after the merger with Sirius was proposed. Nate Davis was appointed interim CEO until the merger was completed, at which point Sirius CEO Mel Karmazin took over as CEO of the newly merged company, Sirius XM.[35]
Merger[edit]



Wikinews has related news: In depth: XM and Sirius merger


Announcement[edit]
After years of speculation (the New York Post first reported on a potential merger in January 2005)[20] and three months of serious negotiations, the $13 billion merger between Sirius and XM was officially announced on February 19, 2007.[36] At the time, the nation's only two satellite radio providers reported nearly 14 million combined subscribers (with nearly 8 million belonging to XM), with neither having turned an annual profit. Sirius was valued at $5.2 billion, and XM at $3.75 billion.[30] Each subscription was sold for $12.95 monthly.[37]
XM and Sirius executives felt the merger would lower programming costs by eliminating overlapping stations and duplicated marketing costs. According to their original operating licenses, the two companies were not allowed to ever own each other's license. In proceeding with the merger, Sirius CEO Mel Karmazin ignored this rule, gambling that the FCC would consider other audio entertainment to be competitors and allow the merger to proceed by waiving the rule.[36][38]
Approval[edit]
After a 57-week review process, the Justice Department approved the Sirius and XM merger on March 24, 2008, concluding that satellite radio competes with terrestrial radio, online streaming, and mp3 players and tablets.[38][39] On July 25, 2008, the FCC approved the merger with a 3–2 vote, determining that it was not a monopoly because of all the competition on the Internet. FCC chairman Kevin Martin stated, "The merger is in the public interest and will provide consumers with greater flexibility and choices."
The biggest challenge for the newly unified company was selling more subscriptions with the drop in the number of cars sold annually in the US, the subsequent reduced demand for cars equipped with satellite radio, as well as online radio-streaming competition. Conditions of the merger included allowing any third-party company to make satellite radio devices; producing new radios that can receive both XM and Sirius channels within one year; allowing consumers to choose which channels they would like to have; freezing subscription rates for three years; setting aside 8% of its channels for noncommercial programmers; and paying $19.7 million in fines for past rule violations.[40][41] Sirius and XM began merging their channels on November 12, 2008.[42]
Each share of XM stock was replaced with 4.6 shares of Sirius stock. Each company's stockholders initially retained approximately 50% of the joined company.[43]
At the time of the merger, Sirius' top programming included channels for NPR, Howard Stern, and Martha Stewart; live NBA and NFL games; and live NASCAR races. XM's programming included channels for Willie Nelson, Opie and Anthony, Snoop Dogg, and Oprah Winfrey; and live Major League Baseball games.[39]
Opposition[edit]
The National Association of Broadcasters was adamantly opposed to the merger, calling it a monopoly.[36] Shortly after the Justice Department gave its support to the merger without restrictions, attorneys general from 11 states (Connecticut, Iowa, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Utah, and Washington) urged the FCC to impose restrictions on the merger.[44] Several Congressional Democrats also opposed the merger, calling it anticompetitive and criticizing the Bush administration for allowing it to go through.[39]
Post-merger[edit]
Resurgence and growth[edit]
After coming close to filing for Chapter 11 only months after the 2008 merger, having gone so far as to hire lawyers to prepare a possible bankruptcy filing,[45] Sirius XM was able to avoid declaring bankruptcy with the assistance of a $530 million loan from Liberty Media in February 2009, which Mel Karmazin negotiated in exchange for a 40% equity stake in Sirius XM.[46][47]
In the fourth quarter of 2009, Sirius XM posted a profit for the first time, with a net income of $14.2 million. This came after net losses of $245.8 million in the year following the merger. The company's resurgence was owed in part to the loan from Liberty Media. Increased automobile sales in the US was also a factor. Sirius XM ended 2009 with 18.8 million subscribers.[46] By the end of 2012, Sirius XM's subscriber base had grown to 23.9 million, mostly due to an increase in partnerships with automakers and car dealers; a strong push in the used-car market; and continued improved car sales in the US in general. The renewal of radio show host Howard Stern's contract through 2015 ($400 million for five years, $100 million less than Stern's previous five-year deal) was also a factor in the company's steady growth; Stern's show attracted over 12 million listeners per week.[47][48]
As of 2012, Sirius XM had a 60% penetration rate in the new car market. Out of that 60%, approximately 45% became subscribers. The company has long-term deals with General Motors, Ford, Toyota, Kia, Bentley, BMW, Volkswagen, Nissan, Hyundai,Suzuki and Mitsubishi,along with assorted trucks, boats and recreational vehicles. As of August 2012, Sirius XM satellite radios were in 50 million cars. The company offers trial subscriptions to new car owners, and then tries to get them to purchase yearly subscriptions. By 2018, Sirius XM predicts over 100 million cars will have Sirius XM radios installed.[48][49]
After trying for four years, on December 21, 2010, Sirius XM received approval from the FCC to add service in Alaska and Hawaii. Sirius XM announced on January 17, 2011 that it would place repeaters in those states and adjust three of its satellites to cover those areas. The move gave Sirius XM coverage in all 50 states.[50]
On January 12, 2011, XM Satellite Radio, Inc. was dissolved as a separate entity and merged into Sirius XM Radio, Inc.[51] On April 11, 2011, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) approved the merger of Sirius and XM's Canadian affiliates in SiriusXM Canada.[52]
On April 11, 2013, a New York appeals court upheld a New York judge's ruling, from April 2012, that Howard Stern was not entitled to stock bonuses based on Sirius XM's exceeding subscriber target projections. The court ruled that subscribers to XM Satellite Radio from before the Sirius XM merger should not be counted as "Sirius subscribers" for the purposes of Stern's lawsuit. Stern argued the opposite, because his popularity had played an integral role in helping Sirius acquire XM. He had been seeking $330 million in stock bonuses.[53][54]
In April 2016, Sirius XM surpassed 30 million total subscribers.[55]
Executives[edit]
Following the merger, Sirius CEO Mel Karmazin became CEO of the combined company, and XM chairman Gary Parsons retained his role.[56] XM CEO and co-founder Hugh Panero stepped down in August 2007, shortly after the merger was first announced.[5]
XM Satellite Radio executives who were not offered jobs in the new combined company were assured golden parachute severance packages that had been approved in 2007. Former CEO Nate Davis received a severance package worth $10 million. Erik Toppenberg, executive vice president of programming, received a severance package worth $5.34 million. CFO Joseph Euteneuer received a severance package worth $4.9 million. Vernon Irvin, chief marketing officer, received a severance package worth $4.5 million.[57]
In November 2009, Parsons resigned as chairman of Sirius XM, receiving a payout of more than $9 million.[29][57] He was succeeded by Eddy Hartenstein, former publisher and CEO of the Los Angeles Times.[29] In December 2012, Mel Karmazin stepped down as Sirius XM CEO after Liberty Media gained control of 49.5% of the company. James E. Meyer was named interim CEO.[58] On April 30, 2013, he was named permanent CEO.[59] Also in April 2013, Liberty Media CEO Greg Maffei was named Sirius XM's chairman, succeeding Hartenstein.[60]
Internet and mobile[edit]
Sirius XM radio content is available to stream online either as an add-on to existing subscriptions or as an Internet-only option.[61] Internet and mobile services directly challenging Sirius XM include iHeartRadio, Pandora, and Spotify.[47]
In August 2011, SiriusXM announced that the company would start offering a personalized interactive online radio experience, similar to that offered by Pandora. The feature would allow listeners to replay, skip, and ban songs on certain channels.[62] MySXM debuted on April 15, 2013, allowing users to fine-tune over 50 existing Sirius XM channels. MySXM is available to all Sirius XM subscribers.[61][63]
On June 17, 2009, Sirius XM released an application for use on Apple's iPhone and iPod Touch, allowing its subscribers to listen to its programming on those devices. The app did not feature all of the programming available to satellite listeners.[64] On March 17, 2011, the app was also made available for the iPad.[65] In 2012, the app was updated for iOS and Android, featuring additional content, and the ability to pause, rewind, and fast-forward through audio streams.[66]




Sirius XM's mobile app (version 3.0), as seen on the iPad Mini


On February 4, 2010, the Sirius XM BlackBerry application was announced, for use on BlackBerry smartphones (the Bold, Curve, Storm, and Tour).[67] As of April 2013, the app featured over 150 channels.[68]
On May 28, 2010, the Sirius XM application for Android smartphones was announced.[69] As of April 2013, the app features over 130 channels.[70]
As part of Howard Stern's new five-year contract with Sirius XM, which he signed on December 9, 2010, The Howard Stern Show, which hadn't previously been made available on mobile devices, would now be a part of Sirius XM's mobile app package.[71]
On March 18, 2015, SiriusXM released a refreshed user interface of the application on Android and iOS.[72]
Subscriptions[edit]
Following the merger, Sirius XM jettisoned the simplicity of previous monthly subscription models and began offering numerous new options, including a la carte offerings, a family-friendly version, and "mostly music" or "news, sports, and talk" packages, ranging in price from $6.99 to $16.99 per month.[73] As of April 2013, almost all music, talk and news programming is available on both Sirius, XM and SiriusXM Internet Radio services.[74]
Prior to the merger, Sirius offered, for a one-time fee, a lifetime subscription (lasting the lifetime of the receiver, not the subscriber).[30] After the merger, due to changes in bundling policies, some customers who had purchased lifetime subscriptions had their service reduced or canceled, and were unable to obtain a refund.[75][76]
Legal settlement[edit]
On December 4, 2014, Sirius XM Holdings agreed to a $3.8 million USD settlement with 45 states and the District of Columbia, over a suit initiated by the Ohio Attorney General, Mike DeWine, stemming from the company's billing and service renewal practices. The suit alleged Sirius XM Holdings was engaged in "misleading, unfair and deceptive acts or practices in violation of state consumer protection laws," Attorney General DeWine said.[77]
Programming[edit]
Main article: List of Sirius XM Radio channels
From the outset, Sirius and XM each attracted celebrity personalities to host shows. Broadminded, Bob Dylan, Tony Hawk, Bam Margera, Opie and Anthony Tom Petty, Ron & Fez, Howard Stern, Martha Stewart, and Oprah Winfrey are among those who signed contracts with one of the two companies. Exclusive sports programming (Major League Soccer, NASCAR, and the Canadian Football League, National Football League, and Premier League on Sirius, and Indy Racing League, Major League Baseball, National Basketball Association, National Hockey League, and PGA Tour on XM) initially differentiated the networks from one another.
Internet[edit]
The internet player allows subscribers to customize most stations to their liking by adjusting settings like: familiar/hits or unfamiliar/depth, studio recordings or live performances, and new/recent or old/classic material. These customized stations also allow listeners to play music without DJ interruptions. Paid subscribers can skip as many tracks as they like and can replay songs.
Canadian counterparts[edit]
Main article: SiriusXM Canada
In Canada, Sirius Canada and XM Canada were partially owned by Sirius XM (20% and 23.3% respectively) in joint ventures with Canadian companies.[78] After the US merger, the two Canadian ventures did not immediately agree to a similar merger, but instead remained in competition as distinct services.[79] Complicating matters was that Sirius Canada has nearly 80% of the total satellite radio subscriber base in that country, and felt they deserved greater than a 50/50 split of the new company, whereas XM Canada felt their deal with the NHL—a particularly lucrative prize in Canadian sports broadcasting—also warranted a significant amount of value in the new company.[79]
On November 24, 2010, XM Radio Canada and Sirius Canada announced that they would merge their services.[80] On April 12, 2011, the CRTC approved the companies' merger into SiriusXM Canada.[81] John Bitove's Canadian Satellite Radio Holdings Inc., the licensee of XM Canada, gained a 30% share in the new company as its primary and controlling shareholder, while Slaight Communications and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the current owners of Sirius Canada, each retained 20% ownership. Sirius XM's American parent company would hold 25%.[52] The merger was completed on June 21, 2011.[82]
Technical[edit]
Receivers[edit]
XM and Sirius use different compression and conditional access systems, making their receivers incompatible with each other's service. A condition of the merger was that Sirius XM would bring to the market satellite radios that can receive both XM and Sirius channels within one year.[41] The interoperable radio, called the MiRGE, was made available beginning in March 2009.[83] but the receiver was soon discontinued after both services eliminated duplicate channels which obviated the need for this radio. As of February 2016[update], Sirius XM offers radios for home, office, automotive, marine, and aviation use.[84]
Satellites[edit]
As of May 2017[update], there are five satellites in orbit: two XM and two Sirius satellites and one spare.[85]XM-3 and XM-4 are the active satellites for the XM service and replaced the original XM-1 and XM-2 satellites which were placed into a disposal orbit. Sirius FM-5 and FM-6 function as the primaries for the Sirius side. FM-6 which was launched on October 25, 2013 and declared ready for service on December 2, 2013 initially served as an in orbit spare while the company worked to deploy repeaters for the Sirius side which were needed to transition to full geostationary operation. In 2016 FM-6 was put into active service and officially replaced Sirius originals FM1-4 which operated in elliptical orbit. FM1-3 were later placed into disposal orbits. With this change FM-5 and FM-6 exclusively serve the Sirius service mirroring XM-3 and 4. Before FM-6 was launched, XM-5 was sent into orbit by Proton from Kazakhstan, on October 14, 2010, and is capable of broadcasting to either service.[86].[87] XM-5 serves as the in orbit spare for the entire system and can function in place of either a Sirius or XM satellite. In late 2016 Sirius XM placed an order for two new satellites SXM-7 and SXM-8 which will replace XM-3 and XM-4. These are scheduled for launch in 2019 and 2020 respectively.
Sirius satellites broadcast within the S band frequencies from 2.3200–2.3325 GHz, while XM radio uses adjacent frequencies 2.3325–2.3450 GHz.[88][89]
