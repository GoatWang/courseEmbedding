Susan M Kanaya's Experience
Title: Chief Financial Officer
               Company: Chemocentryx, Inc.
Job Details
               ChemoCentryx, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing orally-administered therapeutics that target the chemokine and chemoattractant systems in order to treat autoimmune diseases, inflammatory disorders and cancer. The chemokine system is a biological network that regulates inflammation via a collection of secreted chemokine molecules, or ligands, and their specific cell surface receptors. Based on its proprietary drug discovery and drug development platform, ChemoCentryx has generated multiple clinical and preclinical-stage programs, each targeting distinct chemokine and chemoattractant receptors with different small molecule compounds. CCX140, a CCR2 inhibitor, successfully completed a Phase II clinical trial where it was shown to be safe and well tolerated while demonstrating statistically significant improvements in kidney function in patients with diabetic nephropathy. CCX168, a C5aR inhibitor, is in Phase II development for the treatment of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (AAV). CCX168 appears to be safe, well tolerated and successful in allowing both reduction and elimination of high-dose corticosteroids, part of standard of care for AAV patients, without compromising efficacy or safety during a 12-week treatment period. CCX872, a second CCR2 inhibitor, successfully completed Phase I development and is in development for the treatment of non-resectable pancreatic cancer. Vercirnon (also known as Traficet-EN or CCX282) is a specific CCR9 inhibitor for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. Other clinical programs include CCX507, a next generation CCR9 inhibitor, which has successfully completed Phase I development and CCX354, a CCR1 inhibitor which successfully completed a Phase II clinical trial for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. ChemoCentryx also has several programs in advanced preclinical development.

 MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- ChemoCentryx, Inc., a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing orally-administered therapeutics that target the chemokine system, today announced the appointment of Susan M. Kanaya to the post of Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. In this capacity, Ms. Kanaya will oversee financial and accounting operations as well as investor relations. The company also announced the recent appointment of Petrus (Pirow) J. Bekker M.D., Ph.D., to the position of Vice President, Medical and Clinical Affairs and the establishment of ChemoCentryx's clinical development and regulatory affairs department. Both Ms. Kanaya and Dr. Bekker report directly to Thomas Schall, Ph.D., ChemoCentryx's President and Chief Executive Officer.  "I am delighted to welcome these highly qualified executives to the ChemoCentryx team. Their experience and expertise will be invaluable in advancing our multiple products through clinical development - including Traficet-EN(R) which is poised to enter its next stage of clinical trials," said Dr. Schall.  Ms. Kanaya joins ChemoCentryx from publicly-traded Kosan Biosciences where she served as Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. There she was responsible for all financial and accounting operations, investor and public relations, information technology and other corporate-related matters. Among her accomplishments at Kosan Ms. Kanaya was instrumental in securing more than $165 million in equity and debt financing, including an $80 million initial public offering. Prior to joining Kosan in 1999 Ms. Kanaya was at SUGEN, Inc. (acquired by Pharmacia, and in turn Pfizer) since 1994, most recently as Vice President, Finance. Prior to SUGEN Ms. Kanaya served as a controller with two high technology companies and as a Supervising Senior at KPMG. Ms. Kanaya is a graduate of the University of California, Berkeley.  Dr. Bekker brings more than fifteen years of clinical development expertise and joins ChemoCentryx from Amgen, where he most recently served as Senior Director of Global Safety, overseeing all aspects of product safety worldwide. Prior to this role, Dr. Bekker spent several years as Senior Director of Clinical Development and Director of Clinical Development at Amgen, where he was responsible for programs in inflammation, bone metabolism and neurology programs at all stages of product development ranging from preclinical to post-marketing. While at Amgen, Dr. Bekker led the development and facilitated the approvals of several Amgen products, including Embrel(R) and Kineret(R) and contributed to the evaluation of in-licensing candidates for the company. Previous to his time at Amgen, Dr. Bekker spent nearly seven years at Procter & Gamble Pharmaceuticals where he played a key role in the clinical development of the osteoporosis drug Actonel(R). Dr. Bekker received his medical training in his native South Africa, and his Ph.D. in molecular biology from the University of Pennsylvania.  About ChemoCentryx  ChemoCentryx, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing orally-administered therapeutics that target the chemokine system to treat autoimmune diseases, inflammatory disorders and cancer. The chemokine system is a complex network of chemokine molecules, or ligands, and receptors that regulates inflammation. ChemoCentryx has internally generated more than six clinical- and preclinical-stage programs, each targeting distinct chemokine receptors with different small molecule compounds. The company's compounds are designed to be highly potent with minimal side effects and orally available for improved patient compliance, as well as ease and efficiency of manufacture. ChemoCentryx's lead compound, Traficet-EN(R), is currently in Phase II clinical development for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease.
