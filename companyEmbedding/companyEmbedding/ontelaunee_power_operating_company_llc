One of the most common reasons someone's engine won't start is due to a dead or low battery. A number of issues can cause this to happen, most of them being human error. If you left your headlights or fog lamps on by mistake, you may come out to a dead battery.

OPERATING AGREEMENT of _______________

This Operating Agreement (the "Agreement") made and entered into this 27th day of July, 2017 (the "Execution Date"),
	
BY:

_________________________ of ________________________________________, _________________________,  __________
	
(the "Member").
	
BACKGROUND:


The Member wishes to be the sole member of a limited liability company.

The terms and conditions of this Agreement will govern the Member within the limited liability company. 


IN CONSIDERATION OF and as a condition of the Member entering into this Agreement and other valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is acknowledged, the Member agrees as follows:
	

Formation

By this Agreement, the Member forms a Limited Liability Company (the "Company") in accordance with the laws of the State of California. The rights and obligations of the Member will be as stated in the California Revised Uniform Limited Liability Company Act (the "Act") except as otherwise provided in this agreement.

Name

The name of the Company will be _______________.

Sole Member

While the Company consists only of one Member, any reference in this Agreement to two or more Members and that requires the majority consent or unanimous consent of Members, or that requires a certain percentage vote of Members, should be interpreted as only requiring the consent or vote of the sole Member.

Purpose

____________________________________________________________.

Term

The Company will continue until terminated as provided in this Agreement or may dissolve under conditions provided in the Act.

Place of Business

The Principal Office of the Company will be located at ____________________, _______________,  __________ or such other place as the Member may from time to time designate.

Capital Contributions

The following table shows the Initial Contributions of the Member. The Member agrees to make the Initial Contributions to the Company in full, according to the following terms:



Member



Contribution Description



Value ofContribution




 
					
 
					

$0.00
						






Allocation of Profits/Losses

Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, the Net Profits or Losses, for both accounting and tax purposes, will accrue to and be borne by the sole Member: _________________________ of ________________________________________, _________________________,  __________.

Where the Company consists of two or more Members, no Member will have priority over any other Member for the distribution of Net Profits or Losses.

Nature of Interest

A Member's Interest in the Company will be considered personal property.

Withdrawal of Contribution

Where the Company consists of two or more Members, no Member will withdraw any portion of their Capital Contribution without the unanimous consent of the other Members.

Liability for Contribution

A Member's obligation to make their required Capital Contribution can only be compromised or released with the consent of all remaining Members or as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If a Member does not make the Capital Contribution when it is due, he is obligated at the option of any remaining Members to contribute cash equal to the agreed value of the Capital Contribution. This option is in addition to and not in lieu of any others rights, including the right to specific performance that the Company may have against the Member.

Additional Contributions

Capital Contributions may be amended from time to time, according to the business needs of the Company. However if additional capital is determined to be required and an individual Member is unwilling or unable to meet the additional contribution requirement within a reasonable period, and where the Company consists of two or more Members, the remaining Members may contribute in proportion to their existing Capital Contributions to resolve the amount in default. In such case, the allocation of Net Profits or Losses and the distribution of assets on dissociation or dissolution will be adjusted accordingly.

Any advance of money to the Company by any Member in excess of the amounts provided for in this Agreement or subsequently agreed to, will be deemed a debt due from the Company rather than an increase in the Capital Contribution of the Member. This liability will be repaid with interest at such rates and times to be determined by a majority of the Members. This liability will not entitle the lending Member to any increased share of the Company's profits nor to a greater voting power. Repayment of such debts will have priority over any other payments to Members.

Capital Accounts

An individual capital account (the "Capital Account") will be maintained for each Member and their Initial Contributions will be credited to this account. Any Additional Contributions made by any Member will be credited to that Member's individual Capital Account.

Interest on Capital

No borrowing charge or loan interest will be due or payable to any Member on their agreed Capital Contribution inclusive of any agreed Additional Contributions.

Management

Management of this Company is vested in the Member.

Authority to Bind Company

Only the following individuals have authority to bind the Company in contract: ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________.

Duty of Loyalty

Any Member may invest in or engage in any business of any type, including without limitation, a business that is similar to the business of the Company whether or not in direct competition with the Company and whether or not within the established or contemplated market regions of the Company. Neither the Company nor any Member will have any right to that opportunity or any income derived from that opportunity.

Duty to Devote Time

Each Member will devote such time and attention to the business of the Company as the majority of the Members will from time to time reasonably determine for the conduct of the Company's business.

Member Meetings

Where the Company consists of two or more Members, a meeting may be called by any Member providing that reasonable notice has been given to the other Members.

Regular meetings of the Members will be held as required.

Voting

Each Member will be entitled to cast votes on any matter based upon the proportion of that Member's Capital Contributions in the Company.

Admission of New Members

No new Members may be admitted into the Company.

Voluntary Withdrawal of a Member

A Member may not withdraw from the Company without the unanimous consent of the remaining Members. Any such unauthorized withdrawal will be considered a wrongful dissociation and a breach of this Agreement. In the event of any such wrongful dissociation, the withdrawing Member will be liable to the remaining Members for any damages incurred by the remaining Members including but not limited to the loss of future earnings.

The voluntary withdrawal of a Member will have no effect upon the continuance of the Company.

It remains incumbent on the withdrawing Member to exercise this dissociation in good faith and to minimize any present or future harm done to the remaining Members as a result of the withdrawal.

Involuntary Withdrawal of a Member

Events leading to the involuntary withdrawal of a Member from the Company will include but not be limited to: death of a Member; Member mental incapacity; Member disability preventing reasonable participation in the Company; Member incompetence; breach of fiduciary duties by a Member; criminal conviction of a Member; Operation of Law against a Member or a legal judgment against a Member that can reasonably be expected to bring the business or societal reputation of the Company into disrepute. Expulsion of a Member can also occur on application by the Company or another Member, where it has been judicially determined that the Member: has engaged in wrongful conduct that adversely and materially affected the Company's business; has willfully or persistently committed a material breach of this Agreement or of a duty owed to the Company or to the other Members; or has engaged in conduct relating to the Company's business that makes it not reasonably practicable to carry on the business with the Member.

The involuntary withdrawal of a Member will have no effect upon the continuance of the Company.

Dissociation of a Member

Where the Company consists of two or more Members, in the event of either a voluntary or involuntary withdrawal of a Member, if the remaining Members elect to purchase the interest of the withdrawing Member, the remaining Members will serve written notice of such election, including the purchase price and method and schedule of payment for the withdrawing Member's Interests, upon the withdrawing Member, their executor, administrator, trustee, committee or analogous fiduciary within a reasonable period after acquiring knowledge of the change in circumstance to the affected Member. 

Valuation and distribution will be determined as described in the Valuation of Interest section of this Agreement.

Any remaining Members retain the right to seek damages from a dissociated Member where the dissociation resulted from a malicious or criminal act by the dissociated Member or where the dissociated Member had breached their fiduciary duty to the Company or was in breach of this Agreement or had acted in a way that could reasonably be foreseen to bring harm or damage to the Company or to the reputation of the Company.

A dissociated Member will only have liability for Company obligations that were incurred during their time as a Member. On dissociation of a Member, the Company will prepare, file, serve, and publish all notices required by law to protect the dissociated Member from liability for future Company obligations.

Where any remaining Members have purchased the interest of a dissociated Member, the purchase amount will be paid in full, but without interest, within 90 days of the date of withdrawal. The Company will retain exclusive rights to use of the trade name and firm name and all related brand and model names of the Company.

Right of First Purchase

Where the Company consists of two or more Members, in the event that a Member's Interest in the Company is or will be sold, due to any reason, the remaining Members will have a right of first purchase of that Member's Interest. 

Assignment of Interest

In the event that a Member’s interest in the company is transferred or assigned as the result of a court order or Operation of Law, the trustee in bankruptcy or other person acquiring that Member's Interests in the Company will only acquire that Member's economic rights and interests and will not acquire any other rights of that Member or be admitted as a Member of the Company or have the right to exercise any management or voting interests.

Valuation of Interest

Where the Company consists of two or more Members, a Member's financial interest in the Company will be in proportion to their Capital Contributions, inclusive of any Additional Capital Contributions.

In the absence of a written agreement setting a value, the value of the Company will be based on the fair market value appraisal of all Company assets (less liabilities) determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). This appraisal will be conducted by an independent accounting firm agreed to by all Members. An appraiser will be appointed within a reasonable period of the date of withdrawal or dissolution. The results of the appraisal will be binding on all Members.

No allowance will be made for goodwill, trade name, patents or other intangible assets, except where those assets have been reflected on the Company books immediately prior to valuation.

Dissolution

The Company may be dissolved by a unanimous vote of the Members. The Company will also be dissolved on the occurrence of events specified in the Act.

Upon Dissolution of the Company and liquidation of Company property, and after payment of all selling costs and expenses, the liquidator will distribute the Company assets to the following groups according to the following order of priority:

in satisfaction of liabilities to creditors except Company obligations to current Members;

in satisfaction of Company debt obligations to current Members; and then

to the Member.



Records

The Company will at all times maintain accurate records of the following:

Information regarding the status of the business and the financial condition of the Company.

A copy of the Company federal, state, and local income taxes for each year, promptly after becoming available.

Name and last known business, residential, or mailing address of each Member, as well as the date that person became a Member.

A copy of this Agreement and any articles or certificate of formation, as well as all amendments, together with any executed copies of any written powers of attorney pursuant to which this Agreement, articles or certificate, and any amendments have been executed.

The cash, property, and services contributed to the Company by each Member, along with a description and value, and any contributions that have been agreed to be made in the future.



Each Member has the right to demand, within a reasonable period of time, a copy of any of the above documents for any purpose reasonably related to their interest as a Member of the Company, at their expense.

LLC Operating Agreement
Alternate Names:
An LLC Operating Agreement is also known as:

Operating Agreement
Operating Agreement LLC
LLC Agreement
LLC Partnership Agreement
Operating Agreement for LLC

What is a Limited Liability Company (LLC)?
An LLC is a type of business structure formed by filing the proper paperwork with your state. Like the name suggests, an LLC limits the liability of its members, meaning they are not personally responsible for the company's debt or obligations. 
What is an LLC Operating Agreement?
An LLC Operating Agreement is a legal document that establishes the rights and responsibilities of each LLC member and provides details about the LLC's internal management, including how decisions are made, when meetings are held, how new members are admitted and more.
Who is considered a member of an LLC?
A member of a limited liability company is an individual or corporation that owns part of the LLC. He or she must have provided a form of capital contribution (money, services, property) in exchange for a percentage of ownership interest in the company.
Does an LLC have shares of stock like a corporation?
LLC's don't have shares like a corporation, but rather assign a percentage of ownership according to each member's capital contribution. Regardless of the amount of members in an LLC, ownership percentages should always add up to 100%.
What does an LLC Operating Agreement include?
LLC Information
The LLC Operating Agreement has information about the LLC itself, including the name, type/description of services, how long the LLC will be in business, and office address.
Member Information
The LLC agreement includes the following information for each member:

Name and address
Membership class
Capital contribution
Percentage of ownership
Share of profits and losses

An operating agreement also addresses whether a member can voluntarily leave the LLC, if they can compete against the LLC after leaving, how assets are distributed if the company dissolves, and how new members are admitted.
Management
An LLC Operating Agreement specifies how the company will be managed, including how decisions will be made and if actions require a majority of members to vote in favor of decisions (referred to as unanimous consent).
Regular meetings are part of an LLC's obligations, which is why details regarding where and when meetings will be held are important to include in the operating agreement.
An LLC can be managed either by its members or by a designated manager.
Administration
Financial and administrative aspects of an LLC are defined in the operating agreement, including the LLC's accounting methods, fiscal year, annual report details and more.
Other Details in an LLC Agreement
The operating agreement may also specify who has the ability to sign contracts on behalf of the company and methods used to resolve disputes.
Why should an LLC use an Operating Agreement?
By creating and agreeing to all the terms laid out in an operating agreement, members find there are fewer discrepancies in how business is conducted or how profits and losses are distributed.
An LLC Operating Agreement also allows members to specify their own rules for the company, and will serve as an important reference tool if a member decides to withdraw, the company dissolves, or a new member is admitted.
What is the difference between a partnership and an LLC?
A general partnership and an LLC are similar but members of an LLC have limited liability for the debts and obligations of the LLC. In a general partnership, partners have unlimited liability for the debts and obligations of the partnership.
Can members amend (change) terms in the LLC Operating Agreement?
Yes, an operating agreement can be amended if every member agrees and signs an amendment.
Related Documents:

Partnership Agreement: Contract used to spell out the terms of a general partnership between two or more partners. 
Shareholder Agreement: Similar to an LLC Operating Agreement, but it is used by shareholders to define management details, how disputes are resolved, share value and more in a corporation.

Business Plan: A comprehensive document that outlines your company's values, future goals, financial projections, marketing and sales plan, and employee/management details.

OPERATING AGREEMENT of _______________

This Operating Agreement (the "Agreement") made and entered into this 27th day of July, 2017 (the "Execution Date"),
	
BY:

_________________________ of ________________________________________, _________________________,  __________
	
(the "Member").
	
BACKGROUND:


The Member wishes to be the sole member of a limited liability company.

The terms and conditions of this Agreement will govern the Member within the limited liability company. 


IN CONSIDERATION OF and as a condition of the Member entering into this Agreement and other valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is acknowledged, the Member agrees as follows:
	

Formation

By this Agreement, the Member forms a Limited Liability Company (the "Company") in accordance with the laws of the State of California. The rights and obligations of the Member will be as stated in the California Revised Uniform Limited Liability Company Act (the "Act") except as otherwise provided in this agreement.

Name

The name of the Company will be _______________.

Sole Member

While the Company consists only of one Member, any reference in this Agreement to two or more Members and that requires the majority consent or unanimous consent of Members, or that requires a certain percentage vote of Members, should be interpreted as only requiring the consent or vote of the sole Member.

Purpose

____________________________________________________________.

Term

The Company will continue until terminated as provided in this Agreement or may dissolve under conditions provided in the Act.

Place of Business

The Principal Office of the Company will be located at ____________________, _______________,  __________ or such other place as the Member may from time to time designate.

Capital Contributions

The following table shows the Initial Contributions of the Member. The Member agrees to make the Initial Contributions to the Company in full, according to the following terms:



Member



Contribution Description



Value ofContribution




 
					
 
					

$0.00
						






Allocation of Profits/Losses

Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, the Net Profits or Losses, for both accounting and tax purposes, will accrue to and be borne by the sole Member: _________________________ of ________________________________________, _________________________,  __________.

Where the Company consists of two or more Members, no Member will have priority over any other Member for the distribution of Net Profits or Losses.

Nature of Interest

A Member's Interest in the Company will be considered personal property.

Withdrawal of Contribution

Where the Company consists of two or more Members, no Member will withdraw any portion of their Capital Contribution without the unanimous consent of the other Members.

Liability for Contribution

A Member's obligation to make their required Capital Contribution can only be compromised or released with the consent of all remaining Members or as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If a Member does not make the Capital Contribution when it is due, he is obligated at the option of any remaining Members to contribute cash equal to the agreed value of the Capital Contribution. This option is in addition to and not in lieu of any others rights, including the right to specific performance that the Company may have against the Member.

Additional Contributions

Capital Contributions may be amended from time to time, according to the business needs of the Company. However if additional capital is determined to be required and an individual Member is unwilling or unable to meet the additional contribution requirement within a reasonable period, and where the Company consists of two or more Members, the remaining Members may contribute in proportion to their existing Capital Contributions to resolve the amount in default. In such case, the allocation of Net Profits or Losses and the distribution of assets on dissociation or dissolution will be adjusted accordingly.

Any advance of money to the Company by any Member in excess of the amounts provided for in this Agreement or subsequently agreed to, will be deemed a debt due from the Company rather than an increase in the Capital Contribution of the Member. This liability will be repaid with interest at such rates and times to be determined by a majority of the Members. This liability will not entitle the lending Member to any increased share of the Company's profits nor to a greater voting power. Repayment of such debts will have priority over any other payments to Members.

Capital Accounts

An individual capital account (the "Capital Account") will be maintained for each Member and their Initial Contributions will be credited to this account. Any Additional Contributions made by any Member will be credited to that Member's individual Capital Account.

Interest on Capital

No borrowing charge or loan interest will be due or payable to any Member on their agreed Capital Contribution inclusive of any agreed Additional Contributions.

Management

Management of this Company is vested in the Member.

Authority to Bind Company

Only the following individuals have authority to bind the Company in contract: ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________.

Duty of Loyalty

Any Member may invest in or engage in any business of any type, including without limitation, a business that is similar to the business of the Company whether or not in direct competition with the Company and whether or not within the established or contemplated market regions of the Company. Neither the Company nor any Member will have any right to that opportunity or any income derived from that opportunity.

Duty to Devote Time

Each Member will devote such time and attention to the business of the Company as the majority of the Members will from time to time reasonably determine for the conduct of the Company's business.

Member Meetings

Where the Company consists of two or more Members, a meeting may be called by any Member providing that reasonable notice has been given to the other Members.

Regular meetings of the Members will be held as required.

Voting

Each Member will be entitled to cast votes on any matter based upon the proportion of that Member's Capital Contributions in the Company.

Admission of New Members

No new Members may be admitted into the Company.

Voluntary Withdrawal of a Member

A Member may not withdraw from the Company without the unanimous consent of the remaining Members. Any such unauthorized withdrawal will be considered a wrongful dissociation and a breach of this Agreement. In the event of any such wrongful dissociation, the withdrawing Member will be liable to the remaining Members for any damages incurred by the remaining Members including but not limited to the loss of future earnings.

The voluntary withdrawal of a Member will have no effect upon the continuance of the Company.

It remains incumbent on the withdrawing Member to exercise this dissociation in good faith and to minimize any present or future harm done to the remaining Members as a result of the withdrawal.

Involuntary Withdrawal of a Member

Events leading to the involuntary withdrawal of a Member from the Company will include but not be limited to: death of a Member; Member mental incapacity; Member disability preventing reasonable participation in the Company; Member incompetence; breach of fiduciary duties by a Member; criminal conviction of a Member; Operation of Law against a Member or a legal judgment against a Member that can reasonably be expected to bring the business or societal reputation of the Company into disrepute. Expulsion of a Member can also occur on application by the Company or another Member, where it has been judicially determined that the Member: has engaged in wrongful conduct that adversely and materially affected the Company's business; has willfully or persistently committed a material breach of this Agreement or of a duty owed to the Company or to the other Members; or has engaged in conduct relating to the Company's business that makes it not reasonably practicable to carry on the business with the Member.

The involuntary withdrawal of a Member will have no effect upon the continuance of the Company.

Dissociation of a Member

Where the Company consists of two or more Members, in the event of either a voluntary or involuntary withdrawal of a Member, if the remaining Members elect to purchase the interest of the withdrawing Member, the remaining Members will serve written notice of such election, including the purchase price and method and schedule of payment for the withdrawing Member's Interests, upon the withdrawing Member, their executor, administrator, trustee, committee or analogous fiduciary within a reasonable period after acquiring knowledge of the change in circumstance to the affected Member. 

Valuation and distribution will be determined as described in the Valuation of Interest section of this Agreement.

Any remaining Members retain the right to seek damages from a dissociated Member where the dissociation resulted from a malicious or criminal act by the dissociated Member or where the dissociated Member had breached their fiduciary duty to the Company or was in breach of this Agreement or had acted in a way that could reasonably be foreseen to bring harm or damage to the Company or to the reputation of the Company.

A dissociated Member will only have liability for Company obligations that were incurred during their time as a Member. On dissociation of a Member, the Company will prepare, file, serve, and publish all notices required by law to protect the dissociated Member from liability for future Company obligations.

Where any remaining Members have purchased the interest of a dissociated Member, the purchase amount will be paid in full, but without interest, within 90 days of the date of withdrawal. The Company will retain exclusive rights to use of the trade name and firm name and all related brand and model names of the Company.

Right of First Purchase

Where the Company consists of two or more Members, in the event that a Member's Interest in the Company is or will be sold, due to any reason, the remaining Members will have a right of first purchase of that Member's Interest. 

Assignment of Interest

In the event that a Member’s interest in the company is transferred or assigned as the result of a court order or Operation of Law, the trustee in bankruptcy or other person acquiring that Member's Interests in the Company will only acquire that Member's economic rights and interests and will not acquire any other rights of that Member or be admitted as a Member of the Company or have the right to exercise any management or voting interests.

Valuation of Interest

Where the Company consists of two or more Members, a Member's financial interest in the Company will be in proportion to their Capital Contributions, inclusive of any Additional Capital Contributions.

In the absence of a written agreement setting a value, the value of the Company will be based on the fair market value appraisal of all Company assets (less liabilities) determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). This appraisal will be conducted by an independent accounting firm agreed to by all Members. An appraiser will be appointed within a reasonable period of the date of withdrawal or dissolution. The results of the appraisal will be binding on all Members.

No allowance will be made for goodwill, trade name, patents or other intangible assets, except where those assets have been reflected on the Company books immediately prior to valuation.

Dissolution

The Company may be dissolved by a unanimous vote of the Members. The Company will also be dissolved on the occurrence of events specified in the Act.

Upon Dissolution of the Company and liquidation of Company property, and after payment of all selling costs and expenses, the liquidator will distribute the Company assets to the following groups according to the following order of priority:

in satisfaction of liabilities to creditors except Company obligations to current Members;

in satisfaction of Company debt obligations to current Members; and then

to the Member.



Records

The Company will at all times maintain accurate records of the following:

Information regarding the status of the business and the financial condition of the Company.

A copy of the Company federal, state, and local income taxes for each year, promptly after becoming available.

Name and last known business, residential, or mailing address of each Member, as well as the date that person became a Member.

The cash, property, and services contributed to the Company by each Member, along with a description and value, and any contributions that have been agreed to be made in the future.



Each Member has the right to demand, within a reasonable period of time, a copy of any of the above documents for any purpose reasonably related to their interest as a Member of the Company, at their expense.

Books of Account

Accurate and complete books of account of the transactions of the Company will be kept in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and at all reasonable times will be available and open to inspection and examination by any Member. The books and records of the Company will reflect all the Company’s transactions and will be appropriate and adequate for the business conducted by the Company.

Banking and Company Funds

The funds of the Company will be placed in such investments and banking accounts as will be designated by the Member. All withdrawals from these accounts will be made by the duly authorized agent or agents of the Company as appointed by unanimous consent of the Members. Company funds will be held in the name of the Company and will not be commingled with those of any other person or entity.

Audit

Any of the Members will have the right to request an audit of the Company books. The cost of the audit will be borne by the Company. The audit will be performed by an accounting firm acceptable to all the Members. Not more than one (1) audit will be required by any or all of the Members for any fiscal year.

Tax Treatment

This Company is intended to be treated as a disregarded entity, for the purposes of Federal and State Income Tax.

This report will consist of at least:

A copy of the Company's federal income tax returns for that fiscal year.

Force Majeure

Forbidden Acts

No Member may do any act in contravention of this Agreement.

No Member may permit, intentionally or unintentionally, the assignment of express, implied or apparent authority to a third party that is not a Member of the Company.

No Member will have the right or authority to bind or obligate the Company to any extent with regard to any matter outside the intended purpose of the Company.

No Member may confess a judgment against the Company.

Any violation of the above forbidden acts will be deemed an Involuntary Withdrawal and may be treated accordingly by the remaining Members.

Indemnification

All Members will be indemnified and held harmless by the Company from and against any and all claims of any nature, whatsoever, arising out of a Member's participation in Company affairs.

LLC Operating Agreement
Alternate Names:
An LLC Operating Agreement is also known as:

Operating Agreement
Operating Agreement LLC
LLC Agreement
LLC Partnership Agreement
Operating Agreement for LLC

What is a Limited Liability Company (LLC)?
An LLC is a type of business structure formed by filing the proper paperwork with your state. Like the name suggests, an LLC limits the liability of its members, meaning they are not personally responsible for the company's debt or obligations. 
What is an LLC Operating Agreement?
An LLC Operating Agreement is a legal document that establishes the rights and responsibilities of each LLC member and provides details about the LLC's internal management, including how decisions are made, when meetings are held, how new members are admitted and more.
Who is considered a member of an LLC?
A member of a limited liability company is an individual or corporation that owns part of the LLC. He or she must have provided a form of capital contribution (money, services, property) in exchange for a percentage of ownership interest in the company.
Does an LLC have shares of stock like a corporation?
LLC's don't have shares like a corporation, but rather assign a percentage of ownership according to each member's capital contribution. Regardless of the amount of members in an LLC, ownership percentages should always add up to 100%.
What does an LLC Operating Agreement include?
LLC Information
The LLC Operating Agreement has information about the LLC itself, including the name, type/description of services, how long the LLC will be in business, and office address.
Member Information
The LLC agreement includes the following information for each member:

Name and address
Membership class
Capital contribution
Percentage of ownership
Share of profits and losses

An operating agreement also addresses whether a member can voluntarily leave the LLC, if they can compete against the LLC after leaving, how assets are distributed if the company dissolves, and how new members are admitted.
Management
An LLC Operating Agreement specifies how the company will be managed, including how decisions will be made and if actions require a majority of members to vote in favor of decisions (referred to as unanimous consent).
Regular meetings are part of an LLC's obligations, which is why details regarding where and when meetings will be held are important to include in the operating agreement.
An LLC can be managed either by its members or by a designated manager.
Administration
Financial and administrative aspects of an LLC are defined in the operating agreement, including the LLC's accounting methods, fiscal year, annual report details and more.
Other Details in an LLC Agreement
The operating agreement may also specify who has the ability to sign contracts on behalf of the company and methods used to resolve disputes.
Why should an LLC use an Operating Agreement?
By creating and agreeing to all the terms laid out in an operating agreement, members find there are fewer discrepancies in how business is conducted or how profits and losses are distributed.
An LLC Operating Agreement also allows members to specify their own rules for the company, and will serve as an important reference tool if a member decides to withdraw, the company dissolves, or a new member is admitted.
What is the difference between a partnership and an LLC?
A general partnership and an LLC are similar but members of an LLC have limited liability for the debts and obligations of the LLC. In a general partnership, partners have unlimited liability for the debts and obligations of the partnership.
Can members amend (change) terms in the LLC Operating Agreement?
Yes, an operating agreement can be amended if every member agrees and signs an amendment.
Related Documents:

Partnership Agreement: Contract used to spell out the terms of a general partnership between two or more partners. 
Shareholder Agreement: Similar to an LLC Operating Agreement, but it is used by shareholders to define management details, how disputes are resolved, share value and more in a corporation.
Articles of Incorporation: Documents filed with the government to register your business as a corporation.
Business Plan: A comprehensive document that outlines your company's values, future goals, financial projections, marketing and sales plan, and employee/management details.

OPERATING AGREEMENT of _______________

This Operating Agreement (the "Agreement") made and entered into this 27th day of July, 2017 (the "Execution Date"),
	
BY:

_________________________ of ________________________________________, _________________________,  __________
	
(the "Member").
	
BACKGROUND:


The Member wishes to be the sole member of a limited liability company.

The terms and conditions of this Agreement will govern the Member within the limited liability company. 


IN CONSIDERATION OF and as a condition of the Member entering into this Agreement and other valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is acknowledged, the Member agrees as follows:
	

Formation

By this Agreement, the Member forms a Limited Liability Company (the "Company") in accordance with the laws of the State of California. The rights and obligations of the Member will be as stated in the California Revised Uniform Limited Liability Company Act (the "Act") except as otherwise provided in this agreement.

Name

The name of the Company will be _______________.

Sole Member

While the Company consists only of one Member, any reference in this Agreement to two or more Members and that requires the majority consent or unanimous consent of Members, or that requires a certain percentage vote of Members, should be interpreted as only requiring the consent or vote of the sole Member.

Purpose

____________________________________________________________.

Term

The Company will continue until terminated as provided in this Agreement or may dissolve under conditions provided in the Act.

Place of Business

The Principal Office of the Company will be located at ____________________, _______________,  __________ or such other place as the Member may from time to time designate.

Capital Contributions

The following table shows the Initial Contributions of the Member. The Member agrees to make the Initial Contributions to the Company in full, according to the following terms:



Member



Contribution Description



Value ofContribution




 
					
 
					

$0.00
						






Allocation of Profits/Losses

Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, the Net Profits or Losses, for both accounting and tax purposes, will accrue to and be borne by the sole Member: _________________________ of ________________________________________, _________________________,  __________.

Where the Company consists of two or more Members, no Member will have priority over any other Member for the distribution of Net Profits or Losses.

Nature of Interest

A Member's Interest in the Company will be considered personal property.

Withdrawal of Contribution

Where the Company consists of two or more Members, no Member will withdraw any portion of their Capital Contribution without the unanimous consent of the other Members.

Liability for Contribution

A Member's obligation to make their required Capital Contribution can only be compromised or released with the consent of all remaining Members or as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If a Member does not make the Capital Contribution when it is due, he is obligated at the option of any remaining Members to contribute cash equal to the agreed value of the Capital Contribution. This option is in addition to and not in lieu of any others rights, including the right to specific performance that the Company may have against the Member.

Additional Contributions

Capital Contributions may be amended from time to time, according to the business needs of the Company. However if additional capital is determined to be required and an individual Member is unwilling or unable to meet the additional contribution requirement within a reasonable period, and where the Company consists of two or more Members, the remaining Members may contribute in proportion to their existing Capital Contributions to resolve the amount in default. In such case, the allocation of Net Profits or Losses and the distribution of assets on dissociation or dissolution will be adjusted accordingly.

Any advance of money to the Company by any Member in excess of the amounts provided for in this Agreement or subsequently agreed to, will be deemed a debt due from the Company rather than an increase in the Capital Contribution of the Member. This liability will be repaid with interest at such rates and times to be determined by a majority of the Members. This liability will not entitle the lending Member to any increased share of the Company's profits nor to a greater voting power. Repayment of such debts will have priority over any other payments to Members.

Capital Accounts

An individual capital account (the "Capital Account") will be maintained for each Member and their Initial Contributions will be credited to this account. Any Additional Contributions made by any Member will be credited to that Member's individual Capital Account.

Interest on Capital

No borrowing charge or loan interest will be due or payable to any Member on their agreed Capital Contribution inclusive of any agreed Additional Contributions.

Management

Management of this Company is vested in the Member.

Authority to Bind Company

Only the following individuals have authority to bind the Company in contract: ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________.

Duty of Loyalty

Any Member may invest in or engage in any business of any type, including without limitation, a business that is similar to the business of the Company whether or not in direct competition with the Company and whether or not within the established or contemplated market regions of the Company. Neither the Company nor any Member will have any right to that opportunity or any income derived from that opportunity.

Duty to Devote Time

Each Member will devote such time and attention to the business of the Company as the majority of the Members will from time to time reasonably determine for the conduct of the Company's business.

Member Meetings

Where the Company consists of two or more Members, a meeting may be called by any Member providing that reasonable notice has been given to the other Members.

Regular meetings of the Members will be held as required.

Voting

Each Member will be entitled to cast votes on any matter based upon the proportion of that Member's Capital Contributions in the Company.

Admission of New Members

No new Members may be admitted into the Company.

Voluntary Withdrawal of a Member

A Member may not withdraw from the Company without the unanimous consent of the remaining Members. Any such unauthorized withdrawal will be considered a wrongful dissociation and a breach of this Agreement. In the event of any such wrongful dissociation, the withdrawing Member will be liable to the remaining Members for any damages incurred by the remaining Members including but not limited to the loss of future earnings.

The voluntary withdrawal of a Member will have no effect upon the continuance of the Company.

It remains incumbent on the withdrawing Member to exercise this dissociation in good faith and to minimize any present or future harm done to the remaining Members as a result of the withdrawal.

Involuntary Withdrawal of a Member

Events leading to the involuntary withdrawal of a Member from the Company will include but not be limited to: death of a Member; Member mental incapacity; Member disability preventing reasonable participation in the Company; Member incompetence; breach of fiduciary duties by a Member; criminal conviction of a Member; Operation of Law against a Member or a legal judgment against a Member that can reasonably be expected to bring the business or societal reputation of the Company into disrepute. Expulsion of a Member can also occur on application by the Company or another Member, where it has been judicially determined that the Member: has engaged in wrongful conduct that adversely and materially affected the Company's business; has willfully or persistently committed a material breach of this Agreement or of a duty owed to the Company or to the other Members; or has engaged in conduct relating to the Company's business that makes it not reasonably practicable to carry on the business with the Member.

The involuntary withdrawal of a Member will have no effect upon the continuance of the Company.

Dissociation of a Member

Where the Company consists of two or more Members, in the event of either a voluntary or involuntary withdrawal of a Member, if the remaining Members elect to purchase the interest of the withdrawing Member, the remaining Members will serve written notice of such election, including the purchase price and method and schedule of payment for the withdrawing Member's Interests, upon the withdrawing Member, their executor, administrator, trustee, committee or analogous fiduciary within a reasonable period after acquiring knowledge of the change in circumstance to the affected Member. 

Valuation and distribution will be determined as described in the Valuation of Interest section of this Agreement.

Any remaining Members retain the right to seek damages from a dissociated Member where the dissociation resulted from a malicious or criminal act by the dissociated Member or where the dissociated Member had breached their fiduciary duty to the Company or was in breach of this Agreement or had acted in a way that could reasonably be foreseen to bring harm or damage to the Company or to the reputation of the Company.

A dissociated Member will only have liability for Company obligations that were incurred during their time as a Member. On dissociation of a Member, the Company will prepare, file, serve, and publish all notices required by law to protect the dissociated Member from liability for future Company obligations.

Where any remaining Members have purchased the interest of a dissociated Member, the purchase amount will be paid in full, but without interest, within 90 days of the date of withdrawal. The Company will retain exclusive rights to use of the trade name and firm name and all related brand and model names of the Company.

Right of First Purchase

Where the Company consists of two or more Members, in the event that a Member's Interest in the Company is or will be sold, due to any reason, the remaining Members will have a right of first purchase of that Member's Interest. 

Assignment of Interest

In the event that a Member’s interest in the company is transferred or assigned as the result of a court order or Operation of Law, the trustee in bankruptcy or other person acquiring that Member's Interests in the Company will only acquire that Member's economic rights and interests and will not acquire any other rights of that Member or be admitted as a Member of the Company or have the right to exercise any management or voting interests.

Valuation of Interest

Where the Company consists of two or more Members, a Member's financial interest in the Company will be in proportion to their Capital Contributions, inclusive of any Additional Capital Contributions.

In the absence of a written agreement setting a value, the value of the Company will be based on the fair market value appraisal of all Company assets (less liabilities) determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). This appraisal will be conducted by an independent accounting firm agreed to by all Members. An appraiser will be appointed within a reasonable period of the date of withdrawal or dissolution. The results of the appraisal will be binding on all Members.

No allowance will be made for goodwill, trade name, patents or other intangible assets, except where those assets have been reflected on the Company books immediately prior to valuation.

Dissolution

The Company may be dissolved by a unanimous vote of the Members. The Company will also be dissolved on the occurrence of events specified in the Act.

Upon Dissolution of the Company and liquidation of Company property, and after payment of all selling costs and expenses, the liquidator will distribute the Company assets to the following groups according to the following order of priority:

in satisfaction of liabilities to creditors except Company obligations to current Members;

in satisfaction of Company debt obligations to current Members; and then

to the Member.



Records

The Company will at all times maintain accurate records of the following:

Information regarding the status of the business and the financial condition of the Company.

A copy of the Company federal, state, and local income taxes for each year, promptly after becoming available.

Name and last known business, residential, or mailing address of each Member, as well as the date that person became a Member.

The cash, property, and services contributed to the Company by each Member, along with a description and value, and any contributions that have been agreed to be made in the future.



Each Member has the right to demand, within a reasonable period of time, a copy of any of the above documents for any purpose reasonably related to their interest as a Member of the Company, at their expense.

Books of Account

Accurate and complete books of account of the transactions of the Company will be kept in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and at all reasonable times will be available and open to inspection and examination by any Member. The books and records of the Company will reflect all the Company’s transactions and will be appropriate and adequate for the business conducted by the Company.

Banking and Company Funds

The funds of the Company will be placed in such investments and banking accounts as will be designated by the Member. All withdrawals from these accounts will be made by the duly authorized agent or agents of the Company as appointed by unanimous consent of the Members. Company funds will be held in the name of the Company and will not be commingled with those of any other person or entity.

Audit

Any of the Members will have the right to request an audit of the Company books. The cost of the audit will be borne by the Company. The audit will be performed by an accounting firm acceptable to all the Members. Not more than one (1) audit will be required by any or all of the Members for any fiscal year.

Tax Treatment

This Company is intended to be treated as a disregarded entity, for the purposes of Federal and State Income Tax.

Annual Report

As soon as practicable after the close of each fiscal year, the Company will furnish to each Member an annual report showing a full and complete account of the condition of the Company including all information as will be necessary for the preparation of each Member's income or other tax returns. This report will consist of at least:

A copy of the Company's federal income tax returns for that fiscal year.



Goodwill

The goodwill of the Company will be assessed at an amount to be determined by appraisal using generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

Governing Law

The Members submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of California for the enforcement of this Agreement or any arbitration award or decision arising from this Agreement.

Force Majeure

A Member will be free of liability to the Company where the Member is prevented from executing their obligations under this Agreement in whole or in part due to force majeure, such as earthquake, typhoon, flood, fire, and war or any other unforeseen and uncontrollable event where the Member has communicated the circumstance of the event to any and all other Members and where the Member has taken any and all appropriate action to satisfy his duties and obligations to the Company and to mitigate the effects of the event.

Forbidden Acts

No Member may do any act in contravention of this Agreement.

No Member may permit, intentionally or unintentionally, the assignment of express, implied or apparent authority to a third party that is not a Member of the Company.

No Member may do any act that would make it impossible to carry on the ordinary business of the Company.

No Member will have the right or authority to bind or obligate the Company to any extent with regard to any matter outside the intended purpose of the Company.

No Member may confess a judgment against the Company.

Any violation of the above forbidden acts will be deemed an Involuntary Withdrawal and may be treated accordingly by the remaining Members.

Indemnification

All Members will be indemnified and held harmless by the Company from and against any and all claims of any nature, whatsoever, arising out of a Member's participation in Company affairs. A Member will not be entitled to indemnification under this section for liability arising out of gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Member or the breach by the Member of any provisions of this Agreement.

Liability

A Member or any employee will not be liable to the Company or to any other Member for any mistake or error in judgment or for any act or omission believed in good faith to be within the scope of authority conferred or implied by this Agreement or the Company.

Liability Insurance

The Company may acquire insurance on behalf of any Member, employee, agent or other person engaged in the business interest of the Company against any liability asserted against them or incurred by them while acting in good faith on behalf of the Company.

LLC Operating Agreement
Alternate Names:
An LLC Operating Agreement is also known as:

Operating Agreement
Operating Agreement LLC
LLC Agreement
LLC Partnership Agreement
Operating Agreement for LLC

What is a Limited Liability Company (LLC)?
An LLC is a type of business structure formed by filing the proper paperwork with your state. Like the name suggests, an LLC limits the liability of its members, meaning they are not personally responsible for the company's debt or obligations. 
What is an LLC Operating Agreement?
An LLC Operating Agreement is a legal document that establishes the rights and responsibilities of each LLC member and provides details about the LLC's internal management, including how decisions are made, when meetings are held, how new members are admitted and more.
Who is considered a member of an LLC?
A member of a limited liability company is an individual or corporation that owns part of the LLC. He or she must have provided a form of capital contribution (money, services, property) in exchange for a percentage of ownership interest in the company.
Does an LLC have shares of stock like a corporation?
LLC's don't have shares like a corporation, but rather assign a percentage of ownership according to each member's capital contribution. Regardless of the amount of members in an LLC, ownership percentages should always add up to 100%.
What does an LLC Operating Agreement include?
LLC Information
The LLC Operating Agreement has information about the LLC itself, including the name, type/description of services, how long the LLC will be in business, and office address.
Member Information
The LLC agreement includes the following information for each member:

Name and address
Membership class
Capital contribution
Percentage of ownership
Share of profits and losses

An operating agreement also addresses whether a member can voluntarily leave the LLC, if they can compete against the LLC after leaving, how assets are distributed if the company dissolves, and how new members are admitted.
Management
An LLC Operating Agreement specifies how the company will be managed, including how decisions will be made and if actions require a majority of members to vote in favor of decisions (referred to as unanimous consent).
Regular meetings are part of an LLC's obligations, which is why details regarding where and when meetings will be held are important to include in the operating agreement.
An LLC can be managed either by its members or by a designated manager.
Administration
Financial and administrative aspects of an LLC are defined in the operating agreement, including the LLC's accounting methods, fiscal year, annual report details and more.
Other Details in an LLC Agreement
The operating agreement may also specify who has the ability to sign contracts on behalf of the company and methods used to resolve disputes.
Why should an LLC use an Operating Agreement?
By creating and agreeing to all the terms laid out in an operating agreement, members find there are fewer discrepancies in how business is conducted or how profits and losses are distributed.
An LLC Operating Agreement also allows members to specify their own rules for the company, and will serve as an important reference tool if a member decides to withdraw, the company dissolves, or a new member is admitted.
What is the difference between a partnership and an LLC?
A general partnership and an LLC are similar but members of an LLC have limited liability for the debts and obligations of the LLC. In a general partnership, partners have unlimited liability for the debts and obligations of the partnership.
Can members amend (change) terms in the LLC Operating Agreement?
Yes, an operating agreement can be amended if every member agrees and signs an amendment.
Related Documents:

Partnership Agreement: Contract used to spell out the terms of a general partnership between two or more partners. 
Shareholder Agreement: Similar to an LLC Operating Agreement, but it is used by shareholders to define management details, how disputes are resolved, share value and more in a corporation.
Articles of Incorporation: Documents filed with the government to register your business as a corporation.
Business Plan: A comprehensive document that outlines your company's values, future goals, financial projections, marketing and sales plan, and employee/management details.

OPERATING AGREEMENT of _______________

This Operating Agreement (the "Agreement") made and entered into this 27th day of July, 2017 (the "Execution Date"),
	
BY:

_________________________ of ________________________________________, _________________________,  __________
	
(the "Member").
	
BACKGROUND:


The Member wishes to be the sole member of a limited liability company.

The terms and conditions of this Agreement will govern the Member within the limited liability company. 


IN CONSIDERATION OF and as a condition of the Member entering into this Agreement and other valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is acknowledged, the Member agrees as follows:
	

Formation

By this Agreement, the Member forms a Limited Liability Company (the "Company") in accordance with the laws of the State of California. The rights and obligations of the Member will be as stated in the California Revised Uniform Limited Liability Company Act (the "Act") except as otherwise provided in this agreement.

Name

The name of the Company will be _______________.

Sole Member

While the Company consists only of one Member, any reference in this Agreement to two or more Members and that requires the majority consent or unanimous consent of Members, or that requires a certain percentage vote of Members, should be interpreted as only requiring the consent or vote of the sole Member.

Purpose

____________________________________________________________.

Term

The Company will continue until terminated as provided in this Agreement or may dissolve under conditions provided in the Act.

Place of Business

The Principal Office of the Company will be located at ____________________, _______________,  __________ or such other place as the Member may from time to time designate.

Capital Contributions

The following table shows the Initial Contributions of the Member. The Member agrees to make the Initial Contributions to the Company in full, according to the following terms:



Member



Contribution Description



Value ofContribution




 
					
 
					

$0.00
						






Allocation of Profits/Losses

Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, the Net Profits or Losses, for both accounting and tax purposes, will accrue to and be borne by the sole Member: _________________________ of ________________________________________, _________________________,  __________.

Where the Company consists of two or more Members, no Member will have priority over any other Member for the distribution of Net Profits or Losses.

Nature of Interest

A Member's Interest in the Company will be considered personal property.

Withdrawal of Contribution

Where the Company consists of two or more Members, no Member will withdraw any portion of their Capital Contribution without the unanimous consent of the other Members.

Liability for Contribution

A Member's obligation to make their required Capital Contribution can only be compromised or released with the consent of all remaining Members or as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If a Member does not make the Capital Contribution when it is due, he is obligated at the option of any remaining Members to contribute cash equal to the agreed value of the Capital Contribution. This option is in addition to and not in lieu of any others rights, including the right to specific performance that the Company may have against the Member.

Additional Contributions

Capital Contributions may be amended from time to time, according to the business needs of the Company. However if additional capital is determined to be required and an individual Member is unwilling or unable to meet the additional contribution requirement within a reasonable period, and where the Company consists of two or more Members, the remaining Members may contribute in proportion to their existing Capital Contributions to resolve the amount in default. In such case, the allocation of Net Profits or Losses and the distribution of assets on dissociation or dissolution will be adjusted accordingly.

Any advance of money to the Company by any Member in excess of the amounts provided for in this Agreement or subsequently agreed to, will be deemed a debt due from the Company rather than an increase in the Capital Contribution of the Member. This liability will be repaid with interest at such rates and times to be determined by a majority of the Members. This liability will not entitle the lending Member to any increased share of the Company's profits nor to a greater voting power. Repayment of such debts will have priority over any other payments to Members.

Capital Accounts

An individual capital account (the "Capital Account") will be maintained for each Member and their Initial Contributions will be credited to this account. Any Additional Contributions made by any Member will be credited to that Member's individual Capital Account.

Interest on Capital

No borrowing charge or loan interest will be due or payable to any Member on their agreed Capital Contribution inclusive of any agreed Additional Contributions.

Management

Management of this Company is vested in the Member.

Authority to Bind Company

Only the following individuals have authority to bind the Company in contract: ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________.

Duty of Loyalty

Any Member may invest in or engage in any business of any type, including without limitation, a business that is similar to the business of the Company whether or not in direct competition with the Company and whether or not within the established or contemplated market regions of the Company. Neither the Company nor any Member will have any right to that opportunity or any income derived from that opportunity.

Duty to Devote Time

Each Member will devote such time and attention to the business of the Company as the majority of the Members will from time to time reasonably determine for the conduct of the Company's business.

Member Meetings

Where the Company consists of two or more Members, a meeting may be called by any Member providing that reasonable notice has been given to the other Members.

Regular meetings of the Members will be held as required.

Voting

Each Member will be entitled to cast votes on any matter based upon the proportion of that Member's Capital Contributions in the Company.

Admission of New Members

No new Members may be admitted into the Company.

Voluntary Withdrawal of a Member

A Member may not withdraw from the Company without the unanimous consent of the remaining Members. Any such unauthorized withdrawal will be considered a wrongful dissociation and a breach of this Agreement. In the event of any such wrongful dissociation, the withdrawing Member will be liable to the remaining Members for any damages incurred by the remaining Members including but not limited to the loss of future earnings.

The voluntary withdrawal of a Member will have no effect upon the continuance of the Company.

It remains incumbent on the withdrawing Member to exercise this dissociation in good faith and to minimize any present or future harm done to the remaining Members as a result of the withdrawal.

Involuntary Withdrawal of a Member

Events leading to the involuntary withdrawal of a Member from the Company will include but not be limited to: death of a Member; Member mental incapacity; Member disability preventing reasonable participation in the Company; Member incompetence; breach of fiduciary duties by a Member; criminal conviction of a Member; Operation of Law against a Member or a legal judgment against a Member that can reasonably be expected to bring the business or societal reputation of the Company into disrepute. Expulsion of a Member can also occur on application by the Company or another Member, where it has been judicially determined that the Member: has engaged in wrongful conduct that adversely and materially affected the Company's business; has willfully or persistently committed a material breach of this Agreement or of a duty owed to the Company or to the other Members; or has engaged in conduct relating to the Company's business that makes it not reasonably practicable to carry on the business with the Member.

The involuntary withdrawal of a Member will have no effect upon the continuance of the Company.

Dissociation of a Member

Where the Company consists of two or more Members, in the event of either a voluntary or involuntary withdrawal of a Member, if the remaining Members elect to purchase the interest of the withdrawing Member, the remaining Members will serve written notice of such election, including the purchase price and method and schedule of payment for the withdrawing Member's Interests, upon the withdrawing Member, their executor, administrator, trustee, committee or analogous fiduciary within a reasonable period after acquiring knowledge of the change in circumstance to the affected Member. 

Valuation and distribution will be determined as described in the Valuation of Interest section of this Agreement.

Any remaining Members retain the right to seek damages from a dissociated Member where the dissociation resulted from a malicious or criminal act by the dissociated Member or where the dissociated Member had breached their fiduciary duty to the Company or was in breach of this Agreement or had acted in a way that could reasonably be foreseen to bring harm or damage to the Company or to the reputation of the Company.

A dissociated Member will only have liability for Company obligations that were incurred during their time as a Member. On dissociation of a Member, the Company will prepare, file, serve, and publish all notices required by law to protect the dissociated Member from liability for future Company obligations.

Where any remaining Members have purchased the interest of a dissociated Member, the purchase amount will be paid in full, but without interest, within 90 days of the date of withdrawal. The Company will retain exclusive rights to use of the trade name and firm name and all related brand and model names of the Company.

Right of First Purchase

Where the Company consists of two or more Members, in the event that a Member's Interest in the Company is or will be sold, due to any reason, the remaining Members will have a right of first purchase of that Member's Interest. 

Assignment of Interest

In the event that a Member’s interest in the company is transferred or assigned as the result of a court order or Operation of Law, the trustee in bankruptcy or other person acquiring that Member's Interests in the Company will only acquire that Member's economic rights and interests and will not acquire any other rights of that Member or be admitted as a Member of the Company or have the right to exercise any management or voting interests.

Valuation of Interest

Where the Company consists of two or more Members, a Member's financial interest in the Company will be in proportion to their Capital Contributions, inclusive of any Additional Capital Contributions.

In the absence of a written agreement setting a value, the value of the Company will be based on the fair market value appraisal of all Company assets (less liabilities) determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). This appraisal will be conducted by an independent accounting firm agreed to by all Members. An appraiser will be appointed within a reasonable period of the date of withdrawal or dissolution. The results of the appraisal will be binding on all Members.

No allowance will be made for goodwill, trade name, patents or other intangible assets, except where those assets have been reflected on the Company books immediately prior to valuation.

Dissolution

The Company may be dissolved by a unanimous vote of the Members. The Company will also be dissolved on the occurrence of events specified in the Act.

Upon Dissolution of the Company and liquidation of Company property, and after payment of all selling costs and expenses, the liquidator will distribute the Company assets to the following groups according to the following order of priority:

in satisfaction of liabilities to creditors except Company obligations to current Members;

in satisfaction of Company debt obligations to current Members; and then

to the Member.



Records

The Company will at all times maintain accurate records of the following:

Information regarding the status of the business and the financial condition of the Company.

A copy of the Company federal, state, and local income taxes for each year, promptly after becoming available.

Name and last known business, residential, or mailing address of each Member, as well as the date that person became a Member.

A copy of this Agreement and any articles or certificate of formation, as well as all amendments, together with any executed copies of any written powers of attorney pursuant to which this Agreement, articles or certificate, and any amendments have been executed.

The cash, property, and services contributed to the Company by each Member, along with a description and value, and any contributions that have been agreed to be made in the future.



Each Member has the right to demand, within a reasonable period of time, a copy of any of the above documents for any purpose reasonably related to their interest as a Member of the Company, at their expense.

Books of Account

Accurate and complete books of account of the transactions of the Company will be kept in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and at all reasonable times will be available and open to inspection and examination by any Member. The books and records of the Company will reflect all the Company’s transactions and will be appropriate and adequate for the business conducted by the Company.

Banking and Company Funds

The funds of the Company will be placed in such investments and banking accounts as will be designated by the Member. All withdrawals from these accounts will be made by the duly authorized agent or agents of the Company as appointed by unanimous consent of the Members. Company funds will be held in the name of the Company and will not be commingled with those of any other person or entity.

Audit

Any of the Members will have the right to request an audit of the Company books. The cost of the audit will be borne by the Company. The audit will be performed by an accounting firm acceptable to all the Members. Not more than one (1) audit will be required by any or all of the Members for any fiscal year.

Tax Treatment

This Company is intended to be treated as a disregarded entity, for the purposes of Federal and State Income Tax.

Annual Report

As soon as practicable after the close of each fiscal year, the Company will furnish to each Member an annual report showing a full and complete account of the condition of the Company including all information as will be necessary for the preparation of each Member's income or other tax returns. This report will consist of at least:

A copy of the Company's federal income tax returns for that fiscal year.

Forbidden Acts

No Member may do any act in contravention of this Agreement.

No Member may permit, intentionally or unintentionally, the assignment of express, implied or apparent authority to a third party that is not a Member of the Company.

No Member will have the right or authority to bind or obligate the Company to any extent with regard to any matter outside the intended purpose of the Company.

No Member may confess a judgment against the Company.

An operating agreement also addresses whether a member can voluntarily leave the LLC, if they can compete against the LLC after leaving, how assets are distributed if the company dissolves, and how new members are admitted.
Management
An LLC Operating Agreement specifies how the company will be managed, including how decisions will be made and if actions require a majority of members to vote in favor of decisions (referred to as unanimous consent).
Regular meetings are part of an LLC's obligations, which is why details regarding where and when meetings will be held are important to include in the operating agreement.
An LLC can be managed either by its members or by a designated manager.
Administration
Financial and administrative aspects of an LLC are defined in the operating agreement, including the LLC's accounting methods, fiscal year, annual report details and more.
Other Details in an LLC Agreement
The operating agreement may also specify who has the ability to sign contracts on behalf of the company and methods used to resolve disputes.
Why should an LLC use an Operating Agreement?
By creating and agreeing to all the terms laid out in an operating agreement, members find there are fewer discrepancies in how business is conducted or how profits and losses are distributed.
An LLC Operating Agreement also allows members to specify their own rules for the company, and will serve as an important reference tool if a member decides to withdraw, the company dissolves, or a new member is admitted.
What is the difference between a partnership and an LLC?
A general partnership and an LLC are similar but members of an LLC have limited liability for the debts and obligations of the LLC. In a general partnership, partners have unlimited liability for the debts and obligations of the partnership.
Can members amend (change) terms in the LLC Operating Agreement?
Yes, an operating agreement can be amended if every member agrees and signs an amendment.
