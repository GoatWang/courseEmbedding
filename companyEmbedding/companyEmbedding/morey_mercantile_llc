Shipping & Returns Policy
  View complete shipping
  and returns policy & FAQs.

        


White Glove Shipping
Appropriate for large or fragile items.

      Costs range from $100 for smaller items delivered locally to $1,000+ for extra large
      items transported across the Continental United States. Final cost depends on the size of the items and the
      buyer's location.
    

      Local deliveries typically take about 2 weeks and longer
      distance deliveries typically take about 3-6 weeks.
    
Flat Rate Shipping

      Shipment through recognized carriers such as UPS, FedEx, and USPS. Appropriate for smaller items, most
      accessories and some small furniture.
    

      Costs range from $9 to $299 and up, depending on the size and weight of the item.
    
Delivery is typically 7-10 days
Local Pickup

      Local pickup allows a buyer to avoid shipping costs by picking up an item in person. The buyer must contact the
      seller within five business days of their purchase to coordinate a pickup date and time. Delays may result in
      additional charges.
    
Local Delivery

      As a lower cost alternative, some of our sellers offer local curbside delivery within a limited geography around
      their location. The buyer must contact the seller within five business days of their purchase to coordinate a
      delivery date and time. Delays may result in additional charges.
    

      If additional labor is required to move the item inside or upstairs, buyers should make sure to plan accordingly.
    




Returns & Cancellations

        Except for Local Pickup and Local Delivery, buyers have 48 hours after delivery to inspect
        their item(s) and contact support@chairish.com if they wish
        to return an item. There are no restocking fees, but we deduct outbound and return shipping charges from the
        buyer's original purchase price (+ taxes when applicable). Buyers may not be reimbursed for returns that are not
        received in original condition.
