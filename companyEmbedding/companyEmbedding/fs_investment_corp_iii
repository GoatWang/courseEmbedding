1Represents the institutional offering price of FSIC III’s common stock. The institutional offering price is subject to offering expenses of up to 1.5%. Expenses and fees are described more fully in FSIC III’s prospectus. Please consult the prospectus and read it carefully. In February 2016, FSIC III closed its public offering to investors who purchase shares of its common stock through the independent broker-dealer channel.
        

2The annualized distribution rate shown is expressed as a percentage equal to the projected annualized distribution amount per share (which is calculated by annualizing the regular weekly cash distribution per share as of the date indicated, without compounding), divided by FSIC III’s institutional offering price per share as of the date indicated. The annualized distribution rate shown may be rounded. The payment of future distributions on FSIC III’s shares of common stock is subject to the discretion of FSIC III’s board of directors and applicable legal restrictions and, therefore, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any such future distributions. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, 100% of FSIC III’s distributions were funded through net investment income on a tax basis. No portion of FSIC III’s distributions for the three months ended March 31, 2017, was funded through expense reimbursements from FSIC III’s sponsor. The determination of the tax attributes of FSIC III’s distributions is made annually at the end of FSIC III’s fiscal year, and a determination made on an interim basis may not be representative of the actual tax attributes of FSIC III’s distributions for a full year. The actual tax characteristics of distributions to stockholders are reported to stockholders annually on Form 1099-DIV. FSIC III’s total operating expenses and excise taxes as a percentage of average net assets was 7.51% for the year ended December 31, 2016.

1
Institutional Stockholder Returns are the total returns an investor received for the highlighted period taking into account all distributions paid during such period, compounded monthly. The calculation assumes that the investor purchased shares at FSIC III's institutional offering price at the beginning of the applicable period and reinvested all cash distributions pursuant to FSIC III's distribution reinvestment plan ("DRP"). Valuation as of the end of each period is the redemption price pursuant to FSIC III’s share repurchase program on such date. Upon liquidation or redemption, market conditions may cause the actual values to be more or less than the values shown.
Although FSIC III closed its offering to new investors investing through independent broker-dealers in February 2016, it continues to offer shares to new investors through the institutional channel at the institutional offering price. FSIC III’s shares are no longer subject to a sales load, but are still subject to offering expenses of up to 1.5% of the gross proceeds received in its offering. FSIC III’s ratio of total operating expenses to average net assets was 7.51% for the year ended December 31, 2016.


2Cumulative cash distributions per share reflect the total regular cash distributions paid since inception on a per share basis as of June 30, 2017. The payment of future distributions on FSIC III’s shares is subject to the sole discretion of FSIC III’s board of directors and applicable legal restrictions and, therefore, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any such future distributions.

      View risk factors disclosure




Investing in FSIC III may be considered speculative and involves a high level of risk, including the risk of a substantial loss of investment. The following are some of the risks an investment in FSIC III’s common stock involves; however, you should carefully consider all of the information found in the section of FSIC III’s prospectus entitled “Risk Factors” before deciding to invest in shares of FSIC III’s common stock.Because there is no public trading market for shares of FSIC III’s common stock and FSIC III is not obligated to effectuate a liquidity event by a specified date, if at all, it is unlikely that you will be able to sell your shares. If you are able to sell your shares before FSIC III completes a liquidity event, it is likely that you will receive less than you paid for them. While FSIC III intends to conduct quarterly tender offers for its shares, only a limited number of shares will be eligible for repurchase and FSIC III may amend, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time. In addition, any such repurchases will be at the current institutional offering price on the date of repurchase. FSIC III intends to invest in securities that are rated below investment grade by rating agencies or that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. Below investment grade securities, which are often referred to as “junk,” have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. They may also be difficult to value and illiquid. FSIC III’s distributions may be funded from unlimited amounts of offering proceeds or borrowings, which may constitute a return of capital and reduce the amount of capital available toFSIC III for investment. Any capital returned to stockholders through distributions will be distributed after payment of fees and expenses. An investment strategy focused primarily on privately held companies presents certain challenges, including lack of available information about these companies.Investing in middle market companies involves a number of significant risks, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on FSIC III’s operating results.A lack of liquidity in certain of FSIC III’s investments may adversely affect its business.FSIC III is subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, which may have a substantial negative impact on its investments.FSIC III has borrowed funds to make investments, which increases the volatility of its investments and may increase the risks of investing in its securities.FSIC III has limited operating history and is subject to the business risks and uncertainties associated with any new business.If FSIC III is unable to raise substantial funds in its ongoing, continuous “best efforts” public offering, then FSIC III will be more limited in the number and type of investments it may make.FSIC III is a long-term investment for persons of adequate financial means who have no need for liquidity in their investment. To invest in FSIC III, an investor must have either (i) a net worth of at least $70,000 and an annual gross income of at least $70,000, or (ii) a net worth of at least $250,000. Some states impose higher suitability standards. Please consult the prospectus for a detailed description of the suitability standards imposed on investors, including heightened standards required by certain states. FSIC III’s previous distributions to stockholders were funded in significant part from the reimbursement of certain expenses, including through the waiver of certain investment advisoryfees that are subject to repayment to its affiliate, FS Investments, and FSIC III’s future distributions may be funded from such waivers and reimbursements. Significant portions of thesedistributions may not be based on FSIC III’s investment performance, and such waivers and reimbursements by FS Investments may not continue in the future. If FS Investments were notto reimburse certain of FSIC III’s expenses, including through the waiver of certain of its advisory fees, significant portions of these distributions may come from offering proceeds orborrowings. The repayment of any amount owed to FS Investments will reduce the future distributions to which you would otherwise be entitled. 







To invest in FSIC III, an investor must have either (i) a net worth of at least $70,000 and an annual gross income of at least $70,000, or (ii) a net worth of at least $250,000. Some states impose higher suitability standards. Please consult the prospectus for a detailed description of the suitability standards imposed on investors, including heightened standards required by certain states. An investment in FSIC III’s common stock involves significant costs and investors should review the information in FSIC III’s prospectus regarding fees and expenses. Corporate governanceFS Investment Solutions, LLC | 201 Rouse Boulevard | Philadelphia, PA 19112877-372-9880 | Member FINRA/SIPC

1FSIC II’s Stockholder Returns (Without Sales Charge) are the total returns an investor received for the highlighted period taking into account all distributions paid during such period, compounded monthly. Except for the YTD, 1 Year and 3 Year periods, the calculation assumes that the investor purchased shares at FSIC II’s public offering price, excluding selling commissions and dealer manager fees, at the beginning of the applicable period and reinvested all cash distributions pursuant to FSIC II’s distribution reinvestment plan (“DRP”). Since FSIC II closed its public offering in March 2014 and has since issued new shares only pursuant to its DRP, the calculation of FSIC II’s Stockholder Returns (Without Sales Charge) for the YTD, 1 Year and 3 Year periods assumes that the investor purchased shares at the beginning of the applicable period at a price based upon FSIC II’s DRP on such date. Valuation as of the end of each period is the redemption price pursuant to FSIC II’s share repurchase program on such date. Stockholder Returns (Without Sales Charge) do not include selling commissions and dealer manager fees, which could total up to 10% of FSIC II’s public offering price. Had such selling commissions and dealer manager fees been included, performance would be lower. Upon liquidation or redemption, market conditions may cause the actual values to be more or less than the values shown.
FSIC II is closed to new investors. FSIC II’s total expenses as a percentage to average net assets attributable to common stock was 8.96% for the year ended December 31, 2016.


2Stockholder Return (With Sales Charge) is the total return an investor received since inception taking into account all distributions paid during such period, compounded monthly. The calculation assumes that the investor purchased shares at FSIC II’s public offering price, including the maximum selling commissions and dealer manager fees, at inception and reinvested all distributions pursuant to FSIC II’s DRP. Valuation as of the end of the period is the redemption price pursuant to FSIC II’s share repurchase program on such date. Upon liquidation or redemption, market conditions may cause the actual values to be more or less than the values shown.
              

3Cumulative cash distributions per share reflect the total regular cash distributions paid since inception on a per share basis as of June 30, 2017. The payment of future distributions on FSIC II’s shares is subject to the sole discretion of FSIC II’s board of directors, and applicable legal restrictions and, therefore, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any such future distributions.

All-Channel Trend Report>Alt Investments BDCs: Good for the Broker, Bad for the Client


    In the wake of the implosion of many non-traded REITs, non-traded business development companies (BDCs) have emerged as a relatively new structure that is getting a lot of attention. But with high up-front fees and limited liquidity, some say they’re not good for the client.  

Diana Britton | Jul 25, 2012




































	In the world of investing, product departments are constantly putting new spins on old ideas, confident there will always be investors looking for the next best thing that will provide outsized yield. Most of those new ideas are meant to make lots of money for the people who sell them. Less often, they make money for the investors who buy them.  In the wake of the implosion of many non-traded REITs, non-traded business development companies (BDCs) have emerged as a relatively new structure that is getting a lot of attention. But with high up-front fees, limited liquidity and sometimes a reliance on leverage to goose returns, buyer beware.

	“In my opinion, brokers should not be selling private anything—private placement, private REIT, private business development corporation—because it limits the flexibility, it limits liquidity, it limits transparency, and it almost always means higher fees internal,” said Joshua Brown, vice president of Investments at Fusion Analytics Investment Partners. “The only reason [non-traded BDCs] get sold is because it’s product and it’s sexy and it’s a way for a broker to get a higher fee for the same dollars that they would put into a public version.”

	According to Tony Chereso, president and CEO of FactRight, the front-end loads on BDCs are fairly similar to non-traded REITs, which are high - typically around 11.5 to 12 percent. On top of that, BDCs also typically have an incentive structure of "two and twenty," charging two percent of assets in management fees and 20% of capital gains, based on performance.

	“The downside is, it’s a huge hurdle just to get back to even,” because of the up-front fees, Brown said. “Do you know how hard it is to generate 11 percent in this day and age? With flat stock markets and Treasuries yielding 1.5 percent?”

	Non-traded BDCs are pitched as high-yield vehicles, Brown said, so that’s their sex appeal. But they also exist in the public markets, "so why would you look for one outside of that? Is the yield going to be that much better? Probably not.”

New Players in the Market

	Whenever a lot of new players jump on a trend and new assets are gathered, losses often follow. And lately, BDCs—the non-traded variety—are gaining a lot of new traction and interest from advisors and product developers.  

	“If they find that the trend is moving towards a new structure other than the non-traded REITs, I think you might see a groundswell in that direction by some people that are just taking advantage of clients looking for more non-traditional alternative investments that are maybe not subject to the same volatility that the stock market has,” said Gordon Dunne, managing director at The Financial Services Network, an OSJ of LPL Financial.

	According to FactRight, BDCs have registered approximately $7.5 billion in total equity offerings. In the first quarter of this year alone, BDCs raised $655 million, up from $233 million raised in the first quarter 2011, according to data by Robert A. Stanger & Company, Shrewsbury N.J.-based investment-banking firm.

	As of April, there were four non-traded BDCs available for investment and another six funds in registration. Franklin Square was the first to launch a non-traded BDC in 2008, but many players new to the space have launched funds recently, including CNL Securities, which uses Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. as subadvisor; ICON Investment, which uses Apollo Investment Management as subadvisor; and American Realty Capital. All three firms have a background in non-traded REITs.

	These new players are hoping to leverage off of the success of Franklin Square, Chereso said. Franklin Square now has $3.5 billion in AUM and three BDCs, the first of which was closed in May.

	“I worry about firms that are in the real estate business, then all of a sudden they’re in the business of doing what Franklin Square does,” Dunne said. “Do you really understand credit? Do you have the wherewithal internally? Do you have a relationship with firms that have a long track record of making loans to private companies? I just hope that the BDC concept doesn’t get confused.”

	Dunne’s firm invested $30 million in Franklin Square’s first BDC, FS Investment Corporation.

	Just as small, inexperienced managers entered the REIT space over the last decade, Dunne fears the same thing could happen in the BDC space.

	“There have been quite a few firms that have gravitated to this investment structure,” said Chereso. “Some of them have some direct experience,” such as on the publicly traded side of BDCs.

	But if a firm’s core competency is in another area, such as energy or real estate, and they don’t understand credit or credit underwriting, “That causes some concerns,” Chereso said.

	Many of these firms launching BDCs have strong financial positions and resources, but the question is whether they have the depth of talent and capability to manage these strategies effectively, he said.  

	“My biggest concern is there are lots of folks that are jumping into the space, particularly the sponsors, who don’t have a lot, if any, experience in corporate credit in writing BDCs,” Michael Forman, CEO of Franklin Square.

	BDCs provide financing to small and mid-sized businesses. In recent years, they’ve sought to capitalize on the relative lack of debt capital in these markets, as banks restricted lending to build their capital reserves, Stanger says.

	BDCs use a structure similar to non-traded REITs in that capital is raised in a continuous private offering, but BDCs are regulated under the 1940 Act that governs mutual funds. The big difference is that they’re valued quarterly, while non-traded REITs are required to publish their valuations no later than 18 months after the conclusion of the offering. (See chart below comparing other aspects of BDCs and REITs.)

	“I think there’s a lot of concern and skepticism with respect to the REITs, and they look at us as being different,” said Forman. “I think we’ve kind of forced the REITs to have to change their business model a little bit.”

	But they are private vehicles, so they don’t have the daily liquidity that comes with the public markets. “When you have the opacity and you’re away from the public market, your filing requirements are different, you don’t have to disclose as much financial metrics as you would if you were public; it gives you the opportunity to fudge numbers, prolong taking of losses, prolong taking of marks in the portfolio," Brown said.
