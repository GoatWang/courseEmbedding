The Company also announced that it has promoted Anita J. Nigrel to Executive Vice President and Chief Retail Officer to succeed Mr. Filipo.President and CEO Howard C. Bluver stated: “It is with very mixed emotions that I congratulate Frank on his retirement. In the 17 years Frank has been with us, there is simply no one who has done more to preserve and grow the core deposit franchise that is our shining jewel. During his tenure, Frank’s most important role has been to run our branch system, grow our deposit base, and preserve our extraordinarily low cost of funds. His success in accomplishing all of this leaves the Bank in a great position and I am very grateful to him. I wish Frank nothing but the best in retirement, although I know he will remain a great friend to all of us at the Bank and will be available for advice and consultation whenever it is needed.I am also grateful to Frank for providing me with two years advance notice of his retirement, so we could plan a smooth transition together. In that regard, I couldn’t be more pleased to announce the promotion of Anita J. Nigrel to Executive Vice President and Chief Retail Officer. Anita has been with the Bank for 25 years and, among her many duties, she has been responsible for branch operations for over a decade. Accordingly, there is no one who is more ready, willing and able to take control of our branch system and continue the important work of preserving and growing our core deposit franchise. Anita is universally respected throughout our organization, as well as in the community banking world within our marketplace, and I know we will not miss a beat with Anita in charge. I look forward to working closely with her in the years to come.”Corporate InformationSuffolk Bancorp is a one-bank holding company engaged in the commercial banking business through Suffolk County National Bank, a full service commercial bank headquartered in Riverhead, New York and Suffolk Bancorp’s wholly owned subsidiary.

SCNB: Anita Nigrel to take over as Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer

By RiverheadLOCAL -   Jul 9, 2015, 12:23 pm 



Suffolk County National Bank’s parent company, Suffolk Bancorp, announced Friday that Anita Nigrel will be taking over as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer for Frank Filipo, who is retiring.
Filipo served as Executive Vice President of the Company and the Bank since 2003 and was responsible for the Retail Banking Division since 2001.
“It is with very mixed emotions that I congratulate Frank on his retirement. In the 17 years Frank has been with us, there is simply no one who has done more to preserve and grow the core deposit franchise that is our shining jewel,” said President and CEO Howard C. Bluver.
Bluver credited Filipo with running the branch system, growing the deposit base and preserving the company’s low cost of funds.
“I couldn’t be more pleased to announce the promotion of Anita J. Nigrel to Executive Vice President and Chief Retail Officer. Anita has been with the Bank for 25 years and, among her many duties, she has been responsible for branch operations for over a decade,” Bluver said.
