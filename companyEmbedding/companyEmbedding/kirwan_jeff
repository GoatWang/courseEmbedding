Gap Inc. Elevates Two Proven Executives to Guide Gap and Banana Republic Brands into the Next Decade


Global brand presidents named: Andi Owen to lead Banana Republic and Jeff Kirwan to take over Gap



SAN FRANCISCO – November 20, 2014 – With an eye towards 2015, Gap Inc. (NYSE: GPS) today announced the promotion of two successful current executives, with 35 years of combined company experience between them, to become global brand presidents for Gap and Banana Republic.
The moves were orchestrated by Art Peck as he prepares to take on the role of chief executive officer of Gap Inc. in February, with the full support of current chairman and chief executive officer Glenn Murphy.
“We’ll start 2015 with a management team comprised of both established executives and the next generation of brand leaders ready for the next generation of customers,” said Peck.  “We’ve provided a transition period that allows our teams to deliver a successful holiday, while gearing up for a future where great product, showcased seamlessly across physical and digital experiences, consistently delights our customers.”
Jeff Kirwan, 48, who has reported to Murphy for the past three years as president of greater China for Gap Inc., will become Global President for Gap brand in December following a brief transition period.  Kirwan succeeds Stephen Sunnucks, who will leave the company on December 19, after steering the growth of its namesake brand to almost 50 countries over the past decade.
Under Kirwan’s leadership in China, Gap has deployed an aggressive e-commerce strategy, coupled with opening 100 stores in the region in just four years.  Over the past decade with Gap Inc., Kirwan has succeeded in roles of increasing responsibility at Gap and Old Navy, with an expertise in driving growth, retail operations, and brand development.
Andi Owen, 49, who currently leads the Gap Outlet division, will become Global President for Banana Republic, effective January 5.  She succeeds Jack Calhoun, who will depart from the company on February 1 after working with Owen during the transition.  Calhoun, who led the brand for eight years, is credited with pioneering innovative concepts while creating an impressive global economic model for Banana Republic.   
Over nearly 25 years with the company, Owen has thrived in many leadership roles within merchandising, online, and stores.  She has spent 19 years working within Banana Republic, rising from management positions in the field to successfully leading the Banana Republic Factory Store business before taking on her current assignment as EVP of Global Gap Outlet.
“These are important changes within the company, and I’ve been impressed with both Jeff and Andi’s development during our work together these past eight years.  We’ve prepared leaders, with experience across all aspects of the global business, who are ready and eager for the challenges and the opportunities ahead,” said Gap Inc. Chairman and CEO Glenn Murphy.
Murphy added, “Over the past decade, both Steve and Jack helped make Gap Inc. a much stronger and more global company. We appreciate their hard work and passion for our brands, people, and customers.”
Owen and Kirwan will report to Peck in 2015.
“Over the past decade, I’ve worked with Jeff and Andi and seen them in action.  They each bring the creativity, tenacity, and exceptional leadership qualities necessary for these roles, and, importantly, they have consistently delivered results for our brands and company,” Peck added.
Webcast and Conference Call Information
The company will host a conference call with investors and analysts to discuss the company's third quarter 2014 results and leadership announcement starting at approximately 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time today.  Katrina O'Connell, vice president of Corporate Finance and Investor Relations at Gap Inc., will host the call and be joined by Sabrina Simmons, Gap Inc. chief financial officer, Glenn Murphy, Gap Inc. chairman and chief executive officer and Art Peck, president of Gap Inc. Growth, Innovation & Digital division.    
The conference call can be accessed by calling 1-855-5000-GPS or 1-855-500-0477 (participant passcode:1609362). International callers may dial 913-643-0954. The webcast can be accessed at www.gapinc.com.

Urban Forestry Issues



Urban Forestry Issues (PDF)



The U.S. population has grown increasingly urban each decade, from 28 percent in 1910 to 80 percent in 2000 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2002). In the Chesapeake watershed alone, residential development is predicted to consume 800,000 acres between 2003 and 2030, nearly 90 percent of it replacing farmland (Boesch and Greer, 2003). As urban communities grow larger and faster than ever before, natural resource management in these areas becomes crucial for achieving sustainable development and maintaining and enhancing the quality of life and the environment.

Virginia Master Naturalist, American Naturalists (PDF)



Jared Diamond (2005), in his book,
“Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail
or Succeed,” defines landscape amnesia as
one of the primary mechanisms for the
decline and ultimate collapse of societies.
This phenomenon occurs when people
lose knowledge of how the natural world
once was, with each succeeding generation
accepting a degraded environment as the
status quo. Carried to its end, a society
remains unconcerned until it reaches the
point of no return.

WRITE A COMMENT
























CREDIT: Getty Images










A couple of weeks ago, a young girl named Alice Jacob wrote a letter to fashion retailer Gap asking for the store to consider more variety in the clothes it offers to girls, instead of "just pink and princesses and stuff like that."
(As a father to an awesome 2-year-old daughter who happens to love dinosaurs, I completely get this request.)
Well, the president and CEO of Gap, Jeff Kirwan, just responded.
And his email is remarkable.
As reported by The Washington Post:
Hi Alice,
I got hold of the letters you sent in and wanted to be the one to reply to you. I'm Jeff and I'm the head of Gap.
You sound like a really cool kid with a great sense of style.
At GapKids, we try to always offer a wide range of styles and choices for girls and boys. This includes a selection of girls' tees with dinosaurs, firetrucks, sharks, footballs, and some of our superheroes. Our latest Disney Collection, Beauty and the Beast, is also all about the strength and bravery of girls, and that's something that's really important to us.
But, you are right, I think we can do a better job offering even more choices that appeal to everyone. I've talked with our designers and we're going to work on even more fun stuff that I think you'll like.
In the meantime, I'm going to send you a few of my favorite tees from our latest collection. Please check them out and let us know what you think. Our customers' comments are very important to us, and they help us create even better products with each season.
Thank you again,Jeff
Gap Brand President & CEO
Wow. Now that's what I call customer service.
There are a few things that make Kirwan's message so great, and that leaders everywhere can learn from.
For example:
 Identifying that customer complaints are a gift--because they offer valuable feedback and the opportunity to improve Sending free stuff in exchange for that valuable feedback, which makes a huge impression and will probably win that customer for life Praising and acknowledging the opposing party (which most people can't do nowadays)
All of these things are great. But there's one action here that stands head and shoulders above the rest:
He took advice from a 5-year-old.
That's right, a CEO of a multibillion dollar company with over 100,000 employees actually acknowledged that a 5-year-old had identified a major problem.
Not a fellow executive. Not McKinsey, or BCG.
A 5-year-old.
That's not an easy thing for most people to do.
It should be, though. Because so often, you can get the best feedback from the person you'd least expect to offer it. (Like that new intern. Or even the janitor.)
So, if you take only one thing away from Kirwan's letter, may it be this:
Good ideas can come from anyone.
No matter how old they are.
