This Restricted Stock Agreement
(this “Agreement”), dated as of the Grant Date, May 2,
2016, is between CAT9 Group Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
“Company”), and MeiHong "Sanya" Qian. Capitalized terms
used but not defined in this Agreement have the meanings attributed
to them in Appendix 1.

The parties agree as
follows:

ARTICLE I  

GRANT
OF SHARES

1.1                
Grant . As of the Grant Date, subject to the vesting
schedule and other terms contained in this Agreement, the Company
hereby grants to the Recipient, and the Recipient hereby accepts,
4,000,000 shares of Common Stock (the “Shares”), as
compensation for the Recipient’s services to the
Company.

1.2                
Delivery of Shares
. Promptly following the full
signing and delivery of this Agreement and subject to Section 2.1,
the Company shall issue to the Recipient a stock certificate by its
transfer agent, Action Stock Transfer.

1.3                
Rights as a
Shareholder . Upon
receipt of the Shares, the Recipient has all the rights of a
shareholder with respect to the Shares, subject to the terms
contained in this Agreement.

ARTICLE II  

TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS;
SECURITIES LAW COMPLIANCE

2.1                
Transfer Restrictions.
The Recipient shall not make or
attempt to make any disposition, pledge, gift, assignment, or other
transfer (voluntarily or involuntarily) of the Shares. Any such
transfer, purported transfer, or attempted transfer will be
void.

2.2                
Legend . In addition to any other restrictive legend
required by the Company, in order to reflect the restrictions on
disposition of the Shares, the Shares will bear and be subject to a
restrictive legend, similar to the following:

“THE SHARES REFERENCED HEREBY
ARE SUBJECT TO A RESTRICTED STOCK AGREEMENT, WHICH INCLUDES
RESTRICTIONS ON SHARE TRANSFERS. A COPY OF THE RESTRICTED STOCK
AGREEMENT IS ON FILE AT THE PRINCIPAL OFFICE OF THE COMPANY AND
WILL BE MAILED TO ANY PROPERLY INTERESTED PERSON WITHOUT CHARGE
UPON THE COMPANY’S RECEIPT OF A WRITTEN REQUEST FOR IT. ANY
SALE OR TRANSFER IN VIOLATION OF THE RESTRICTED STOCK AGREEMENT
WILL BE VOID.”

2.3                
Restricted Securities
. The Recipient makes the following
representations to the Company:

(a)              
The Recipient is aware of the
Company's business affairs and financial condition and has acquired
sufficient information about the Company to reach an informed and
knowledgeable decision to accept the Shares.

(b)              
The Recipient is receiving the
Shares for the Recipient’s own account for investment, not
with a view to or for sale in connection with, any distribution
thereof, nor with any present intention of distributing or selling
the same.

(c)               
The Recipient confirms that the
Recipient has been informed that the Shares are restricted
securities under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities
Act”).





1 








 




(d)              
The Recipient is prepared to hold
the Shares for the required holding period pursuant to Rule 144 of
the Securities and Exchange Commission issued under the Securities
Act.

ARTICLE III
 

TAX
PROVISIONS

3.1                
Section 83(b) Election
. The Recipient understands that
under Section 83 of the Code, the fair market value of the Shares
(or portion thereof) on the date that any forfeiture restrictions
applicable to the Shares (or portion thereof) lapse, minus the
price paid, if any, for the Shares (or portion thereof) will be
reportable as ordinary income to the Recipient on such lapse date.
For this purpose, the date the forfeiture restrictions lapse is the
date on which the Shares (or portion thereof) become Vested Shares
in accordance with Article III. The Recipient understands that the
Recipient may elect under Section 83(b) of the Code to be taxed at
the time the Shares are acquired under this Agreement, rather than
when the Shares (or a portion thereof) cease to be subject to the
forfeiture restrictions. Such election must be filed with the
Internal Revenue Service within 30 days after the Grant Date. A
form for making this election is attached as Exhibit A. The
Recipient understands that failure to make this filing within such
30-day period will result in the recognition of ordinary income by
the Recipient each time the forfeiture restrictions lapse. The
Recipient also understands and acknowledges that nothing in this
Agreement guarantees that the vesting requirements of this award
will be met. Accordingly, a Recipient who makes an election under
Section 83(b) of the Code may pay current taxes but may
subsequently forfeit all rights to the Unvested Shares by failing
to meet the vesting requirements. In such a case, the Recipient
acknowledges that the Company has no obligation to reimburse or
make whole the Recipient for the taxes paid in connection with an
election under Section 83(b) of the Code.

3.2                
Section 83(b) Election
Acknowledgement . The
Recipient acknowledges that it is the Recipient’s sole
responsibility to file a timely election under Section 83(b) of the
Code, should the Recipient opt to make a Section 83(b) election.
That filing should be made by registered or certified mail, return
receipt requested, and the Recipient should retain two copies of
the completed form for filing with the Recipient’s state and
federal tax returns for the current tax year and a copy for the
Recipient’s personal records. If making a Section 83(b)
election, the Recipient shall promptly send a copy of such 83(b)
election form to the Company.

3.3                
Valuation of Common
Stock . The Recipient
understands that the Company has valued the Shares at par value, or
$0.0001 cents per Share as of the Grant Date, which equals the fair
market value of one share of Common Stock as determined by the
Company in a manner consistent with Code Section 409A.

3.4                
Withholding
. As a condition precedent to the
release of the Vested Shares from the escrow as described in
Article IV, the Recipient shall comply with the requests of the
Company as they relate to the satisfaction of any federal, state,
or local withholding tax obligations that arise in connection with
the release of the Vested Shares. Such requests may include among
others (a) the deduction of any such required withholding from any
payments due or to become due to the Recipient, (b) the payment in
cash by the Recipient to the Company in an amount equal to any
required withholding, and (c) signing such documentation necessary
to enable withholding of Shares to satisfy tax
obligations.

ARTICLE IV
 

GENERAL
PROVISIONS

4.1                
Adjustments
. The existence of the
Recipient’s rights under this Agreement does not affect in
any way the right or power of the Company or its shareholders to
make or authorize any or all adjustments, recapitalizations,
reorganizations or other changes in the Company’s capital
structure or its business, or any merger, consolidation, or share
exchange of the Company, or any issuance of bonds, debentures or
preferred or prior preference stock ahead of or affecting Common
Stock or the rights thereof, or dissolution or liquidation of the
Company, or any sale or transfer of all or any part of its assets
or business, or any other corporate act or proceeding, whether of a
similar character or otherwise.

4.2                
Notices . To be effective, any notice, consent, or
communication required or permitted to be given in connection with
this Agreement must be in writing and (i) delivered in person, (ii)
mailed by certified or

 What does it do?   




What does it do?
	The pattern of conditions ProstateSure™ deals with falls under the category of Lin Zheng or Lin Syndrome (淋证) from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Lin means to dribble or drip, and is associated with frequent short voidings of urine. When the prostate gland is enlarged, Chinese medicine often views the condition as one of frequent, short voidings of urine with associated Kidney Qi deficiency. Qian Lie Shu Pian is appropriate for most presentations of prostate enlargement with frequent urination, as well as chronic prostatitis.Qian Lie Shu Pian powerfully tonifies and enriches the Kidneys, clears deficiency heat, drains dampness and promotes urination. Qian Lie Shu Wan is an essential formula for the treatment of many urinary and prostatic disorders with Traditional Chinese Medicine.Clinical researches have been conducted to show the effect of Qian Lie Shu Wan in relieving the symptoms of chronic prostatitis. In one study, 344 patients took the formula over a course of 1-2 months, and were compared to a control group that did not take the formula. The treatment group had dramatic improvements in chronic prostatitis, with symptoms reduced in 90% of the cases and clinical resolution in approximately 58% of the cases. Another study of 480 patients used TCM pattern differentiation, and noted improvement in 89% of the cases that were ascribed to Kidney Yang deficiency, and 82% improvement in cases ascribed to Kidney Yin deficiency patterns. A follow-up study on patients that used the formula long-term found no damage to the liver, kidneys, heart, or circulatory system.1,2Qian Lie Shu Wan is based on the classical formula Jin Gui Shen Qi Wan, which is composed of 8 herbs that can be divided into two classes of action. The first group of herbs is composed of Shu Di Huang (Rehmannia root), Shan Zhu Yu (Cornus fruit) and Shan Yao (Chinese Yam). Together these herbs tonify the Kidney Yin, enrich and stabilize essence and improve the function of the Spleen. The second group of herbs is composed of Ze Xie (Oriental water plantain), Mu Dan Pi (Peony bark) and Fu Ling (poria). These are draining herbs which clear deficiency heat and drain dampness. This action is assisted by Gui Zhi (Cinnamon twig) and Fu Zi (processed Aconite root), which help promote the transformation of water to eliminate dampness and to restore Kidney Yang's function of governing water and urination.Qian Lie Shu Wan has the addition of Yi Yi Ren (Job' Tears), Dong Gua Zi (Winter melon seed), Tao Ren (Peach seed) and Cang Zhu (Atractylodes). The addition of this group of herbs to the base formula powerfully increases this formula' emphasis on draining heat and dampness, which encumber the Urinary Bladder and/or prostate resulting in urinary difficulty, prostatic enlargement and pain. Yi Yi Ren and Dong Gua Zi strongly promote urination, clear heat and expel phlegm and pus. Tao Ren and Yi Yi Ren are both useful herbs for conditions involving pelvic pain. Cang Zhu has a warm nature and a damp-drying effect, which supports the Spleen and balances the cold nature of the other herbs in the formula.Finally, the formula has the additional herbs Yin Yang Huo (Horny goat weed) and Jiu Cai Zi (Chinese chive seed), which powerfully supplement Yang and strengthen the Kidney. This helps treat the root problem of insufficient Kidney Yang which fails to promote the proper transformation of water and the normal urination. Treating the root problem by supplementing the body' Yang helps to stem frequent urination and troublesome symptoms such as nighttime urination (nocturia).These modifications result in a formula which is well balanced and highly effective for a wide variety of urinary disorders.

I've used the Shou Wu Wan Guang Ci Tang Brand for about two plus years and recently switched over to the Hairvive brand for its higher potency.  I've not seen either effect my sparsely graying hairs, thus the main reason why I bought it, but it’s worked well in other ways.  The two most noticeable changes; it strengthened my nails, regulates bowel movements and it may help with keeping my youthful looks.

				Good for my husband
My husband have taken one bottle of Hairvive so far. His hair becomes darker. It seems works very well on his type who needs nurture Yin.

I took two bottles of Hairvive, but it works slow on me. I think I need traditional type of QI BAO MEI RAN Wan, which can nurture both Yin and Yang at the same time.

I suggest all of your medicine can be classified according to 《中医体质分类判定标准及中医体质分类与判定自测表》. Thank you.

I am 70 years old. My hairline has been retreating over the years. I was skeptical of products that claim to grow hair. As I know and trust the people at ActiveHerb, I started to take HairVive. Now after 3 months my hair is growing back on my top. I am very happy about it and proud of ActiveHerb

				Amazing
I started taking this for my hair which after 3 weeks stopped falling out. I dont know if this is what made it stop BUT my years of back aches which my Acu doc told me are due to yin deficiency are also almost gone after 3 weeks. This formula is amazing.

				not happy
As the product says, promotes hair growth, well it is not doing that. I'm still losing hair and only used this product because my acupuncturist said to and it is not working. I was so hoping it would.

CAT9
Group Inc. 

  Notes
to Condensed Financial Statements

September
30, 2016

(Unaudited)

 

NOTE 1 -
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND HISTORY

 

CAT9 Group
Inc., (the “Company”) formerly ANDES 4
Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware
on January 26, 2015, and has been inactive since inception.
The Company intends to serve as a vehicle to effect an asset
acquisition, merger, exchange of capital stock or other business
combination with a domestic or foreign business.

 

On July
31, 2015, the sole officer and director of the Company entered into
a Share Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) pursuant to
which he entered into an agreement to sell an aggregate of
10,000,000 shares of his shares of the Company’s common stock
to Chongqing Field Industrial Company Ltd. at an aggregate
purchase price of $40,000. These shares represent 100% of the
Company’s issued and outstanding common stock. Effective upon
the closing date of the Share Purchase Agreement, August 12, 2015,
the sole officer and director of the Company executed the agreement
and owned no shares of the Company’s stock and Chongqing
Field Industrial Company Ltd. was the sole stockholder of the
Company.

 

On May 2,
2016, the Company entered into Employee Agreements with Wenfa
"Simon" Sun, its President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman
of the Board of Directors, and MeiHong "Sanya" Qian, its Chief
Financial Officer and Secretary. Pursuant to the Employment
Agreement, the Company issued 6,000,000 shares of restricted common
stock to Wenfa "Simon" Sun, and 4,000,000 shares of restricted
common stock to MeiHong "Sanya" Qian.

 

On May 3,
2016, the sole shareholder of the Company, Chongqing Field
Industrial Ltd., ("CQFI") consented to a redemption of its
10,000,000 shares of common stock at a price of $0.0001 per share
for an aggregate redemption price of $1,000. As a result of this
action by CQFI, management of the Company now control 100% of the
issued and outstanding shares.

  

With the
redemption and subsequent issuance of the 10,000,000 shares of
restricted common stock, the Company effected a change in its
control and the new majority shareholders are the current members
of management of the Company.

 

NOTE 2 -
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT POLICIES

 

Basis of
presentation

The
accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements of CAT9 Group
Inc. have been prepared without audit pursuant to the rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission requirements
for interim financial statements. Therefore, they do not include
all of the information and footnotes required by accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States for complete
financial statements. The financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the audited financial statements CAT9 Group Inc.
in our Form 10-12G/A2 filed on September 8, 2015.

 

The
interim unaudited financial statements present the balance sheet,
statements of operations and cash flows CAT9 Group Inc. The
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States.

 

 

 




-  8 
-




  

 




 




[Index]

The
interim financial information is unaudited. In the opinion of
management, all adjustments necessary to present fairly the
financial position as of September 30, 2016 and the results of
operations and cash flows presented herein have been included in
the financial statements. All such adjustments are of a normal and
recurring nature. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of
results of operations for the full year.

 

Use of
estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(“U.S. GAAP”) requires the Company to make estimates
and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of
contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates and judgments
are based on historical information, information that is currently
available to the Company and on various other assumptions that the
Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

 

Cash and
cash equivalents

Cash and
cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term investments with
original maturities of less than 90 days. Cash equivalents are
placed with high credit quality financial institutions and are
primarily in money market funds. The carrying value of those
investments approximates fair value.

 

Earnings
(loss) per share

Basic
earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income
(loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted-average
number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing income
available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of
shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to
include the number of additional shares of common stock that would
have been outstanding if potentially dilutive securities had been
issued. There were no potentially dilutive securities outstanding
during the periods presented.

 

Stock-based
compensation

The
Company accounts for equity instruments issued in exchange for the
receipt of goods or services from other than employees in
accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) ASC 718-10, Compensation – Stock
Compensation, and the conclusions reached by FASB ASC 505-50,
Equity – Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees. Costs are
measured at the estimated fair market value of the consideration
received or the estimated fair value of the equity instruments
issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The value of equity
instruments issued for consideration other than employee services
is determined on the earliest of a performance commitment or
completion of performance by the provider of goods or services as
defined by FASB ASC 505-50.

 

Income
taxes

The
Company follows Section 740-10-30 of the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and
liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that
have been included in the financial statements or tax returns.
Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on
the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of
assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the
fiscal year in which the differences are expected to reverse.
Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the
extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the
assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the fiscal years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
the Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income in the period
that includes the enactment date.

[Index]

The
Company adopted section 740-10-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification (“Section 740-10-25”) with regards to
uncertainty income taxes.  Section 740-10-25 addresses the
determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be
claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial
statements.  Under Section 740-10-25, the Company may
recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it
is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on
examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical
merits of the position.  The tax benefits recognized in the
financial statements from such a position should be measured based
on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent (50%)
likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Section
740-10-25 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification,
interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim
periods and requires increased disclosures.  The Company had
no material adjustments to its liabilities for unrecognized income
tax benefits according to the provisions of Section
740-10-25.

 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

The
Company has evaluated recent pronouncements through Accounting
Standards Updates (“ASU”) 2015-08 and believes that
none of them will have a material impact on the Company’s
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

 

NOTE 3 -
GOING CONCERN

 

The
accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared on a
going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets
and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of
business. The Company has incurred losses since inception and had a
deficit accumulated of $ 45,521 as of September 30, 2016. The
Company requires capital for its contemplated operational and
marketing activities. The Company’s ability to raise
additional capital through the future issuances of common stock is
unknown. The obtainment of additional financing, the successful
development of the Company’s contemplated plan of operations,
and its transition, ultimately, to the attainment of profitable
operations are necessary for the Company to continue operations.
The ability to successfully resolve these factors raise substantial
doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going
concern. The financial statements of the Company do not include any
adjustments that may result from the outcome of these
aforementioned uncertainties.

 

NOTE 4 -
STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

The
Company is authorized to issue 5,000,000 shares of $.0001 par value

Special
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

 

The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with our
unaudited financial statements, which are included elsewhere in
this Form 10-Q (the “Report”). This Report contains
forward-looking statements which relate to future events or our
future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify
forward-looking statements by terminology such as
“may,” “should,” “expects,”
“plans,” “anticipates,”
“believes,” “estimates,”
“predicts,” “potential” or
“continue” or the negative of these terms or other
comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions and
involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors
that may cause our or our industry’s actual results, levels
of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different
from any future results, levels of activity, performance or
achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking
statements. While these forward-looking statements, and any
assumptions upon which they are based, are made in good faith and
reflect our current judgment regarding the direction of our
business, actual results will almost always vary, sometimes
materially, from any estimates, predictions, projections,
assumptions or other future performance suggested herein. Except as
required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the
United States, we do not intend to update any of the
forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual
results

 


  Item
2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations

 

On May 2,
2016, the Company entered into Employee Agreements with Wenfa
"Simon" Sun, its President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman
of the Board of Directors, and MeiHong "Sanya" Qian, its Chief
Financial Officer and Secretary. Pursuant to the Employment
Agreement, the Company issued 6,000,000 shares of restricted common
stock to Wenfa "Simon" Sun, and 4,000,000 shares of restricted
common stock to MeiHong "Sanya" Qian.

 

On May 3,
2016, the sole shareholder of the Company, Chongqing Field
Industrial Ltd., ("CQFI") consented to a redemption of its
10,000,000 shares of common stock at a price of $0.0001 per share
for an aggregate redemption price of $1,000. As a result of this
action by CQFI, management of the Company now control 100% of the
issued and outstanding shares.

  

With the
redemption and subsequent issuance of the 10,000,000 shares of
restricted common stock, the Company effected a change in its
control and the new majority shareholders are the current members
of management of the Company.

 

The
Company will attempt to locate and negotiate with a business entity
for the combination of that target company with the Company. The
combination will normally take the form of a merger,
