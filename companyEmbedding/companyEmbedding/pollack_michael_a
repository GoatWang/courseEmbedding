#1 Owner/Operator

Ranking Arizona - Since 2005









 











Michael A. Pollack 

   Michael A. Pollack is the President and Founder of Pollack Investments, one of the largest independently owned and operated real estate companies in Arizona. Pollack Investments specializes in all aspects of retail, commercial, multi-family and single family real estate developments including the ownership, management, construction, and the leasing of various types of real estate projects in California, Arizona and Nevada.  
 The 31,000 square foot corporate headquarters is located at 1136 W.   Baseline Rd., Mesa, Arizona and is home to the highly specialized equipment used on a daily basis to stay on top of the real estate market and the properties that comprise the Pollack Real Estate portfolio. 
Michael began his real estate entrepreneurial career in San Jose, California over 43 years ago starting in single-family homes but quickly moved into the multi-family residential housing business where he was personally involved in either the development or redevelopment of more than 10,000 units. 
While attending high school he also worked hands on learning most of the construction trades such as electrical, plumbing, mechanical, carpentry, sheetrock, concrete, painting, floor covering, insulation and landscaping. Michael built his first house at the age of eighteen. Michael’s real estate career has included projects in the states of California, Texas, Louisiana, Nevada and Arizona.
In 1980 Michael reinvented himself into what he is primarily known for today, “The Renovation King of distressed properties.”  Along with his vast knowledge of both construction and redevelopment Michael has a general contractor’s license in the states of California and Arizona.  Even today, Michael continues to personally oversee each and every project in the Pollack Investments portfolio including renovation, expansion of existing buildings and all new construction.
A man who likes to wear a lot of hats, Michael is involved in all aspects of his business including negotiations, acquisitions, sales, contracts, finance, leasing and MAP International Management Inc. his asset management company. Michael has been able to closely and successfully work with some of the top lending companies including: American Express, Ameriprise, Riversource, Sonoma National Bank, Wells Fargo Bank, Bank of America, Bank of the West, California Business Bank, Thrivent Financial, John Hancock Life Insurance Company, Northmarq Capital, Key Bank, Plaza Bank of Commerce and Comerica Bank.  Michael is proud of the fact that he has paid lenders on time and according to the agreement of loan documents.
With over 40 years in the real estate business Michael A. Pollack has survived and outlasted many challenging times in the cyclical real estate market. He relies on his experience and personal involvement in more than 10,000,000 square feet of real estate projects to guide him through turbulent markets.  In 2007 Michael began to prepare for a ride through the down turn in the economy by strategically selling off unproductive land and selected properties.  He is never one to miss an opportunity therefore in 2009 he returned to his roots acquiring single family homes in Arizona and Nevada to both diversify his holdings and add to his vast real estate portfolio.
Michael has been on the Economic Development Board for the city of Chandler, Arizona as well as the Mayor’s 4 Corner Economic Board. He is always aware of the current market conditions when not at his office or on a job site Michael constantly tours properties looking for his next potential acquisition.  His persistence to excellence and the pride he has for turning out beautiful properties is only possible through his hard work which is evident in his seven day work week.
Being a news headliner is nothing new to a man who has much to say about past, current, and future real estate markets.  Michael has been featured in numerous newspapers, magazines, and television shows including: the Wall Street Journal, Commercial Leasing Update, Arizona Republic, Arizona Tribune, San Jose Mercury News, Las Vegas Sun, The New Orleans Time Picayune, Orange County Register, San Francisco Chronicle, Personal Real Estate Investor, Today’s Arizona Women, National Real Estate Investor, Peoria Times, Shopping Center Today, Tucson Business, Shopping Center Business, Globe Street, Los Angeles Times, Houston Chronicle, Houston Post, Houston Monthly Magazine, Phoenix Business Journal, Shopping Center World, USA Today, Fox, NBC, CBS, ABC, A&E Network, and numerous cable shows.  In 1977 Michael also had his own T.V. show called, “Topics and Answers” and in 1982 Michael Co-hosted Houston Nightlife.  In 1999 Michael hosted a business radio show in Phoenix, Arizona that was awarded most outstanding talk program.  With his deep voice, recognizable to many, Michael has been featured in more than 100 radio, TV and newspaper ads.
As an advocate for giving back to the communities, he works and lives in, Michael gives both personally and professionally to various charities and non-profit organizations.  The list is too extensive to catalog but includes some of the following charities:  Goodwill Industries, Banner Health Foundation, Save the Family, City of Hope, Boys and Girls Club, Boy Scouts of America, Haitian Disaster Relief, Chandler Regional Hospital, Assistance League of the East Valley, Special Olympics, Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, American Cancer Society, Chandler Jaycees, Cystic Fibrosis, Chandler Center for the Arts, Tempe Center for the Arts, The International Commission, Mesa Center for the Arts, Friends for Live Animal Sanctuary, Muscular Dystrophy, Burn Foundation, Rotary International, YMCA, Child Crisis Center, Desert Cancer Foundation, St. Mary’s Food Bank, Chandler Education Foundation, Gilbert Education Foundation and the Pollack Chabad of the East Valley.
Michael A. Pollack does not just give financial help, but he is also an accomplished auctioneer and Master of Ceremonies, who has given his time and talent throughout the years to numerous charities in order to help make a positive difference in the lives of others. Combining his life-long love of music with his ability to play drums, Michael displayed yet another facet of himself starting in 2003 when he founded and performed in the band “Corporate Affair”.  The band has played various charity events around the valley of the sun at some of the following venues:  Arizona Biltmore, Phoenician Resort, The Buttes Resort, Sheraton Wild Horse Pass, Arizona Grand, Desert Ridge Marriott, Hyatt Regency Resort and Spa, Mesa Hilton, Scottsdale Waterfront, and The Celebrity Theater at no cost to the various charities.  Never slowing down Michael designed and built an award winning parade float which has been featured in several parades including APS Light Parade, Fiesta Bowl, Chandler Parade, Gilbert Parade, Scottsdale Parade and the Tempe Light Parade showcasing his talent and love for entertaining the hundreds of thousands of people along the parade routes.
Giving back to the community has always been an important part of Michael’s personality and life; he implanted that strong desire to give within each of his children.  With the 2011 tragic loss of his eldest son, Michael led with his heart to establish the Daniel Heath Pollack Memorial foundation in his son’s name, to continue giving to charities that Daniel supported, in his memory.  Michael has received numerous commendations, resolutions and proclamations from senators, congressional representatives, governors, mayors, city councils, county supervisors and commercial industry leaders for his achievements in renovation and community revitalization.

Among his notable accolades is a special recognition from President George W. Bush,a certificate of special recognition from Arizona Governors Jane Dee Hull, Fife Symington and Jan Brewer and letters of congratulations from Vice President Al Gore, U.S. Congressmen J.D. Hayworth, Jim Kolbe and real estate legend Donald Trump.  In addition, recognition’s have been received from former Congressman and Secretary of Transportation Norman Mineta; former state Senator John Huppenthal; letter of congratulations from United States Senator John McCain; Glendale, Arizona Mayor Elaine Scruggs; Mesa, Arizona Mayor Keno Hawker; Chandler, Arizona Mayor Jay Tibshraeny; Tempe, Arizona Mayor Neil Giuliano; Tucson, Arizona Mayor Robert Walkup; Tempe, Arizona Mayor Hugh Hallman;  Chandler, Arizona Mayor Boyd Dunn;  Mesa, Arizona Mayor Scott Smith; San Jose, California Mayor Thomas McEnery; Santa Clara, California Mayor William A. Gissler; Oakdale, California Mayor Elmo Garcia; Houston, Texas Mayor Kathryn J. Whitmire; and many other political and business leaders.
In a proclamation from the City of Chandler Michael was recognized for redeveloping and revitalizing more than 400,000 square feet of shopping space in Chandler, as well as for his work with scores of community organizations.

In the years that Michael has been in real estate, he has witnessed many growing changes in design and color schemes.  As a leader in his field, he has stood out as a front-runner in new design concepts bringing out the beauty of his properties through enhancements and color blending which bring out their surroundings.  Evidence of his design talent can be seen in his corporate office remodeled to his specifications bringing a rich old world feel, from the marble floors to the highly embellished walls and ornate ceilings showcased throughout.
Michael has been named Real Estate Entrepreneur of the Year by the American Design Institute, Builder Developer of the Year by the American Multi-House Association and was named “Outstanding Young Man of America” on two separate occasions.
As a pillar of the community, Michael has received extensive city awards and recognition’s for his redevelopment projects, which in many cases have revived entire neighborhoods bringing pride to the cities they are located in. After hours, you can find Michael greeting and shaking hands with patrons at his, one of a kind, discount Movie Theater, “Pollack Tempe Cinemas,” located in Tempe, Arizona.  Michael personally decorated the theater to allow families the thrill of seeing some of his private collectibles on display.  A collection of pieces that he personally handpicked and acquired over 40 years, including wax museum figures and signed pictures of stars young and old, as well as a vintage lunch box display borrowed from his private advertising museum. The Pollack museum, which contains more than 8,000 rare and unusual examples of antique, three-dimensional advertising and cultural items, and it is the largest collection of its kind in the world. Also in this unique collection you will find an extensive collection of rare Barringer Displays and Antique Slot Machines.  Many of the pieces in the museum are featured in the book he co-authored and that was published by Pennyfield’s Publishing in 2001.
With 2014 on the brink of daylight Michael is happy to announce that his companies will enter the New Year with over 100 commercial, industrial, professional, and single-family locations.  Michael admits during the difficult downturn of the economy  in 2008-2011 he had to spend more time and energy navigating his way through some very choppy waters.  Based on the formula he used in the past he vows to continue to stay on course and personally navigate the future growth of his companies. He will continue to be a mentor to the real estate community passing down the lessons he has learned to younger generations while strengthening the bonds between communities and property owners working to revitalize neighborhoods making this world a better place one project at a time.
When many of the largest and most influential developers  and property owners ran into financial difficulties and in many cases walked away from properties and filed for bankruptcy in 2008-2011, Michael dug into his grassroots and emerged as a strong force to be reckoned with.  With dedication and hard work Michael utilized his strengths and specialized knowledge of his field acquired in his 39 years of business to navigate through the turbulent waters of despair emerging as a source of strength and guidance in the real estate business for many. Michael has worked with some of the leading real estate brokerages including: Marcus and Millichap, Cushman and Wakefield, CBRE, CB Commercial, Colliers International, Grubb & Ellis, Derito Partners, Strategic Real Estate, Lee & Associates, Century 21, Remax and UBI Business Brokers.

Michael’s long-term legacy will be a dramatic biography will encompass the forty years in the real estate business, including his recent journey into the real estate hurricane that devastated large portions of the nation starting in 2008.   Michael implemented what he considers his greatest planning strategy helping him maneuver his way from the dark days of 2008 through 2011 allowing him to not only see the light but to shine as one of the few real estate developers or owners who did not have to renegotiate one single loan and was not one minute late on any of his financial obligations.
Michael A. Pollack prides himself on his very public and positive name recognition that he has earned with hard work, dedication, and integrity.
