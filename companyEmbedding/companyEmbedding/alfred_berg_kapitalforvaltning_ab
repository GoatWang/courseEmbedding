Where is the neutral monetary policy? Nordic currencies to strengthen?
"...If this were true, it would imply that the neutral policy rate for Norway and Sweden would be higher than that for the eurozone, which in turn would be likely to lead to a potential strengthening of their currencies. Higher expected long-term growth and stronger currency indeed makes the Nordics an attractive environment for investors."
