	Vista Gold Corp. Announces Process Flowsheet Changes to Generate Better Gold Recoveries and Lower Operating Costs at Mt Todd




	Denver, Colorado, November 28, 2016 -  


	Vista Gold Corp. (“Vista”, the “Company,” “we” or “our”) (NYSE MKT: VGZ) (TSX: VGZ) today announced the results of process area optimization studies that have the potential to enhance the project economics for the Mt Todd gold project in Northern Territory, Australia.


	 The anticipated economic improvements are the result of process flowsheet changes that are expected to produce higher gold recoveries and lower process area operating costs.  Testing indicates that these objectives can be accomplished through selectively screening and rejecting sub-economic, coarse crusher product prior to grinding; resulting in opportunities for improved gold recovery through finer grinding and improved operating costs down-stream of the grinding circuit.




	 




	A conference call with management to discuss the results of the Mt Todd gold project optimization studies is scheduled for Tuesday,  November 29


	, 2016 


	at 2:00 pm MST.




	Summary of Process Area Optimization Results 




	Earlier this year, Vista completed an independent review of the Mt Todd gold project.  The combined input of the independent consultants and the project management team resulted in additional comminution and metallurgical recovery evaluations.  These evaluations assessed opportunities to selectively remove below cut-off grade material from the process circuit after crushing.  This results in less material being processed in the grinding and leaching circuits.  The reduction in material results in excess grinding capacity which can be used to achieve a finer grind size in the final product and a corresponding increase in gold recovery for the remaining portion of the leach feed.  Achieving the finer grind size is not expected to materially change the total grinding costs.  Most importantly, the higher gold recovery is expected to increase cash flow, while the leaching, cyanide detoxification and tailings management costs are expected to decrease as a result of the reduction in the volume of material processed.




	We completed size distribution and assay analysis of the high pressure grinding rolls  (“HPGR”)  crusher product.  This indicates that screening the HPGR crusher product at 5/8” produces an oversize product that accounts for 15-20% of the weight, but contains only 7-9% of the gold.  Subsequently, we completed test work with Tomra Sorting Solutions, Inc. (“TOMRA”) at their facilities in Germany to evaluate the recovery of sulfide/quartz/calcite-bearing material using Laser Reflection/Fluorescence and X-ray Transmission (“XRT”) automated sorting techniques.  This test work indicates that approximately 85% of the gold in this oversize fraction can be efficiently recovered with a return of 30-40% of the weight.  We expect this to translate into an 11.5% reduction in material to be processed in the grinding/leaching circuits with a 1.6% loss in gold coming from the elimination of sub-economic material from the process stream.




	If there is an 11.5% reduction in material passing to the grinding circuit, we expect to achieve a final grind size of 80% passing (“P80”) 75 microns (“μm”), approximately 17% finer than the final grind size used in our May 2013 PFS of 90 μm.  Test work confirms that at a P80 75 μm grind size, we can expect to achieve gold recoveries in the range of 83-84%, up from the 81.7% reported in the May 2013 PFS.

















	 







	 












	Vista’s President & CEO, Frederick H. Earnest commented, “The process improvements that we have identified have the potential to generate lower operating costs and better gold recoveries without adding materially to the capital costs of the project.  These improvements, coupled with the current US dollar to Australian dollar exchange rate have the potential to produce a significant improvement in project economics.  We are now evaluating an update of our preliminary feasibility study.”    




	Detailed Discussion of Metallurgical Testing Program Results




	 




	Mt Todd Deposit Geology




	The Mt Todd deposit is hosted by a silicified sequence of greywackes, siltstones and shales.  This host is cross-cut (nearly perpendicular to the bedding planes) by two different series of quartz and calcite veins.  The injection of quartz- and calcite-rich solution provided the transportation mechanism for the gold and other sulfide minerals found in the deposit.  The gold in the Mt Todd deposit is associated with the veining and occurrence of sulfide minerals, and is found only in small concentrations (likely the result of micro-fracturing) in the host rock.  The quartz/calcite veining is pervasive throughout the deposit with vein thicknesses running from a couple of millimeters to several centimeters.  Vein density can vary from 3-4 to 10-15 veins per meter.  Selective assaying was completed to assess the presence of gold exclusively in the veins and/or sulfides compared to the host rock.  Selective samples submitted to Pine Creek Labs in Pine Creek, Northern Territory, Australia indicated that carefully selected veins and sulfide samples contained 0.16


	-41.4 grams Au/tonne of sample compared to 0.05-0.46 grams Au/tonne of sample for the host rock.  The relatively small proportions of vein/sulfide material account for the average grade of the deposit, and at the same time highlight the value of efforts to separate the host rock from the gold-bearing veins and sulfides.




	HPGR Product Screen-size and Gold Distribution Analysis




	In 2012, we prepared two bulk samples representative of the Mt Todd deposit using metallurgical core dispersed across the deposit (identified as M1 and M3).  These two samples were sent to Thysen Krupp Industrial Solutions’ HPGR testing facilities in Germany for HPGR crushing tests.  A total of approximately


	two tonnes of material between the two composites was crushed.


	The HPGR crushed material was returned to Vista for subsequent metallurgical testing.  Using HPGR crushed material from these two composites, we undertook studies to evaluate the amount of material and amount of gold contained in various screen size fractions.  The results of this analysis are summarized in the following table.  This work (including the subsequent sample prep) was completed by Resource Development Inc. of Wheatridge, Colorado (“RDi”) with assaying completed by


	Florin Analytical Services in Reno, Nevada.

	Based on this data and with some understanding of the minimum size requirements for selective automated sorting we determined that the 5/8” screen oversize  provided a meaningful volume of material for our testing to evaluate selective sorting and rejection.  This size was also selected because it is reasonable to expect that screening can be effectively achieved at this size in a full scale operation.  Physical observation of the +5/8” material indicated visually identifiable portions of vein material and sulfide material.  It was noted that the majority of the 5/8” material showed no visual indications of veining or sulfides. 





















	 







	 












	Automated Sorting Testing


	 




	Automated sorting is employed by many industries, and in the gold sector the Coeur Kensington mine is successfully operating an automated sorting circuit to recover higher grade ore before wasting the rejects.  Many different sensors are used today in sorting, including but not limited to: Optical, Laser, XRT, Near Infrared, Visible light, Electromagnetic, and Color.  A sample of +5/8” oversize material was sent to TOMRA’s mining sorting division for testing. Testing was performed under the supervision of Outotec personnel using XRT and Laser sorting sensors.  Testing indicates that a combination of XRT and Laser sorting methods could effectively identify the material containing quartz/calcite veining and/or sulfide material for subsequent removal using automated air sorting technology. A larger sorting test is planned to verify the promising indicative results. The following table summarizes the results of test work completed by TOMRA under Outotec supervision at TOMRA’s mining sorting division in Germany.

	Grind-size/Recovery Testing




	As part of the comprehensive metallurgical testing completed in 2012, we completed grind size optimization studies.  Those studies indicated that a P80 of 90


	μm was the optimum grind size.  At that time we recognized that finer grinding could result in higher gold recoveries, but the additional capital (i.e. larger mills) and power could not be justified to achieve the incremental increase in gold recovery.  With the successful completion of the screening and automated sorting tests, we evaluated the relative advantages of down-sizing the mills to match the expected throughput compared to maintaining the mill size and grinding to a finer size.




	As part of the recent testing, we completed grinding tests to achieve an initial product with a P80 of 90 μm.  This product was subsequently screened to assess the relative proportion of material at size fractions from 100 mesh to minus 400 mesh.  This screen analysis indicated that 40-50% of the ground material was minus 400 mesh and 10-20% of the material was plus 200 mesh.  RDi completed an analysis of the energy requirements to grind to a finer size and determined that the ball mills selected for the project in the 2013 PFS, operating with 11.5% less feed from the crushers would be able to successfully produce a product with a P80 of 75 μm without any additional power demand.  Based on grind-size and leach recovery work completed in 2012 and work recently completed by RDi, we expect that total recoveries in the range of 83-84% can be achieved with mill product with a P80 of 75 μm. 




	Evaluation of Potential to Incorporate 2-Stage HPGR Crushing




	In addition to the foregoing work, we prepared additional core composite samples and sent them to KCA in Reno, Nevada for additional HPGR testing.  We conducted a testing program to evaluate the potential to achieve significant additional size reduction through 2-stage HPGR crushing.  The objective of the program was to evaluate the potential to achieve sufficiently fine ball mill feed that even finer grinding, and hence higher gold recoveries, could be achieved.  At this time we are not convinced that the additional capital and operating costs of 2-stage HPGR crushing can be justified by the results, but additional testing is contemplated.

DENVER, Colo., Nov. 28, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Vista Gold Corp. ("Vista", the "Company," "we" or "our") (NYSE MKT: VGZ) (TSX: VGZ) today announced the results of process area optimization studies that have the potential to enhance the project economics for the Mt Todd gold project in Northern Territory, Australia. The anticipated economic improvements are the result of process flowsheet changes that are expected to produce higher gold recoveries and lower process area operating costs. Testing indicates that these objectives can be accomplished through selectively screening and rejecting sub-economic, coarse crusher product prior to grinding; resulting in opportunities for improved gold recovery through finer grinding and improved operating costs down-stream of the grinding circuit.








A conference call with management to discuss the results of the Mt Todd gold project optimization studies is scheduled for Tuesday, November 29, 2016 at 2:00 pm MST.
Summary of Process Area Optimization Results 
Earlier this year, Vista completed an independent review of the Mt Todd gold project. The combined input of the independent consultants and the project management team resulted in additional comminution and metallurgical recovery evaluations. These evaluations assessed opportunities to selectively remove below cut-off grade material from the process circuit after crushing. This results in less material being processed in the grinding and leaching circuits. The reduction in material results in excess grinding capacity which can be used to achieve a finer grind size in the final product and a corresponding increase in gold recovery for the remaining portion of the leach feed. Achieving the finer grind size is not expected to materially change the total grinding costs. Most importantly, the higher gold recovery is expected to increase cash flow, while the leaching, cyanide detoxification and tailings management costs are expected to decrease as a result of the reduction in the volume of material processed.
We completed size distribution and assay analysis of the high pressure grinding rolls ("HPGR") crusher product. This indicates that screening the HPGR crusher product at 5/8" produces an oversize product that accounts for 15-20% of the weight, but contains only 7-9% of the gold. Subsequently, we completed test work with Tomra Sorting Solutions, Inc. ("TOMRA") at their facilities in Germany to evaluate the recovery of sulfide/quartz/calcite-bearing material using Laser Reflection/Fluorescence and X-ray Transmission ("XRT") automated sorting techniques. This test work indicates that approximately 85% of the gold in this oversize fraction can be efficiently recovered with a return of 30-40% of the weight. We expect this to translate into an 11.5% reduction in material to be processed in the grinding/leaching circuits with a 1.6% loss in gold coming from the elimination of sub-economic material from the process stream.
If there is an 11.5% reduction in material passing to the grinding circuit, we expect to achieve a final grind size of 80% passing ("P80") 75 microns ("μm"), approximately 17% finer than the final grind size used in our May 2013 PFS of 90 μm. Test work confirms that at a P80 75 μm grind size, we can expect to achieve gold recoveries in the range of 83-84%, up from the 81.7% reported in the May 2013 PFS.
Vista's President & CEO, Frederick H. Earnest commented, "The process improvements that we have identified have the potential to generate lower operating costs and better gold recoveries without adding materially to the capital costs of the project. These improvements, coupled with the current US dollar to Australian dollar exchange rate have the potential to produce a significant improvement in project economics. We are now evaluating an update of our preliminary feasibility study."  
Detailed Discussion of Metallurgical Testing Program Results
Mt Todd Deposit GeologyThe Mt Todd deposit is hosted by a silicified sequence of greywackes, siltstones and shales. This host is cross-cut (nearly perpendicular to the bedding planes) by two different series of quartz and calcite veins. The injection of quartz- and calcite-rich solution provided the transportation mechanism for the gold and other sulfide minerals found in the deposit. The gold in the Mt Todd deposit is associated with the veining and occurrence of sulfide minerals, and is found only in small concentrations (likely the result of micro-fracturing) in the host rock. The quartz/calcite veining is pervasive throughout the deposit with vein thicknesses running from a couple of millimeters to several centimeters. Vein density can vary from 3-4 to 10-15 veins per meter. Selective assaying was completed to assess the presence of gold exclusively in the veins and/or sulfides compared to the host rock. Selective samples submitted to Pine Creek Labs in Pine Creek, Northern Territory, Australia indicated that carefully selected veins and sulfide samples contained 0.16-41.4 grams Au/tonne of sample compared to 0.05-0.46 grams Au/tonne of sample for the host rock. The relatively small proportions of vein/sulfide material account for the average grade of the deposit, and at the same time highlight the value of efforts to separate the host rock from the gold-bearing veins and sulfides.
HPGR Product Screen-size and Gold Distribution AnalysisIn 2012, we prepared two bulk samples representative of the Mt Todd deposit using metallurgical core dispersed across the deposit (identified as M1 and M3). These two samples were sent to Thysen Krupp Industrial Solutions' HPGR testing facilities in Germany for HPGR crushing tests. A total of approximately two tonnes of material between the two composites was crushed. The HPGR crushed material was returned to Vista for subsequent metallurgical testing. Using HPGR crushed material from these two composites, we undertook studies to evaluate the amount of material and amount of gold contained in various screen size fractions. The results of this analysis are summarized in the following table. This work (including the subsequent sample prep) was completed by Resource Development Inc. of Wheatridge, Colorado ("RDi") with assaying completed by Florin Analytical Services in Reno, Nevada.

Based on this data and with some understanding of the minimum size requirements for selective automated sorting we determined that the 5/8" screen oversize  provided a meaningful volume of material for our testing to evaluate selective sorting and rejection. This size was also selected because it is reasonable to expect that screening can be effectively achieved at this size in a full scale operation. Physical observation of the +5/8" material indicated visually identifiable portions of vein material and sulfide material. It was noted that the majority of the 5/8" material showed no visual indications of veining or sulfides.  
Automated Sorting Testing Automated sorting is employed by many industries, and in the gold sector the Coeur Kensington mine is successfully operating an automated sorting circuit to recover higher grade ore before wasting the rejects. Many different sensors are used today in sorting, including but not limited to: Optical, Laser, XRT, Near Infrared, Visible light, Electromagnetic, and Color. A sample of +5/8" oversize material was sent to TOMRA's mining sorting division for testing. Testing was performed under the supervision of Outotec personnel using XRT and Laser sorting sensors. Testing indicates that a combination of XRT and Laser sorting methods could effectively identify the material containing quartz/calcite veining and/or sulfide material for subsequent removal using automated air sorting technology. A larger sorting test is planned to verify the promising indicative results. The following table summarizes the results of test work completed by TOMRA under Outotec supervision at TOMRA's mining sorting division in Germany.

Grind-size/Recovery TestingAs part of the comprehensive metallurgical testing completed in 2012, we completed grind size optimization studies. Those studies indicated that a P80 of 90 μm was the optimum grind size. At that time we recognized that finer grinding could result in higher gold recoveries, but the additional capital (i.e. larger mills) and power could not be justified to achieve the incremental increase in gold recovery. With the successful completion of the screening and automated sorting tests, we evaluated the relative advantages of down-sizing the mills to match the expected throughput compared to maintaining the mill size and grinding to a finer size.
As part of the recent testing, we completed grinding tests to achieve an initial product with a P80 of 90 μm. This product was subsequently screened to assess the relative proportion of material at size fractions from 100 mesh to minus 400 mesh. This screen analysis indicated that 40-50% of the ground material was minus 400 mesh and 10-20% of the material was plus 200 mesh. RDi completed an analysis of the energy requirements to grind to a finer size and determined that the ball mills selected for the project in the 2013 PFS, operating with 11.5% less feed from the crushers would be able to successfully produce a product with a P80 of 75 μm without any additional power demand. Based on grind-size and leach recovery work completed in 2012 and work recently completed by RDi, we expect that total recoveries in the range of 83-84% can be achieved with mill product with a P80 of 75 μm.  
Evaluation of Potential to Incorporate 2-Stage HPGR CrushingIn addition to the foregoing work, we prepared additional core composite samples and sent them to KCA in Reno, Nevada for additional HPGR testing. We conducted a testing program to evaluate the potential to achieve significant additional size reduction through 2-stage HPGR crushing. The objective of the program was to evaluate the potential to achieve sufficiently fine ball mill feed that even finer grinding, and hence higher gold recoveries, could be achieved. At this time we are not convinced that the additional capital and operating costs of 2-stage HPGR crushing can be justified by the results, but additional testing is contemplated.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
