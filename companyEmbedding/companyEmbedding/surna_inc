Mr. Simonton was a partner for seven years in PwC's National Professional Services Group, which handles the firm's auditing and accounting standards, SEC, corporate governance, risk management and quality matters. He has extensive experience with SEC filings, including assistance with over 100 initial public offerings during his PwC career.

Surna’s Story
Headquartered in Boulder, CO, Surna (OTCQB: SRNA) engineers and manufactures innovative technology and products that address the energy and resource intensive nature of indoor cultivation. Surna’s current focus lies in supplying industrial solutions to commercial indoor cannabis cultivation facilities.
Surna’s diverse engineering team is tasked with creating novel energy and resource efficient solutions, including our signature liquid-cooled climate control platform. Our engineers continuously seek to create technologies that allow growers to easily meet the highly specific demands of a cannabis cultivation environment through temperature, humidity, light and process control.
Surna’s goal is to provide intelligent solutions that improve the quality, control and overall yield and efficiency of indoor cannabis cultivation. The Company’s operations exclude the production or sale of marijuana.










 







 




Why Cannabis?
Right now, there is a phenomenal opportunity to integrate garden-specific technology into the cannabis industry. As the industry grows, efficient technology will be needed to keep up with demand for product.
Between 2013 and 2015, the cannabis industry grew 72.2% with $5.4 billion in revenue generated in 2015; growth is expected to increase to 30% annually between 2014 and 2020. Cannabis is currently the fastest growing industry in the US. With more states legalizing every few months (currently 25 states have legalized medical marijuana and four have legalized recreational use), it is only a matter of time until legalization becomes the norm.
It is important to note that because Surna does not actually touch the cannabis plant, it is not affected by any cannabis-related regulations. This allows Surna to operate worldwide with systems currently in place in the US, Canada, Australia, South Africa and more.









Surna’s Future
Ultimately, Surna envisions the cannabis industry expanding horizontally and spinning off related and conventionally regulated new sectors such as food products, nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, remote agriculture monitoring technologies and many more.
Additionally, our water-chilled climate control systems have the potential to be used in any commercial buildings, bringing affordable water-chilling technology to small and mid-size buildings.

Our Brands











Hydro Innovations
Hydro Innovations was acquired by Surna in July 2014. Hydro Innovation’s co-founder, Stephen Keen developed our innovative water-chilled climate technology specifically for the indoor grow. His ideas and products were designed with the intention of making every garden environment easier and more cost effective to control while setting the gardener on the path to success. Hydro Innovations products are available to hobby indoor gardeners.

Surna Inc. Signs Contract With Vancouver's Sante Veritas Therapeutic









PR Newswire




Feb 28, 2017 5:00 AM EST













 


















































  Contract valued at $835,000 represents Surna's continued growth in Canada   BOULDER, Colo., Feb. 28, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Surna Inc. (OTCQB: SRNA), a technology company that engineers equipment for controlled environment agriculture (CEA) with special expertise in cannabis cultivation, signed a contract with Vancouver's Sante Veritas Therapeutic to design and provide equipment for the environmental control system in its first commercial cultivation facility. Surna expects to ship and recognize revenue of $835,000 in the third quarter of 2017. "Cannabis for medical use is legal throughout all of Canada, making the market an outstanding opportunity for continued growth," said Surna CEO Trent Doucet. "We now have five clients in Canada, and our sales team continues to see significant activity from both new market entrants as well as existing clients planning expansion." Surna's innovative technology and products address the energy and resource intensive nature of indoor cultivation, enabling companies to both improve product quality and yield while significantly reducing energy and other resource consumption. "At Sante Veritas, the well-being of our patients and customers will always be our first priority," said Suzanne Wood, CFO. "We selected Surna because its energy efficient environmental control system provides one of the highest levels of biosecurity and is designed to meet our goal of delivering the absolute highest quality product."

Forward Looking StatementsThis press release contains forward-looking statements regarding the Company's future business expectations, which are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including the uncertainties as to the timing of the transactions described above, uncertainties as to how many holders will agree to the terms of a transaction and the possibility that various closing conditions for the transactions may not be satisfied or waived. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Surna's financial results is included in Surna's filings with the SEC, including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. The Company cautions readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. The Company disclaims any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.  Statement About Cannabis MarketsThe use, possession, cultivation, and distribution of cannabis is prohibited by federal law.  This includes medical and recreational cannabis.  Although certain states have legalized medical and recreational cannabis, companies and individuals involved in the sector are still at risk of being prosecuted by federal authorities. Further, the landscape in the cannabis industry changes rapidly.  What was the law last week is not the law today and what is the law today may not be the law next week.  This means that at any time the city, county, or state where cannabis is permitted can change the current laws and/or the federal government can supersede those laws and take prosecutorial action. Given the uncertain legal nature of the cannabis industry, it is imperative that investors understand that the cannabis industry is a high-risk investment. A change in the current laws or enforcement policy can negatively affect the status and operation of our business, require additional fees, stricter operational guidelines and unanticipated shut-downs.

Business/June 28, 2017/187 views /In its latest released report Surna Inc (OTCMKTS:SRNA)OTCMKTSOTCMKTS:SRNASRNASurna IncSurna Inc (OTCMKTS:SRNA) On What Factors Surna Inc (OTCMKTS:SRNA) Products And Services Demand Is Based On?share on:FacebookTwitterIn its latest released report, Surna Inc (OTCMKTS:SRNA) had indicated that regulatory changes are main pointer for new facility construction. The demand for its services and products is mainly dependent on the new construction of cannabis grow facilities in Canada and the U.S.
Recent and projected regulatory changes comprising recreational and/or medicinal cannabis use in different jurisdictions, like California, tends to be a major indicator for getting approvals for new facility construction. For 2017, the company focus is on new facility setup in California, where recreational cannabis utilization was approved in 2016, and in Canada, where federal decriminalization legislation has been launched and recreational cannabis use seems to be gaining support.
The highlights
While Surna usual project sales deal is non-cancellable, there are many threats that the company may not realize the full deal value on time, or at all. Closure of a sales deal is grounded upon customers’ ability to obtain, license and establish their growing facility and take equipment possession.
In order to resolve these risks, the company can have three major milestones built into contracts. First, the company present consumer with engineering plans for which they need an upfront deposit before they commence their services. In many instances, the engineering stage is done as part of the building permit procedure or license application, represents on average almost 10% of the total deal value, and takes around 4 to 6 weeks to complete.
Previously, Surna needed a larger preliminary deposit that covered initial equipment and engineering items, however, starting in early 2017, they started offering their consumers a lower preliminary deposit for engineering only. The company’s plan is to lock in the sales deal and start the engineering part of the project earlier, which is vital for many reasons.
They can help their consumers with their design and engineering plans as part of licensing application procedure. Also, Surna is better positioned to lock in its technology for the assignment at an earlier stage. It is also able to help minimize the consumer’s time to market.

	CAUTIONARY
	NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS






	 




	This
	Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this “Form 10-Q”) contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private
	Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”),
	and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). All statements contained
	in this Form 10-Q other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding our future results of operations and
	financial position, our business strategy and plans, and our objectives for future operations, are forward-looking statements.
	The words “believe,” “may,” “will,” “estimate,” “continue,” “anticipate,”
	“intend,” “expect,” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We have
	based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that
	we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, short-term and long-term business operations
	and objectives, and financial needs. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, and assumptions,
	including those described in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
	year ended December 31, 2016, as updated from time to time in the Company’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
	Commission (the “SEC”). Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge

	March

	NOTE
	1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES





	 





	Company:





	 




	Surna
	Inc. incorporated in Nevada on October 15, 2009. On March 26, 2014, the Company acquired Safari Resource Group, Inc. (“Safari”),
	a Nevada corporation, whereby the Company became the sole surviving corporation after the acquisition of Safari. In July 2014,
	the Company acquired 100% of the membership interests in Hydro Innovations, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (“Hydro”),
	pursuant to which Hydro became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company engineers and manufactures innovative technology
	and products that address the energy and resource intensive nature of indoor cultivation. The Company is focused on supplying
	industrial solutions to commercial indoor cannabis cultivation facilities. The Company’s engineering team is tasked with
	creating novel energy and resource efficient solutions, including the Company’s proprietary liquid-cooled climate control
	platform. The Company’s engineers continuously seek to create technologies that allow growers to meet the specific demands
	of a cannabis cultivation environment through temperature, humidity, light, and process control. The Company’s objective
	is to provide intelligent solutions that improve the quality, control and overall crop yield and efficiency of indoor cannabis
	cultivation. The Company is headquartered in Boulder, Colorado. The Company does not cultivate or distribute cannabis.




	 





	Financial
	Statement Presentation:





	 




	The
	accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting
	principles in the United States (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q
	and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Pursuant to these rules and regulations, certain information and note disclosures, normally
	included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, have been condensed or omitted. GAAP requires management to
	make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. In the opinion of management, all adjustments
	(consisting of normal recurring items) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for
	the three months ended March 31, 2017 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending
	December 31, 2017. The balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date,
	but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. For further information,
	refer to the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
	December 31, 2016. The notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are presented on a continuing basis
	unless otherwise noted.




	 





	Basis
	of Presentation:






	 





	The
	accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.
	The Company has experienced recurring losses since its inception. The Company incurred a net loss of approximately $1,001,000
	for the three months ended March 31, 2017, and had an accumulated deficit of approximately $15,337,000 as of March 31, 2017. Since
	inception, the Company has financed its activities principally through debt and equity financing. Management expects to incur
	additional losses and cash outflows in the foreseeable future in connection with its operating activities.




	 




	The
	Company’s consolidated financial statements have been presented on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization
	of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.




	 




	The
	Company is subject to a number of risks similar to those of other similar stage companies, including dependence on key individuals,
	successful development, marketing and branding of products; uncertainty of product development and generation of revenues; dependence
	on outside sources of financing; risks associated with research, development; dependence on third-party, suppliers and collaborators;
	protection of intellectual property; and competition with larger, better-capitalized companies. Ultimately, the attainment of
	profitable operations is dependent on future events, including obtaining adequate financing to fund its operations and generating
	a level of revenues adequate to support the Company’s cost structure. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, the
	Company extinguished convertible promissory notes in the principal amount of $510,000 through the issuance of shares of its common
	stock (See Note 2) and raised $2,685,000 in a private placement of the Company’s common stock and attached warrants to accredited
	investors (see Note 5).




	 







	F-

	5

	 









	 







	 




	 




	The
	Company will need to raise debt and equity financing in the future in order to continue its operations, however, there can be
	no assurance that such financing will be available in sufficient amounts and on acceptable terms, when and if needed, or at all.
	If results of operations for 2017 do not meet management’s expectations, or additional capital is not available, management
	believes the Company has the ability to reduce certain expenditures. The precise amount and timing of the funding needs cannot
	be determined accurately at this time, and will depend on a number of factors, including market demand for the Company’s
	products and services, the success of product development efforts, the management of working capital, and the continuation of
	normal payment terms and conditions for purchase of goods and services. The Company is uncertain whether its cash balances and
	cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund its operations for the next twelve months. If the Company is unable to substantially
	increase revenues, reduce expenditures, or otherwise generate cash flows from operations, then the Company will need to raise
	additional funding to continue as a going concern from investors or through other avenues.




	 





	Basis
	of Consolidation and Reclassifications:





	 




	The
	condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its controlled and wholly-owned subsidiary.
	Intercompany transactions, profits, and balances are eliminated in consolidation.




	 




	Certain
	reclassifications have been made to amounts in prior periods to conform to the current period presentation. All reclassifications
	have been applied consistently to the periods presented. The reclassifications had no impact on net loss or total assets and liabilities.




	 





	Use
	of Estimates:





	 




	The
	preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
	the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
	statements and that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates
	on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results
	of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
	from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates. In addition, any change in these estimates or their related
	assumptions could have an adverse effect on the Company’s operating results. Key estimates include: valuation of derivative
	liabilities, valuation of intangible assets, and valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities.




	 





	Recent
	Accounting Pronouncements:





	 




	In
	January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2017-01,

	Clarifying the Definition of a Business

	(“ASU 2017-01”). The standard clarifies the definition of a business by adding guidance to assist entities in
	evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions of assets or businesses. ASU 2017-01 is effective for
	fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Under ASU 2017-01, to be considered
	a business, the assets in the transaction need to include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute
	to the ability to create outputs. Prior to the adoption of the new guidance, an acquisition or disposition would be considered
	a business if there were inputs, as well as processes that when applied to those inputs had the ability to create outputs. Early
	adoption is permitted for certain transactions. Adoption of ASU 2017-01 may have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
	financial statements if it enters into future business combinations.




	 




	In
	January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-04,

	Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment

	(“ASU
	2017-04”). ASU 2017-04 simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by removing Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test,
	which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation. ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual or interim goodwill impairment tests
	in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and should be applied on a prospective basis. Early adoption is permitted for
	interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating
	the effect that adopting this new accounting guidance will have on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial
	position.




	 




	In
	August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,

	Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and
	Cash Payments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force).

	This ASU requires changes in the presentation of certain items
	in the statement of cash flows including but not limited to debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; contingent consideration
	payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of
	corporate-owned life insurance policies and distributions received from equity method investees. This guidance will be effective
	for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, will require adoption on
	a retrospective basis and will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the effect
	that adopting this new accounting guidance will have on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position.

	In
	June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,

	Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on
	Financial Instruments

	. The amendments within this ASU replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with
	a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable
	information to inform credit loss estimates. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including
	interim periods within those fiscal years. Entities may early adopt the amendments within this ASU but not prior to the fiscal
	years beginning after December 15, 2018, including the interim periods within those fiscal years. An entity will apply the amendments
	in this ASU through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which
	the guidance is effective (that is, a modified-retrospective approach). However, a prospective transition approach is required
	for debt securities for which an other-than-temporary impairment had been recognized before the effective date. The Company is
	currently evaluating the effect that adopting this new accounting guidance will have on its consolidated results of operations,
	cash flows and financial position.




	 




	In
	March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,

	Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based
	Payment Accounting

	. This ASU is designed to address simplification of several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment
	transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification
	on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods
	within those annual periods. Early adoption of this ASU is permitted and would be applied on a retrospective basis back to the
	beginning of fiscal year that included any such interim period in which early adoption was elected. The Company is currently evaluating
	the effect that adopting this new accounting guidance will have on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial
	position.




	 




	In
	February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,

	Leases

	(Topic 842) which requires companies leasing assets to recognize on
	their balance sheet a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to
	use the underlying asset for the lease term on contracts longer than one year. The lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy
	election to not recognize lease assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases. How leases are recorded on the balance sheet
	represents a significant change from previous GAAP guidance in Topic 840. ASU 2016-02 maintains a distinction between finance
	leases and operating leases similar to the distinction under previous lease guidance for capital leases and operating leases.
	The Company is currently evaluating the effect that adopting this new accounting guidance will have on its consolidated results
	of operations, cash flows and financial position. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2018,
	and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that adopting this new accounting guidance will
	have on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position.




	 




	In
	January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,

	Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of
	Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

	. The amendments in this Update address certain aspects of recognition, measurement,
	presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
	2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that adopting this new
	accounting guidance will have on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position.




	 




	In
	July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,

	Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory

	. ASU 2015-11 simplifies the subsequent
	measurement of inventory by replacing today’s lower of cost or market test with a lower of cost and net realizable value
	test. The guidance applies only to inventories for which cost is determined by methods other than last-in first-out (LIFO) and
	the retail inventory method (RIM). Entities that use LIFO or RIM will continue to use existing impairment models (e.g., entities
	using LIFO would apply the lower of cost or market test). The guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years
	beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning
	of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that adopting this new accounting guidance
	will have on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position.




	 




	In
	May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,

	Revenue from Contracts with Customers

	, issued as a new Topic, ASC Topic 606. The
	new revenue recognition standard supersedes all existing revenue recognition guidance. Under this ASU, an entity should recognize
	revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity
	expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2015-14, issued in August 2015, deferred the effective date
	of ASU 2014-09 to the first quarter of 2018, with early adoption permitted in the first quarter of 2017. The Company is currently
	evaluating the effect that adopting this new accounting guidance will have on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows
	and financial position.

	NOTE
	2 – CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTES





	 




	During
	the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company entered into note conversion and warrant amendment agreements (each an “Agreement”
	and together, the “Agreements”) to: (i) amend the convertible promissory notes – series 2 (“Original Notes”)
	to reduce the conversion price of such holder’s Original Note and simultaneously cause the conversion of the outstanding
	amount under such Original Note into shares of common stock of the Company (“Conversion Shares”); and (ii) reduce
	the exercise price of the original warrant (“Original Warrants” and together with the amended notes and the amended
	warrants, the “Amendments”). Each Agreement has been privately negotiated so the terms vary. Pursuant to the Agreements,
	the Original Notes have been amended to reflect a reduced conversion price per share between $0.09 and $0.22. Additionally, pursuant
	to the Agreements


	,


	the Original Warrants have been amended to reflect a reduced exercise price per share between
	$0.30 and $0.35, except for one Original Warrant to reflect a reduced exercise price of $0.15 per share. The term of one Original
	Warrant was also extended.




	 




	Pursuant
	to the Agreements, the Company (i) converted Original Notes with an aggregate outstanding principal amount of $510,000 and accrued
	interest of $129,150 in exchange for the issuance of 5,011,554 shares of the Company’s common stock, and (ii) amended Original
	Warrants to reduce their exercise price. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company also made payments of $314,150
	to settle convertible promissory notes in the principal amount of $270,000 and accrued interest of $44,150. As of March 31, 2017,
	the Company had no convertible notes outstanding.




	 




	The
	Company has accounted for the Agreements as debt extinguishment in accordance with ASC 470 - Debt section 470-50-40-2 where by
	the difference between the reacquisition price of the debt and the net carrying amount of the extinguished debt was recognized
	as a loss during for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The following details the calculation of the loss on extinguishment

	NOTE
	3 – PROMISSORY NOTES






	 





	In
	February 2017, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with two accredited investors for the issuance of promissory
	notes in the aggregate original principal amount of $537,500. In addition, each investor received 125,000 shares, an aggregate
	of 250,000, shares of the Company’s common stock. The notes are unsecured, bear interest at 6%, per annum and are due and
	payable, with all accrued interest, on November 9, 2017. The total proceeds were approximately $500,000 with an original issue
	discount of approximately $37,500. In accordance with ASU 470, the Company has allocated the cash proceeds amount between the
	debt and shares issued on a relative fair value basis. Based on relative fair value, the Company allocated approximately $461,000
	and $39,000 to the promissory notes and the shares of common stock, respectively. The original issue discount of $37,500 and fair
	value of the shares issued of $39,000 are being amortized and expensed over the term of the loans. For the three months ended
	March 31, 2017, the amortization expense was approximately $14,000. In the event of a default under the terms of the promissory
	notes, the interest rate automatically increases to 18% per annum, until as such time the default event is cured. The events of
	default include suspension from trading of the Company’s common stock, failure to pay principal or interest when due, commencement
	of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or a change of control.




	 





	NOTE
	4 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES






	 







	Litigation








	 






	From
	time to time, in the normal course of its operations, the Company is subject to litigation matters and claims. Litigation can
	be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to
	predict and the Company’s view of these matters may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold.
	The Company expenses legal fees as incurred. The Company records a liability for contingent losses when it is both probable that
	a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. An unfavorable outcome to any legal matter,
	if material, could have an adverse effect on the Company’s operations or its financial position, liquidity or results of
	operations.




	 








	Stock
	Options of Former CEO








	 






	In
	March 2017, a former CEO of the Company requested to exercise an option to purchase 3,000,000 shares of the Company’s common
	stock at an exercise price of $.00024 per share. The stock option expired in March 2017.

	The Company’s
	Board of Directors has not approved the request for the issuance of the common stock under the stock option.
	The Company’s Board of Directors is reviewing the

	agreements related to the stock option

	and
	the prior relationship between the Company and the former CEO.







	 





	NOTE

	Shares
	Issued as Compensation for Services








	 






	On
	March 14, 2017, Timothy J. Keating and the Company entered into a Board of Directors Agreement (the “Agreement”).
	Pursuant to the Agreement, as a non-executive director of the Company and non-employee Chairman of the Board, Mr. Keating is entitled
	to an annual retainer of $75,000, of which $60,000 is paid for serving as an independent director ($30,000 paid in cash and $30,000
	paid in shares of common stock) and $15,000 is paid for serving as Chairman of the Board. The Company also issued Mr. Keating
	an equity retention payment of 1,400,000 shares of the Company’s restricted common stock (i) 700,000 shares which vested
	immediately (“Retention Shares”) and (ii) 700,000 shares (“Vesting Shares”) which will vest on March 1,
	2018. In accordance with ASC 505-50 Stock-Based Compensation Issued to Nonemployees, the Retention Shares were valued, using the
	closing price for the Company’s common stock, as of the date of ratification for total value of approximately $122,000,
	which was expensed as compensation. The fair value of the Vesting Shares will be expensed on a prorated basis over the vesting
	period. The fair value will be equal to the fair value of the Vesting Shares on the date the service period ends. As of March
	31, 2017, the fair value was estimated to be approximately $127,000. As of March 31, 2017, the compensation expense for the Vesting
	Shares was approximately $6,000.




	 




	During
	the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company also issued 40,000 shares of common stock to an employee which were valued
	at $8,840 on the date of issuance.




	 












	Stock
	Options of Current CEO








	 






	In
	March 2017, in a private transaction, Stephen and Brandy Keen, principal shareholders of the Company (“Keens”), assigned
	to Trent Doucet, the Company’s current CEO, stock options to purchase an aggregate of 3,088,800 shares of the Company’s
	common stock at a purchase price of $0.00024 per share (the “Stock Option”). The Keens have informed the Company that
	they agreed to assign the Stock Options as an incentive (i) for the CEO to complete the negotiations with the Company’s
	existing convertible noteholders to convert their notes into shares of the Company’s common stock, and (ii) for the CEO
	to complete a private placement of the Company’s common stock of at least $2,225,000. The CEO thereupon delivered
	a purported notice of exercise of the Stock Option to the Company just prior to the expiration of the Stock Option. The Company
	erroneously reported in its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 that 3,088,800 shares of common stock underlying the
	Stock Option had been issued during the three months ended March 31, 2017.





	 







	Prior
	to the Company’s acceptance of the notice of exercise and issuances of the shares in response thereto, in May 2017, Mr.
	Doucet and the Keens entered into a rescission agreement to nullify the March 2017 assignment transaction. Pursuant to its terms,
	the Stock Option has since expired.

	Private
	Placement








	 






	In
	March 2017, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with certain accredited investors
	(the “Investors”). The Company issued an aggregate of 16,781,250 investment units (the “Units”), for aggregate
	gross proceeds of $2,685,000. Each Unit consisted of one share of the Company’s common stock and one warrant for the purchase
	of one share of the Company’s common stock; however, one investor declined receipt of the warrant to purchase 468,750 shares
	of the Company’s common stock.




	 




	Pursuant
	to each of the warrants, the holder thereof may, subject to the terms of the warrant, at any time on or after six months after
	the date of the warrant and on or prior to the close of business on the date that is the third anniversary of the date of the
	warrant, purchase up to the number of shares of the Company’s common stock as set forth in the respective warrant. The exercise
	price per share of the common stock under each warrant is $0.26, subject to adjustment as provided in the warrant. Each warrant
	is callable at the Company’s option commencing six months from the date of the warrant, provided the Company’s common
	stock trades at a volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) of $0.42 or greater (subject to adjustment) for five consecutive
	trading days (the “Call Condition”). Commencing at any time after the date on which the Call Condition is satisfied,
	the Company has the right, upon 30 days’ notice to the holder given not later than 30 trading days after the date on which
	the Call Condition is satisfied, to redeem the number of warrant shares specified in the applicable Call Condition at a price
	of $0.01 per warrant share, subject to the terms of the warrant.

	ITEM
	2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS






	 





	The
	following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed
	consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, which include additional information
	about our accounting policies, practices, and the transactions underlying our financial results, as well as with our audited consolidated
	financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, as filed with the SEC. In
	addition to our historical unaudited condensed consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking
	statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in
	the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and
	elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, particularly in Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”





	 





	Overview





	 




	We
	develop, design, and distribute cultivation technologies for controlled environment agriculture (“CEA”). Our customers
	include state-regulated cannabis cultivation facilities as well as traditional indoor agricultural facilities, including organic
	herb and vegetable producers. Our technologies include a comprehensive line of optimized lighting, environmental control, air
	sanitation, and cultivation facilities. These technologies are designed to meet the specific environmental conditions required
	for CEA and reduce energy and water consumption. In addition, Surna offers mechanical design services specific to hydronic cooling,
	including mechanical equipment and piping design.




	 




	Our
	standard CEA project consists of small chillers, fan-coils, and dehumidifiers, the major equipment items which we manufacture.
	Other required equipment items typically consist of large chillers, pumps, air separators and expansion tanks which we purchase
	from outside vendors. We believe our core competency is to provide integration services for these equipment items delivering a
	fully engineered, turn-key, single-source solution to our customers.




	 




	This integrated, single-sourced solution can create gross
	profit margin fluctuations depending on project design and the mix between our proprietary equipment, which typically generates
	a higher gross profit margin, and the equipment manufactured by outside vendors. Further, quarterly fluctuations in gross profit
	margins can occur based on the timing of a project’s needs for our manufactured equipment versus third party manufactured
	equipment.




	 




	The
	demand for our integrated solution, including engineering design, proprietary equipment and third party manufactured equipment,
	is primarily based on the new construction of cannabis cultivation facilities in the U.S. and Canada.




	 




	Recent
	and anticipated regulatory changes involving medicinal and/or recreational cannabis use in various jurisdictions, such as California,
	tends to be a leading indicator for the granting of licenses for new facility construction.




	 




	For
	2017, we are focused on new facility construction in California where recreational cannabis use was approved in November 2016
	and in Canada where federal legalization legislation has been introduced and recreational cannabis use appears to be gaining support.




	 




	Our
	marketing efforts are generally targeted to those persons who are actively seeking licenses to produce cannabis and, in many cases,
	our engineering services are needed for the completion of license applications. As such, the projects we quote may not advance
	to the contract stage due to either a failure of our prospect to receive licensure or to obtain project financing. In other cases,
	the successful licensee was either unknown to us at the time of application or elected to use a competing technology – rooftop
	duct system or traditional split air conditioning system – as opposed to our ductless hydronic system.




	 








	1










	 







	 




	While
	our typical project sales contract is non-cancellable, there are risks that we may not realize the full contract value in a timely
	manner or at all. Completion of a sales contract is dependent upon our customers’ ability to secure, license and build their
	growing facility and take possession of the equipment. In order to address these risks, we have three key milestones built into
	our contracts.




	 




	●	First,
	we provide our customer with engineering plans for which we require an upfront deposit before we begin our services. In many cases,
	the engineering phase is done as part of the license application or building permit process, represents on average approximately
	10% of the total contract value, and takes approximately four to six weeks to complete. We previously required a larger initial
	deposit that covered engineering and initial equipment items, however, beginning in early-2017, we began offering our customers
	a lower initial deposit for engineering only. Our strategy is to lock in the sales contract and commence the engineering
	portion of the project earlier, which is important for a number of reasons: (i) we can assist our customers with their
	engineering and design plans as part of their licensing application process, (ii) we are better positioned to lock in our technology
	for the project at an earlier stage, and (iii) we are able to help reduce the customer’s time to market.




	 




	●	Second,
	upon completion of the engineering phase, it may take our customer on average five months to complete the facility build-out,
	with possible delays due to financing or other aspects which are beyond our control. Customer delays in obtaining financing and
	completing facility build-out make the timing of completion of our sales contract unpredictable. For our protection, before we
	begin manufacturing our proprietary equipment items, we require an upfront deposit.




	 




	●	And
	third, the last phase of our contract involves procurement and drop-ship delivery of third party manufactured equipment items,
	which we undertake only upon payment of the third and final deposit.




	 






	As
	of March 31, 2017, we have executed sales contracts with a total unearned contract value of approximately $3,790,000 (“Q1
	2017 backlog”), of which approximately $2,279,000 was attributed to sales contracts entered into in the three months ended
	March 31, 2017 and the remaining $1,511,000 attributed to prior quarters. About 78% of the Q1 2017 backlog is attributed to projects
	for which we have not received a further deposit on our proprietary equipment and, as a result, there are potential risks of project
	cancellation or delays. Further, a substantial portion of our Q1 2017 backlog is not expected to be recognized as revenue
	until the second half of 2017.




	 




	In
	an effort to continue the bookings trend, we are implementing a new CRM system to better manage an ever-increasing number of inbound
	request for quotes, have added new sales personnel including a sales coordinator to assist the outside sales team, and have assigned
	sales territories to allow the sales personnel to focus on individual regional needs and to get more personally involved in their
	markets. We also recently developed a sales quotation tool reducing the time it takes to prepare detailed system proposals from
	an average of four hours to about fifteen minutes. We anticipate this tool will shorten the learning curve of our
	new sales personnel. We also hope to realize the benefits of a preferred pricing program recently received from one of
	our major equipment suppliers, who awarded the Company national account status. As new jurisdictions continue to ease regulation
	of cannabis and larger scale projects become more prevalent as the market matures and investment capital becomes more readily
	available, we believe the Company is well positioned to address the new challenges and opportunities the market presents.






	 




	Nonetheless,
	the ever-changing nature of our sales and the needs of our customers make it difficult for us to predict when we will recognize
	revenue. We continue to remain focused on increasing our sales contract backlog and quoting larger projects in an effort to increase
	revenue.




	 





	Recent
	Developments





	 





	In
	April, we entered into a sales contract with a customer with a contract value of approximately $1,300,000 for which we have not
	completed the engineering phase. Accordingly, this contract carries the potential risk of non-completion due to the early stage
	of this project.





	 






	On
	May 10, 2017, we entered into a three-year consulting agreement with Mr. Keen, one of our principal shareholders and a former
	officer and director. Under the consulting agreement, Mr. Keen will provide certain consulting services to the Company including
	research and development, new product design and innovations, existing product enhancements and improvements, and other technology
	advancements with respect to the Company’s business and products in exchange for an annual consulting fee of $30,000 per
	year. The consulting agreement also includes certain activity restrictions which prohibit Mr. Keen from competing with the Company.
	In connection with the execution of this consulting agreement, Mr. Keen resigned as a director of the Company on May 10, 2017.
	Mr. Keen’s employment with the Company ceased as of April 28, 2017.




	 




	On
	May 10, 2017, we entered into a three-year equipment, demonstration and product testing agreement with Sterling, an entity controlled
	by Mr. Keen, which operates a Colorado regulated cannabis cultivation facility. Under this agreement, the Company has
	agreed to provide to Sterling certain lighting, environmental control, and air sanitation equipment for use at the Sterling facility
	in exchange for a quarterly fee of $16,500. Also, under this agreement, Sterling has agreed to allow the Company and its existing
	and prospective customers to have access to the Sterling facility for demonstration tours in a working environment, which the
	Company believes will assist it in the sale of its products. Sterling has also agreed to monitor, test and evaluate the Company’s
	products installed at the Sterling facility and to collect data and provide feedback to the Company on the energy and operational
	efficiency and efficacy of the installed products, which the Company intends to use to improve, enhance and develop new or additional
	product features, innovations and technologies. In consideration for access to the Sterling facility to conduct demonstration
	tours and for the product testing and data to be provided by Sterling, the Company will pay Sterling a quarterly fee of $12,000.

	Critical
	Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates





	 




	This
	discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our interim unaudited condensed consolidated
	financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
	Certain accounting policies are particularly important to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations
	and require the application of significant judgment by our management or can be materially affected by changes from period to
	period in economic factors or conditions that are outside of our control. As a result, they are subject to an inherent degree
	of uncertainty. In applying these policies, management uses their judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used
	in the determination of certain estimates. Those estimates are based on our historical operations, our future business plans and
	projected financial results, the terms of existing contracts, observance of trends in the industry, information provided by our
	customers, and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. For information regarding our critical accounting
	policies as well as recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.




	 





	Results
	of Operations





	 




	The
	following discussion should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes
	included in this Form 10-Q.




	 






	Comparison
	of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 and 2016






	 





	Revenues
	and Cost of Goods Sold





	 




	Revenue
	for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was approximately $1,593,000 compared to $2,498,000 for the three months ended March
	31, 2016, a decline of $905,000, or 36%. As described in “Overview” above, the resulting decline in revenue is primarily
	due to the restructuring of our policies to secure sales contracts at an earlier stage which further increases our backlog. The
	decline in revenue was primarily due to: (i) the restructuring of our policies to secure sales contracts at an earlier stage which
	was not in place in Q1 2016, and (ii) the heightened uncertainty of the cannabis industry following the recent U.S. presidential
	election.





	 





	Cost
	of revenue decreased by 17% from $1,410,000 for three months ended March 31, 2016 to approximately $1,165,000 for the three months
	ended March 31, 2017. The gross margin decreased by seventeen percentage points from 44% for three months ended March 31, 2016
	to 27% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Our cost of revenue cost structure is comprised of both a fixed and variable
	component. The fixed cost component represents engineering, manufacturing and project management salaries and benefits, which
	totaled approximately $294,000, or 18% of total revenue, for the three months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to $332,000, or
	13% of total revenue, for three months ended March 31, 2016. The decline of approximately $38,000 is due to a decrease in our
	manufacturing head-count in 2017. However, the increase in fixed costs as a percentage of revenue was the result of a 36% decline
	in revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016. The variable cost component
	represents our cost of equipment, outside engineering costs, shipping and handling, travel and warranty costs, which total approximately
	$871,000, or 55% or total revenue, in the three months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to $1,078,000, or 43% of total revenue,
	in the three months ended March 31, 2016. We continue to attempt to reduce our variable costs through more competitive prices
	from our vendors and reduced warranty expenditures.




	 




	Operating
	expenses increased by 41% from $724,000 for three months ended March 31, 2016 to approximately $1,018,000 for three months ended
	March 31, 2017. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, we incurred $136,000 in non-cash compensatory expenses, compared to
	non-cash compensatory expenses of $3,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016.




	 




	The
	most significant component of our increased operating expenses in the three months ended March 31, 2017 were selling, general
	and administrative expenses (“SG&A expenses”). SG&A expenses increased by $249,000, or 44%, from $569,000
	for the three months ended March 31, 2016 to $818,000 for three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in SG&A expenses
	for the three months ended March 31, 2017 is due primarily to the following: (i) increased personnel-related costs of approximately
	$184,000, including a non-cash stock-based retention bonus paid to our new chairman of our board of approximately $131,000, which
	was calculated using the fair market value of the common stock on the date the stock-based retention bonus was ratified by the
	board of directors, (ii) increased travel cost of approximately $16,000, and (iii) increased investor and public relations costs
	of approximately $66,000. These increases were offset by decreases in the following: (i) our SG&A expenses related to outside
	sales commissions decreased by approximately $24,000, and (ii) our provision for bad debt for three months ended March 31, 2017
	was zero compared to the March 31, 2016 provision of approximately $41,000.




	 








	3










	 







	 




	Other
	expenses decreased by 63% from $1,111,000 for three months ended March 31, 2016 to approximately $411,000 for three months ended
	March 31, 2017. This was the result of a decrease in interest expense and the amortization of debt discount on convertible promissory
	notes related to the conversion of certain convertible promissory notes converted in fourth quarter of 2016 and the first quarter
	of 2017.




	 




	Overall,
	we realized a net loss of approximately $1,001,000 for three months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to a net loss of approximately
	$746,000 for three months ended March 31, 2016, an increase of $255,000, or 34%.

	We
	have never reported net income. We incurred net losses for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 and have an accumulated
	deficit of approximately $15,337,000 as of March 31, 2017. We had working capital (current assets in excess of current
	liabilities) of approximately $43,000 as of March 31, 2017 as compared to a working capital deficit of approximately $2,860,000
	as of December 31, 2016. This change in working capital is primarily related to the $2,685,000 we raised in a private placement
	of our common stock and attached warrants during the three months ended March 31, 2017. We have not been able to generate sufficient
	cash from operating activities to fund our ongoing operations. Since our inception, we have raised capital through private sales
	of common stock and debt securities. Our future success is dependent upon our ability to achieve profitable operations and generate
	cash from operating activities. There is no guarantee that we will be able to generate enough revenue and/or raise sufficient
	capital to support our operations. As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we had a cash balance of approximately $1,969,000
	and $320,000, respectively.




	 




	We
	will need to raise debt and/or equity financing in the second half of 2017 in order to continue our operations, unless we are
	able to reduce our operating expenses. There can be no assurance however that we will be able to raise such financing in sufficient
	amounts or on acceptable terms, or at all. If we determine that our revenue and operating results as we move into the second half
	of 2017 are not satisfactory, we intend to explore various operating cost reductions. Even if we are able to reduce operating
	costs, we will still need to seek additional debt and/or equity financing. The precise amount and timing of the funding needs
	cannot be determined accurately at this time, and will depend on a number of factors, including the market demand for our products
	and services, the timing of our receipt of deposits from our customers under our sales contracts, our management of working capital,
	and the continuation of normal payment terms and conditions for purchase of goods and services.




	 






	Cash
	Requirements






	 






	Management
	has determined our March 31, 2017 cash balance of approximately $1,969,000 will not be sufficient to fund our operations over
	the next twelve months. Based on management’s estimate for our operational cash requirements and without modifications to
	our existing payment obligations, which include, among other things, the upcoming payments for promissory notes in the principal
	amount of $537,500, which were issued in February 2017 and mature in November 2017, we will require additional capital to
	be raised in the second half of 2017.




	 




	If
	we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, make adjustments to our payment arrangements or raise sufficient
	additional capital through future debt and equity financings or strategic and collaborative ventures with potential partners,
	we will likely have to reduce the size and scope of our operations. Our officers and shareholders have not made any written or
	oral agreement to provide us additional financing. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to raise capital
	on terms and conditions that are deemed acceptable to us, or at all.

	Operating
	Activities






	 








	Cash
	used in operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was approximately $1,338,000 compared to cash provided by operations
	of approximately $774,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, significant
	non-cash expenses included: (i) compensation for services paid in stock of approximately $136,000, and (ii) loss on extinguishment
	of debt of $415,000. However, these non-cash expenses were offset by: (i) a reduction in our accounts payable and accrued expenses
	of approximately $266,100, and (ii) a reduction in deferred revenue of $496,500.




	 






	Investing
	Activities






	 




	Cash
	provided by investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was approximately $73,000 compared to cash provided
	by investing activities of approximately $70,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. We received payments of $75,000 and
	$25,000 on a note receivable for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Also in the three months ended
	March 31, 2016, we had net proceeds of $31,000 from the sale of property and equipment.




	 






	Financing
	Activities






	 




	Cash
	provided by financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was approximately $2,915,000 compared to cash used
	in financing activities of approximately $34,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. During the three months ended March
	31, 2017, we completed a private placement for the sale of shares of our common stock, with attached warrants, resulting in net
	proceeds of approximately $2,685,000. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we also issued two unsecured promissory notes
	for aggregate proceeds of $500,000 and made payments of $270,000 to extinguish the principal under our remaining convertible promissory
	notes.




	 






	Inflation






	 




	In
	the opinion of management, inflation has not and will not have a material effect on our operations in the immediate future. Management
	will continue to monitor inflation and evaluate the possible future effects of inflation on our business and operations.




	 






	Contractual
	Payment Obligations






	 




	As
	of March 31, 2017, our contractual payment obligations consisted of promissory notes of $537,500 due in November 2017 and an office
	lease for a 90-day period ending on July 1, 2017.




	 





	Off-Balance
	Sheet Arrangements





	 




	There
	are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
	changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources
	that is material to investors.





	 










	ITEM
	3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK






	 




	We
	are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information under
	this item.

	ITEM
	4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES






	 





	Evaluation
	of Disclosure Controls and Procedures





	 




	Our
	management, with the participation of our chief executive officer (“CEO”) and principal financial and accounting officer
	(“PFAO”), has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
	and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our CEO
	and PFAO concluded that, because of certain material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as described
	in Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 filed with the SEC, our disclosure controls
	and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were not effective as of as of March 31, 2017.




	 




	We
	did not maintain effective controls over certain aspects of the financial reporting process because we lacked a sufficient complement
	of personnel with a level of accounting expertise and an adequate supervisory review structure that is commensurate with our financial
	reporting requirements. In addition, there was inadequate segregation of duties due to the limitation on the number of our accounting
	personnel.




	 




	We
	intend to take appropriate and reasonable steps to make the necessary improvements to remediate these deficiencies. However, due
	to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties has not always been possible and may not be economically feasible.




	 





	Changes
	in Internal Control over Financial Reporting





	 




	For
	the quarter ended March 31, 2017, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially
	affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

	1. Legal Proceedings






	 




	We
	are not presently a party to any material legal proceedings, nor is the Company aware of any pending or threatened litigation
	that would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, operating results, cash flows, or financial condition
	should such litigation be resolved unfavorably. We have and will continue to have commercial disputes arising in the ordinary
	course of our business.





	 










	Item
	1A. Risk Factors






	 




	In
	addition to the information set forth in this Form 10-Q, you should also carefully review and consider the risk factors contained
	in our other reports and periodic filings with the SEC, including, without limitation, the risk factors contained under the caption
	“Item 1A—Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 that could materially
	and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The risk factors discussed in that Form 10-K
	do not identify all risks that we face because our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not
	presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. There have been no material changes in
	the significant factors that may affect our business and operations as described in “Item 1A—Risk Factors” of
	the Annual Report on 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.

	CONSULTING
	AGREEMENT







	 





	This
	Consulting Agreement (this “

	Agreement

	”) is made and entered into effective this 10th day of May, 2017 (the
	“

	Effective Date

	”) by and between

	Surna, Inc.

	, a Nevada corporation whose address is 1780 55th Street,
	Suite A, Boulder, Colorado 80301 (the “

	Company

	”) and

	Stephen Keen

	, an adult resident of the State of
	Colorado (the “

	Consultant

	”). The Consultant and the Company may be referred to herein individually as a “Party”
	or collectively as the “Parties.”




	 





	AGREED
	ACKNOWLEDGMENTS






	 





	A.      The
	Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates are engaged in the development, design and distribution of cultivation technologies
	for controlled environment agriculture for state-regulated cannabis cultivation facilities and traditional indoor agricultural
	facilities, including lighting, environmental control, air sanitation and cultivation facilities designed to meet the specific
	environmental conditions required for indoor cultivation and to reduce energy and water consumption (the “

	Business

	”).




	 




	B.      In
	connection with the Business, the Company manufactures, sells and delivers the following products and services: (i) liquid-based
	process cooling and climate control systems, (ii) reflectors and lighting systems, including water-cooled reflectors (iii) a full-service
	air sanitation technology program, (iii) a full-service engineering package for designing and engineering commercial scale thermodynamic
	systems specific to indoor cultivation facility conditions, (iv) automation and control devices, systems and technologies used
	for environmental, lighting and climate control in indoor cultivation facilities, (v) a comprehensive, hybrid cultivation facility
	design and system utilizing sunlight and a high-power LED lighting system, and (vi) and other products, services, and technologies
	now or hereafter developed related to the foregoing (collectively, the “

	Products

	”).




	 




	C.      The
	Business of the Company is highly competitive and requires the creation of relationships with the Company’s customers because
	of the technology and type of product involved.




	 




	D.      The
	Company has invested and will continue to invest considerable sums of time, money, and other resources in developing the confidence
	and loyalty of its customers and potential customers and to recruit, train, support and compensate its employees and potential
	employees. In addition, the Company expends significant amounts of time and money to attract, identify, locate, and establish
	contacts and business relationships with prospective customers. The loss of these existing and prospective relationships with
	customers, and with existing and potential employees, will cause substantial and irreparable harm to the Company, which cannot
	be accurately or adequately compensated by money alone.




	 




	E.      The
	Consultant and the Company are parties to that certain Executive Employment Agreement by and between the Consultant and the Company
	dated July 25, 2014 (“

	services benefiting the Company, as set forth herein. Both the Consultant and the Company wish to enter into this Agreement to
	set forth the terms and conditions of the Consultant’s engagement with the Company.




	 




	G.      The
	Consultant acknowledges that, in the course of the Consultant’s consulting with the Company, the Consultant will frequently
	come into contact with the Company’s customers and suppliers to such an extent that the Consultant may be able to control
	or direct, in whole or in part, the business and relationships between the Company and its customers and suppliers. Accordingly,
	the Company reposes its trust in the Consultant not to disrupt or otherwise misappropriate the customer and supplier relationships
	developed and/or supported by the Company.




	 







	 









	 







	 




	H.      The
	Consultant will also, during the course of the Consultant’s consulting with the Company, have frequent and close contact
	with the Company’s employees, managers, salespeople, and key staff employees. As a result of the Consultant’s performance
	of services hereunder, the Consultant will acquire and have access to confidential information concerning the Company’s
	employees, prospective employees, customers, suppliers, and prospective customers and suppliers that is not easily or generally
	available to the Company’s competitors.




	 




	I.      The
	Consultant acknowledges that, by virtue of the Consultant’s performance of services hereunder, the Consultant may have access
	to certain secret and confidential business data and information belonging to the Company including, but not limited to: marketing
	plans, financial strategies, market surveys and assessments, customer and Company technical information, financial statements,
	budget data, personnel records, customer profiles and purchase requirements, product design, engineering and technical specifications,
	pricing plans and strategies, sales contracts and proposals, private and confidential discussions with executive managers, legal
	advice and strategies, performance evaluations, price schedules from suppliers, litigation and planned litigation, capital needs,
	lists of customers and potential customers, hiring and training goals, internal operation and production reports and schedules,
	compensation packages, customer account projections, licenses, promotional plans and information, corporate policies for internal
	operations, bids and proposals by suppliers and to customers, identities and personal profiles of key persons at customers and
	potential customers, expense data by customer, and other confidential and sensitive business information developed and maintained
	by the Company.




	 




	J.      The
	Company has a valuable and proprietary interest in the confidential information described in paragraph I above and has expended
	considerable time and money to safeguard and protect such information from direct or indirect divulgence of same by its employees
	and contractors, including the Consultant. In addition, as part of the Company’s relationship with each of its customers,
	the Company assures customers that the unique, confidential, and secret information shared by customers with the Company will
	be protected from disclosure to and unauthorized use by others. Any divulgence of such information will constitute an irreparable
	injury to the Company and the Company’s customers.




	 




	K.      The
	Consultant acknowledges that (i) the Consultant’s consulting with the Company is one of great trust and confidence requiring
	that the Consultant exercise a high degree of loyalty, honesty, and integrity, (ii) the Consultant has and will receive substantial
	and adequate monetary consideration and benefits pursuant to this Agreement, (iii) the Consultant has read and understood the
	terms of this Agreement and signed same as a free and voluntary act, (iv) the Consultant has freely chosen to enter into this

	with the Company and the benefits provided for herein.

	advancements with respect to the Business and the Products (the “

	such time as necessary to perform the Base Services hereunder, provided that, the Parties acknowledge and agree that the Consultant
	shall not be required to devote more than forty (40) hours per month during the Term hereof to the performance of the Base Services
	under this Agreement. The time and place for the performance of the Base Services hereunder shall be mutually agreed to by the

	and optimization of growing conditions and related crop yields and, that such consulting services shall fall outside the scope
	of this Agreement. Except as set forth in Section 10 hereof, the Consultant may provide consulting services to any third party

	7.

	.




	 




	a.      


	Independent
	Contractor Relationship


	. The Consultant understands and agrees that, pursuant to this Agreement, the Consultant is an
	independent contractor and not an employee of the Company or any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, and is not and will not be

	b.

	. The Company shall reimburse the Consultant for reasonable expenses incurred by the Consultant in
	connection with the performance of the Services pursuant to this Agreement, including, but not limited to, travel expenses, professional
	conventions or similar professional functions and other reasonable business expenses, provided that travel expenses and any other
	expense in excess of $500 must be approved in advance by the Company. The Consultant agrees to provide the Company with receipts
	and/or documentation sufficient to permit the Company to take its full business expense deduction. The Company shall have no obligation
	to reimburse the Consultant for expenses claimed if the Consultant does not provide sufficient receipts and/or documentation.




	 




	8.      


	Termination


	.
	Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, during the Term, the engagement of the Consultant by the
	Company shall terminate immediately upon the Consultant’s death, the Company shall have the right to and may, in the exercise
	of its discretion, terminate the Consultant’s engagement at any time by reason of Disability, or with Cause or without Cause,
	the Consultant shall have the right to and may, in the exercise of the Consultant’s discretion, resign the Consultant’s
	engagement for Good Reason or without Good Reason (a “

	Voluntary Resignation

	”), subject to the provisions set
	forth below:




	 




	a.      


	Death/Disability


	.
	The engagement of the Consultant by the Company shall terminate immediately upon death of the Consultant or immediately upon the
	giving of written notice by the Company to the Consultant of the Consultant’s termination due to Disability. As used in
	this Agreement, “

	Disability

	” shall mean the Consultant is unable to perform the Consultant’s duties hereunder
	due to the onset of any sickness, injury or disability, even with reasonable accommodation, for a consecutive period of one hundred
	eighty (180) days or an aggregate of six (6) months in any twelve (12)-consecutive month period. A determination of “Disability”
	shall be made by a physician satisfactory to both the Consultant and the Company, provided that if the Consultant and the Company
	do not agree on a physician, the Consultant and the Company shall each select a physician and these two together shall select
	a third physician, whose determination as to Disability shall be binding on all parties. The appointment of one or more individuals
	to carry out the duties of the Consultant during a period of the Consultant’s inability to perform such duties and pending
	a determination of Disability shall not be considered a breach of this Agreement by the Company.




	 




	b.      


	With
	Cause


	. The engagement of the Consultant by the Company shall terminate at the election of the Company immediately upon
	the giving of written notice by the Company to the Consultant of the Consultant’s termination with Cause. For purposes of
	this Agreement, the term “

	Cause

	” means that the Consultant: (i) has been convicted of, or entered a plea of
	guilty or “

	nolo contendere

	” to, a felony (excluding any felony relating to the negligent operation of an automobile),
	(ii) has failed to perform the Services under this Agreement (other than by reason of illness or temporary disability), (iii)
	has materially breached any non-competition or non-disclosure agreement in effect between the Consultant and the Company, including
	such agreements in this Agreement, (iv) has engaged in illegal conduct or gross misconduct that in any case causes material financial
	harm to the Company, (v) has engaged in fraud or material dishonesty in connection with the Business of the Company, (vi) has
	engaged in willful misappropriation or embezzlement of any of the Company’s funds or property, or (vii) has engaged in conduct
	that is detrimental to the Business or reputation of the Company. Any of the aforesaid clauses (ii) through (iii) may be cured
	by the Consultant, if curable, if cured within fifteen (15) days after receipt by the Consultant of written notice of the same.
	In the event such acts or omissions are capable of being cured, the effective date of termination, in the event of the Consultant’s
	failure to cure, must be at least fifteen (15) days after such notice of termination to afford the Consultant the ability to cure
	the same. The Company may place the Consultant on paid leave for up to sixty (60) consecutive days while it is determining whether
	there is a basis to terminate Consultant’s engagement for Cause. This leave will not constitute Good Reason.






	 









	 









	 







	 




	c.      


	Without
	Cause


	. The engagement of the Consultant by the Company shall terminate at the election of the Company upon written notice
	(or upon such later date specified in such notice) to the Consultant without Cause.




	 




	d.      


	Voluntary
	Resignation


	. The engagement of the Consultant by the Company shall terminate at the election of the Consultant upon thirty
	(30) days’ prior written notice to the Company (which the Company may, in its sole discretion, make effective earlier than
	any notice date) for a Voluntary Resignation. The Consultant’s Voluntary Resignation may be for “

	Good Reason

	”
	if, other than to the extent the cause of the event is primarily the result of Consultant’s voluntary actions or omissions
	in providing services hereunder, (i) the Company commits a material breach of its obligations under this Agreement, (ii) a material
	change of the principal location in which Consultant is required to perform the Services Consultant hereunder on a regular basis
	more than 50 miles from its current location without the Consultant’s prior consent, or (iii) a failure to pay the Consultant’s
	Base Fee or Additional Fee to which the Consultant is entitled under this Agreement. The Consultant will provide written notice
	to the Company of the existence of any event or condition that constitutes Good Reason within ninety (90) days of its existence.
	Upon receipt of such notice, the Company shall have a period of thirty (30) days during which it may remedy such event or condition
	that constitutes Good Reason (the “

	Cure Period

	”). Notwithstanding any other provision herein, the Consultant’s
	termination of engagement shall not constitute termination with Good Reason unless such termination occurs within sixty (60) days
	following the last day of the Cure Period.




	 




	e.      


	Non-renewal


	.
	The Consultant’s engagement shall terminate at a Term Date if either the Consultant or the Company notifies the other Party
	of its non-renewal of this Agreement not later than sixty (60) days prior to such Term Date by providing written notice to the
	other Party of such Party’s intent not to renew.




	 




	f.      


	Notice
	of Termination


	. Any termination of the Consultant’s engagement by the Company or by the Consultant (other than termination
	pursuant to Death) shall be communicated by written Notice of Termination to the other Party hereto in accordance with this Agreement.
	For purposes of this Agreement, a “

	Notice of Termination

	” shall mean a notice which shall indicate the specific
	termination provision in this Agreement relied upon and shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed
	to provide a basis for termination of the Consultant’s engagement under the provision so indicated.




	 




	g.      


	Date
	of Termination


	. The “

	Date of Termination

	” shall mean the date the Consultant’s engagement is
	terminated in accordance with this Section 8.




	 




	9.      


	Effects
	of Termination


	.




	 




	a.      


	Death/Disability


	.
	If the engagement of the Consultant should terminate during the Term due to the Consultant’s death, of if the engagement
	of the Consultant should terminate during the Term at the election of the Company due to Disability, then the Company will pay
	to the Consultant or, in the event of the Consultant’s death, to the estate of the Consultant:




	 




	i.      Any
	earned and accrued but unpaid Base Fee or Additional Fee through the Date of Termination;




	 




	ii.      reimbursement
	for any unreimbursed business expenses incurred through the Date of Termination in accordance with Section 7(b) (collectively,

	a.      


	Purpose


	.
	As previously acknowledged, the Company has invested heavily in its information systems, personnel, product development, customers,
	and customer development. As a consultant, the Consultant is entrusted with the fruits of these investments and the decisions
	to be made regarding similar future investments. In order to provide the Services and receive the compensation hereunder, the
	Company requires a written commitment from key consultants that its trust will not be misplaced and its investments lost or damaged.
	Accordingly, the Consultant makes the following promises regarding the Consultant’s activities.




	 







	 









	 







	 




	b.

	to the express and implicit terms of this Agreement to the reasonable satisfaction of the Company. During engagement, the Consultant

	all such inventive ideas and any patents obtained thereon to the Company, but without expense to the Consultant, (b) the Consultant
	agrees that all such inventive ideas and any patents thereof shall be the exclusive property of the Company, and (c) the Consultant
	will, at any and all times, furnish such information and assistance and execute such applications and other documents as may be

	in connection therewith.

	Property

	developments, discoveries, models, or business plans or opportunities, or any other intellectual property of any type or nature
	whatsoever related to the Business or the Products (“

	Intellectual Property

	”), developed by the Consultant during
	the period of the Consultant’s engagement by the Company or its affiliates and whether developed by the Consultant during
	or after business hours, or alone or in connection with others, that is in any way related to the Business of the Company, its
	successors or assigns. This provision shall not apply to books or articles authored by the Consultant during non-work hours, consistent
	with the Consultant’s obligations under this Agreement, so long as such books or articles (a) are not funded in whole or
	in part by the Company, and (b) do not contain any confidential information or Intellectual Property of the Company. The Consultant
	agrees, at the Company’s expense, to take all steps necessary or proper to vest title to all such Intellectual Property
	in the Company, and cooperate fully and assist the Company in any litigation or other proceedings involving any such Intellectual
	Property.

	any person employed by or providing services to the Company or any customer of the Company. The Consultant shall not approach
	any such employees for such a prohibited purpose and shall not knowingly cooperate in any other person or entity’s efforts
	to do so. The Company’s customers are third-party beneficiaries of this covenant and shall have standing to enforce the
	terms of this Section 10(e) by seeking whatever equitable and legal remedies may be available to the Company hereunder.

	the course of the Consultant’s engagement with the Company) which is related to the Business and the Products and is not

	through a means other than a breach of this Agreement by the Consultant. In the event the Consultant is required by any legal
	proceedings to disclose confidential information, the Consultant shall provide the Company with prompt notice thereof so that
	the Company may seek an appropriate protective order and/or waive compliance by the Consultant with the provisions hereof.

	manufacturing, or marketing of products which are competitive with, substantially similar to, or serve the same function as the
	Products manufactured, marketed or sold by the Company either now or at any time during the Term. This post-termination restriction
	is limited to activities in or directed at the geographic area located in North America where the Company has sold or manufactured
	the Products at any time during the Term hereof. The Consultant specifically agrees, without limitation, that the Consultant will
	not accept a similar position or perform the same or similar responsibilities or services as performed for the Company for any

	h.      


	Return
	of Company Materials

	and the Products, whether or not created by the Consultant during the Term hereof including, but not be limited to: all financial,
	sales and purchase data for the Business and the Company’s customers, all financial statements and projections, all marketing
	surveys and analyses, all strategic planning material, all data on the Company’s competitors, all customer information,

	Company prompt written notice of any such legal process and cooperated with the Company’s efforts to seek a protective order.




	 







	 









	 







	 




	j.      


	Consultant’s
	Representations


	. The Consultant represents and acknowledges that none of the activity restrictions set forth in this Section
	10 will prevent the Consultant from obtaining employment, cause undue hardship, cause a relocation, or adversely impact numerous
	other business and employment opportunities that are not affected by the existence of these restrictions. The Consultant further
	acknowledges that the Consultant believes the foregoing restrictions to be reasonable and necessary to protect the Company’s
	legitimate business interests. Any violation of the restrictions in this Section 10 can cause harm to the Company of an irreparable
	nature for which money damages alone will not suffice. The Consultant agrees that the Consultant will fully and promptly disclose
	to any person or entity with which the Consultant becomes associated subsequent to the termination or expiration of this Agreement
	all of the restrictions on the Consultant’s post-termination activities. The Company shall also have the right to disclose

	l.      


	Tolling


	.
	In the event of any violation of the provisions of this Section 10, the Consultant acknowledges and agrees that the post-termination
	restrictions contained in this Section 10 shall be extended by a period of time equal to the period of such violation, it being

	and Remedies upon Breach


	. The Consultant acknowledges and agrees that any breach by the Consultant of any of the provisions
	of Section 10 (the “

	Restrictive Covenants

	”) would result in irreparable injury and damage for which money damages
	would not provide an adequate remedy. Therefore, if the Consultant breaches, or threatens to commit a breach of, any of the provisions
	of the Restrictive Covenants, the Company and its affiliates shall have the following rights and remedies, each of which rights
	and remedies shall be independent of the other and severally enforceable, and all of which rights and remedies shall be in addition
	to, and not in lieu of, any other rights and remedies available to the Company and its affiliates, under law or in equity (including,
	without limitation, the recovery of damages):




	 




	i.      the
	right and remedy to have the Restrictive Covenants specifically enforced (without posting bond and without the need to prove damages)
	by any court of competent jurisdiction, including, without limitation, the right to an entry against the Consultant of restraining
	orders and injunctions (preliminary, mandatory, temporary and permanent) against violations, threatened or actual, and whether
	or not then continuing, of such covenants; and




	 




	ii.      the
	right and remedy to require the Consultant to account for and pay over to the Company or any of its affiliates all compensation,
	profits, monies, accruals, increments or other benefits (collectively, “

	Benefits

	”) derived or received by the
	Consultant as the result of any transactions constituting a breach of the Restrictive Covenants, and the Consultant shall account
	for and pay over such Benefits to such member of Company Group and, if applicable, its affected affiliates.




	 




	11.      


	Successors

	personal services. This Agreement shall not be assignable by the Company, except that the Company may assign it to an affiliate
	of the Company and shall assign it in connection with a transaction involving the succession by a third party to all or substantially
	all of the Company’s business and/or assets (whether direct or indirect and whether by purchase, merger, consolidation,
	liquidation or otherwise). When assigned to a successor, the assignee shall assume this Agreement and expressly agree to perform
	this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent as the Company would be required to perform it in the absence of such
	an assignment and the Company shall be released of all obligations hereunder. For all purposes under this Agreement, the term
	“Company” shall include any successor to the Company’s business and/or assets that executes and delivers the
	assumption agreement described in the immediately preceding sentence or that becomes bound by this Agreement by operation of law.
	This Agreement is intended for the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns as provided
	in this Section 11 and is not for the benefit of, nor may any provision hereof be enforced by, any other person, except as otherwise
	set forth in this Agreement.

	known address. Arbitration shall be commenced by the filing by a party of an arbitration demand with the AAA in its office in
	Denver, Colorado. The arbitration and resolution of the dispute shall be resolved by a single arbitrator appointed by the AAA
	pursuant to AAA rules. The arbitration shall in all respects be governed and conducted by applicable AAA rules, and any award
	and/or decision shall be conclusive and binding on the parties. The arbitration shall be conducted in Denver, Colorado regardless

	from arbitration.




	 




	e.

	so holding shall modify or amend the offending restriction or restrictions in any reasonable fashion so as to render it or them
	enforceable to the fullest extent possible under prevailing law. In the event that any restriction is deemed void and unenforceable
	and not suitable or capable of being so modified, then such restriction shall be severed. Each term and provision of this Agreement
	is and shall be construed as severable in whole or in part, and, if any provision or the application thereof to particular circumstances
	should be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, then the remaining terms and provisions shall not be affected and shall remain fully
	enforceable. An adjudication or finding of invalidity or unenforceability for one jurisdiction of any particular provision shall
	not invalidate or void such provision in any other jurisdiction. It is the express intent of the Parties that all restrictions

	in Surna’s catalogs and bulletins, other than damage or failure arising from modifications made to the Equipment by parties

	recommended by Surna, Surna will use its commercially reasonable efforts to repair or replace the Equipment in a commercially
	reasonable time fame. Surna shall not be obligated to pay for the cost of lost refrigerant or lost product or any other direct,
	indirect, or consequential damages, loss or contamination of crop, loss of profits, or reimbursement for loss caused by interruption
	of service, arising out of the use of the Equipment. Surna’s obligations and liabilities under this Section 1.6 shall be

	Sterling’s cost, or (ii) pay to Surna an amount equal to the replacement cost incurred by Surna in replacing the Equipment,
	provided that, in all cases, the proceeds of any insurance recovery shall be earmarked for fulfillment of Sterling’s obligations
	under either (i) or (ii) above. NO SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE OF THE EQUIPMENT SHALL IMPAIR OR MODIFY ANY OBLIGATION OF STERLING AND
	KEEN UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, WHICH OBLIGATIONS REMAIN IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT.

	3.4.       
	Sterling shall not at any time during the Term hereof or at any time thereafter communicate, divulge or disclose , take, or use
	for itself any information, knowledge, data, or materials that were disclosed or obtained by it during the Term (including, without
	limitation, the Performance Data and any information and knowledge that was conceived, created, or developed by Sterling during
	the course of this Agreement) which is related to the Surna Business and Surna Products and is not already generally known in
	Surna’s trade by competitors. This restriction on confidential information disclosure shall apply to knowledge or information
	which relates to the Surna Business or the business of Surna’s customers and is in the nature of a business secret of Surna
	or Surna’s customers provided, however, that this restriction on confidential information use shall not apply to any information
	or knowledge conceived, created, or developed by Sterling as long as Sterling’s use thereof does not compete with the Surna
	Business or Surna Products. Included within the scope of this restriction shall be the specific items identified in Section 3.6
	hereof and any other information and matters designated by Surna (verbally or in writing) to be confidential during the Term hereof.
	The obligations of Sterling with respect to the disclosure and use of confidential information under this Section 3.4 shall cease
	to the extent such information becomes generally known in Surna’s trade by competitors through a means other than a breach
	of this Agreement by Sterling. In the event Sterling is required by any legal proceedings to disclose confidential information,
	Sterling shall provide Surna with prompt notice thereof so that Surna may seek an appropriate protective order and/or waive compliance
	by Sterling with the provisions hereof.

	or business, directly or indirectly, engage in any business activity which relates to the sale, manufacturing, or marketing of
	products which are competitive with, substantially similar to, or serve the same function as the Surna Products manufactured,
	marketed or sold by Surna. This post-termination restriction is limited to activities in or directed at the geographic area located
	in North America where Surna has sold or manufactured the Surna Products at any time during the Term hereof. Sterling specifically

	Sterling’s business, cause undue hardship, or adversely impact numerous other business opportunities that are not affected
	by the existence of these restrictions. Sterling further acknowledges that it believes the foregoing restrictions to be reasonable
	and necessary to protect Surna’s legitimate business interests. Any violation of the restrictions in this Section 3 can
	cause harm to Surna of an irreparable nature for which money damages alone will not suffice. Sterling agrees that it will fully
	and promptly disclose to any person or entity with which it becomes associated subsequent to the termination or expiration of
	this Agreement all of the restrictions on its post-termination activities. Surna shall also have the right to disclose this Agreement
	to any business entity utilizing the services of Sterling subsequent to the termination or expiration of this Agreement.

	the Term and thereafter, neither Party shall knowingly, directly or indirectly, make negative comments or otherwise disparage
	the other Party, any of its affiliates, or any of their respective officers, directors, employees, shareholders, agents or businesses
	in any manner likely to be harmful to them or their business reputations or personal reputations. Each Party shall direct its
	senior management team to not disparage or encourage or induce others to disparage the other Party. The foregoing shall not be
	violated by truthful statements in response to legal process, required governmental testimony or filings, or administrative or
	arbitral proceedings (including depositions in connection with such proceedings); provided that the Party has given the other
	Party prompt written notice of any such legal process and cooperated with the other Party’s efforts to seek a protective
	order




	 




	3.9.       The
	provisions of this Section 3 restricting the post-termination activities of Sterling shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

	7.2.       This
	Agreement constitutes the entire understanding or agreement between Surna and Sterling relating to the subject matter hereof and

	7.3.       This
	Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and shall be enforceable by and against each Party and their respective
	successors and assigns, provided that this Agreement shall not be assignable by either Party, except that either Party may assign
	it to an affiliate of that Party and shall assign it in connection with a transaction involving the succession by a third party
	to all or substantially all of that Party’s business and/or assets (whether direct or indirect and whether by purchase,
	merger, consolidation, liquidation or otherwise). When assigned to a successor, the assignee shall assume this Agreement and expressly
	agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent as the Party assigning it would be required to perform
	it in the absence of such an assignment and the assigning Party shall be released of all obligations hereunder.

	provision of this Agreement may be waived, modified, supplemented or amended except in a written instrument signed by the Parties.

	this Agreement.




	 




	7.6.       Any
	notice, report or demand required or permitted by any provisions of this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to
	have been sufficiently given or served for all purposes if sent by registered or certified mail or overnight delivery (with evidence
	of delivery) charges prepaid, to the address of the party to whom such notice is to be given as shown on the cover sheet hereof
	or as such party may from time to time direct in writing. Notices are deemed to have been received on the date that they are delivered
	to the address.




	 




	7.7.       Surna
	intends to publicly announce and disclose this Agreement and the subject matter hereof in accordance with applicable laws. Until
	such time as Surna has publicly announced and/or disclosed this Agreement and the subject matter hereof, Sterling shall not publicly

	7.8.       All
	questions concerning the construction, validity, enforcement and interpretation of this Agreement shall be governed by and construed
	and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Colorado, without regard to the principles of conflicts of law

	claims arising from the subject matter of this Agreement shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Notice of a demand to arbitrate
	a dispute by either party shall be given in writing to the other at their last known address. Arbitration shall be commenced by
	the filing by a party of an arbitration demand with the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in its office in
	Denver, Colorado. The arbitration and resolution of the dispute shall be resolved by a single arbitrator appointed by the AAA
	pursuant to AAA rules. The arbitration shall in all respects be governed and conducted by applicable AAA rules, and any award
	and/or decision shall be conclusive and binding on the parties. The arbitration shall be conducted in Denver, Colorado regardless
	of the particular plant or facility of the Parties. The arbitrator shall supply a written opinion supporting any award, and judgment
	may be entered on the award in any court of competent jurisdiction. Each Party shall pay its own fees and expenses for the arbitration
	except for any costs and charges imposed by the AAA which may be assessed against the losing party by the arbitrator. Any fees
	of the arbitrator for his services shall in all events be shared and paid equally by the Parties.




	 








	9

	 









	 







	 




	7.10.       In
	the event that preliminary or permanent injunctive relief is necessary or desirable in order to prevent a Party from acting contrary
	to this Agreement or to prevent irreparable harm prior to a confirmation of an arbitration award, then either Party is authorized
	and entitled to commence a lawsuit solely to obtain equitable relief against the other pending the completion of the arbitration
	in a court having jurisdiction over the Parties. All rights and remedies of the parties shall be cumulative and in addition to
	any other rights and remedies obtainable from arbitration.




	 




	7.11.       In
	the event that any court or arbitrator finds or holds any restriction contained in this Agreement to be unreasonable, invalid,
	or unenforceable, then it is the express intent of the Parties that the court or arbitrator so holding shall modify or amend the
	offending restriction or restrictions in any reasonable fashion so as to render it or them enforceable to the fullest extent possible
	under prevailing law. In the event that any restriction is deemed void and unenforceable and not suitable or capable of being
	so modified, then such restriction shall be severed. Each term and provision of this Agreement is and shall be construed as severable
	in whole or in part, and, if any provision or the application thereof to particular circumstances should be invalid, illegal,
	or unenforceable, then the remaining terms and provisions shall not be affected and shall remain fully enforceable. An adjudication
	or finding of invalidity or unenforceability for one jurisdiction of any particular provision shall not invalidate or void such
	provision in any other jurisdiction. It is the express intent of the Parties that all restrictions imposed by this Agreement be
	construed and applied to avoid legal nullities and with a view towards enforcement whenever possible.




	 




	7.12.       The
	Parties agree that each of them and/or their respective counsel have reviewed and had an opportunity to revise this Agreement
	and, therefore, the normal rule of construction to the effect that any ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party
	shall not be employed in the interpretation of this Agreement or any amendments thereto. The word “including” shall
	be construed to include the words “without limitation.” In this Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires,
	references to the singular shall include the plural and vice versa.




	 




	7.13.       This
	Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall
	constitute one and the same instrument. Counterparts may be delivered via facsimile, electronic mail (including pdf or any electronic
	signature complying with the U.S. ESIGN Act of 2000,

	e.g.

	, www.docusign.com) or other transmission method and any counterpart
	so delivered shall be deemed to have been duly and validly delivered and be valid and effective for all purposes.

	was committed in bad faith or (b) was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty, (ii) Indemnitee actually received an improper
	personal benefit in money, property or services, or (iii) in the case of any criminal Proceeding, Indemnitee had reasonable cause
	to believe that his conduct was unlawful.




	 







	 









	 







	 





	Section

	(a)
	if it determines Indemnitee is entitled to reimbursement under Chapter 78 of the NRS, the court shall order indemnification, in
	which case Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover the expenses of securing such reimbursement; or




	 




	(b)
	if it determines that Indemnitee is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification in view of all the relevant circumstances,
	whether or not Indemnitee (i) has met the standards of conduct set forth in Chapter 78 of the NRS or (ii) has been adjudged liable
	for receipt of an improper personal benefit under Chapter 78 of the NRS, the court may order such indemnification as the court
	shall deem proper.




	 





	Section
	7. Indemnification for Expenses of a Party Who is Wholly or Partly Successful.

	Notwithstanding any other provision of this
	Agreement, and without limiting any such provision, to the extent that Indemnitee is, by reason of his Corporate Status, made
	a party to and is successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of any Proceeding, he shall be indemnified for all Expenses
	actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection therewith. If Indemnitee is not wholly successful in such
	Proceeding but is successful, on the merits or otherwise, as to one or more but less than all claims, issues or matters in such
	Proceeding, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee under this Section 7 for all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him
	or on his behalf in connection with each successfully resolved claim, issue or matter, allocated on a reasonable and proportionate
	basis. For purposes of this Section and without limitation, the termination of any claim, issue or matter in such a Proceeding
	by dismissal, with or without prejudice, shall be deemed to be a successful result as to such claim, issue or matter.




	 







	 









	 







	 





	Section
	8. Advance of Expenses.

	The Company shall advance all reasonable Expenses incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection
	with any Proceeding to which Indemnitee is, or is threatened to be, made a party or a witness, within ten days after the receipt
	by the Company of a statement or statements from Indemnitee requesting such advance or advances from time to time, whether prior
	to or after final disposition of such Proceeding. Such statement or statements shall reasonably evidence the Expenses incurred
	by Indemnitee and shall include or be preceded or accompanied by a written affirmation by Indemnitee of Indemnitee’s good
	faith belief that the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification by the Company as authorized by law and by this Agreement
	has been met and a written undertaking by or on behalf of Indemnitee, in substantially the form attached hereto as

	Exhibit
	A

	or in such form as may be required under applicable law as in effect at the time of the execution thereof, to reimburse
	the portion of any Expenses advanced to Indemnitee relating to claims, issues or matters in the Proceeding as to which it shall
	ultimately be established that the standard of conduct has not been met and which have not been successfully resolved as described
	in Section 7. To the extent that Expenses advanced to Indemnitee do not relate to a specific claim, issue or matter in the Proceeding,
	such Expenses shall be allocated on a reasonable and proportionate basis. The undertaking required by this Section 8 shall be
	an unlimited general obligation by or on behalf of Indemnitee and shall be accepted without reference to Indemnitee’s financial
	ability to repay such advanced Expenses and without any requirement to post security therefor.




	 





	Section
	9. Procedure for Determination of Entitlement to Indemnification.

	(a) To obtain indemnification under this Agreement, Indemnitee
	shall submit to the Company a written request, including therein or therewith such documentation and information as is reasonably
	available to Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification.
	The Secretary of the Company shall, promptly upon receipt of such a request for indemnification, advise the Board of Directors
	in writing that Indemnitee has requested indemnification. (b) Upon written request by Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant
	to the first sentence of Section 9(a) hereof, a determination, if required by applicable law, with respect to Indemnitee’s
	entitlement thereto shall promptly be made in the specific case: (i) if a Change in Control shall have occurred, by Independent
	Counsel in a written opinion to the Board of Directors, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee; or (ii) if a Change
	of Control shall not have occurred, (A) by the Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof) by a majority vote
	of a quorum consisting of Disinterested Directors (“

	Disinterested Directors

	”), or (B) if a quorum of the Board
	of Directors consisting of Disinterested Directors is not obtainable or, even if obtainable, such quorum of Disinterested Directors
	so directs, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board of Directors, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee,
	or (C) if so directed by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors, by the stockholders of the Company; and, if it is
	so determined that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, payment to Indemnitee shall be made within ten days after such determination.
	Indemnitee shall cooperate with the person, persons or entity making such determination with respect to Indemnitee’s entitlement
	to indemnification, including providing to such person, persons or entity upon reasonable advance request any documentation or
	information which is not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure and which is reasonably available to Indemnitee and
	reasonably necessary to such determination. Any costs or Expenses incurred by Indemnitee in so cooperating with the person, persons
	or entity making such determination shall be borne by the Company (irrespective of the determination as to Indemnitee’s
	entitlement to indemnification) and the Company shall indemnify and hold Indemnitee harmless therefrom.




	 







	 









	 







	 





	Section
	10. Presumptions and Effect of Certain Proceedings.

	(a) In making a determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification
	hereunder, the person or persons or entity making such determination shall presume that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification
	under this Agreement if Indemnitee has submitted a request for indemnification in accordance with Section 9(a) of this Agreement,
	and the Company shall have the burden of proof to overcome that presumption in connection with the making of any determination
	contrary to that presumption. (b) The termination of any Proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, a plea of nolo
	contendere or its equivalent, or an entry of an order of probation prior to judgment, does not create a presumption that Indemnitee
	did not meet the requisite standard of conduct described herein for indemnification.




	 





	Section
	11. Remedies of Indemnitee.

	(a) If (i) a determination is made pursuant to Section 9 of this Agreement that Indemnitee is
	not entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, (ii) advance of Expenses is not timely made pursuant to Section 8 of this
	Agreement, (iii) no determination of entitlement to indemnification shall have been made pursuant to Section 9(b) of this Agreement
	within 30 days after receipt by the Company of the request for indemnification, (iv) payment of indemnification is not made pursuant
	to Section 7 of this Agreement within ten days after receipt by the Company of a written request therefor, or (v) payment of indemnification
	is not made within ten days after a determination has been made that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, Indemnitee shall
	be entitled to an adjudication in an appropriate court of the State of Nevada, or in any other court of competent jurisdiction,
	of his entitlement to such indemnification or advance of Expenses. Alternatively, Indemnitee, at his option, may seek an award
	in arbitration to be conducted by a single arbitrator pursuant to the commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
	Association. Indemnitee shall commence such proceeding seeking an adjudication or an award in arbitration within 180 days following
	the date on which Indemnitee first has the right to commence such proceeding pursuant to this Section 11(a); provided, however,
	that the foregoing clause shall not apply to a proceeding brought by Indemnitee to enforce his rights under Section 7 of this
	Agreement. (b) In any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 11 the Company shall have the burden
	of proving that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advance of Expenses, as the case may be. (c) If a determination
	shall have been made pursuant to Section 9(b) of this Agreement that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Company shall
	be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 11, absent a misstatement
	by Indemnitee of a material fact, or an omission of a material fact necessary to make Indemnitee’s statement not materially
	misleading, in connection with the request for indemnification.




	(d)
	In the event that Indemnitee, pursuant to this Section 11, seeks a judicial adjudication of or an award in arbitration to enforce
	his rights under, or to recover damages for breach of, this Agreement, Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover from the Company,
	and shall be indemnified by the Company for, any and all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him in such judicial adjudication
	or arbitration. If it shall be determined in such judicial adjudication or arbitration that Indemnitee is entitled to receive
	part but not all of the indemnification or advance of Expenses sought, the Expenses incurred by Indemnitee in connection with
	such judicial adjudication or arbitration shall be appropriately prorated.




	 







	 









	 







	 





	Section
	12. Defense of the Underlying Proceeding.

	(a) Indemnitee shall notify the Company promptly upon being served with or receiving
	any summons, citation, subpoena, complaint, indictment, information, notice, request or other document relating to any Proceeding
	which may result in the right to indemnification or the advance of Expenses hereunder; provided, however, that the failure to
	give any such notice shall not disqualify Indemnitee from the right, or otherwise affect in any manner any right of Indemnitee,
	to indemnification or the advance of Expenses under this Agreement unless the Company’s ability to defend in such Proceeding
	or to obtain proceeds under any insurance policy is materially and adversely prejudiced thereby, and then only to the extent the
	Company is thereby actually so prejudiced. (b) Subject to the provisions of the last sentence of this Section 12(b) and of Section
	12(c) below, the Company shall have the right to defend Indemnitee in any Proceeding which may give rise to indemnification hereunder;
	provided, however, that the Company shall notify Indemnitee of any such decision to defend within 15 calendar days following receipt
	of notice of any such Proceeding under Section 12(a) above. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Indemnitee,
	which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, consent to the entry of any judgment against Indemnitee or enter into any
	settlement or compromise which (i) includes an admission of fault of Indemnitee or (ii) does not include, as an unconditional
	term thereof, the full release of Indemnitee from all liability in respect of such Proceeding, which release shall be in form
	and substance reasonably satisfactory to Indemnitee. This Section 12(b) shall not apply to a Proceeding brought by Indemnitee
	under Section 11 above or Section 18 below. (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 12(b) above, if in a Proceeding to which
	Indemnitee is a party by reason of Indemnitee’s Corporate Status, (i) Indemnitee reasonably concludes, based upon an opinion
	of counsel approved by the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, that he may have separate defenses or counterclaims
	to assert with respect to any issue which may not be consistent with other defendants in such Proceeding, (ii) Indemnitee reasonably
	concludes, based upon an opinion of counsel approved by the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, that an
	actual or apparent conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest exists between Indemnitee and the Company, or (iii)
	if the Company fails to assume the defense of such Proceeding in a timely manner, Indemnitee shall be entitled to be represented
	by separate legal counsel of Indemnitee’s choice, subject to the prior approval of the Company, which shall not be unreasonably
	withheld, at the expense of the Company. In addition, if the Company fails to comply with any of its obligations under this Agreement
	or in the event that the Company or any other person takes any action to declare this Agreement void or unenforceable, or institutes
	any Proceeding to deny or to recover from Indemnitee the benefits intended to be provided to Indemnitee hereunder, Indemnitee
	shall have the right to retain counsel of Indemnitee’s choice, subject to the prior approval of the Company, which shall
	not be unreasonably withheld, at the expense of the Company (subject to Section 11(d)), to represent Indemnitee in connection
	with any such matter.




	 





	Section
	13. Non-Exclusivity; Survival of Rights; Subrogation; Insurance.





	(a)
	The rights of indemnification and advance of Expenses as provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any other
	rights to which Indemnitee may at any time be entitled under applicable law, the Articles of Incorporation of the Company (as
	amended from time to time, the “

	Charter

	”) or the bylaws of the Company (as amended from time to time, the “

	Bylaws

	”),
	any agreement or a resolution of the stockholders entitled to vote generally in the election of directors or of the Board of Directors,
	or otherwise. No amendment, alteration or repeal of this Agreement or of any provision hereof shall limit or restrict any right
	of Indemnitee under this Agreement in respect of any action taken or omitted by such Indemnitee in his Corporate Status prior
	to such amendment, alteration or repeal. (b) In the event of any payment under this Agreement, the Company shall be subrogated
	to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of Indemnitee, who shall execute all papers required and take all
	action necessary to secure such rights, including execution of such documents as are necessary to enable the Company to bring
	suit to enforce such rights. (c) The Company shall not be liable under this Agreement to make any payment of amounts otherwise
	indemnifiable or payable or reimbursable as expenses hereunder if and to the extent that Indemnitee has otherwise actually received
	such payment under any insurance policy, contract, agreement or otherwise.




	 







	 









	 







	 





	Section
	14. Insurance.

	The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to acquire directors and officers liability insurance, on
	terms and conditions deemed appropriate by the Board of Directors of the Company, with the advice of counsel, covering Indemnitee
	or any claim made against Indemnitee for service as a director or officer of the Company and covering the Company for any indemnification
	or advance of Expenses made by the Company to Indemnitee for any claims made against Indemnitee for service as a director or officer
	of the Company. Without in any way limiting any other obligation under this Agreement, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee
	for any payment by Indemnitee arising out of the amount of any deductible or retention and the amount of any excess of the aggregate
	of all judgments, penalties, fines, settlements and reasonable Expenses incurred by Indemnitee in connection with a Proceeding
	over the coverage of any insurance referred to in the previous sentence.




	 





	Section
	15. Indemnification for Expenses of a Witness.

	Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent that Indemnitee
	is, by reason of his Corporate Status, a witness in any Proceeding, whether instituted by the Company or any other party, and
	to which Indemnitee is not a party, he shall be advanced all reasonable Expenses and indemnified against all Expenses actually
	and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection therewith.




	 





	Section
	16. Duration of Agreement; Binding Effect.

	(a) This Agreement shall continue until and terminate ten years after the date
	that Indemnitee’s Corporate Status shall have ceased; provided, that the rights of Indemnitee hereunder shall continue until
	the final termination of any Proceeding then pending in respect of which Indemnitee is granted rights of indemnification or advance
	of Expenses hereunder and of any proceeding commenced by Indemnitee pursuant to Section 11 of this Agreement relating thereto.
	(b) The indemnification and advance of Expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Agreement shall be binding upon and
	be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns (including any direct or indirect successor by
	purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company), shall continue
	as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, trustee, officer, employee or agent of the Company or of any other corporation,
	partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise which such person is or was serving at the written
	request of the Company, and shall inure to the benefit of Indemnitee and his spouse, assigns, heirs, devisees, executors and administrators
	and other legal representatives. (c) The Company shall require and cause any successor (whether direct or indirect by purchase,
	merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all, substantially all or a substantial part, of the business and/or assets of the Company,
	by written agreement in form and substance satisfactory to Indemnitee, expressly to assume and agree to perform this Agreement
	in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform if no such succession had taken place.




	 





	Section
	17. Severability.

	If any provision or provisions of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for
	any reason whatsoever: (a) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement (including,
	without limitation, each portion of any section of this Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or
	unenforceable that is not itself invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby; and
	(b) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, each portion of any section
	of this Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself invalid, illegal
	or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested thereby.




	 







	 









	 







	 





	Section
	18. Exception to Right of Indemnification or Advance of Expenses.

	Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Indemnitee
	shall not be entitled to indemnification or advance of Expenses under this Agreement with respect to any Proceeding brought by
	Indemnitee, unless (a) the Proceeding is brought to enforce indemnification under this Agreement or otherwise or (b) the Company’s
	Bylaws, the Charter, a resolution of the stockholders entitled to vote generally in the election of directors or of the Board
	of Directors or an agreement approved by the Board of Directors to which the Company is a party expressly provide otherwise.

	by the party against whom enforceability is sought shall be sufficient to evidence the existence of this Agreement. Electronic

	EXHIBIT A



	 


	FORM OF UNDERTAKING TO REPAY EXPENSES ADVANCED


	 


	To: The Board of Directors of Surna, Inc.


	 


	Re: Undertaking to Repay Expenses Advanced


	 


	Ladies and Gentlemen:


	 


	This undertaking is
	being provided pursuant to that certain Indemnification Agreement (the “

	Indemnification Agreement

	”) dated ____
	day of _______, 20__, by and between Surna, Inc. (the “

	Company

	”) and the undersigned Indemnitee (“

	Indemnitee

	”),
	pursuant to which I am entitled to advance of expenses in connection with

	[Description of Proceeding]

	(the “

	Proceeding

	”).


	 


	Terms used herein and
	not otherwise defined shall have the meanings specified in the Indemnification Agreement.


	 


	I am subject to the
	Proceeding by reason of my Corporate Status or by reason of alleged actions or omissions by me in such capacity. I hereby affirm
	that at all times, insofar as I was involved as

	[a director/officer]

	of the Company, in any of the facts or events giving
	rise to the Proceeding, I (1) acted in good faith and honestly, (2) did not receive any improper personal benefit in money, property
	or services and (3) in the case of any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe that any act or omission by me
	was unlawful.


	 


	In consideration of
	the advance of Expenses by the Company for reasonable attorneys’ fees and related expenses incurred by me in connection
	with the Proceeding (the “

	Advanced Expenses

	”), I hereby agree that if, in connection with the Proceeding, it
	is established that (1) an act or omission by me was material to the matter giving rise to the Proceeding and (a) was committed
	in bad faith or (b) was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty or (2) I actually received an improper personal benefit
	in money, property or services or (3) in the case of any criminal proceeding, I had reasonable cause to believe that the act or
	omission was unlawful, then I shall promptly reimburse the portion of the Advanced Expenses relating to the claims, issues or
	matters in the Proceeding as to which the foregoing findings have been established and which have not been successfully resolved
	as described in Section 7 of the Indemnification Agreement. To the extent that Advanced Expenses do not relate to a specific claim,
	issue or matter in the Proceeding, I agree that such Expenses shall be allocated on a reasonable and proportionate basis.


	 


	IN WITNESS WHEREOF,
	I have executed this Affirmation and Undertaking on this ___day of _____, 20___.

	I,
	Trent Doucet, certify that:




	 




	1.
	I have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2017 of Surna Inc. (the “registrant”);




	 




	2.
	Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
	to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;




	 




	3.
	Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all
	material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods
	presented in this report;




	 




	4.
	The registrant’s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls
	and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined
	in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15-d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:




	 




	a.
	Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision,
	to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly
	during the period in which this report is being prepared;




	 




	b.
	Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed
	under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
	financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;




	 




	c.
	Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions
	about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on
	such evaluation; and




	 




	d.
	Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the
	registrant’s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant’s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that
	has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant’s internal control over financial
	reporting; and




	 




	5.
	The registrant’s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control
	over financial reporting, to the registrant’s auditors and the Audit Committee of the registrant’s board of directors
	(or persons performing the equivalent functions):




	 




	a.
	All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which
	are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information;
	and




	 




	b.
	Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant’s
	internal control over financial reporting.

	Surna
	Reports Q1 2017 Results






	 






	May
	15, 2017

	– Boulder, Colorado – Surna, Inc., a manufacturer of a proprietary line of optimized lighting, environmental
	control and air sanitation systems for state-regulated cannabis cultivation facilities as well as traditional indoor agricultural
	facilities (“Surna” or the “Company”) (OTCQB: SRNA), announced today operating and financial results for
	the three months ended March 31, 2017. The Company will not be hosting a conference call following the release of its financial
	results.





	 






	Results
	of Operations





	 




	Revenue
	for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was approximately $1,593,000 compared to $2,498,000 for the three months ended March
	31, 2016, a decline of $905,000, or 36%. The decline in revenue was primarily due to: (i) the restructuring of our policies to
	secure sales contracts at an earlier stage which was not in place in Q1 2016, and (ii) the heightened uncertainty of the cannabis
	industry following the recent U.S. presidential election.




	 




	Cost
	of revenue decreased by 17% from $1,410,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016 to approximately $1,165,000 for the three
	months ended March 31, 2017. The gross margin decreased by seventeen percentage points from 44% for the three months ended March
	31, 2016 to 27% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The fixed cost component represents engineering, manufacturing and
	project management salaries and benefits, which totaled approximately $294,000, or 18% of total revenue, for the three months
	ended March 31, 2017 as compared to $332,000, or 13% of total revenue, for three months ended March 31, 2016. The variable cost
	component represents our cost of equipment, outside engineering costs, shipping and handling, travel and warranty costs, which
	total approximately $871,000, or 55% or total revenue, in the three months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to $1,078,000, or
	43% of total revenue, in the three months ended March 31, 2016.




	 




	Our
	standard controlled environment agriculture project consists of small chillers, fan-coils, and dehumidifiers, the major equipment
	items which we manufacture. Other required equipment items typically consist of large chillers, pumps, air separators and expansion
	tanks, which we purchase from outside vendors. We believe our core competency is to provide integration services for these equipment
	items delivering a fully engineered, turn-key, single-source solution to our customers.




	 




	This
	integrated solution can create gross profit margin fluctuations depending on project design and the mix between our proprietary
	equipment, which typically generates a higher gross profit margin, and the equipment manufactured by outside vendors, which has
	a lower gross profit margin. Further, quarterly fluctuations in gross profit margins can occur based on the timing of a project’s
	needs for our manufactured equipment versus third party manufactured equipment.




	 




	Operating
	expenses increased by 41% from $724,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016 to approximately $1,018,000 for the three months
	ended March 31, 2017. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, we incurred $136,000 in non-cash compensatory expenses, compared
	to non-cash compensatory expenses of $3,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016.




	 




	The
	most significant component of our increased operating expenses in the three months ended March 31, 2017 were selling, general
	and administrative expenses (“SG&A expenses”). SG&A expenses increased by $249,000, or 44%, from $569,000
	for the three months ended March 31, 2016 to $818,000 for three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in SG&A expenses
	for the three months ended March 31, 2017 is due primarily to the following: (i) increased personnel-related costs of approximately
	$184,000, including a non-cash stock-based retention bonus paid to our new chairman of our board of approximately $131,000, (ii)
	increased travel cost of approximately $16,000, and (iii) increased investor and public relations costs of approximately $66,000.
	These increases were offset by decreases in the following; (i) our SG&A expenses related to outside sales commissions, which
	decreased by approximately $24,000, and (ii) our provision for bad debt for the three months ended March 31, 2017 which was zero
	compared to the March 31, 2016 provision of approximately $41,000.




	 


	Overall,
	we realized a net loss of approximately $1,001,000 for three months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to a net loss of approximately
	$746,000 for three months ended March 31, 2016, an increase $255,000, or 34%.



	 






	 


	 


	 









	 




	 







	 





	Regulatory
	Changes are Leading Indicator for New Facility Construction





	 




	The
	demand for our products and services is primarily based on the new construction of cannabis cultivation facilities in the U.S.
	and Canada.




	 




	Recent
	and anticipated regulatory changes involving medicinal and/or recreational cannabis use in various jurisdictions, such as California,
	tends to be a leading indicator for the granting of licenses for new facility construction.




	 




	For
	2017, we are focused on new facility construction in California, where recreational cannabis use was approved in November 2016,
	and in Canada, where federal legalization legislation has been introduced and recreational cannabis use appears to be gaining
	support.




	 





	Contract
	Milestones and Revenue Model






	 





	While
	our typical project sales contract is non-cancellable, there are risks that we may not realize the full contract value in a timely
	manner, or at all. Completion of a sales contract is dependent upon our customers’ ability to secure, license and build
	their growing facility and take possession of the equipment.




	 




	In
	order to address these risks, we have three key milestones built into our contracts:




	 






	 



	●

	 




	First,
	we provide our customer with engineering plans for which we require an upfront deposit before we begin our services. In many
	cases, the engineering phase is done as part of the license application or building permit process, represents on average
	approximately 10% of the total contract value, and takes approximately four to six weeks to complete. We previously required
	a larger initial deposit that covered engineering and initial equipment items, however, beginning in early 2017, we began
	offering our customers a lower initial deposit for engineering only. Our strategy is to lock in the sales contract and commence
	the engineering portion of the project earlier, which is important for a number of reasons: (i) we can assist our customers
	with their engineering and design plans as part of their licensing application process, (ii) we are better positioned to lock
	in our technology for the project at an earlier stage, and (iii) we are able to help reduce the customer’s time to market.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	Second,
	upon completion of the engineering phase, it may take our customer on average five months to complete the facility build-out,
	with possible delays due to financing or other aspects which are beyond our control. Customer delays in obtaining financing
	and completing facility build-out make the timing of completion of our sales contract unpredictable. For our protection, before
	we begin manufacturing our proprietary equipment items, we require an upfront deposit.






	 




	 




	 






	 



	●



	And
	third, the last phase of our contract involves procurement and drop-ship delivery of third party manufactured equipment items,
	which we undertake only upon payment of the third and final deposit.






	 





	Sales
	Contract Backlog





	 




	As
	of March 31, 2017, we had executed project sales contracts with a total unearned contract value of approximately $3,790,000 (“Q1
	2017 backlog”), of which approximately $2,279,000 was attributed to sales contracts entered into in the three months ended
	March 31, 2017 and the remaining $1,511,000 attributed to prior quarters.




	 




	About
	78% of the Q1 2017 backlog is attributed to projects for which we have not received a further deposit on our proprietary equipment
	and, as a result, there are potential risks of project cancellation or delays. Further, a substantial portion of our Q1 2017 backlog
	is not expected to be recognized as revenue until the second half of 2017.




	 




	In
	April, we entered into a sales contract with a customer with a contract value of approximately $1,300,000 for which we have not
	completed the engineering phase. Accordingly, this contract carries the potential risk of non-completion due to the early stage
	of this project.




	 




	We
	continue to remain focused on increasing our sales contract backlog and quoting larger projects in an effort to position us for
	incremental revenues in the second half of 2017, but it is difficult for us to predict when we will recognize project revenue.




	 







	 


	 


	 









	 




	 








	 






	Balance
	Sheet; Capital Requirements






	 





	We
	had working capital (current assets in excess of current liabilities) of approximately $43,000 as of March 31, 2017 as compared
	to a working capital deficit of approximately $2,860,000 as of December 31, 2016. This change in working capital quarter-over-quarter
	is primarily related to the $2,685,000 we raised in a private placement of our common stock and attached warrants during the three
	months ended March 31, 2017.




	 




	During
	the three months ended March 31, 2017, we extinguished convertible promissory notes in the principal amount of $510,000 through
	the issuance of shares of its common stock and made payments of $270,000 to extinguish the remainder of our convertible promissory
	notes.




	 




	Management
	has determined our March 31, 2017 cash balance of approximately $1,969,000 will not be sufficient to fund our operations over
	the next twelve months. Based on management’s estimate for our operational cash requirements and without modifications to
	our existing payment obligations, which include, among other things, the upcoming payments for promissory notes in the principal
	amount of $537,500, which were issued in February 2017 and mature in November 2017, we will require additional capital to be raised
	in the second half of 2017.




	 




	If
	we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, make adjustments to our payment arrangements or raise sufficient
	additional capital through future debt and equity financings or strategic and collaborative ventures with potential partners,
	we will likely have to reduce the size and scope of our operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue
	to raise capital on terms and conditions that are deemed acceptable to us, or at all.




	 





	Other
	Developments






	 





	On
	May 10, 2017, our Board of Directors approved a three-year consulting agreement between the Company and Stephen Keen, a principal
	shareholder of the Company and a former officer and director. Under the consulting agreement, Mr. Keen will provide us certain
	consulting services including research and development, new product design and innovations, existing product enhancements and
	improvements, and other technology advancements with respect to our business and products in exchange for an annual consulting
	fee of $30,000. The consulting agreement also includes certain activity restrictions which prohibit Mr. Keen from competing against
	us. In connection with the execution of this consulting agreement, Mr. Keen resigned as a director on May 10, 2017. Mr. Keen’s
	employment with the Company ceased as of April 28, 2017.




	 




	On
	May 10, 2017, our Board also approved a three-year equipment, demonstration and product testing agreement between the Company
	and Sterling Pharms, LLC (“Sterling”), an entity controlled by Mr. Keen, which operates a Colorado-regulated cannabis
	cultivation facility. Under this agreement, we have agreed to provide to Sterling certain lighting, environmental control, and
	air sanitation equipment for use at the Sterling facility in exchange for a quarterly fee of $16,500. Also, under this agreement,
	Sterling has agreed to allow us and our existing and prospective customers to have access to the Sterling facility for demonstration
	tours in a working environment, which we believe will assist us in the sale of our products. Sterling has also agreed to monitor,
	test and evaluate our products installed at the Sterling facility and to collect data and provide feedback to us on the energy
	and operational efficiency and efficacy of the installed products, which we intend to use to improve, enhance and develop new
	or additional product features, innovations and technologies. In consideration for access to the Sterling facility to conduct
	demonstration tours and for the product testing and data to be provided by Sterling, we will pay Sterling a quarterly fee of $12,000.

	Statement
	about Cannabis Markets





	 




	The
	use, possession, cultivation, and distribution of cannabis is prohibited by federal law. This includes medical and recreational
	cannabis. Although certain states have legalized medical and recreational cannabis, companies and individuals involved in the
	sector are still at risk of being prosecuted by federal authorities. Further, the landscape in the cannabis industry changes rapidly.
	What was the law last week is not the law today and what is the law today may not be the law next week. This means that at any
	time the city, county, or state where cannabis is permitted can change the current laws and/or the federal government can supersede
	those laws and take prosecutorial action. Given the uncertain legal nature of the cannabis industry, it is imperative that investors
	understand that the cannabis industry is a high-risk investment. A change in the current laws or enforcement policy can negatively
	affect the status and operation of our business, require additional fees, stricter operational guidelines and unanticipated shut-downs.

Full year improvements include gross margin reaching 30% and a reduction in our operating loss of 83% compared to 2015. Additionally, our recent debt conversion and equity financing fortified our balance sheet by more than $5.5 million, enabling us to pursue our sales team expansion more aggressively."Both the medicinal and recreational segments of the cannabis cultivation market are growing rapidly in the US and internationally. We also have been building our presence and recently signed our sixth deal in Canada. In 2017, we anticipate rolling out our next generation equipment as well as beta test of our control and automation platform."Overall, 2016 was a pivotal year for our market and for Surna specifically.

(www.surna.com) develops innovative technologies and products that monitor, control and or address the energy and resource intensive nature of indoor cannabis cultivation. Currently, the company's revenue stream is based on its main product offerings – supplying industrial technology and products to commercial indoor cannabis grow facilities.Headquartered in Boulder, CO, Surna's diverse engineering team is tasked with creating novel energy and resource efficient solutions, including the company's signature water-cooled climate control platform. The company's engineers continuously seek to create technology that solves the highly specific demands of the cannabis industry for temperature, humidity, light and process control.Surna's goal is to provide intelligent solutions to improve the quality, the control and the overall yield and efficiency of CEA. Though its clients do, the company neither produces nor sells cannabis.Forward Looking StatementsThis press release contains forward-looking statements regarding the Company's future business expectations, which are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including Surna's ability to monetize service components, Surna's support of premium prices for existing products, commercialization of research and development efforts and continued expansion of legal cannabis markets. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Surna's financial results is included in Surna's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. The Company cautions readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. The Company disclaims any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.Read MoreStatement About Cannabis MarketsThe use, possession, cultivation, and distribution of cannabis is prohibited by federal law.  This includes medical and recreational cannabis.  Although certain states have legalized medical and recreational cannabis, companies and individuals involved in the sector are still at risk of being prosecuted by federal authorities. Further, the landscape in the cannabis industry changes rapidly.  What was the law last week is not the law today and what is the law today may not be the law next week.  This means that at any time the city, county, or state where cannabis is permitted can change the current laws and/or the federal government can supersede those laws and take prosecutorial action. Given the uncertain legal nature of the cannabis industry, it is imperative that investors understand that the cannabis industry is a high-risk investment. A change in the current laws or enforcement policy can negatively affect the status and operation of our business, require additional fees, stricter operational guidelines and unanticipated shut-downs.   Surna Marketing   Investor Relations     Jamie English   Kirsten Chapman/ Becky Herrick     Marketing Manager   LHA Investor Relations     jamie.english@surna.com   surna@lhai.com       +1-(303)-993-5271   +1-(415) 433-3777     Surna Inc.
