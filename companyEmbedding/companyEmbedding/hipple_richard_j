Reminder - Materion (MTRN) Goes Ex-Dividend Soon
Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel, on 2/17/15, Materion Corp will trade ex-dividend, for its quarterly dividend of $0.085, payable on 3/3/15. As a percentage of MTRN's recent stock price of $37.16, this dividend works out to approximately 0.23%.

YieldBoost Materion Corp From 0.9% To 9.3% Using Options
Shareholders of Materion Corp looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 0.9% annualized dividend yield can sell the June 2015 covered call at the $40 strike and collect the premium based on the $1.40 bid, which annualizes to an additional 8.4% rate of return against the current stock price (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost), for a total of 9.3% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $40 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but MTRN shares would have to climb 11.2% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 15.1% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.

Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements Certain statements in this Ferro press release may constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Federal securities laws. These statements are subject to a variety of uncertainties, unknown risks and other factors concerning the Company's operations and business environment, which are difficult to predict and often beyond the control of the Company. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by these forward-looking statements, and that could adversely affect the Company's future financial performance, include the following: --  We depend on reliable sources of raw materials and other         supplies at a reasonable cost, but availability of such         materials and supplies could be interrupted and/or the prices         charged for them could escalate. --  The markets in which we participate are highly competitive and         subject to intense price competition. --  We are striving to improve operating margins through sales         growth, price increases, productivity gains and improved         purchasing techniques, but we may not be successful in         achieving the desired improvements. --  We are engaged in restructuring programs to improve         manufacturing efficiency and reduce costs. If we are not         successful in the execution of our restructuring programs, we         will not realize the expected cost savings. --  Our products are sold into industries where demand is         unpredictable, cyclical or heavily influenced by consumer         spending. --  The global scope of our operations exposes us to risks related         to currency conversion and changing economic, social and         political conditions around the world. --  We have a growing presence in the Asia/Pacific region where it         can be difficult for an American company to compete lawfully         with local competitors. --  Regulatory authorities in the U.S., European Union and         elsewhere are taking a much more aggressive approach to         regulating hazardous materials and those regulations could         affect sales of our products. --  Our operations are subject to stringent environmental, health         and safety regulations, and compliance with those regulations         could require us to make significant investments. --  We depend on external financial resources and any interruption         in access to capital markets or borrowings could adversely         affect our financial condition. --  Interest rates on some of our external borrowings are variable         and our borrowing cost could be affected adversely by interest         rate increases. --  Many of our assets are encumbered by liens that have been         granted to lenders and those liens affect our flexibility in         making timely dispositions of property and businesses. --  We are subject to a number of restrictive covenants in our         credit facilities and those covenants could affect our         flexibility in funding strategic initiatives. --  We have significant deferred tax assets and our ability to         utilize these assets will depend on our future performance. --  We are a defendant in several lawsuits that could have an         adverse effect on our financial condition and/or financial         performance, unless they are successfully resolved. --  Our businesses depend on a continuous stream of new products         and failure to introduce new products could affect our sales         and profitability. --  Employee benefit costs, especially post-retirement costs,         constitute a significant element of our annual expenses, and         funding these costs could adversely affect our financial         condition. --  We are exposed to risks associated with acts of God,         terrorists, and others, as well as fires, explosions, wars,         riots, accidents, embargoes, natural disasters, strikes and         other work stoppages, quarantines and other governmental         actions, and other events or circumstances that are beyond the         Company's reasonable control. Additional information regarding these risk factors can be found in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2006. The risks and uncertainties identified above are not the only risks the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that it currently believes to be immaterial also may adversely affect the Company. Should any known or unknown risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, these developments could have material adverse effects on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. This release contains time-sensitive information that reflects management's best analysis only as of the date of this release. The Company does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect future events, information or circumstances that arise after the date of this release.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/23/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.

Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.

The Extras We Include, for FREE


Run criminal background checks on previous owners, their associates, or the neighbors. Get to know the whole story.



Know your new neighborhood by seeing sex offender information, which may include names, addresses, and criminal convictions.

Maryann, New Jersey
