DALLAS —  In a decade as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Richard W. Fisher was frequently mistaken in his economic predictions but seldom boring.The departure of Mr. Fisher, who stepped down on Thursday, means that the Fed is losing one of the most outspoken internal opponents of its stimulus campaign just as it is winding down. Mr. Fisher argued right up to his retirement that the central bank was increasing economic inequality, destabilizing financial markets and might yet unleash higher inflation. But he is best known not so much for what he said as for the way he said it.He spoke more often and more colorfully than any of his colleagues at the Federal Reserve, larding his speeches with quotes, anecdotes and metaphors. Among the most memorable was his 2012 description of his breeding bull, Too Big to Fail, as full of liquidity but unable to reach the pretty cows on the other side of the fence.“His speeches have regularly been the most eloquent — a true joy to read his somewhat excessive Texas exuberance in explaining both the successes and the possible excesses of monetary policy,” the former Fed chairman Paul A. Volcker, a mentor to Mr. Fisher, said in a recent introduction. Continue reading the main story

Noting that Mr. Fisher was the rare non-economist among senior Fed officials, Mr. Volcker continued: “In an era in which economists claim a natural right to central banking leadership, Dick has brought a healthy sense of reality, sound judgment, business background and leadership.”

Richard W. Fisher, the most outspoken internal opponent of the Fed’s stimulus campaign, talks with Rick Santelli of CNBC about “lazy” traders.

But Mr. Fisher also has angered those who think the Fed can and should do more to help unemployed workers.“He was wrong at the beginning, and he’s still wrong now,” said Danny Cendejas of the Texas Organizing Project, a nonprofit group that advocates for lower-income Texans. “He’s ignoring the reality of what’s happening, particularly in the Latino community and in communities of color.”

At the Fed, Mr. Fisher was set apart by his views and his style. He kept a list of roughly 50 executives at corporations ranging from Walmart to American Airlines to “the Bud distributor in North Texas,” and he called several dozen before each Fed meeting. He insisted that those anecdotal reports offered a more accurate and timely window onto the economy than government data and the Fed’s elaborate models.“My local dry cleaner, I would say that if you took him and put him against the whole Fed staff in terms of forecasting, he’s been far more accurate,” Mr. Fisher said.Mr. Fisher now worries that the Fed is waiting too long to raise rates and that its efforts to assist the recovery instead will cause another downturn. He said the consequences of the Fed’s stimulus campaign would not be clear for some time.“How long?” he said, repeating a question. “No idea. And I hope my concerns, which are only expressed as uncertainties, prove to be sleep lost and nothing more.”These warnings have made Mr. Fisher a popular figure among the Fed’s Republican critics, who also insist that the Fed’s attempts to expand employment are doing more harm than good. So did a February speech in which Mr. Fisher told a New York audience that the Fed should change its governance structure to limit the outsize role of the New York Fed.But Mr. Fisher has spoken sharply against calls from Republican lawmakers for new restrictions on the Fed’s authority. He said he wanted the Fed itself to make better decisions.Mr. Fisher rose in Horatio Alger style from childhood poverty to marry the daughter of a prominent congressman and build a fortune of more than $20 million as an investor. He worked his way through Harvard as a cook and a crew member on the yacht of a wealthy alumnus, and by renting his dorm room to amorous couples. Now he sits on Harvard’s Board of Overseers.He was born in Los Angeles in 1949 to a Norwegian mother and an Australian father who met in South Africa and conceived Mr. Fisher in Shanghai before moving to California. A few years later, propelled by poverty, the family moved to Mexico City, where Mr. Fisher learned to speak Spanish fluently.

After returning to California, he won a scholarship to attend Admiral Farragut Academy, a preparatory school for the United States Naval Academy. After two years at Annapolis, a teacher encouraged him to transfer to Harvard.

He ended up in Dallas after marrying the daughter of a Texas congressman, James Collins. The young couple lived in New York at first, where Mr. Fisher worked as an assistant to the banker Robert Roosa. But Mr. Fisher says that one day, while on a ferry returning from the Statue of Liberty with his infant son, he looked across the water at the New York skyline and decided to leave.“I thought, ‘This place is already made,’” he recalled. “Things were moving my way, but I just thought, ‘This has already been built. I need to go someplace new.’”He made a fortune investing in distressed assets during the rocky years of the Texas economy in the late 1980s and early 1990s. After two failed runs for the United States Senate, he signed on with the Clinton administration as a deputy trade representative in 1997. He remained in Washington until 2005, when he got a call asking him if he’d like to come back to Texas to run the Dallas Fed.The Fed’s 12 regional branches together oversee the banking system, operate payments infrastructure and conduct economic research. Their presidents also participate in setting monetary policy. And the Dallas Fed has a longstanding preference for outspoken leaders.Mr. Fisher’s predecessor, Robert D. McTeer, was known for reciting cowboy poetry and for his disagreements with the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan. When Mr. Fisher took the job, he changed the hold music on the Dallas Fed’s phone system from country and western to classical.The Dallas Fed’s board has yet to select Mr. Fisher’s successor, but Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago, said it was a good bet they would pick someone with a strong voice. “They like to have people who are cowboys,” she said.He was one of the first Fed officials to raise concerns about the health of the housing market. Yet he was also among the last to understand the depth of the resulting financial crisis. He warned throughout most of 2008 that inflation was the primary danger to the economy — a threat that has still not materialized — and that the bleak pronouncements of other Fed officials were fueling an unwarranted sense of panic.In August, as the financial system teetered on the brink of collapse, he voted to raise interest rates, which would have made the situation even worse.

In December that year, when the Fed reduced its benchmark interest rate nearly to zero in a move to spur a recovery, Mr. Fisher cast the only dissenting vote. After the meeting, he decided the moment required solidarity and went to Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman, to change his vote.But Mr. Fisher said in the interview here that he had not changed his mind. He said the Fed should never have pushed interest rates below 2 percent, nor bought so many bonds.Like many of the Fed’s critics on the left, Mr. Fisher emphasizes that he is deeply concerned about the damage caused by the Great Recession. He says he simply does not believe the Fed is helping. He says holding down interest rates has mostly enriched the rich, like his own family.The middle class is being squeezed, he said, “but the Fed can’t fix that.”The Fed’s current chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, sometimes uses the metaphor of a car to talk about monetary policy. Mr. Fisher said he had frequently argued for the substitution of a ship “because there are no brakes.”He told of serving as a student at the Naval Academy on the U.S.S. Truckee, a tanker, as it collided with an aircraft carrier, the U.S.S. Wasp, in June 1968.“The scariest thing was watching all the other ships pull over the horizon,” he said, and then draws the metaphor: The Fed’s portfolio, which has swelled to more than $4 trillion, is “an enormous amount of explosive fuel” and the danger is “an explosion of inflation.”“My successors,” he said, “are going to have to be very careful in steering that ship.”

Biography[edit]
Early life[edit]
A first-generation American, Fisher was born in Los Angeles, California but grew up in Mexico. His father was Australian, while his mother was South African, of Norwegian descent.[2] Following graduation from Admiral Farragut Academy, he attended the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland from 1967 to 1969, before transferring to Harvard University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in economics in 1971. From 1972 to 1973, he studied Latin American studies at Oxford University. Completing his education in 1975, he earned an M.B.A. from the Graduate School of Business at Stanford University.
After returning to California, he won a scholarship to attend Admiral Farragut Academy, a preparatory school for the United States Naval Academy. After two years at Annapolis, a teacher encouraged him to transfer to Harvard.[3]
Career[edit]
Moving to New York City, Fisher joined the Wall Street investment bank Brown Brothers, Harriman and Company, where he was assistant to former Undersecretary of the Treasury Robert V Roosa,[4] specializing in fixed income and foreign exchange markets. From 1978 to 1979, he served as Special Assistant to Secretary W. Michael Blumenthal at the United States Department of the Treasury, where he worked issues relating to the dollar crisis. Returning to Brown Brothers, he established and managed the bank's Dallas-based Texas operations.
Leaving Brown Brothers in 1987, Fisher created Fisher Capital Management, and a separate funds-management firm, Fisher Ewing Partners, managing both firms until 1997. In 1993, he was a candidate in the special election for the U.S. Senate seat in Texas, which was vacated by Lloyd Bentsen when the latter became U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, but took fifth place in a 21 candidate field behind State Treasurer Kay Bailey Hutchison, U.S. Senator Bob Krueger, U.S. Congressman Joe Barton, and U.S. Congressman Jack Fields.
The following year, he was a candidate for the same U.S. Senate seat in the regularly scheduled election. Fisher came in second to former Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox in the Democratic Party primary, but won the ensuing run-off election. Fisher lost the general election in a landslide to incumbent Republican Kay Bailey Hutchison as she beat him 61% to 38%.
From 1997 to 2001, Fisher served as Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, serving under U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky, where he was responsible for the implementation of NAFTA, and negotiating a variety of trade agreements, including the bilateral accords admitting both the People's Republic of China and Taiwan to the World Trade Organization. From 2001 to 2005, he served as Vice Chairman of Kissinger McLarty Associates, a strategic advisory firm headed by former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and former White House Chief of Staff Mack McLarty. He left the firm in April, 2005, when he was appointed as President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, succeeding Robert D. McTeer in that post.
Transcripts of the Federal Open Market Committee May 2007 showed Fisher sounded the alarm on the housing crisis even as many of his peers on the Committee expressed doubts: “On the housing front, I have been bearish—more bearish than anybody at this table. I am more concerned than I was before. We can go through the numbers, but I think it is best expressed by the CEO of one of the five big builders, who said that in March he was arguing internally with his board that the headlines were worse than reality and now reality is worse than the headlines.” [5]
At the Dallas Fed, Fisher was outspoken in 2013 in opposition to the way quantitative easing was being pursued by Fed chair Ben Bernanke and board.[6]
As US equity markets began to unravel barely two weeks after Yellen's Dec. 18th rate hike announcement, Fisher came out on CNBC decrying the Federal Open Market Committee's decision to launch QE3 saying that he, "voted against doing QE3" and that QE3 was, "one step too far."[7] Fisher is also a member of Washington D.C. based think tank the Inter-American Dialogue.[8]
Personal life[edit]
Fisher is divorced from Nancy Miles Collins, the daughter of former U.S. Congressman James M. Collins[citation needed]. They have four children, including their son, actor Miles Fisher.

Item Description: ReInk Books, 2017. Softcover. Book Condition: NEW. Reprinted from 2012 edition. Volume: 81 Language: eng. NO changes have been made to the original text. This is NOT a retyped or an ocr'd reprint. Illustrations, Index, if any, are included in black and white. Each page is checked manually before printing. As this reprint is from very old book, there could be some missing or flawed pages, but we always try to make the book as complete as possible. Fold-outs, if any, are not part of the book. If the original book was published in multiple volumes then this reprint is of only one volume, not the whole set. This paperback book is SEWN, where the book block is actually sewn (smythe sewn/section sewn) with thread before binding which results in a more durable type of paperback binding. It can also be open wide. The pages will not fall out and will be around for a lot longer than normal paperbacks. This print on demand book is printed on high quality acid-free paper.

Biography[edit]
Early life[edit]
A first-generation American, Fisher was born in Los Angeles, California but grew up in Mexico. His father was Australian, while his mother was South African, of Norwegian descent.[2] Following graduation from Admiral Farragut Academy, he attended the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland from 1967 to 1969, before transferring to Harvard University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in economics in 1971. From 1972 to 1973, he studied Latin American studies at Oxford University. Completing his education in 1975, he earned an M.B.A. from the Graduate School of Business at Stanford University.
After returning to California, he won a scholarship to attend Admiral Farragut Academy, a preparatory school for the United States Naval Academy. After two years at Annapolis, a teacher encouraged him to transfer to Harvard.[3]
Career[edit]
Moving to New York City, Fisher joined the Wall Street investment bank Brown Brothers, Harriman and Company, where he was assistant to former Undersecretary of the Treasury Robert V Roosa,[4] specializing in fixed income and foreign exchange markets. From 1978 to 1979, he served as Special Assistant to Secretary W. Michael Blumenthal at the United States Department of the Treasury, where he worked issues relating to the dollar crisis. Returning to Brown Brothers, he established and managed the bank's Dallas-based Texas operations.
Leaving Brown Brothers in 1987, Fisher created Fisher Capital Management, and a separate funds-management firm, Fisher Ewing Partners, managing both firms until 1997. In 1993, he was a candidate in the special election for the U.S. Senate seat in Texas, which was vacated by Lloyd Bentsen when the latter became U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, but took fifth place in a 21 candidate field behind State Treasurer Kay Bailey Hutchison, U.S. Senator Bob Krueger, U.S. Congressman Joe Barton, and U.S. Congressman Jack Fields.
The following year, he was a candidate for the same U.S. Senate seat in the regularly scheduled election. Fisher came in second to former Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox in the Democratic Party primary, but won the ensuing run-off election. Fisher lost the general election in a landslide to incumbent Republican Kay Bailey Hutchison as she beat him 61% to 38%.
From 1997 to 2001, Fisher served as Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, serving under U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky, where he was responsible for the implementation of NAFTA, and negotiating a variety of trade agreements, including the bilateral accords admitting both the People's Republic of China and Taiwan to the World Trade Organization. From 2001 to 2005, he served as Vice Chairman of Kissinger McLarty Associates, a strategic advisory firm headed by former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and former White House Chief of Staff Mack McLarty. He left the firm in April, 2005, when he was appointed as President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, succeeding Robert D. McTeer in that post.
Transcripts of the Federal Open Market Committee May 2007 showed Fisher sounded the alarm on the housing crisis even as many of his peers on the Committee expressed doubts: “On the housing front, I have been bearish—more bearish than anybody at this table. I am more concerned than I was before. We can go through the numbers, but I think it is best expressed by the CEO of one of the five big builders, who said that in March he was arguing internally with his board that the headlines were worse than reality and now reality is worse than the headlines.” [5]
At the Dallas Fed, Fisher was outspoken in 2013 in opposition to the way quantitative easing was being pursued by Fed chair Ben Bernanke and board.[6]
As US equity markets began to unravel barely two weeks after Yellen's Dec. 18th rate hike announcement, Fisher came out on CNBC decrying the Federal Open Market Committee's decision to launch QE3 saying that he, "voted against doing QE3" and that QE3 was, "one step too far."[7] Fisher is also a member of Washington D.C. based think tank the Inter-American Dialogue.[8]
Personal life[edit]
Fisher is divorced from Nancy Miles Collins, the daughter of former U.S. Congressman James M. Collins[citation needed]. They have four children, including their son, actor Miles Fisher.

Biography[edit]
Early life[edit]
A first-generation American, Fisher was born in Los Angeles, California but grew up in Mexico. His father was Australian, while his mother was South African, of Norwegian descent.[2] Following graduation from Admiral Farragut Academy, he attended the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland from 1967 to 1969, before transferring to Harvard University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in economics in 1971. From 1972 to 1973, he studied Latin American studies at Oxford University. Completing his education in 1975, he earned an M.B.A. from the Graduate School of Business at Stanford University.
After returning to California, he won a scholarship to attend Admiral Farragut Academy, a preparatory school for the United States Naval Academy. After two years at Annapolis, a teacher encouraged him to transfer to Harvard.[3]
Career[edit]
Moving to New York City, Fisher joined the Wall Street investment bank Brown Brothers, Harriman and Company, where he was assistant to former Undersecretary of the Treasury Robert V Roosa,[4] specializing in fixed income and foreign exchange markets. From 1978 to 1979, he served as Special Assistant to Secretary W. Michael Blumenthal at the United States Department of the Treasury, where he worked issues relating to the dollar crisis. Returning to Brown Brothers, he established and managed the bank's Dallas-based Texas operations.
Leaving Brown Brothers in 1987, Fisher created Fisher Capital Management, and a separate funds-management firm, Fisher Ewing Partners, managing both firms until 1997. In 1993, he was a candidate in the special election for the U.S. Senate seat in Texas, which was vacated by Lloyd Bentsen when the latter became U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, but took fifth place in a 21 candidate field behind State Treasurer Kay Bailey Hutchison, U.S. Senator Bob Krueger, U.S. Congressman Joe Barton, and U.S. Congressman Jack Fields.
The following year, he was a candidate for the same U.S. Senate seat in the regularly scheduled election. Fisher came in second to former Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox in the Democratic Party primary, but won the ensuing run-off election. Fisher lost the general election in a landslide to incumbent Republican Kay Bailey Hutchison as she beat him 61% to 38%.
From 1997 to 2001, Fisher served as Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, serving under U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky, where he was responsible for the implementation of NAFTA, and negotiating a variety of trade agreements, including the bilateral accords admitting both the People's Republic of China and Taiwan to the World Trade Organization. From 2001 to 2005, he served as Vice Chairman of Kissinger McLarty Associates, a strategic advisory firm headed by former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and former White House Chief of Staff Mack McLarty. He left the firm in April, 2005, when he was appointed as President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, succeeding Robert D. McTeer in that post.
Transcripts of the Federal Open Market Committee May 2007 showed Fisher sounded the alarm on the housing crisis even as many of his peers on the Committee expressed doubts: “On the housing front, I have been bearish—more bearish than anybody at this table. I am more concerned than I was before. We can go through the numbers, but I think it is best expressed by the CEO of one of the five big builders, who said that in March he was arguing internally with his board that the headlines were worse than reality and now reality is worse than the headlines.” [5]
At the Dallas Fed, Fisher was outspoken in 2013 in opposition to the way quantitative easing was being pursued by Fed chair Ben Bernanke and board.[6]
As US equity markets began to unravel barely two weeks after Yellen's Dec. 18th rate hike announcement, Fisher came out on CNBC decrying the Federal Open Market Committee's decision to launch QE3 saying that he, "voted against doing QE3" and that QE3 was, "one step too far."[7] Fisher is also a member of Washington D.C. based think tank the Inter-American Dialogue.[8]
Personal life[edit]
Fisher is divorced from Nancy Miles Collins, the daughter of former U.S. Congressman James M. Collins[citation needed]. They have four children, including their son, actor Miles Fisher.

Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas hosts African-American Professional Organizations




TweetSharebar
TweetBy Michelle London Bell
    Richard W. Fisher, President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas
Sponsoring organizations include National Black MBA Association – Dallas/Fort Worth Chapter, The Urban Financial Services Coalition, National Society of Black Engineers, National Association of Black Accountants of Dallas, and the National African-American Insurance Association of Dallas.
Representatives from the Dallas Federal Reserve were on hand to facilitate the event and ensure that each respective attendee was positively impacted by the experience, including Alfreda B. Norman, Assistant Vice President and Community Affairs Officer.  “The goal of this event was to create more visibility of the Fed amongst different audiences,” said Norman, “not just across the nation but of course to engage our immediate community, so I looked at this as a unique way to share intel with young professionals.”
The program included an introduction to ULGDYP by current President Anthony Murphy on how the event was initiated, as part of the “Economic Empowerment Movement” of the organization — consistent with its mission of promoting socio-economic equality.  Murphy then presented the overarching goals and intent of the evening – to gain insight into the Federal Reserve, glean an understanding of the impact of the Federal Reserve on the current economic climate, and go forth to create and develop opportunities for other professionals as a result of the knowledge acquired.
Following Murphy, Michael Demby of the Dallas Federal Reserve introduced the keynote of the evening, Richard W. Fisher, President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank                            of Dallas.  His account of the roles and authority of the Dallas Fed (the 11th District of the United States), was both informative and insightful and included:

Treasury Note identification 101


Little-known stats about Dallas’ central bank (the Dallas coverage area is comprised of Texas, parts of Louisiana and New Mexico, branches in Houston and San Antonio)


Currency printing operations for over 60% of US currency out of Fort Worth

Fisher provided a bare-bones breakdown on the roles of the Dallas Fed, which includes cash reserves for district banks, paying down the deficit, providing liquidity for the banking system, supervising close to 600 financial institutions, and providing financial literacy.
The most engaging portion of the evening included an in-depth Economics 101 discussion on Mr. Fisher’s role on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), chaired by Ben S. Bernanke. “There are 16 total members on the committee, with four governors who reflect political interests and the remaining representatives from each District to reflect ‘main street’ interests,” says Fisher.
The agenda of the day, every six weeks, includes each District representative stating their opinion of the economy and subsequently, what should they do about it – with the chief goal of controlling the Federal Funds rate to affect economic growth.  In short – “do we tighten monetary policy, loosen it, or keep it the same?” was the question Fisher cited as posed at each meeting.  He made it crystal clear that the responsibilities point back to economics and not politics, which is “up to the fiscal authorities.”
A quick history lesson took attendees through the end of 2007, through 2008, and 2009 – citing long periods of economic boom and expansion that led to false confidence, cockiness of the consumer, greed and lack of regulation.   Fisher emphasized how this cycle has been repeated throughout history since the Roman Empire.  “The chief job of the regulators is to keep a situation [like this] under control, and they failed to do so,”  he said.  The crescendo of the presentation was the poignant question – what do we do now to get the economy back on track?
The evening concluded with a Q&A session for Mr. Fisher, followed by a brief synopsis of each partnering organization in order to provide attendees with a glimpse of each group’s respective mission, upcoming events, and information on how to get involved.  Ms. Norman gave final remarks on the Fed’s community affairs and financial literacy initiatives, which include activities surrounding the Community Reinvestment Act, advocacy coalitions, and conferences and workshops on wealth and asset-building.

Great showing by multiple like-minded DFW organizations!
Not mentioned in the article, but very instrumental in spearheading this event on behalf of the Urban League of Greater Dallas Young Professionals was Professional Development Chair, Candice Day.
Kudos to her for getting the ball rolling for such a momentous event.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
