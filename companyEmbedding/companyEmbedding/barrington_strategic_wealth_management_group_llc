2016 Five Star Wealth Manager Award
      Diana Joseph/BSWMG honored as a five year winner (2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016) of Five Star Wealth Manager in the November issue of Chicago Magazine
Press Release � November 17, 2016

 11/9/16 WBBM Newsradio 780’s Kris Kridel interviews Diana Joseph for “Personal Finance Wednesday: Navigating Your Investments in a Time of Political Change”
      During the interview, Diana emphasized the prematurity of making big changes in client portfolios as a result of the Trump presidential win. “Now is the time to sit back and let the dust settle,” while creating an outline of possible moves with information that is known. Diana drew attention to interest rates and the impact of a rise in rates on savings, bonds, and mortgages. Diana also mentioned healthcare and biotech, energy, and defense as favored sectors under the coming administration.  In summary, Diana reiterated the importance of client asset allocations which were created with individual goals in mind, so portfolio changes would be made slowly and incrementally. The “Navigating Your Investments” section begins at the 20 minute mark.

Diana Joseph quoted in Barron’s
      Dow Slides 2.75%, Into the Red for the Year
      By JACQUELINE DOHERTY
      “This is the beginning of a little taper tantrum,” says Diana in the article. As the Fed’s quantitative easing program slows, investors are noticing the value of holdings in their portfolios more. Small caps, as measured by the Russell 2000 Growth Index, are down year-to-date compared to large caps, which are up.  The Russell 1000 Growth Index’s earnings multiple of 18 is significantly lower than that of the Russell 2000’s Growth Index at 30.  Large Caps are better priced for the moment; “valuation disparities are great.” With the Fed’s fund flows ebbing, the “anything goes” equity strategy has dried up. Hard commodities, large-cap stocks with growing dividends, and some munis have more attractive risk/reward profiles.

      Dow Drops 6.4% in Worst Week Since Fall 2008
By JACQUELINE DOHERTY
In view of the market's selloff, there are a number of companies that have financial metrics at or near the low-end of their 10-year range, says Diana Joseph, chief investment officer at Barrington Strategic Wealth Management Group. PepsiCo (PEP), for example, has price-to-book, price-to-cash-flow and price-to-earnings ratios that are close to 10-year lows, Joseph notes. Yes, there are concerns that the company has lost market share to chief rival Coca-Cola (KO). But it has exposure to the emerging markets and its growing nutritional foods business makes the company particularly attractive, along with its 3.4% dividend yield.

        There's Safety in These Numbers
By DIMITRA DEFOTIS
Procter & Gamble had a tougher time in this span, as earnings grew only 4%. But the company's exposure to faster-growing foreign markets, which account for 58% of sales, and its valuation at 15.2 times this year's expected earnings, make the stock attractive. P&G could generate total returns of 8% to 10% in each of the next five years, says Diana Joseph, chief investment officer at Barrington Wealth Management Group in Chicago.

Investment Philosophy
Asset Allocation / Diversification
Individuals, foundations and family offices can derive benefit from Barrington’s investment road map. The investment roadmap allows us to custom-tailor an investment program just for you. Asset allocation and diversification feature prominently in a tailored strategy. To be effective, asset allocation must be dynamic.

Asset Allocation
We believe that asset allocation is more important to overall performance and volatility reduction than almost any other decision. Each investor’s allocation is different depending on his or her combination of goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance. Your own allocation might utilize some combination of equity, fixed income, alternative strategies, cash equivalents and real estate-related investments. 
        




Diversification
      Diversification means achieving a blend of individual  investments within asset classes to accomplish a specific risk/reward goal.  To be effective, diversification should dynamically reflect the future probabilities, not look backward at the past.  These Asset Allocation Wheels are examples of allocations that may be appropriate for some investors at a point in time.  An investor’s particular goals, circumstances, and risk tolerance will dictate the appropriate allocation for that investor.  The Allocation Wheels are presented here only to reflect how diversification may look under a given set of circumstances.  All investments have some risk.  Some of these strategies have more risk than traditional investments.



DIVERSIFIED ALLOCATION EXAMPLE: December 31, 2016

     (click for larger view)



This grid of returns for nine asset classes features the best performing asset classes at the top and the worst performing asset classes at the bottom, of each year. Clearly, diversification reflective of the economic environment can moderate volatility.

What Makes Us Unique

We are a boutique investment management firm focused exclusively on helping our clients to reach their financial goals. We are known for our dedicated client service. 
 We are independent and do not have affiliated investment banking or brokerage arms which could conflict with our focus on our clients best interests.          
Our incisive written analysis of macroeconomic and financial issues provides the framework for asset allocation and informs sector and specific investment selections. Clients know where we stand on economic and investment issues.          
Our singular focus allows us to be decisive and nimble- attributes of particular value in tumultuous times.          
We work hard to earn our clients trust through a dedicated focus on their needs and integrity in our decision making.          
We offer multiple investment strategies which can be combined to meet each client’s goals. 

Our structure provides additional peace of mind for clients

BSWMG manages client assets. We do not hold them. 
          
Your investments are held at a custodian of your choosing, in separate accounts, held in the legal title of those accounts.              


You receive separate statements of holdings and confirmations of transactions directly from this separate custodian. 
          
This data flows into our portfolio management system which is reconciled daily by the portfolio management software firm with the data available at your custodian. Reconciliations are performed on a best-efforts basis. 
            The securities underlying your account’s performance are independently visible on the custodial statements so that anyone viewing them could ascertain their likelihood of generating the stated performance.                    


We do not receive commissions on the transactions made in your accounts. We are solely compensated via fees based upon your account’s valuation. 
          
Unlike some managers that charge fees and commissions, we forego the extra commission revenue to obviate any actual, as well as potential conflicts of interest in our investments for you.              


We do not have the ability to move money outside of your accounts in your name with the exception of management fees.  We do this for your protection and for ours.        
Integrity and transparency provide a true value proposition for the client.

FORBES TOP-RANKED TEAM

















People deserve to understand what’s happening with their money.
Have you ever sat across from a financial advisor and only understood every third word they were saying? And yet they were talking about your money, your life, and your future.
At Barrington Wealth Management, we believe clients should understand everything that is happening with their money; that advisors should be just as good about explaining investments as they are at making them.


What are you going to do with my money?


First, we’re going to get to know you and discuss what’s most important to you. We’re going to figure out your goals and the outcomes you’d like to achieve with this money. We’ll do this by establishing your Family Index Number, which is the rate of return needed on your investments in order to pursue those outcomes. After we determine your Family Index Number, we allocate your money to our various investment strategies designed to help you pursue those goals.


Can you handle the complexity of my situation? 


We work with a wide variety of clients – everyone from high net worth investors to those who are just starting out. While each family gets a personalized allocation strategy, we’ve helped thousands of families navigate their complex financial needs and guided them through life’s major decisions.


How can you make my life easier?


As your trusted advisor, we’re focused on adding convenience and simplicity to your lives. We will make sure you’re educated on your investments and how we manage your money – as much or as little information as you’d like.
Whether you’re investing hundreds or millions, at Barrington Wealth Management we’re about much more than results – we’re about helping you understand where those results have come from and why the strategy works. If you’re tired of the mystery of investing and want to know exactly what’s happening with your money, schedule an appointment today.

Three Reasons to Consider Active ManagementPublished by Brett Carson
Trends are pervasive in our culture, and the investment world is no different. The latest is the move towards passive investing using low-cost ETFs. Essentially, the argument is that nobody can consistently beat the overall market, so you’re better off owning a cheap index fund with the aim of just keeping pace with it.  Read more

Free commission offer applies to online purchases of Fidelity ETFs and select iShares ETFs in a Fidelity brokerage account. Fidelity accounts may require minimum balances. The sale of ETFs is subject to an activity assessment fee (from $0.01 to $0.03 per $1,000 of principal). iShares ETFs and Fidelity ETFs are subject to a short-term trading fee by Fidelity if held less than 30 days.



          1. $4.95 commission applies to online U.S. equity trades in a Fidelity retail account only for Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC retail clients. Certain accounts may require a minimum opening balance of $2,500. Sell orders are subject to an activity assessment fee (from $0.01 to $0.03 per $1,000 of principal). Other conditions may apply. See Fidelity.com/commissions for details. Employee equity compensation transactions and accounts managed by advisors or intermediaries through Fidelity Clearing and Custody Solutions are subject to different commission schedules.


          2. Fidelity commissioned Corporate Insight to study bond pricing, available online, for self-directed retail investors from five brokers that offer corporate and municipal bonds. The study compared online bond prices for over 20,000 municipal and corporate inventory matches between September 2nd and October 6th, 2015. It compared municipal and corporate inventories offered online. The study found on average that four competitors that bundled their markups or fees into their online bond prices were asking an average of $13.65 more per bond. Corporate Insight determined the average cost differential by calculating the difference between the costs of matching corporate and municipal bond inventory at Fidelity vs. these markup-based firms in the study, then averaging the differences across all of the competitor firms. For the table, the example competitor trade costs range of $240 - $510 is based on an average size order of $22,000 face or par value bonds and average cost differential between Fidelity and the four selected competitors displayed in the table. Year to date, through September 2015, Fidelity's retail brokerage account holders who purchased individual municipal or corporate bonds, purchased an average of 22 bonds per transaction.
	
    

          3.
	
	
	       
					
Minimum concessions of $19.95 apply if traded with a Fidelity representative. For U.S. Treasury purchases traded with a Fidelity representative, a flat charge of $19.95 per trade applies. A $250 maximum applies to all trades, reduced to a $50 maximum for bonds maturing in one year or less. Fixed income trading requires a Fidelity brokerage account with a minimum opening balance of $2,500. Rates are for U.S. dollar–denominated bonds; additional fees and minimums apply for non-dollar bond trades. Other conditions may apply; see Fidelity.com/commissions for details. Please note that concessions may affect the total cost of the transaction and the total, or "effective," yield of your investment. The offering broker, which may be our affiliate National Financial Services LLC, may separately mark up or mark down the price of the security and may realize a trading profit or loss on the transaction.



          4.
	
	
	       
        Other fees and expenses applicable to continued investment are described in the fund’s current prospectus.


          5. Fidelity® Tax-Managed U.S. Equity Index Strategy and Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios apply tax-sensitive investment management techniques (including tax-loss harvesting) on a limited basis, at their discretion, primarily with respect to determining when assets in a client's account should be bought or sold. For taxable accounts, Fidelity® Equity-Income Strategy may apply tax-sensitive investment management techniques on a limited basis at Strategic Advisers' discretion, primarily with respect to determining when assets in a client's account should be bought or sold. As a discretionary investment management service, any assets contributed to an investor's account that Fidelity® Tax-Managed U.S. Equity Index Strategy, Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios, and/or Fidelity® Equity Income Strategy do not elect to retain may be sold at any time after contribution. An investor may have a gain or loss when assets are sold.
	
    

          6. The advisory fee does not cover charges resulting from trades effected with or through broker-dealers other than affiliates of Strategic Advisers, mark-ups or mark-downs by broker-dealers, transfer taxes, exchange fees, regulatory fees, odd-lot differentials, handling charges, electronic fund and wire transfer fees, or any other charges imposed by law or otherwise applicable to your account. You will also incur underlying expenses associated with the investment vehicles selected.
	
    

Options trading entails significant risk and is not appropriate for all investors. Certain complex options strategies carry additional risk. Before trading options, please read Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options. Supporting documentation for any claims, if applicable, will be furnished upon request.


There is an Options Regulatory Fee from $0.04 to $0.06 per contract, which applies to both option buy and sell transactions. The fee is subject to change.



ETFs are subject to market fluctuation and the risks of their underlying investments. ETFs are subject to management fees and other expenses. Unlike mutual funds, ETF shares are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than their NAV, and are not individually redeemed from the fund.



For iShares ETFs, Fidelity receives compensation from the ETF sponsor and/or its affiliates in connection with an exclusive long-term marketing program that includes promotion of iShares ETFs and inclusion of iShares funds in certain FBS platforms and investment programs. Additional information about the sources, amounts, and terms of compensation can be found in the ETF’s prospectus and related documents. Fidelity may add or waive commissions on ETFs without prior notice. BlackRock and iShares are registered trademarks of BlackRock Inc., and its affiliates.


In general, the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk, liquidity risk, call risk, and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to loss.


          Fidelity Portfolio Advisory Service®, Fidelity® Strategic Disciplines, and BlackRock® Diversified Income Portfolio are services provided by Strategic Advisers, Inc., a registered investment adviser and a Fidelity Investments company. Fidelity® Strategic Disciplines includes the Breckinridge Intermediate Municipal Separately Managed Account, the Fidelity® Equity-Income Strategy, and the Fidelity® Tax-Managed U.S. Equity Index Strategy. Fidelity GoSM is a service provided by Strategic Advisers, Inc., and by Geode Capital Management LLC, an unaffiliated registered investment adviser. Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios may be offered through Strategic Advisers, Inc., or Fidelity Personal Trust Company, FSB (FPTC), a federal savings bank. Nondeposit investment products and trust services offered through FPTC and its affiliates are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, are not obligations of any bank, and are subject to risk, including possible loss of principal. These advisory services are provided for a fee.


          Brokerage services are provided by Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC. Custody and other services are provided by National Financial Services LLC. Both are Fidelity Investments companies and members of NYSE and SIPC.
	
    


Before investing in any mutual fund or exchange-traded fund, you should consider its investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus, offering circular or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.
