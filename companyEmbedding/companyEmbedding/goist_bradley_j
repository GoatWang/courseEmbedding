		Cott makes changes in North America, U.K.

Share This:










Bradley J. Goist has been named president of the North America business unit of Cott Corp.

TORONTO — Bradley J. Goist has been named president of the North America business unit of Cott Corp., effective June 27. He will succeed Steven Kitching, who will return to the United Kingdom to be the president of the company’s Cott United Kingdom/Europe business unit, a position similar to the one he previously held from 2008 to 2013.
Mr. Goist most recently was with The Kellogg Co., where he held various positions from 2009 to 2016, including senior vice-president and general manager of U.S. Snacks and senior vice-president of marketing and innovation for U.S. Snacks. Prior to that, he held several positions with The Coca-Cola Co. from 1996 to 2009, including senior vice-president and general manager of hydration and senior vice-president of juices, teas and emerging brands.
Mr. Goist received a bachelor’s degree in economics from the University of Michigan and a master’s of business administration degree from The Ohio State University.
“Steve was instrumental in setting a clear strategy for stability and growth in North America, with a significant focus on growing our contract manufacturing business,” said Jerry Fowden, president and chief executive officer. “We are very thankful for the many contributions Steve made to the North America business unit and are very pleased that he is staying with Cott on his return to his native United Kingdom to lead our United Kingdom/Europe business unit.
“We are excited about Brad’s appointment as president of the North America business unit. With 30 years of diverse sales, marketing and general management experience, Brad has the knowledge and expertise to lead our North America business unit. Brad and Steve will collaborate with the rest of the management team in the North America business unit in a phased handover of responsibilities.”
