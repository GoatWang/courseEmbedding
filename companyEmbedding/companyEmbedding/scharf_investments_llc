Overview
Why Stocks?
How We Invest
How We Communicate


Our mission is to add measurable value to client accounts over the course of a market cycle.


Overview
Scharf Investments is an independent registered investment advisory firm offering low valuation or 'valuation-sensitive' equity portfolios. We attempt to achieve this goal by  tracking relevant benchmarks in rising markets and losing significantly less than  benchmarks in falling markets.
Scharf Investments offers personalized services which may take the following factors into account for individual clients:

Asset allocation
Income tax status and tax management
Estate, gift, intergenerational and philanthropic issues

We operate on a fee basis, not on commissions. Clients can choose between the industry standard 'percentage of assets fee' or a profit-based performance fee. In each case our clients' goals and ours are the same — to make their assets grow. Clients are advised objectively, without many of the conflicts of interest prevalent in the investment brokerage community.

   Risks


Investment Risks
Investment in securities involves significant risk of loss. An investor in any of the strategies managed by Scharf Investments must understand and be willing to accept those risks, including the loss of a substantial amount of any such investment in securities. Those risks include the risk of changes in economic and market conditions, the concentration of investments within a portfolio, and the volatility of securities.
In addition, the material in this website includes forward looking statements based on Scharf Investments' experience and expectations about the securities markets and the methods by which Scharf Investments expects to invest in those markets. Those statements are sometimes indicated by words such as "expects," "believes," "seeks," "may," "intends," "attempts," "will," and similar expressions. The forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to many risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore actual investment returns could differ materially and adversely from those expressed or implied in any forward looking statements. Scharf Investments undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward looking statements for any reason.

Product Overview
Philosophy
Process


We seek to preserve capital in a down market.


Product Overview
Scharf Investments' objective is to add measurable value to client accounts over the course of a market cycle. We attempt to achieve this goal by  tracking relevant benchmarks in rising markets and losing less than  benchmarks in falling markets.
Our  performance during down market periods has been the key to our top 1% rate of return, alpha, sharpe ratio and downside capture since the beginning of 1991. During that period, we helped preserve capital by capturing just 54% of the S&P 500's decline during its negative quarters. 
We use a proprietary variation of low-valuation investing that we describe as "growth stocks at value prices" to construct a portfolio of 25–35 stocks with the capacity for predictable earnings. Our approach is style box agnostic; we select securities of various market caps, styles and, to a lesser extent, countries*. However, our predilection for earning predictability and mitigation of downside risk generally results in a portfolio with a mid-large cap, US-domiciled bias.
Our Multi-factor Analytical Performance (MAP) screen identifies stocks that we believe have appreciation potential of at least 30–40% over the next 12–24 months due to the exponential interaction of improved valuations applied to rising per share earnings, cash flow and/or book value. Integral to the strategy is risk management. We build and monitor Favorability Ratios — upside potential/downside risk — for each stock and seek to provide diversification by limiting exposure to individual stocks and industries. Many advisors and clients hire us as a large cap core or relative value manager. Some clients hire us as an all-cap manager.
* Non-U.S. domiciled stocks tend be ADRs and multi-nationals. We generally limit our exposure to international stocks to 0–25% of the portfolio.

Low Valuation — The Adviser employs a bottom–up, valuation–oriented investment strategy.  The Adviser believes that companies with low valuation ratios (low price to earnings, low price to cash and low price to book value) outperform stocks with higher valuations over the long term. 
Discount to Fair Value — Because value may not be easy to discern and may not be precisely quantifiable, the Adviser attempts to purchase securities trading at a significant discount to what the Adviser believes to be fair value.  By purchasing securities only when they are at a significant discount to fair value, the Adviser hopes to mitigate downside risk.
Investment Flexibility — Opportunities are not confined within style boxes. The Adviser searches for compelling investments in companies large and small, foreign and domestic. The Adviser’s proprietary screen applies across the investment spectrum.
Focus — The Fund will typically be constructed with the Adviser’s top 25–35 ideas at the time of purchase.  The Adviser believes that owning too many stocks can be counterproductive to enhancing the risk/reward profile of the Fund.
Long–Term Perspective — The Adviser believes that the appropriate measurement period for the success of its investment strategy is a complete market cycle; that is, from peak to the succeeding peak or a trough to the succeeding trough.  This may enable the Adviser to take advantage of opportunities that investors with shorter time horizons may overlook.




Equity Process
Through a proprietary screening process, the Advisor seeks to identify investments with low valuations combined with growing earnings, cash flow and/or book value which the Advisor describes as “growth stocks at value prices.” The Advisor regularly screens for stocks that satisfy its criteria. Generally only a small fraction of the stocks screened meet the Advisor’s criteria and qualify for further fundamental research. Such research consists of qualitative confirmation of the potential identified by the screen. This may include examination of a company’s annual reports and other shareholder materials as well as contacting the company’s management. Out of the stocks that qualify, the Advisor generally chooses approximately 25 – 35 individual securities.



Fixed Income Process
The Adviser seeks to identify fixed-income investments with favorable risk-reward characteristics.  In screening for suitable investments, the Adviser considers many factors, including yield–to–maturity, credit quality, liquidity, call risk, duration risk, and capital appreciation potential. Generally only a small fraction of the fixed–income securities screened meet the Adviser’s criteria and qualify for further fundamental research.  Such research consists of qualitative confirmation of the potential identified by the screen as well as an assessment of the underlying financial condition and prospects of the issuer. 
Please see the Funds prospectus for a more complete disclosure of the Fund’s investment guidelines.

Before you invest in the Scharf Funds, please refer to the prospectuses for important information about
    the investment companies, including investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. You may obtain
    a hard copy of the prospectuses by calling 1-866-5SCHARF (1-866-572-4273). The summary or statutory
  prospectuses should be read and considered carefully before you invest or send money. 
The Funds are offered only to United States residents, and information on this site is intended only for
  such persons. Nothing on this web site should be considered a solicitation to buy or an offer to sell shares
  of the Funds in any jurisdiction where the offer or solicitation would be unlawful under the securities laws
  of such jurisdiction.
Mutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is  possible. Some of the Funds are non-diversified, meaning they may concentrate  their assets in fewer individual holdings than diversified funds. Therefore,  the Funds are more exposed to volatility than diversified funds.   Diversification does not assure a profit, nor does it protect against a loss in  a declining market.  The Funds may invest in securities representing  equity or debt.  These securities may be issued by small- and medium-sized  companies, which involve additional risks such as limited liquidity and greater  volatility. The Funds may invest in foreign securities which involve greater  volatility; political, economic and currency risks; and differences in  accounting methods. These risks are greater for emerging markets. The Funds may  invest in ETFs or mutual funds, the risks of owning either generally reflecting  the risks of owning the underlying securities held by the ETF or mutual  fund.  The Funds follow an investment style that favors relatively low  valuations. Investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when  interest rates rise. This risk is usually greater for longer-term debt  securities. Investment in lower-rated, non-rated and distressed securities  presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher-rated  securities.
Book value is the net asset value of a company, calculated by subtracting total liabilities from total assets. 
   Price to Earnings Ratio is a valuation ratio of a company's current share price compared to its per-share earnings.
   Price to Cash Flow Ratio (“P/CF”) is a measure of the market's expectations of a firm's future financial health. Because this measure deals with cash flow, the effects of depreciation and other non-cash factors are removed. Similar to the price-earnings ratio, P/CF provides an indication of relative value.
   Book Value is the value at which an asset is carried on a balance sheet. To calculate, take the cost of an asset minus the accumulated depreciation.
  Price to Book Value is the ratio of the company's current price divided by the latest quarter's book value per share.
   Cash Flow is a measure of financial performance calculated as operating cash flow minus capital expenditures.
   Yield to Maturity is the rate of return anticipated on a bond if it is held until the maturity date.
   Duration is a measure of the sensitivity of the price (the value of principal) of a fixed-income investment to a change in interest rates.
   Discount to fair value is when a company is trading at a lower valuation to its estimated of the value of all assets and liabilities.

Research Reports. The Electronic Services make available analyst research and opinions ("Research Reports") that may be prepared by an Information Provider or by various third party investment bankers or other entities providing analysis, research and opinions ("Third Party Research Providers"). We do not endorse or approve Research Reports prepared by Third Party Research Providers and only make such Research Reports available to you as a service and convenience.

The information in Alerts may be prepared and delivered by Information Providers. The information may be delayed. Neither we nor any Information Provider guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of information available through Alerts.
