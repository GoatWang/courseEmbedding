Southwest Georgia Financial Corporation Reports 6% Earnings Growth 
      for 2017 Second Quarter






July 25, 2017 06:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time



MOULTRIE, Ga.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Southwest 
      Georgia Financial Corporation (the “Company”) (NYSE American: SGB), 
      a full-service community bank holding company, today reported results of 
      operations for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2017. 
      Comparisons are to prior year-periods unless otherwise noted.
    

Second Quarter and Six-Month Income Highlights



        For the quarter, net income increased 6% to $1.1 million, or $0.42 per 
        diluted share, on strong net interest income growth of $439 thousand 
        to $4.3 million. Revenue growth was driven primarily by a $33.3 
        million, or 12% increase in average loan volume. Higher revenue more 
        than offset investment costs for expansion of the Company’s Tifton 
        operations.
      

        For the six months ended June 30, 2017, net income was up 3.9% to $2.1 
        million, or $0.84 per diluted share. Net interest income expanded 8% 
        in the first half of 2017, partially offset by a 6% increase in 
        overhead expenses primarily for people, processes and systems to 
        further market penetration.
      


Balance Sheet Trends and Asset Quality



        Total assets expanded 11% to $470.3 million at period end as 
        noninterest-bearing deposits grew 22% and interest-bearing deposits 
        were up 10%. Total deposits at June 30, 2017 were $391.2 million.
      

        Total loan growth of 12% reflects strong positions in the Company’s 
        leading markets. Total loans were $322.6 million at period end. 
        Continued discipline in underwriting standards resulted in solid 
        credit fundamentals, with year-to-date nonperforming loans to total 
        loans at 0.40% and net charge-offs to average loans at 0.12%.
      


Capital Management



        Book value per share grew 5% to $15.83.
      

        The Company has a Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio of 13.53%, a Common 
        Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of 12.59%, and a Leverage Capital Ratio of 
        8.96%, all measurably above the federal “well capitalized” standard.
      

        In June 2017, the Company paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.11 per 
        common share. Southwest Georgia Financial Corporation or its 
        predecessor, Southwest Georgia Bank, has paid cash dividends for 89 
        consecutive years.
      


      “We delivered another strong quarter highlighted by the continued 
      expansion of our customer base. On a year-to-date basis, earnings per 
      share have grown 3.7% and are on pace with last year’s record 
      performance even as we make significant investments related to our 
      Tifton expansion and growth initiatives,” commented DeWitt Drew, 
      President and CEO. “We continue to fortify our structure with technology 
      and talent as we grow into a larger organization. Construction is 
      underway on our full service banking center in Tifton and it is expected 
      to be completed in early 2018. In addition to the Tifton market, our 
      historic Moultrie market is doing well and we believe there remains 
      significant opportunity for growth in Valdosta. Importantly, we are 
      addressing these market opportunities while maintaining our exceptional 
      asset quality.”
    

Webcast and Conference Call


      The Company will host a conference call and webcast on Tuesday, July 25, 
      2017 at 1:00 p.m. ET. Management will review the financial and operating 
      results for the second quarter of 2017, as well as the Company’s 
      strategy and outlook. A question and answer session will follow the 
      formal discussion.
    

      The conference call can be accessed by calling (201) 689-8263. 
      Alternatively, the webcast can be monitored at www.sgfc.com.
    

      A telephonic replay will be available from 4:00 p.m. ET on the day of 
      the teleconference until Tuesday, August 1, 2017. To listen to the 
      archived call, dial (412) 317-6671 and enter conference ID number
