 History Our founders started the business in 1955 with the ownership of one gasoline service station in New York City and combined real estate ownership, leasing and management with service station operation and petroleum distribution.
We held our initial public offering in 1971 under the name Power Test Corp.
In 1985, we acquired from Texaco the petroleum distribution and marketing assets of Getty Oil Company in the Northeast United States along with the Getty® name and trademark in connection with our real estate and the petroleum marketing business in the United States.
Beginning on January 1, 2001, we elected to be treated as a REIT under federal income tax laws.
In late 2015 and early 2016 we completed a senior leadership transition and announced the recruitment of key employees to increase our management team depth, provide fresh perspectives and expand our in-house capabilities.

Ah, garages -- one of modern days' greatest necessary evils.  

When you get two flat tires at work and there's a Getty station down the street, what real choice do you have but to flop on in for service?

Well, who would have thought that shredded tires would lead me to the only shop in town that hasn't instantly charged me a vagina tax just for walking in the shop with one?

Gold, Jerry, gold.

The guys at Executive Getty were pretty straight with me, as mechanics go. 

I suggest getting your estimate in writing then checking over your receipt with a fine tooth comb before anteing up, but that's pretty much par for any service course.  Also, nobody called me when the work was done so I had to check in at the end of the day and wait unnecessarily.   But again, not unexpected; even at a dealership they're not exactly heavy on the follow-up phone calls.  

Dave, the general manager, was friendly and approachable. He checked out my entire electrical system searching for a problem (solving one of three) and charged me for a half hours work; I'm quite sure the task at hand took a good bit longer. Kenny was manning the desk and he was very helpful and personable.  He was also quick to provide me shuttle service to and from my office.
 
While taking the car in still isn't my idea of a good time, consider this lamb well sheared, as I would totally return to Executive Getty the next time I have problems with my car.  Which, let's face it, is inevitable.  *Deep sigh*







Argh, they no longer offer oil changes or any such services on Saturdays.  However, any service during the week requires an appointment....very inconvenient.







Horrible experience.  I used to work across the street so i went there for convenience.  That stopped once i realized how they were over-charging me.  To add insult to injury, the mechanics (who looked 20 yrs old) who were cleaning up when i came to pick up my vehicle, were very rude & acted like i was inconveniencing them.  They were very short with me.  I would NEVER go back.







I've been goiong there for 25 years... probably through various owners.  They always do great work and have occasionally told me I needed LESS work than I thought, or another mechanic thought, I needed.   I trust them...

Ah, garages -- one of modern days' greatest necessary evils.  When you get two flat tires at work and there's a Getty station down the street, what real choice do you have but to flop on in for service?Well, who would have thought that shredded tires would lead me to the only shop in town that hasn't instantly charged me a vagina tax just for walking in the shop with one?Gold, Jerry, gold.The guys at Executive Getty were pretty straight with me, as mechanics go. I suggest getting your estimate in writing then checking over your receipt with a fine tooth comb before anteing up, but that's pretty much par for any service course.  Also, nobody called me when the work was done so I had to check in at the end of the day and wait unnecessarily.   But again, not unexpected; even at a dealership they're not exactly heavy on the follow-up phone calls.  Dave, the general manager, was friendly and approachable. He checked out my entire electrical system searching for a problem (solving one of three) and charged me for a half hours work; I'm quite sure the task at hand took a good bit longer. Kenny was manning the desk and he was very helpful and personable.  He was also quick to provide me shuttle service to and from my office. While taking the car in still isn't my idea of a good time, consider this lamb well sheared, as I would totally return to Executive Getty the next time I have problems with my car.  Which, let's face it, is inevitable.  *Deep sigh*

Argh, they no longer offer oil changes or any such services on Saturdays.  However, any service during the week requires an appointment....very inconvenient.

This place not only has some of the cheaper gas in the area, but also a garage which seems to be quite good.  What I like is the fact that the mechanics all seemed older - i.e. very experienced, and not salesman-like as some younger mechanics seem to be nowadays.I took my car in for an oil change at 9am on a Saturday, they promised to have it done by 2pm, but would try for noon.  At about 12:10 I received a call saying the car was ready.  There were no comments such as "The car needs this or that flushed" or "We recommend this ridiculously expensive and wholly unnecessary service".  I greatly appreciated that, particularly given that my car is older and has over 100k miles on it, thus I'm always afraid that I'll end up spending $$$ on servicing it.  The oil change was also cheaper than what one pays at Jiffy Lube or the like.  I'll definitely return.

Horrible experience.  I used to work across the street so i went there for convenience.  That stopped once i realized how they were over-charging me.  To add insult to injury, the mechanics (who looked 20 yrs old) who were cleaning up when i came to pick up my vehicle, were very rude & acted like i was inconveniencing them.  They were very short with me.  I would NEVER go back.

I've been goiong there for 25 years... probably through various owners.  They always do great work and have occasionally told me I needed LESS work than I thought, or another mechanic thought, I needed.   I trust them...

Certificate Vignette

About Specimen CertificatesSpecimen Certificates are actual certificates that have never been issued. They were usually kept  by the printers in their permanent archives as their only example of a particular certificate.  Sometimes you will see a hand stamp on the certificate that says "Do not remove from file".Specimens were also used to show prospective clients different types of certificate designs that were available. Specimen certificates are usually much scarcer than issued certificates. In fact, many times they are the only way to get a certificate for a particular company because the issued certificates were redeemed and destroyed. In a few instances, Specimen certificates were made for a company but were never used because a different design was chosen by the company.These certificates are normally stamped "Specimen" or they have small holes spelling the word specimen. Most of the time they don't have a serial number, or they have a serial number of 00000. This is an exciting sector of the hobby that has grown in popularity over the past several years.

GETTY
REALTY CORP. ANNOUNCES

 

PRELIMINARY
FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE QUARTER

 

AND NINE
MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2010

 

 

JERICHO,
NY, October 26, 2010 --- Getty
Realty Corp. (NYSE-GTY) (“Getty” or the
“Company”) today reported its preliminary financial
results for the quarter and nine months ended September 30,
2010.

 

Net
earnings for the quarter ended September 30, 2010 increased by $1.2
million to $13.4 million, as compared to $12.2 million for the
quarter ended September 30, 2009. Net earnings for the nine months
ended September 30, 2010 increased by $3.5 million to $39.2
million, as compared to $35.7 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2009. Earnings from continuing operations for the
quarter ended September 30, 2010 increased by $2.8 million to $13.5
million, as compared to $10.7 million for the quarter ended
September 30, 2009. Earnings from continuing operations for the
nine months ended September 30, 2010 increased by $6.9 million to
$37.7 million, as compared to $30.8 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2009. The results of discontinued operations,
primarily comprised of gains on dispositions of real estate, was a
loss of $0.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2010 as
compared to earnings of $1.5 million for the quarter ended
September 30, 2009. Earnings from discontinued operations were $1.5
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 as compared to
$4.9 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2009.

 

The $2.8
million and $6.9 million increases in earnings from continuing
operations for the quarter and nine months ended September 30,
2010, respectively, as compared to the respective prior year
periods, were principally due to increased rental income and net
reductions in operating expenses. The $1.7 million and $3.4 million
decreases in earnings from discontinued operations for the quarter
and nine months ended September 30, 2010, respectively, as compared
to the respective prior year periods, were principally due to lower
gains on dispositions of real estate.

 

During the
second quarter of 2010, the Company completed a public stock
offering of 5.2 million shares of common stock. The $108.2 million
net proceeds from the offering was used in part to repay a portion
of the outstanding balance under the Company’s revolving
credit facility and the remainder is available for general
corporate purposes.

 

Funds from
operations, or FFO, increased by $2.3 million to $15.7 million for
the quarter ended September 30, 2010, and increased by $5.9 million
to $44.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2010, as
compared to $13.4 million and $38.9 million for the respective
prior year periods. Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO,
increased by $2.5 million to $15.4 million for the quarter ended
September 30, 2010, and increased by $4.8 million to $43.8 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2010, as compared to $12.9
million and $39.0 million for the respective prior year periods.
Certain items, which are included in the increases in net earnings,
are excluded from the increases in FFO and AFFO. The increases in
FFO for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2010 were
primarily due to the increases in net earnings discussed above and
further below but exclude decreases in depreciation and
amortization expense and decreases in gains on dispositions of real
estate. The increases in AFFO for the quarter and nine months ended
September 30, 2010 also exclude non-cash adjustments recorded for
deferred rental revenue due to the recognition of rental income on
a straight-line basis over the current lease term, net amortization
of above-market and below-market leases and recognition of rental
income under a direct financing lease using the effective interest
rate method   which produces a constant periodic rate of
return on the net investment in the leased property (the
“Revenue Recognition Adjustments”) which cause the
Company’s reported revenues from rental properties to vary
from the amount of rent payments contractually due or received by
the Company during the periods presented.  The increase
in AFFO for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 also excludes
impairment charges recorded in 2009. FFO and AFFO are supplemental
non-GAAP measures of the performance of real estate investment
trusts and are defined and reconciled to net earnings in the
financial tables at the end of this release.

 

 

 

  

 

 

The
calculations of net earnings per share, FFO per share, and AFFO per
share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 were
impacted by increases in the weighted average number of shares
outstanding as a result of the issuance of 5.2 million shares of
common stock in May 2010. The weighted average number of shares
outstanding used in the Company’s per share calculations
increased by 5.2 million shares, or 20.9%, and 2.5 million shares,
or 10.2%, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010,
as compared to the respective prior year periods. Accordingly, the
percentage or direction of the changes in net earnings, FFO and
AFFO discussed above may differ from the changes in the related per
share amounts. Diluted net earnings per share decreased by $0.04
per share to $0.45 per share for the quarter ended September 30,
2010, as compared to $0.49 per share for the quarter ended
September 30, 2009. Diluted net earnings per share was $1.44 per
share for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009.
Diluted FFO per share decreased by $0.01 per share for the quarter
ended September 30, 2010 and increased by $0.07 per share for the
nine months ended September 30, 2010 to $0.53 per share and $1.64
per share, respectively, as compared to $0.54 per share and $1.57
per share for the respective prior year periods. Diluted AFFO per
share was $0.52 per share for the quarters ended September 30, 2010
and 2009, and increased by $0.04 per share for the nine months
ended September 30, 2010 to $1.61 per share, as compared to $1.57
per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2009.

 

Revenues
from rental properties included in continuing operations increased
by $1.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2010, and $4.3
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 to $22.0
million and $66.2 million, respectively, as compared to $20.8
million and $61.9 million for the respective prior year periods.
Rent received increased by $1.4 million for the quarter ended
September 30, 2010 to $21.7 million and by $4.3 million to $65.2
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2010, as compared
to the respective prior year periods. The increases in rent
received were primarily due to rental income from the thirty-six
properties acquired from, and leased back to, White Oak Petroleum
in September 2009 and, to a lesser extent, due to rent escalations,
partially offset by the effect of dispositions of real estate and
lease expirations. Rental revenue includes Revenue Recognition
Adjustments which increased rental revenue by $0.3 million and $0.5
million for the quarters ended September 30, 2010 and 2009,
respectively, and increased rental revenue by $0.9 million and $1.0
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009,
respectively.

 

Impairment
charges of $1.1 million recorded in the nine months ended September
30, 2009 were attributable to general reductions in real estate
valuations in 2009 and, in certain cases, by the removal or
scheduled removal of underground storage tanks by Getty Petroleum
Marketing Inc., the Company’s largest tenant. There were no
impairment charges recorded in the quarters ended September 30,
2010 and 2009 and the nine months ended September 30,
2010.

 

Environmental
expenses, net of estimated recoveries from underground storage tank
funds included in continuing operations for the quarter ended
September 30, 2010 decreased by $1.0 million to $1.0 million,

About Environmental, Social & Governance Summary (ESG)



GMI ESG Ratings


GMI AGR® Score & Rating






GMI ESG Ratings
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Flags:  GMI Ratings publishes Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) ratings on over 6,000 companies worldwide. These ratings provide an independent assessment of the sustainable investment value of public companies.  The ESG Ratings model is based on a carefully crafted and applied list of KeyMetrics® that result in an overall ESG concern level as expressed by Red (High Concern), Yellow (Average Concern), and Green (Low Concern) flags.  Unlike traditional ESG risk models, GMI's rating methodology is designed to identify risks most likely to affect equity valuations. Specifically, these ratings reflect actual corporate behaviors rather than policies or affirmations of intent to adhere to best ESG practices. Further, unlike other models with evenly weighted metrics, we assign context-sensitive relative weightings to our key metrics, based on market, regional, ownership or sector differences.  Individual company scores are then assigned as a percentile rank, ranging from 1 (worst ranked) to 100 (best) on the basis of these KeyMetrics® and then converted to the Red, Yellow or Green flag designation.
Company Reports:  In addition to a company's overall risk rating, ESG reports also include an industry rating based on a comparison between the company's risk levels in each ESG component area relative to its industry peers.  Further, the ESG analysis serves as a summary of behavioral events that contributed to the company's overall risk level.

 More About GMI



GMI Accounting and Governance Risk (AGR) Score & Rating
The GMI Accounting and Governance Risk (AGR) Score & Rating is widely recognized as an indicator of the confidence level surrounding a company's management and reported financials.
Scores range from 0 to 100, and correspond to a risk classification for each company ranging from "Very Aggressive" to "Conservative." The AGR Score is a percentile ranking among the approximately 8,000 companies rated by GMI. Through continued back-testing, GMI has demonstrated a strong correlation between its quarterly AGR Score and the likelihood of adverse events, including securities class action litigation, financial restatements, regulatory enforcement actions, and stock price declines.
				Thus, a company's AGR Score can help investors looking to manage risk or enhance investment performance. GMI forensically analyzes the financial reporting and governance practices of over 8,000 North American-based publicly traded companies.
About GMI
GMI is an independent risk research firm which provides a statistically modeled assessment of corporate integrity. Founded in 2002 in direct response to the growing number of scandals, lawsuits and investor losses resulting from fraudulent corporate behavior, the firm identifies potential high-risk company accounting and governance activity, which in turn has been historically correlated to stock price declines, securities class-action litigation, and material financial restatements. The product of GMI's analysis is a unique risk measure - the AGR Score which can be used by investors as a way to more effectively manage corporate risk.

† The Equity Summary Score provided by Thomson Reuters StarMine is current as of the date specified.  There may be differences between the Equity Summary Score analyst count and the number of underlying analysts listed.  Due to the timing in receiving ratings changes into the Equity Summary Score model, the Equity Summary Score analyst count may lag the ratings count displayed by one or more days.  There may also be analyst count variations for symbols with multiple share classes and ADRs.  More details on Equity Summary Score calculation are included in the Understanding and Using the Equity Summary Score Methodology (PDF).As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.

You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund’s sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to money market funds and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.

If you hold Fidelity Advisor Fund assets outside of your employer-sponsored retirement plan, accounts with such assets are not included in the list of Fidelity accounts.
Company Stock Funds are not mutual funds and are unmanaged, non-diversified investment options.

Managed Income Funds, Commingled Pools and individually managed options, such as Strategies, are not mutual funds. Although individual investment contracts purchased for a managed income fund are backed by the issuer of the debt, units of the fund are not guaranteed by the manager, Plan sponsor or insured by the FDIC.
A summary of the benefits provided under a workplace savings plan is contained in the Summary Plan Description for the plan. Full details are provided in the official plan document, which governs the operation of the plan. In the event that the content of a Fidelity Site or any oral representations made by any person regarding the plan conflict with or are inconsistent with the provisions of the governing plan document, the provisions of the governing plan documents are controlling. The information presented on a Fidelity Site is not intended to create, nor is it to be construed to create, a contract between (1) an employer or a Fidelity Entity and (2) any one of the employer’s employees or other plan participants.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/22/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

The net proceeds to us from this offering are expected to be approximately 
$      ($      if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase 
additional shares of common stock in full), after deducting the underwriting 
discount and our estimated offering expenses. 
  
We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering for acquisition of 
properties in the gas station and convenience store sector, repayment or 
refinancing of outstanding indebtedness under our credit agreement and general
corporate purposes. As of the date of this prospectus supplement we do not 
have any binding commitments or agreements relating to the acquisition of any 
properties. However, we review potential acquisition opportunities on an 
ongoing basis and may have one or more potential acquisitions under 
consideration at any point in time, which may be at varying stages of the 
negotiation and due diligence review process. Any such potential transactions 
are subject to substantial due diligence, the negotiation of a definitive 
purchase and sale agreement and ancillary agreements and the receipt of 
various board of directors, governmental and other approvals. Therefore, 
there is significant uncertainty whether we will be able to successfully 
enter into a definitive agreement and consummate a proposed transaction, even 
as to those proposed transactions for which we have entered into non-binding 
letters of intent. Depending upon the size of a transaction, it is possible 
that a transaction might impact our capital structure by diluting our 
existing shareholders or increasing our total indebtedness. It is also 
possible that such a transaction could have a significant impact on our 
financial results. 
  
We are party to a $175.0 million amended and restated senior unsecured credit 
agreement which expires in March 2011 that we utilize from time to time to 
fund our working capital needs, including acquisitions and capital 
expenditures. Subject to the terms of the credit agreement and continued 
compliance with its covenants, we have the option to extend the term of the 
credit agreement for one additional year to March 2012. As of March 31, 2010, 
borrowings under the credit agreement, were $149.2 million, bearing interest 
at a weighted-average effective rate of 3.1% per annum. The weighted-average 
effective rate is based on $104.2 million of LIBOR rate borrowings floating 
at market rates plus a margin of 1.25% and $45.0 million of LIBOR rate 
borrowings effectively fixed at 5.44% by an interest rate swap agreement, 
plus a margin of 1.25%. We had $25.8 million available under the terms of 
the credit agreement as of March 31, 2010. Affiliates of J.P. Morgan 
Securities Inc. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated are 
lenders under our credit agreement and will receive a portion of the net 
proceeds from this offering to the extent that net proceeds are used to pay 
down our credit agreement. We may re-borrow amounts repaid under our credit 
agreement with proceeds from this offering to fund future property 
acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes. 
  
Pending application of the net proceeds from this offering, we will invest 
such proceeds in interest-bearing accounts and short-term, interest-bearing 
securities, which are consistent with our intention to continue to qualify 
for taxation as a REIT.


The sector of the real estate industry in which we operate is highly 
competitive. Where we own properties, we compete for tenants with a large 
number of real estate property owners and other companies that sublet 
properties. Our principal means of competition are rents charged in relation 
to the income producing potential of the location. In addition, we expect 
other major real estate investors, some with much greater financial resources 
or more experienced personnel than we have, will compete with us for 
attractive acquisition opportunities. These competitors include petroleum 
manufacturing, distributing and marketing companies, other REITs, investment 
banking firms and private institutional investors. This competition has 
increased prices for properties we seek to acquire and may impair our ability 
to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms in the future.


Company Description
We are the leading publicly-traded real estate investment trust (“REIT”) in 
the United States specializing in the ownership and leasing of retail motor 
fuel and convenience store properties and petroleum distribution terminals. 
The operators of our properties are primarily distributors and


 retailers 
engaged in the sale of gasoline and other motor fuel products, convenience 
store products, automotive repair services and fast food. Over the past 
decade, these lines of business have matured into a single industry as 
operators increased their emphasis on co-branded locations with multiple uses.
The combination of petroleum product sales with other offerings, particularly 
convenience store products, has helped provide one-stop shopping for consumers
and we believe has represented an important driver behind the industry’s 
growth. 
  
As of March 31, 2010, we owned 909 properties and leased 155 properties. Nine 
of the properties we own are petroleum distribution terminals. Our properties 
are located primarily in the Northeast and the Mid-Atlantic regions in the 
United States. The company owns or leases properties in New York, 
Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Maryland, Virginia, 
New Hampshire, Maine, Rhode Island, Texas, North Carolina, Delaware, Hawaii, 
California, Florida, Ohio, Arkansas, Illinois, North Dakota and Vermont. Our 
typical property is used as a retail motor fuel outlet and convenience store, 
and is located on between one-half and three quarters of an acre of land in a 
metropolitan area. We believe our network of retail motor fuel and convenience
store properties and terminal properties across the Northeast and the 
Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States is unique and that comparable 
networks of properties are not readily available for purchase or lease from 
other owners or landlords. Many of our properties are located at highly 
trafficked urban intersections or conveniently close to highway entrance or 
exit ramps. 
  
The sector of the real estate industry in which we operate is highly 
competitive, and we compete for tenants with a large number of property 
owners. Our principal means of competition are rents charged in relation to 
the income producing potential of the location. In addition, we expect other
major real estate investors with significant capital will continue to compete 
with us for attractive acquisition opportunities. These competitors include 
petroleum manufacturing, distributing and marketing companies, other REITs, 
investment funds and private institutional investors. 
  
We are self-administered and self-managed by our experienced management team, 
which has over one hundred years of combined experience in owning, leasing and
managing retail motor fuel and convenience store properties. Our executive 
officers are engaged exclusively in the day-to-day business of our company. 
We administer nearly all management functions for our properties, including 
leasing, legal, data processing, finance and accounting.

Our tenants are responsible for managing the operations conducted at the 
properties they rent from us and for the payment of taxes, maintenance, 
repair, insurance and other operating expenses related to those properties. 
Our tenants’ financial results are largely dependent on the performance of 
the petroleum marketing industry, which is highly competitive and subject to 
volatility. As of March 31, 2010, we leased approximately 78% of our 1,064 
owned and leased properties on a long-term triple-net basis to Getty 
Petroleum Marketing Inc. (“Marketing”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of OAO 
LUKoil (“Lukoil”), one of the largest integrated oil companies in the world. 
Marketing operates the petroleum distribution terminals but typically does 
not itself directly operate the retail motor fuel and convenience store 
properties it leases from us. Rather, Marketing generally subleases our 
retail properties to subtenants that either operate their gas stations, 
convenience stores, automotive repair services or other businesses at our 
properties or are petroleum distributors who may operate our properties 
directly and/or sublet our properties to the operators.

------

Our founders started the business in 1955 with the ownership of one gasoline 
service station in New York City and combined real estate ownership, leasing 
and management with service station operation and petroleum distribution. We 
held our initial public offering in 1971 under the name Power Test Corp. We 
acquired, from Texaco in 1985, the petroleum distribution and marketing assets 
of Getty Oil Company in the Northeast United States along with the Getty R 
name and trademark in connection with our real estate and the petroleum 
marketing business in the United States. In 1997, we spun-off our petroleum 
marketing business to our shareholders as a separate NYSE listed company, 
Marketing. In 2000, Marketing was acquired by a subsidiary of OAO LUKoil, one 
of the largest integrated Russian oil companies. 
  
We are a Maryland corporation with headquarters at 125 Jericho Turnpike, 
Suite 103, Jericho, New York 11753. Our telephone number is (516) 478-5400 and 
our Web address is www.gettyrealty.com.

Ah, garages -- one of modern days' greatest necessary evils.  

When you get two flat tires at work and there's a Getty station down the street, what real choice do you have but to flop on in for service?

Well, who would have thought that shredded tires would lead me to the only shop in town that hasn't instantly charged me a vagina tax just for walking in the shop with one?

Gold, Jerry, gold.

The guys at Executive Getty were pretty straight with me, as mechanics go. 

I suggest getting your estimate in writing then checking over your receipt with a fine tooth comb before anteing up, but that's pretty much par for any service course.  Also, nobody called me when the work was done so I had to check in at the end of the day and wait unnecessarily.   But again, not unexpected; even at a dealership they're not exactly heavy on the follow-up phone calls.  

Dave, the general manager, was friendly and approachable. He checked out my entire electrical system searching for a problem (solving one of three) and charged me for a half hours work; I'm quite sure the task at hand took a good bit longer. Kenny was manning the desk and he was very helpful and personable.  He was also quick to provide me shuttle service to and from my office.
 
While taking the car in still isn't my idea of a good time, consider this lamb well sheared, as I would totally return to Executive Getty the next time I have problems with my car.  Which, let's face it, is inevitable.  *Deep sigh*







Argh, they no longer offer oil changes or any such services on Saturdays.  However, any service during the week requires an appointment....very inconvenient.







Horrible experience.  I used to work across the street so i went there for convenience.  That stopped once i realized how they were over-charging me.  To add insult to injury, the mechanics (who looked 20 yrs old) who were cleaning up when i came to pick up my vehicle, were very rude & acted like i was inconveniencing them.  They were very short with me.  I would NEVER go back.







I've been goiong there for 25 years... probably through various owners.  They always do great work and have occasionally told me I needed LESS work than I thought, or another mechanic thought, I needed.   I trust them...

This place not only has some of the cheaper gas in the area, but also a garage which seems to be quite good.  What I like is the fact that the mechanics all seemed older - i.e. very experienced, and not salesman-like as some younger mechanics seem to be nowadays.I took my car in for an oil change at 9am on a Saturday, they promised to have it done by 2pm, but would try for noon.  At about 12:10 I received a call saying the car was ready.  There were no comments such as "The car needs this or that flushed" or "We recommend this ridiculously expensive and wholly unnecessary service".  I greatly appreciated that, particularly given that my car is older and has over 100k miles on it, thus I'm always afraid that I'll end up spending $$$ on servicing it.  The oil change was also cheaper than what one pays at Jiffy Lube or the like.  I'll definitely return.

Ah, garages -- one of modern days' greatest necessary evils.  

When you get two flat tires at work and there's a Getty station down the street, what real choice do you have but to flop on in for service?

Well, who would have thought that shredded tires would lead me to the only shop in town that hasn't instantly charged me a vagina tax just for walking in the shop with one?

Gold, Jerry, gold.

The guys at Executive Getty were pretty straight with me, as mechanics go. 

I suggest getting your estimate in writing then checking over your receipt with a fine tooth comb before anteing up, but that's pretty much par for any service course.  Also, nobody called me when the work was done so I had to check in at the end of the day and wait unnecessarily.   But again, not unexpected; even at a dealership they're not exactly heavy on the follow-up phone calls.  

Dave, the general manager, was friendly and approachable. He checked out my entire electrical system searching for a problem (solving one of three) and charged me for a half hours work; I'm quite sure the task at hand took a good bit longer. Kenny was manning the desk and he was very helpful and personable.  He was also quick to provide me shuttle service to and from my office.
 
While taking the car in still isn't my idea of a good time, consider this lamb well sheared, as I would totally return to Executive Getty the next time I have problems with my car.  Which, let's face it, is inevitable.  *Deep sigh*







Argh, they no longer offer oil changes or any such services on Saturdays.  However, any service during the week requires an appointment....very inconvenient.







Horrible experience.  I used to work across the street so i went there for convenience.  That stopped once i realized how they were over-charging me.  To add insult to injury, the mechanics (who looked 20 yrs old) who were cleaning up when i came to pick up my vehicle, were very rude & acted like i was inconveniencing them.  They were very short with me.  I would NEVER go back.







I've been goiong there for 25 years... probably through various owners.  They always do great work and have occasionally told me I needed LESS work than I thought, or another mechanic thought, I needed.   I trust them...

This place not only has some of the cheaper gas in the area, but also a garage which seems to be quite good.  What I like is the fact that the mechanics all seemed older - i.e. very experienced, and not salesman-like as some younger mechanics seem to be nowadays.I took my car in for an oil change at 9am on a Saturday, they promised to have it done by 2pm, but would try for noon.  At about 12:10 I received a call saying the car was ready.  There were no comments such as "The car needs this or that flushed" or "We recommend this ridiculously expensive and wholly unnecessary service".  I greatly appreciated that, particularly given that my car is older and has over 100k miles on it, thus I'm always afraid that I'll end up spending $$$ on servicing it.  The oil change was also cheaper than what one pays at Jiffy Lube or the like.  I'll definitely return.

I've been goiong there for 25 years... probably through various owners.  They always do great work and have occasionally told me I needed LESS work than I thought, or another mechanic thought, I needed.   I trust them...







Argh, they no longer offer oil changes or any such services on Saturdays.  However, any service during the week requires an appointment....very inconvenient.







Ah, garages -- one of modern days' greatest necessary evils.  

When you get two flat tires at work and there's a Getty station down the street, what real choice do you have but to flop on in for service?

Well, who would have thought that shredded tires would lead me to the only shop in town that hasn't instantly charged me a vagina tax just for walking in the shop with one?

Gold, Jerry, gold.

The guys at Executive Getty were pretty straight with me, as mechanics go. 

I suggest getting your estimate in writing then checking over your receipt with a fine tooth comb before anteing up, but that's pretty much par for any service course.  Also, nobody called me when the work was done so I had to check in at the end of the day and wait unnecessarily.   But again, not unexpected; even at a dealership they're not exactly heavy on the follow-up phone calls.  

Dave, the general manager, was friendly and approachable. He checked out my entire electrical system searching for a problem (solving one of three) and charged me for a half hours work; I'm quite sure the task at hand took a good bit longer. Kenny was manning the desk and he was very helpful and personable.  He was also quick to provide me shuttle service to and from my office.
 
While taking the car in still isn't my idea of a good time, consider this lamb well sheared, as I would totally return to Executive Getty the next time I have problems with my car.  Which, let's face it, is inevitable.  *Deep sigh*







Horrible experience.  I used to work across the street so i went there for convenience.  That stopped once i realized how they were over-charging me.  To add insult to injury, the mechanics (who looked 20 yrs old) who were cleaning up when i came to pick up my vehicle, were very rude & acted like i was inconveniencing them.  They were very short with me.  I would NEVER go back.

This place not only has some of the cheaper gas in the area, but also a garage which seems to be quite good.  What I like is the fact that the mechanics all seemed older - i.e. very experienced, and not salesman-like as some younger mechanics seem to be nowadays.I took my car in for an oil change at 9am on a Saturday, they promised to have it done by 2pm, but would try for noon.  At about 12:10 I received a call saying the car was ready.  There were no comments such as "The car needs this or that flushed" or "We recommend this ridiculously expensive and wholly unnecessary service".  I greatly appreciated that, particularly given that my car is older and has over 100k miles on it, thus I'm always afraid that I'll end up spending $$$ on servicing it.  The oil change was also cheaper than what one pays at Jiffy Lube or the like.  I'll definitely return.

Horrible experience.  I used to work across the street so i went there for convenience.  That stopped once i realized how they were over-charging me.  To add insult to injury, the mechanics (who looked 20 yrs old) who were cleaning up when i came to pick up my vehicle, were very rude & acted like i was inconveniencing them.  They were very short with me.  I would NEVER go back.







Argh, they no longer offer oil changes or any such services on Saturdays.  However, any service during the week requires an appointment....very inconvenient.







Ah, garages -- one of modern days' greatest necessary evils.  

When you get two flat tires at work and there's a Getty station down the street, what real choice do you have but to flop on in for service?

Well, who would have thought that shredded tires would lead me to the only shop in town that hasn't instantly charged me a vagina tax just for walking in the shop with one?

Gold, Jerry, gold.

The guys at Executive Getty were pretty straight with me, as mechanics go. 

I suggest getting your estimate in writing then checking over your receipt with a fine tooth comb before anteing up, but that's pretty much par for any service course.  Also, nobody called me when the work was done so I had to check in at the end of the day and wait unnecessarily.   But again, not unexpected; even at a dealership they're not exactly heavy on the follow-up phone calls.  

Dave, the general manager, was friendly and approachable. He checked out my entire electrical system searching for a problem (solving one of three) and charged me for a half hours work; I'm quite sure the task at hand took a good bit longer. Kenny was manning the desk and he was very helpful and personable.  He was also quick to provide me shuttle service to and from my office.
 
While taking the car in still isn't my idea of a good time, consider this lamb well sheared, as I would totally return to Executive Getty the next time I have problems with my car.  Which, let's face it, is inevitable.  *Deep sigh*







I've been goiong there for 25 years... probably through various owners.  They always do great work and have occasionally told me I needed LESS work than I thought, or another mechanic thought, I needed.   I trust them...

This place not only has some of the cheaper gas in the area, but also a garage which seems to be quite good.  What I like is the fact that the mechanics all seemed older - i.e. very experienced, and not salesman-like as some younger mechanics seem to be nowadays.I took my car in for an oil change at 9am on a Saturday, they promised to have it done by 2pm, but would try for noon.  At about 12:10 I received a call saying the car was ready.  There were no comments such as "The car needs this or that flushed" or "We recommend this ridiculously expensive and wholly unnecessary service".  I greatly appreciated that, particularly given that my car is older and has over 100k miles on it, thus I'm always afraid that I'll end up spending $$$ on servicing it.  The oil change was also cheaper than what one pays at Jiffy Lube or the like.  I'll definitely return.

Ah, garages -- one of modern days' greatest necessary evils.  

When you get two flat tires at work and there's a Getty station down the street, what real choice do you have but to flop on in for service?

Well, who would have thought that shredded tires would lead me to the only shop in town that hasn't instantly charged me a vagina tax just for walking in the shop with one?

Gold, Jerry, gold.

The guys at Executive Getty were pretty straight with me, as mechanics go. 

I suggest getting your estimate in writing then checking over your receipt with a fine tooth comb before anteing up, but that's pretty much par for any service course.  Also, nobody called me when the work was done so I had to check in at the end of the day and wait unnecessarily.   But again, not unexpected; even at a dealership they're not exactly heavy on the follow-up phone calls.  

Dave, the general manager, was friendly and approachable. He checked out my entire electrical system searching for a problem (solving one of three) and charged me for a half hours work; I'm quite sure the task at hand took a good bit longer. Kenny was manning the desk and he was very helpful and personable.  He was also quick to provide me shuttle service to and from my office.
 
While taking the car in still isn't my idea of a good time, consider this lamb well sheared, as I would totally return to Executive Getty the next time I have problems with my car.  Which, let's face it, is inevitable.  *Deep sigh*







Argh, they no longer offer oil changes or any such services on Saturdays.  However, any service during the week requires an appointment....very inconvenient.







Horrible experience.  I used to work across the street so i went there for convenience.  That stopped once i realized how they were over-charging me.  To add insult to injury, the mechanics (who looked 20 yrs old) who were cleaning up when i came to pick up my vehicle, were very rude & acted like i was inconveniencing them.  They were very short with me.  I would NEVER go back.







I've been goiong there for 25 years... probably through various owners.  They always do great work and have occasionally told me I needed LESS work than I thought, or another mechanic thought, I needed.   I trust them...

This place not only has some of the cheaper gas in the area, but also a garage which seems to be quite good.  What I like is the fact that the mechanics all seemed older - i.e. very experienced, and not salesman-like as some younger mechanics seem to be nowadays.I took my car in for an oil change at 9am on a Saturday, they promised to have it done by 2pm, but would try for noon.  At about 12:10 I received a call saying the car was ready.  There were no comments such as "The car needs this or that flushed" or "We recommend this ridiculously expensive and wholly unnecessary service".  I greatly appreciated that, particularly given that my car is older and has over 100k miles on it, thus I'm always afraid that I'll end up spending $$$ on servicing it.  The oil change was also cheaper than what one pays at Jiffy Lube or the like.  I'll definitely return.

Argh, they no longer offer oil changes or any such services on Saturdays.  However, any service during the week requires an appointment....very inconvenient.







Ah, garages -- one of modern days' greatest necessary evils.  

When you get two flat tires at work and there's a Getty station down the street, what real choice do you have but to flop on in for service?

Well, who would have thought that shredded tires would lead me to the only shop in town that hasn't instantly charged me a vagina tax just for walking in the shop with one?

Gold, Jerry, gold.

The guys at Executive Getty were pretty straight with me, as mechanics go. 

I suggest getting your estimate in writing then checking over your receipt with a fine tooth comb before anteing up, but that's pretty much par for any service course.  Also, nobody called me when the work was done so I had to check in at the end of the day and wait unnecessarily.   But again, not unexpected; even at a dealership they're not exactly heavy on the follow-up phone calls.  

Dave, the general manager, was friendly and approachable. He checked out my entire electrical system searching for a problem (solving one of three) and charged me for a half hours work; I'm quite sure the task at hand took a good bit longer. Kenny was manning the desk and he was very helpful and personable.  He was also quick to provide me shuttle service to and from my office.
 
While taking the car in still isn't my idea of a good time, consider this lamb well sheared, as I would totally return to Executive Getty the next time I have problems with my car.  Which, let's face it, is inevitable.  *Deep sigh*

Horrible experience.  I used to work across the street so i went there for convenience.  That stopped once i realized how they were over-charging me.  To add insult to injury, the mechanics (who looked 20 yrs old) who were cleaning up when i came to pick up my vehicle, were very rude & acted like i was inconveniencing them.  They were very short with me.  I would NEVER go back.







I've been goiong there for 25 years... probably through various owners.  They always do great work and have occasionally told me I needed LESS work than I thought, or another mechanic thought, I needed.   I trust them...

This place not only has some of the cheaper gas in the area, but also a garage which seems to be quite good.  What I like is the fact that the mechanics all seemed older - i.e. very experienced, and not salesman-like as some younger mechanics seem to be nowadays.I took my car in for an oil change at 9am on a Saturday, they promised to have it done by 2pm, but would try for noon.  At about 12:10 I received a call saying the car was ready.  There were no comments such as "The car needs this or that flushed" or "We recommend this ridiculously expensive and wholly unnecessary service".  I greatly appreciated that, particularly given that my car is older and has over 100k miles on it, thus I'm always afraid that I'll end up spending $$$ on servicing it.  The oil change was also cheaper than what one pays at Jiffy Lube or the like.  I'll definitely return.

Horrible experience.  I used to work across the street so i went there for convenience.  That stopped once i realized how they were over-charging me.  To add insult to injury, the mechanics (who looked 20 yrs old) who were cleaning up when i came to pick up my vehicle, were very rude & acted like i was inconveniencing them.  They were very short with me.  I would NEVER go back.







Ah, garages -- one of modern days' greatest necessary evils.  

When you get two flat tires at work and there's a Getty station down the street, what real choice do you have but to flop on in for service?

Well, who would have thought that shredded tires would lead me to the only shop in town that hasn't instantly charged me a vagina tax just for walking in the shop with one?

Gold, Jerry, gold.

The guys at Executive Getty were pretty straight with me, as mechanics go. 

I suggest getting your estimate in writing then checking over your receipt with a fine tooth comb before anteing up, but that's pretty much par for any service course.  Also, nobody called me when the work was done so I had to check in at the end of the day and wait unnecessarily.   But again, not unexpected; even at a dealership they're not exactly heavy on the follow-up phone calls.  

Dave, the general manager, was friendly and approachable. He checked out my entire electrical system searching for a problem (solving one of three) and charged me for a half hours work; I'm quite sure the task at hand took a good bit longer. Kenny was manning the desk and he was very helpful and personable.  He was also quick to provide me shuttle service to and from my office.
 
While taking the car in still isn't my idea of a good time, consider this lamb well sheared, as I would totally return to Executive Getty the next time I have problems with my car.  Which, let's face it, is inevitable.  *Deep sigh*







Argh, they no longer offer oil changes or any such services on Saturdays.  However, any service during the week requires an appointment....very inconvenient.

I've been goiong there for 25 years... probably through various owners.  They always do great work and have occasionally told me I needed LESS work than I thought, or another mechanic thought, I needed.   I trust them...

This place not only has some of the cheaper gas in the area, but also a garage which seems to be quite good.  What I like is the fact that the mechanics all seemed older - i.e. very experienced, and not salesman-like as some younger mechanics seem to be nowadays.I took my car in for an oil change at 9am on a Saturday, they promised to have it done by 2pm, but would try for noon.  At about 12:10 I received a call saying the car was ready.  There were no comments such as "The car needs this or that flushed" or "We recommend this ridiculously expensive and wholly unnecessary service".  I greatly appreciated that, particularly given that my car is older and has over 100k miles on it, thus I'm always afraid that I'll end up spending $$$ on servicing it.  The oil change was also cheaper than what one pays at Jiffy Lube or the like.  I'll definitely return.

Ah, garages -- one of modern days' greatest necessary evils.  

When you get two flat tires at work and there's a Getty station down the street, what real choice do you have but to flop on in for service?

Well, who would have thought that shredded tires would lead me to the only shop in town that hasn't instantly charged me a vagina tax just for walking in the shop with one?

Gold, Jerry, gold.

The guys at Executive Getty were pretty straight with me, as mechanics go. 

I suggest getting your estimate in writing then checking over your receipt with a fine tooth comb before anteing up, but that's pretty much par for any service course.  Also, nobody called me when the work was done so I had to check in at the end of the day and wait unnecessarily.   But again, not unexpected; even at a dealership they're not exactly heavy on the follow-up phone calls.  

Dave, the general manager, was friendly and approachable. He checked out my entire electrical system searching for a problem (solving one of three) and charged me for a half hours work; I'm quite sure the task at hand took a good bit longer. Kenny was manning the desk and he was very helpful and personable.  He was also quick to provide me shuttle service to and from my office.
 
While taking the car in still isn't my idea of a good time, consider this lamb well sheared, as I would totally return to Executive Getty the next time I have problems with my car.  Which, let's face it, is inevitable.  *Deep sigh*







Argh, they no longer offer oil changes or any such services on Saturdays.  However, any service during the week requires an appointment....very inconvenient.







Horrible experience.  I used to work across the street so i went there for convenience.  That stopped once i realized how they were over-charging me.  To add insult to injury, the mechanics (who looked 20 yrs old) who were cleaning up when i came to pick up my vehicle, were very rude & acted like i was inconveniencing them.  They were very short with me.  I would NEVER go back.







I've been goiong there for 25 years... probably through various owners.  They always do great work and have occasionally told me I needed LESS work than I thought, or another mechanic thought, I needed.   I trust them...

This place not only has some of the cheaper gas in the area, but also a garage which seems to be quite good.  What I like is the fact that the mechanics all seemed older - i.e. very experienced, and not salesman-like as some younger mechanics seem to be nowadays.I took my car in for an oil change at 9am on a Saturday, they promised to have it done by 2pm, but would try for noon.  At about 12:10 I received a call saying the car was ready.  There were no comments such as "The car needs this or that flushed" or "We recommend this ridiculously expensive and wholly unnecessary service".  I greatly appreciated that, particularly given that my car is older and has over 100k miles on it, thus I'm always afraid that I'll end up spending $$$ on servicing it.  The oil change was also cheaper than what one pays at Jiffy Lube or the like.  I'll definitely return.

Ah, garages -- one of modern days' greatest necessary evils.  

When you get two flat tires at work and there's a Getty station down the street, what real choice do you have but to flop on in for service?

Well, who would have thought that shredded tires would lead me to the only shop in town that hasn't instantly charged me a vagina tax just for walking in the shop with one?

Gold, Jerry, gold.

The guys at Executive Getty were pretty straight with me, as mechanics go. 

I suggest getting your estimate in writing then checking over your receipt with a fine tooth comb before anteing up, but that's pretty much par for any service course.  Also, nobody called me when the work was done so I had to check in at the end of the day and wait unnecessarily.   But again, not unexpected; even at a dealership they're not exactly heavy on the follow-up phone calls.  

Dave, the general manager, was friendly and approachable. He checked out my entire electrical system searching for a problem (solving one of three) and charged me for a half hours work; I'm quite sure the task at hand took a good bit longer. Kenny was manning the desk and he was very helpful and personable.  He was also quick to provide me shuttle service to and from my office.
 
While taking the car in still isn't my idea of a good time, consider this lamb well sheared, as I would totally return to Executive Getty the next time I have problems with my car.  Which, let's face it, is inevitable.  *Deep sigh*







Argh, they no longer offer oil changes or any such services on Saturdays.  However, any service during the week requires an appointment....very inconvenient.







Horrible experience.  I used to work across the street so i went there for convenience.  That stopped once i realized how they were over-charging me.  To add insult to injury, the mechanics (who looked 20 yrs old) who were cleaning up when i came to pick up my vehicle, were very rude & acted like i was inconveniencing them.  They were very short with me.  I would NEVER go back.







I've been goiong there for 25 years... probably through various owners.  They always do great work and have occasionally told me I needed LESS work than I thought, or another mechanic thought, I needed.   I trust them...

This place not only has some of the cheaper gas in the area, but also a garage which seems to be quite good.  What I like is the fact that the mechanics all seemed older - i.e. very experienced, and not salesman-like as some younger mechanics seem to be nowadays.I took my car in for an oil change at 9am on a Saturday, they promised to have it done by 2pm, but would try for noon.  At about 12:10 I received a call saying the car was ready.  There were no comments such as "The car needs this or that flushed" or "We recommend this ridiculously expensive and wholly unnecessary service".  I greatly appreciated that, particularly given that my car is older and has over 100k miles on it, thus I'm always afraid that I'll end up spending $$$ on servicing it.  The oil change was also cheaper than what one pays at Jiffy Lube or the like.  I'll definitely return.
