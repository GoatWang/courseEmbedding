Setting the Standard













 About Us 




You are hereHome » Company » About Us 






Leading Global Trade Management Software Provider
Amber Road is a leading provider of on-demand Global Trade Management (GTM) solutions. Our GTM solutions automate import and export processes to enable goods to flow unimpeded across international borders in the most efficient, compliant and profitable way. Our solutions use a combination of enterprise-class software, intelligent trade content, and a global trade network that connects supply chain participants such as importers, exporters, freight forwarders, customs brokers and transportation carriers.
Our business has benefited from an explosion in global trade volumes over the past ten years in the USA and Europe. Companies of all sizes and nearly every industry are pursuing low-cost-country sourcing strategies with suppliers located in places like China, India and Southeast Asia. Global trade volumes are also being driven by higher exports as companies seek new markets to accelerate growth.
The increase in international shipment volumes combined with a proliferation of country-specific trade regulations have led to a need for global trade automation. Governments around the world are increasingly adding more stringent controls to cross-border trade in an effort to boost revenues from duties and taxes, spur economic growth, protect national interests and improve security. Companies can no longer manage the complexity of trade compliance by adding personnel or using spreadsheets.




Global logistics has also become more complex. International shipments span greater distances, have much longer lead times and include more trading partners. A single international shipment can touch more than a dozen trading partners. Goods often fall into a black hole and don't emerge for as long as sixty days while in-transit. Shippers must deal with multiple languages, time zones, currencies, and modes of transport for each shipment. A mistake at any step along the supply chain can mean delays, extra costs, government fines and waste.
Amber Road changes the way companies conduct global trade. Many of our customers, including some of the world's largest enterprises, have automated their global trade processes for the first time with our solutions. We replace a combination of spreadsheets, ineffective home grown solutions, and manual processes with a comprehensive suite of products that automate trade from the time a purchase order is placed with an overseas supplier to the time a shipment is delivered. Our GTM suite includes products that manage transportation costs, optimize logistics, provide shipment tracking and visibility, ensure compliance with import and export regulations, and assist companies in the implementation and use of preferential and free-trade agreements.
Automating global trade requires more than software. It also requires trade content. Trade content includes harmonized tariff codes, restricted party lists, export regulations, import regulations, shipping documents, preferential duties and taxes, specifications involving free trade agreements, transportation rates, and sailing schedules.



 






















Why Amber Road?
Effective business leaders know that to stay competitive and grow, their organization must take full advantage of the global economy. But managing a global trade network is complex.
Our cloud-based platform handles all aspects of global trade including facilitating product development and global sourcing, automating risk & quality management and managing transportation, duty programs, import and export compliance and supply chain visibility.
 








Amber Road sources content daily from government agencies and transportation carriers in 147 countries. We then transform text-based regulatory legalese and complex transportation contracts into an executable, proprietary syntax that can be used by our software. Because content can change frequently, we constantly monitor and update it. Our content team updated more than 12 million records in 2012. We call our content Global Knowledge®.
Implementing global trade automation fundamentally changes the way a business operates. Paper is eliminated in favor of electronic documents, messages and alerts. Tedious manual processes, such as researching trade regulations, classifying goods against harmonized tariff codes, calculating duties and taxes, phoning transport carriers to solicit transportation quotes or shipping schedules, and chasing down shipment status against a myriad of carrier websites are all replaced with an integrated suite of Amber Road products. Our GTM solutions aim to achieve straight-through-processing, so that goods and their related shipping documents move with little or no management intervention. Further, using the intelligence gathered by our technologies, supply chain executives are able to optimize their global networks to achieve sustainable improvements and savings.
 


















Key differentiators include:  

Functional depth and breadth of Global Trade Management Software powered by trade compliance content


Trade compliance and supply chain visibility tools


One stop shop for software and content for over 145 countries


Enterprise Technology Framework which provides a flexible platform to best meet your organizational needs

 








We target our solutions for the largest enterprises in the world, as well as mid-market companies. Our solutions appeal to companies represented in nearly all verticals, including Chemical, Consumer Electronics, Consumer Products, Higher Education, High Technology, Industrial Manufacturers, Logistics and Transportation, Oil & Gas, Pharmaceutical, Retail and Software. We sell our GTM solutions through multi-year subscription agreements, and host our solutions in a highly secure, scalable datacenter with on-demand access.
We are headquartered in East Rutherford, NJ. We have offices in McLean, VA, Raleigh, NC, Munich, Germany and Bangalore, India. Our customers have deployed our solutions with users in approximately 80 countries who conduct trade across 147 countries.

World Leader in Cloud-Based Global Trade Management
Amber Road’s (NYSE: AMBR) mission is to dramatically transform the way companies conduct global trade. As a leading provider of cloud-based global trade management (GTM) software, trade content and training, we help companies all over the world create value through their global supply chain by improving margins, achieving greater agility and lowering risk.
We do this by creating a digital model of the global supply chain that enables collaboration between buyers, sellers and logistics companies. We replace manual and outdated processes with comprehensive automation for global trade activities, including sourcing, supplier management, production tracking, transportation management, supply chain visibility, import and export compliance, and duty management. We provide rich data analytics to uncover areas for optimization and deliver a platform that is responsive and flexible to adapt to the ever-changing nature of global trade.



 



 






















Global Trade Management Overview - Amber Road
With more and more companies engaging in global trade - importing and exporting goods around the world on a daily basis - the need has arisen for a platform that automates and streamlines global trade. Amber Road provides a single, on-demand solution that does just this.
 















Enterprise Technology Framework - A Powerful On-Demand Platform
The extensive capabilities found in Amber Road's global trade management software are made possible by an on-demand platform that unifies the offering with common code, data storage and schema. By delivering global trade management via the cloud, Amber Road gives customers the flexibility to access their critical compliance and global logistics processes from anywhere in the world.
 

 








GTM Software Suite
Managing successful supplier relationships requires a great deal of collaboration. Given the added complexity of global vs. domestic shipments - different languages and time zones, longer lead times, complex trade regulations - collaborating with foreign suppliers is even more difficult and more important.
 
Our GTM software suite is comprised of solutions to automate and manage business processes for:
 


Global sourcing




Risk and quality management




Production management




Global transportation management




Export management




Supply chain visibility




Import management




Duty management


 
By centralizing and automating these processes, Amber Road accelerates the movement of goods across international borders, enhances compliance and reduces global supply chain costs.
 
 

 












Global Knowledge®
Amber Road is powered by Global Knowledge®, the industry's most comprehensive database of trade compliance content and international business rules. Global Knowledge has been amassed by our team of in-house trade experts since we began offering GTM solutions. This team monitors and updates global trade regulations on a daily basis to ensure our customers have the data they need for the highest levels of import/export compliance and accurate landed cost calculations.
 

 








Cloud-Based Trading Network 
Amber Road has built a global trading network with pre-established connectivity to over hundreds of trading partners. The network's secure data communication services enable suppliers, forwarders, transportation carriers, and customs brokers to share supply chain information and alerts that are critical to the timely delivery of goods.
 

 








"Tyco needed a solution to optimize our company, speed to market, efficiencies and compliance. We found all of these capabilities with Amber Road.”

By delivering global trade management via the cloud, Amber Road gives customers the flexibility to access their critical compliance and global logistics processes from anywhere in the world.
 

 








GTM Software Suite
Managing successful supplier relationships requires a great deal of collaboration. Given the added complexity of global vs. domestic shipments - different languages and time zones, longer lead times, complex trade regulations - collaborating with foreign suppliers is even more difficult and more important.
 
Our GTM software suite is comprised of solutions to automate and manage business processes for:
 


Global sourcing




Risk and quality management




Production management




Global transportation management




Export management




Supply chain visibility




Import management




Duty management


 
By centralizing and automating these processes, Amber Road accelerates the movement of goods across international borders, enhances compliance and reduces global supply chain costs.
 
 

 












Global Knowledge®
Amber Road is powered by Global Knowledge®, the industry's most comprehensive database of trade compliance content and international business rules. Global Knowledge has been amassed by our team of in-house trade experts since we began offering GTM solutions. This team monitors and updates global trade regulations on a daily basis to ensure our customers have the data they need for the highest levels of import/export compliance and accurate landed cost calculations.
 

 








Cloud-Based Trading Network 
Amber Road has built a global trading network with pre-established connectivity to over hundreds of trading partners. The network's secure data communication services enable suppliers, forwarders, transportation carriers, and customs brokers to share supply chain information and alerts that are critical to the timely delivery of goods.
