Our Firm Building Enduring Relationships
















Barry Investment Advisors focuses on developing a partnership with you and your trusted advisors. Through collaboration, we customize planning and investment strategies that fit your life and help build a meaningful legacy.                                                                                       
Barry Investment Advisors’ roots go back 40 years to Providence, Rhode Island.  Joseph Barry completed his training during 1974 when the worries of the day were inflation, interest rates and impeachment. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had just dipped below 600!
In the 80s, Joe’s office moved to New Bedford, Massachusetts, bringing a major Wall St. firm to serve the affluent families residing in the coastal communities to the east and west of the city.
In November of 2007, Patrick Barry teamed up with Joe and founded the independent firm now known as Barry Investment Advisors, LLC. Today our team of eleven professionals serves over 400 families, many of whom are the children and grandchildren of clients that date back to those early years.

Questions & Answers
















Who are the members of Barry Investment Advisors, LLC?
Patrick Barry is the Managing Partner of the firm.  Joseph Barry is the Founder and Investment Analyst. Kate Alves' primary focus is investment advisory and Elizabeth Garvey and Andi McNamara are responsible for financial planning. Ann Sullivan leads our administrative team along with Katherine French and Lauren Lennahan. Whitney Holland is our Director of Operations. Sharon Elston is our Compliance Officer. Justin Neria is our Chief Information Officer and Tyler Craig is our Research Analyst.
As an independent firm, we have no corporate restrictions or influence regarding our recommendations.
What kind of service should I expect?
We understand the type and quality of service that high net worth clients appreciate.  While the delivery of our financial planning and investment advice is centered on regular reviews, we welcome your calls, emails, and meetings at any time.  Our significant investment in advanced technology has made available various methods of communication, including texts, emails, webinars, conference calls, Twitter and eMoney wealth management services.
Who will safeguard my assets?
Fidelity Institutional Wealth Services® is a leading provider of trading, custody and brokerage services to registered investment advisors, trust institutions, and third-party administrators.  The company is able to leverage the capital, resources, and expertise of the Fidelity organization, one of the world's largest financial services companies on behalf of its clients.  Other custodians are utilized when appropriate.
Are there any minimums to become a client?
For new relationships, there is a $2,000,000 minimum investment.
Will I have to pay any taxes if I transfer my account?
Most of your securities will be eligible for transfer without tax consequences. Your cost basis information will be retained.  We will hold new client positions that meet our criteria rather than replacing them to save on unnecessary capital gain tax.
What guidelines do you use for asset allocations?
Asset allocations are established according to your objectives and are set and rebalanced according to overall market valuations. We strive to follow the principles outlined in Benjamin Graham's The Intelligent Investor, Fourth Revised Edition, copyright 1973, by Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. We suggest companies with strong financials, purchased at low prices relative to earnings and book value.
What do you charge for your services?  
Our firm is compensated using an asset-based charge determined by the aggregate value of all household accounts.  We receive no other compensation.  There is no financial incentive to bias our advice.  The detailed fee structure is contained in our Wrap Fee Brochure filed with the Securities & Exchange Commission.   
Do you ever oversee an entire portfolio that also has allocations that are not part of the assets you manage such as private equity funds, hedge funds and 401(k) plans?
We include all of your varied assets and liabilities and consider all of your financial affairs in our plans. Our wealth management system aggregates assets with daily updates for all investment accounts that are accessible via the Internet. Estimates you provide are used for illiquid assets such as business interests and real estate. In addition to the balance sheet, we provide an electronic vault for document storage. With your approval, the other members of your financial team may be granted access to your accounts for review. The aggregated financial accounting includes the assets of hedge funds and private equity portfolios. While we are in no position to evaluate a hedge fund or private equity portfolio, we do advise that you avoid becoming too illiquid and hold reasonable expectations for the performance of your portfolio.

What Makes us Different
















Focus
Our team specializes in servicing the needs of affluent families. A number of our relationships span three to four generations. Our systems allow us to extend our advisory service to 401(k) plans and other outside investment accounts including corporate executive compensation plans. Our company’s growth is directly tied to the value of our clients’ accounts and introductions to their friends, family and colleagues.
The Review Process
Our systematic reviews over the phone or in person are the engine of our service efforts. Each review is agenda driven and productive, covering the financial plan and the investment portfolio in detail. Reviews assure the client a disciplined delivery of services. This does not preclude other interactions throughout the course of the year.
Discretion Advisory
The aim of our Balanced Global Value investment style is to achieve long-term goals. We utilize the best trading software available to ensure tax and liquidity sensitivities, to provide quick response time to the market, and to apply client customizations.  We aim to have low turnover in our client portfolios. 
Team Approach

Internal: Our modern office has been designed with advanced systems and physical collaborative spaces to facilitate client solutions.   
External: We enjoy frequent communication with our clients’ tax and legal advisors and make income and capital gain data available to CPAs to aid in the planning process.
Clients: The families we serve come from varied backgrounds and include business owners and executives. Clients are often a valuable source of information and insight. 

Financial Concierge
We encourage the use of the many conveniences of our primary custodian, Fidelity Institutional Wealth Services.  Automatic bill paying, direct deposit, money transfers and simplified charitable giving are but a few examples. Our website also provides direct access to our personalized wealth management service.
Fees
Our firm is compensated using an asset-based charge determined by the aggregate value of all household accounts. We receive no other compensation. There is no financial incentive to bias our advice. The detailed fee structure is contained in our Wrap Fee Brochure filed with the Securities & Exchange Commission.
Technology
The technological landscape is ever changing.  Having the best software partners enables us do more and be more creative in dealing with clients.  We work with Salesforce, RedBlack, Harvest Solutions, Hubspot, Advent Software, Capital IQ, among others.  The firm received the InvesmentNews Technology Award for 2013.

Our Firm Building Enduring Relationships
















Barry Investment Advisors focuses on developing a partnership with you and your trusted advisors. Through collaboration, we customize planning and investment strategies that fit your life and help build a meaningful legacy.                                                                                       
Barry Investment Advisors’ roots go back 40 years to Providence, Rhode Island.  Joseph Barry completed his training during 1974 when the worries of the day were inflation, interest rates and impeachment. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had just dipped below 600!
In the 80s, Joe’s office moved to New Bedford, Massachusetts, bringing a major Wall St. firm to serve the affluent families residing in the coastal communities to the east and west of the city.
In November of 2007, Patrick Barry teamed up with Joe and founded the independent firm now known as Barry Investment Advisors, LLC. Today our team of eleven professionals serves over 400 families, many of whom are the children and grandchildren of clients that date back to those early years.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
