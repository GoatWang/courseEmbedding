News>Retail & Financial Ingles Director Sells Shares
Jon Springer | Aug 27, 2013




































ASHEVILLE, N.C. — Laura Ingle Sharp, daughter of the founder of Ingles Markets here and a member of its board of directors, has sold nearly all her stock in the company, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

		Follow @SN_News for updates throughout the day.


	Sharp raised more than $352,000 through the sale of 13,999 Class A Ingles shares at prices between $25.15 and $25.23 per share in three open-market sales late last week. In late June, Sharp sold more than 10,000 shares.

	Robert P. Ingle II, the company’s president and chief executive officer, sold 1.5 million shares in late June.

	Robert and Laura Ingle are the son and daughter of the late Robert P. Ingle, Ingles Markets’ founder.

	Ingles Markets in June said its board had authorized the company to repurchase up to 4 million of its own shares, but it was unclear who the buyers were for the Ingles’ recent stock sales.
