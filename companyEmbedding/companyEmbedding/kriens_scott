Title
Chairman, Juniper Networks


Scott Kriens is an American businessman. He is chairman and former CEO of Juniper Networks.[1]
Early life and education[edit]
Kriens received his bachelor's degree (B.A.) in economics from California State University, East Bay in Hayward, CA in 1979.[2] As an undergraduate, Kriens fixed cars to meet expenses. Now he collects European sports cars. [3]
Career[edit]
Initially, Kriens served marketing stints with Burroughs, which merged with Sperry in 1986 to form Unisys and Tandem, now part of Compaq Computer, before getting the entrepreneurial bug at Stratacom. From April 1986 to January 1996, Kriens served as Vice President of Sales and Vice President of Operations at StrataCom, Inc., a telecommunications equipment company, which he co-founded in 1986. He was there for ten years until 1996, when Stratacom was sold for $4.5 billion to Cisco.[2]
After the company was sold, Kriens took time off to build a house and have a child. Then Crosspoint Venture Partners recruited Kriens to take the reins at Juniper. In October 1996, he moved as the CEO of Juniper Networks and continued in the top post until September 2008. Much of Juniper's market success is credited to Kriens as the CEO.[2][4][5] Juniper's stock defied market rising from $57 at the start of 2000 to an all-time high of $243 in mid-October in 2000.[2] When Kevin Johnson joined as the CEO in Juniper, Kriens remained as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the company and stays involved in setting the company's long-term strategy.[6]
He was ranked 463rd on the Forbes Executive Pay in 2006,[7] 478th in 2007[8] and 454th in 2008[9]
He was the overall U.S. Winner of the EY Entrepreneur of The Year Award in 2000 with Juniper Networks [10]

California State University, East Bay


Title
Chairman, Juniper Networks


Scott Kriens is an American businessman. He is chairman and former CEO of Juniper Networks.[1]
Early life and education[edit]
Kriens received his bachelor's degree (B.A.) in economics from California State University, East Bay in Hayward, CA in 1979.[2] As an undergraduate, Kriens fixed cars to meet expenses. Now he collects European sports cars. [3]
Career[edit]
Initially, Kriens served marketing stints with Burroughs, which merged with Sperry in 1986 to form Unisys and Tandem, now part of Compaq Computer, before getting the entrepreneurial bug at Stratacom. From April 1986 to January 1996, Kriens served as Vice President of Sales and Vice President of Operations at StrataCom, Inc., a telecommunications equipment company, which he co-founded in 1986. He was there for ten years until 1996, when Stratacom was sold for $4.5 billion to Cisco.[2]
After the company was sold, Kriens took time off to build a house and have a child. Then Crosspoint Venture Partners recruited Kriens to take the reins at Juniper. In October 1996, he moved as the CEO of Juniper Networks and continued in the top post until September 2008. Much of Juniper's market success is credited to Kriens as the CEO.[2][4][5] Juniper's stock defied market rising from $57 at the start of 2000 to an all-time high of $243 in mid-October in 2000.[2] When Kevin Johnson joined as the CEO in Juniper, Kriens remained as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the company and stays involved in setting the company's long-term strategy.[6]
He was ranked 463rd on the Forbes Executive Pay in 2006,[7] 478th in 2007[8] and 454th in 2008[9]
He was the overall U.S. Winner of the EY Entrepreneur of The Year Award in 2000 with Juniper Networks [10]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
