As Square’s Business Lead, Brougher will oversee the company’s growth operations including revenue products, international expansion, customer support, and partnerships. She was most recently the Vice President of SMB Global Sales and Operations at Google, where she led global teams in charge of acquiring, growing, and retaining small advertisers.
“Simple technologies have an outsized impact when they are made available to everyone,” said Brougher. “I love helping small businesses around the world find the tools they need to grow and be successful, so I’m thrilled to join Square which has made this its mission. I am very grateful to my colleagues and friends at Google for what we’ve achieved together.”
“Francoise is a perfect fit for Square,” said Jack Dorsey, co-founder and CEO of Square. “Her accomplishments in growing and managing large, global teams, and her focus on building simple, scalable solutions that empower millions of people, will have a huge impact on our company and our customers.”
Prior to joining Google, Brougher served as Vice President of Business Strategy at Charles Schwab & Co. for five years, and from 1998–2000 as the Chief Executive Officer of Ocean Gem Pearl Corporation. She also was a management consultant for Booz Allen Hamilton in Europe and the US, and early in her career worked in manufacturing for L’Oreal in Japan. Brougher earned a Masters in Business Administration from Harvard Business School in 1994, and a Masters in Engineering from Institut Catholique d’Arts et Metiers in France. She joined the board of Sodexo S.A., the global food services and facility management company, in January 2012.
Square’s recent growth has been fueled by international expansion and increased adoption by brick and mortar merchants. In Canada, Square’s first market outside the US, gross payment volume over the first six months is 90% higher per capita than it was in the US at the equivalent point in time.

  Mobile payment company Square
  announced today that it
  has hired Francoise Brougher, a former Google
  executive, to serve as the company's Business Lead. 

  Brougher replaces Keith
  Rabois who resigned from the company earlier this year after
  an employee accused him of sexual harassment. (Rabois 
  denied the allegations.)

  Square's CEO Jack
  Dorsey said in a statement Brougher was a "perfect fit for
  Square." 

  In her new role at Square, Brougher will be responsible for the
  company's growth operations including its revenue products,
  international expansion, customer support, and partnerships.

  Before joining Square, Brougher was vice president of small
  business global sales and operations at Google in the online
  advertising space. Brougher worked at Google for about eight
  years.





  Before joining Google she was an executive at Charles
  Schwab and prior to that, CEO at Ocean Gem, a wholesale pearl
  company.

  Brougher received her MBA from Harvard Business School in
  1994, and a Masters in Engineering from Institut
  Catholique d’Arts et Metiers in France.

Square Hires Former Google SMB Of Global Sales and Operations, Francoise Brougher, As Business Lead

Square has announced the hiring of a new Business Lead, Francoise Brougher, and she comes straight from spending eight years at Google. For the past three years, Brougher held the title of SMB Global Sales and Operations for the online advertising unit at Google.
Although Square has grown its footprint considerably, in part because of its high-profile partnership with Starbucks, the company has yet to announce its plans to address the international market. Today, the service is only available in the U.S. and Canada, which has allowed a plethora of competitors to thrive overseas, especially in European markets where companies like iZettle,  SumUp,Payleven, mPowa and Intuit have already launched.
Here’s what Square co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey had to say about the hiring:
Francoise is a perfect fit for Square. Her accomplishments in growing and managing large, global teams, and her focus on building simple, scalable solutions that empower millions of people, will have a huge impact on our company and our customers.
According to Brougher’s LinkedIn page, she had a hand in advertising operations for all of Google’s online advertisers, policy, quality and ad approvals as well as working on fraud and risk. These are skills that are going to come in handy for Square’s payment processing team.
Brougher’s reason for leaving Google and joining Square is to spend time helping small businesses “find the tools they need to grow and be successful.” She went on to thank her former colleagues at Google for “what we’ve achieved together.” Broughner played a huge role in bringing in advertisers to the system very early on, which now counts for revenue that allows Google to build out all of its moonshot ideas. She’ll be helping Square with customer support and partnerships, in addition to growing out the company internationally.
Prior to Google, Brougher spent four years at Charles Schwab as Vice President of the Business Strategy group.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/27/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.

Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.
