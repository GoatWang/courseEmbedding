The New York Post reports that NBA star Shaquille “Shaq” O’Neal is backing M7, a line of tablets by Monster Products sold on Walmart.com. “I’ve been a music fan all my life, and in the mid-’90s when I was spending time in music studios, every top producer was using Monster equipment,” Shaq told the newspaper.
It’s just the latest product endorsed by Shaq, who reportedly earned $292 million over his 19-season career. Below are a few of his favorite things:
Chris Christie (2013): The Republican Governor of New Jersey, who won re-election Tuesday, is “a good man. Excuse me, he’s a great man” with the best education agenda, Shaq said in a 30-second ad last month.

Cream Soda (2013): “SODA SHAQ,” a line of cream sodas by AriZona beverages with the tagline “A Big Can for the Big Man.”

PRNewsFoto / Rexam

Buick LaCrosse (2013): Emerging from this “luxurious, yet fuel-efficient” car, he leans back and exclaims, “Like my Mom said the day I was born, ‘Wow! That’s a lot more than I expected!'”

Icy Hot: The athlete is the first thing you see on the pain reliever’s website.

Reebok: Shaq is known for his “1992 Classic Shaq Attaq” and “1995 Classic Shaqnosis” sneakers, relaunched this year.

The Original Soup Man (2012): NBA star teamed up with the company made famous by Seinfeld to promote Shaq-A-Roni ‘n Meatballs and Shaq ‘n Cheese, both reportedly low in sodium and fat, as part of a healthy school lunches initiative. He also handed out samples to advertise Soup Man’s new product line in supermarkets nationwide.

Comcast (2009): He floated the idea of doing a movie with actor and economist Ben Stein called “Shaq ‘n’ Stein,” in a Western-themed spot for the cable provider.

vitaminwater (2008): In this Super Bowl ad, the beverage transformed the basketball player into an overzealous jockey competing in a horse race.

Radio Shack (2003): Shaq used his 7-foot height to tout big names in small, personal electronics at the gadgets store.

Burger King (2002): Shaq parodied Isaac Hayes’s “Theme from Shaft” to promote the first celebrity-endorsed Burger King Value Meal, a grilled sourdough bacon cheeseburger, fries with cheese dipping sauce, and a soft drink. Tagline: “the man who can jam over any man…Shaq!”

Taco Bell (1997): Shaq raised awareness about “Taco Neck Syndrome,” which comes from tilting the head sideways in an effort to inhale all of the taco’s contents before they fall out. The National Spasmodic Torticollis Association called it insensitive and said people shouldn’t make fun of a serious condition like chronic neck pain.

Pepsi (1993): He’s king of the court in this commercial, where he tries to take candy from a baby.

Florida's Neal Communities Reports Record 2016
Closes 1,129 homes in its best year to date.


Neal Communities, a private home builder in southwest Florida, broke all previous company sales records in 2016, ending the year with 1,109 sales and 1,129 closings in communities spanning from Hillsborough to Collier Counties, the company said. This marks a 13 percent increase in closings from 2015, totaling over $430 million in closings."Our success is a direct testament to our dedicated, passionate team and its strong leadership and vast experience," said Pat Neal, CEO and chairman at Neal Communities. "I am continually humbled and impressed by our team's integrity and dedication to providing the best product, value and customer service in the business."




Dick Dickinson
The Neal management team: Randy Turkovics, Pat Neal, Charlene Neal, Michael Storey and Michael Greenberg.



 Randy Turkovics, Pat Neal, Charlene Neal, Michael Storey and Michael GreenbergRandy Turkovics, Pat Neal, Charlene Neal, Michael Storey and Michael GreenbergNeal Communities opened six new communities in 2016 and hired 31 new team members, continuing its seventh consecutive year of steady growth.Key Florida markets contributed to the firm's 2016 success, including Lakewood Ranch, Hillsborough County, south Sarasota County, and Lee and Collier Counties."Last year marked our 22nd year building in Lakewood Ranch," said Neal. "We are proud that our corporate headquarters are located in one of the top master-planned communities in the country."Southern Sarasota County communities rounded out Neal's 2016 growth trend, with continued robust sales in Grand Palm, a Venice master-planned neighborhood that is more than one-third sold out with rapid, consistent sales since its opening in 2012. In 2017, the builder plans massive additions to the popular community, including a new $2-million gated entrance, six new subdivisions and a new discovery center with eight models for buyers to browse.This year, Neal Communities also plans to invest in a new resort-style amenity center at Boca Royale Golf & Country Club in Englewood. The home builder foresees an even greater involvement in Lakewood Ranch and other key markets in southwest Florida that have proven to be successful like Lee and Collier Counties.Neal's southern division has seen significant accomplishments in 2016. The home builder opened a dedicated design studio in Bonita Springs along with four new communities in Lee and Collier Counties, including Coconut Cove, Daniels Place and Watermark Phase 3 in Fort Myers and Avalon, the builder's first condominium community, in Naples.Neal Communities became the sixth largest builder in Lee and Collier Counties – just three years after opening its first community in spring 2013. Since then, Neal's south division has grown significantly and now employs 44 people. Selling currently in 10 communities, the division has sold out and completed two neighborhoods since spring 2013.Neal Signature Homes, the firm's luxury building division closed 90 homes in 2016, an almost 50 percent increase from the 61 homes closed in 2015.

Abstract
Historically, companies disseminated financial information via the press release. The ability to disseminate information now exists on multiple "new media" channels beyond just the press release, with each channel reaching a different audience. With the different channels of communication come different connotations and associations that people have about the channels, which may affect the interpretation of the message, thereby altering management's ability to effectively communicate with stakeholders. I investigate whether retail investors' processing of financial information disclosures is dependent upon the fit between the channel and the type of information sent on the channel. Using the Elaboration Likelihood Model, I experimentally test how good and bad financial information posted on a social media channel, Twitter, compares to a more traditional channel, a company investor relations page where financial information is traditionally posted. I find that Twitter is associated with investors processing financial information unconsciously on the peripheral route while conscious or central route processing is associated with information coming from the company's investor relations page. Additionally, I find that investors have lower perceptions of management credibility after viewing financial disclosures on a company's Twitter feed than after viewing the same disclosures on the company's investor relations page.

Abstract
Historically, companies disseminated financial information via the press release. The ability to disseminate information now exists on multiple "new media" channels beyond just the press release, with each channel reaching a different audience. With the different channels of communication come different connotations and associations that people have about the channels, which may affect the interpretation of the message, thereby altering management's ability to effectively communicate with stakeholders. I investigate whether retail investors' processing of financial information disclosures is dependent upon the fit between the channel and the type of information sent on the channel. Using the Elaboration Likelihood Model, I experimentally test how good and bad financial information posted on a social media channel, Twitter, compares to a more traditional channel, a company investor relations page where financial information is traditionally posted. I find that Twitter is associated with investors processing financial information unconsciously on the peripheral route while conscious or central route processing is associated with information coming from the company's investor relations page. Additionally, I find that investors have lower perceptions of management credibility after viewing financial disclosures on a company's Twitter feed than after viewing the same disclosures on the company's investor relations page.
