					CATHERINE M. KILBANE
				


            
            
            Catherine M. Kilbane has created a unique setup for her legal department at American Greetings. Ms. Kilbane, who has been  senior vice president and general counsel since October 2003, has cross-matrixed the legal  department  by business  unit and by  functional  speciality. Lawyers are embedded in business units, where they advise through the life cycle of an initiative.  This structure affords the business unit its own “mini-general counsel” who can identify issues and bring them back to the appropriate functional specialist for  another look.  Each lawyer in the department  is embedded in one or two business units and also has his or  her own functional area of expertise. For example, the retail sales force's embedded lawyer's  specialty is corporate law. When the unit has a contract dispute, the  embedded lawyer will engage a  litigation functional specialist to handle the dispute.  Consequently, when another business unit needs corporate counsel, the lawyer assigned to  the retail sales force will step in as a functional specialist. In addition to creating this structure, Ms. Kilbane has led the American Greetings legal team through product acquisitions, credit facilities renewal and the closing of a large debt offering in 2011. Among her department's other accomplishments:  •  It has developed a proactive approach to intellectual property protection that allows American Greetings to leverage its creativity to create a sustainable competitive advantage through patents, trademarks and copyrights. •  It has developed and implemented a comprehensive product safety process to ensure that all  its products comply with  Consumer Product Safety Commission requirements.Q & A WITH CATHERINE M. KILBANE
 In what ways, if any, have you seen the legal landscape change over the past decade?The good news is that the last decade has brought broader career path choices for lawyers. The bad news is that a legal career path now has much more uncertainty. I benefited from very good training opportunities when I was a new lawyer, and in today's legal environment it's more challenging to provide those types of training opportunities. Describe some of the most challenging aspects of your position. The ever-shifting regulatory landscape makes it difficult to provide proactive counseling. I've found that my internal clients want to be empowered with the knowledge of what the law requires. Providing that kind of real-time training on a global basis requires a creative approach. What qualities are especially important for someone to have who is working in a general or in-house counsel position? Why? You need a level of comfort making decisions on a real-time basis — business demands often can't wait for exhaustive legal research. The ability to craft practical solutions that draw on resources from a variety of sources is key. And a sense of humor certainly helps. What are some of the recurring issues you face?As a company driven by its creative culture, at American Greetings, intellectual property issues are often at the top of our list. Finally, on a more lighthearted note: If you weren't in your current profession, what would be you be doing?I'd make greeting cards!
