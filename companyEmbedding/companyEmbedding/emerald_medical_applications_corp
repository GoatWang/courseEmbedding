Emerald Medical Application's Dermacompare Technology Chosen as One of Four Start Up Technology Winners of Merck's Health Innovation Technology Scouts (HITS) Program
Merck And Emerald Performing Due Diligence To Figure Out The Best Method Of Collaborating In The Skin Cancer Market


























PETACH TIKVA, Israel, November 28, 2016 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ --
PETACH TIKVA, Israel, November 28, 2016 /PRNewswire/ --


                                        








Emerald Medical Applications Corp. (otcqb:MRLA) ("Emerald" or the "Company"), the Israeli-based company engaged in the development and sale of DermaCompare™, today announced that its proprietary artificial intelligence technology and application for the early diagnosis of melanoma and other skin cancers, was selected as one of four technology start up winners of Merck & Co., Inc. Health Innovation Technology Scouts Program (HITS).


                                        








The goal of HITS is to find start up technology companies from around the world that are early in their evolution which Merck can partner with and/or co-create services that complement their core products and future pipeline. After reviewing more than 400 worldwide startup companies in the information technology industry this year, Emerald was selected as one of eight companies to participate in the final judging, which took place on Nov 10, 2016.


                                        








Emerald's CEO and President, Adi Zamir and Lior Wayn, presented to Merck's senior executives at the HITS "Be Well Challenge" final, where they were named one of the four winners. As one of the selected winners, Merck has committed to a due diligence process that will determine the potential feasibility of a partnership with the Company.


                                        








Adi Zamir CEO of Emerald said "We are proud to have our technology chosen as a winner by a company of Merck's caliber. Their dedication to patients with melanoma is clear; Keytruda is the leading immunotherapy product for melanoma in the world. We believe DermaCompare's ability to identify moles that are suspicious of melanoma could add value to Merck's efforts in the treatment of skin cancer, and look forward to working with them to figure out the best way to implement our technology so that they may help many more people worldwide."

Emerald Medical Applications is an Israeli-based medical technology company that utilizes proprietary military image processing technology and state of the art data analytics to improve the analysis of medical images. Emerald's flagship solution, DermaCompare™, is an FDA Class #1 approved, HIPPA-compliant, skin cancer (melanoma) screening platform that enables physicians to identify and monitor changes in their patients' skin health, specifically the early detection of cancerous moles and skin anomalies.


                                        








The DermaCompare™ patient application is available in Mac or Android based platforms and works using virtually any digital camera, including cell phones, iPads, tablets and other similar devices, to take Total Body Photography ("TBP") images and, in real-time, transmit these images for dermatological evaluation and identification of suspicious moles, lesions and other skin conditions. These images are then compared using Emerald's cloud database, as well as the patient's previous Total Body Photography images, which will dramatically enhance a physician's ability to detect Melanoma earlier, more accurately and more efficient than other means of diagnosis

Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
 


                                        








This press release may contain forward-looking statements, about Emerald's expectations, beliefs or intentions regarding, among other things, its product development efforts, business, financial condition, results of operations, strategies or prospects. In addition, from time to time, Emerald or its representatives have made or may make forward-looking statements, orally or in writing. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking words such as "believe," "expect," "intend," "plan," "may," "should" or "anticipate" or their negatives or other variations of these words or other comparable words or by the fact that these statements do not relate strictly to historical or current matters. These forward-looking statements may be included in, but are not limited to, various filings made by Emerald with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, press releases or oral statements made by or with the approval of one of Emerald's authorized executive officers.

Emerald Medical Applications’ DermaCompare™ Chosen Israeli Technology Most Likely to Succeed in Brazil

		  Company Enters Exclusive Three-Year, $7 Million Distribution Agreement With Laser Brazil Technology

PETACH TIKVA, Israel, April 18, 2016 /PRNewswire/ --
Emerald Medical Applications Corp. (OTCQB: MRLA) ("Emerald" or the "Company"), the Israeli-based company engaged in the development and sale of DermaCompare™, its proprietary artificial intelligence technology for the early diagnosis of melanoma and other skin cancers, today announced that DermaCompare was selected as the Israeli technology "most likely to succeed in Brazil" by the Israel - Brazil Chamber of Commerce.
The Company also announced that it has entered an exclusive agreement with Laser Brazil Technology (LBT), a leading distributor of dermatologic medical equipment in Brazil. The agreement provides LBT with exclusive distribution rights for the Company's DermaCompare to dermatologists throughout Brazil for a period of three years. In order to maintain the exclusivity, LBT must generate a minimum of $7 million in revenue for the Company.
According to the recent study "Melanoma characteristics in Brazil: demographics, treatment, and survival analysis," melanoma constitutes less than 5% of skin cancers but is responsible for approximately 95% of skin cancer deaths, and its incidence has been rising worldwide. The report also states that over recent decades the overall survival rate of Brazilian patients diagnosed with melanoma are lower than worldwide rates.
DermaCompare enables patients to "self-conduct" a dermatology scan using Total Body Photography Imaging (TBP) with a basic digital camera, typically a tablet or Smartphone (whether iPhone or Android), following simply, self-explanatory, online instructions. Once uploaded to the DermaCompare platform, physicians can review their patient's skin TBP images and receive a summary of data points with current, relevant data about the patient's skin, including alerts to any suspicious changes. This is particularly important in the cases of melanoma, which is most often diagnosed based on the changing appearance of moles.
"Early detection is the most effective tool for the treatment of any cancer, particularly aggressive cancers like melanoma. We are excited by the opportunity through Laser Brasil Technology to bring our DermaCompare platform to Brazil, where we believe DermaCompare will be a widely-accepted and an effective tool in improving early melanoma detection rates. Not only does DermaCompare empower patients to take charge of their own health and that of their loved ones, it expedites the early examination and diagnosis process, which is critical to improving survival rates," said Lior Wayn, Emerald's Founder and Chief Executive Officer.
Wayn went on to say, "We are so proud to have been selected by the Chamber of Commerce as the Israeli company most likely to succeed in Brazil. We chose LBT as our partner because of their reputation within the dermatology sector, which is unparalleled. We firmly believe their network will enable us to fast-track the exposure of DermaCompare to dermatologists and patients in need throughout Brazil and even elsewhere in South America."
About Emerald  Medical Applications  Corp 
Emerald Medical Applications is an Israeli-based medical technology company that utilizes proprietary military image processing technology and state of the art data analytics to improve the analysis of medical images. Emerald's flagship solution, DermaCompare™, is an FDA Class #1 approved, HIPPA-compliant, skin cancer (melanoma) screening platform that enables physicians to identify and monitor changes in their patients' skin health, specifically the early detection of cancerous moles and skin anomalies.
The DermaCompare™ patient application is available in Mac or Android based platforms and works using virtually any digital camera, including cell phones, iPads, tablets and other similar devices, to take Total Body Photography (TBP) images and, in real-time, transmit these images for dermatological evaluation and identification of suspicious moles, lesions and other skin conditions. These images are then compared using Emerald's cloud database, as well as the patient's previous Total Body Photography images, which will dramatically enhance a physician's ability to detect Melanoma earlier, more accurately and more efficient than other means of diagnosis

PETACH TIKVA, Israel, May 18, 2016 /PRNewswire/ --
Emerald Medical Applications Corp. (OTCQB: MRLA) ("Emerald" or the "Company"), the Israeli-based company engaged in the development and sale of DermaCompare™, its proprietary artificial intelligence technology and application for the early diagnosis of melanoma and other skin cancers, today announced that Dr. Ben-Zion Weiner has joined the Company's Scientific Advisory Board.
From 1975 to 2012, Dr. Weiner held executive positions with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (NYSE:   TEVA) and its subsidiaries ("Teva"). He was Vice President of Global Products of Teva from 2005 to 2011 where he was responsible for global Generic and Innovative Research and Development.
Dr. Weiner was also a Member of the Core Management Committee. 
Dr. Weiner holds a B.Sc. Degree in General Chemistry and Biochemistry, graduating with distinction at the Hebrew University, Jerusalem, a M.Sc. Degree in Organic Chemistry, graduating with distinction at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and a Ph.D. Degree from the Hebrew University, Jerusalem. Dr. Weiner did his Post-Doctorate studies at Schering Plough Corporation in Bloomfield, New Jersey, on "Exploratory work of new drugs, research in organic chemistry, and pharmacology." Dr. Weiner received twice the Rothschild Prize for Innovation/Export for the development of Copaxone(R) for Multiple Sclerosis and for the development of alpha D3 for Dialysis and Osteoporosis. 
Dr. Weiner commented, "I am pleased with the high potential of Emerald's DermaCompare™ technology. My pharmaceutical background will allow me to consult and advise the company on how to maximize current and future applications for the technology. Dr. Weiner went on saying: "I am honored and privileged to join forces with Professor Perry Robbins and Lior Wayn, CEO of Emerald Medical Applications Corp., stated, "I would like to officially welcome Dr. Weiner to our Scientific advisory board. His qualifications and expertise in the areas of chemistry, pharmacology and pharmaceutical products will undoubtedly be of significant value as we explore to maximize our DermaCompare's potential. I believe that our ability to combine the power of artificial intelligence with the utility of a mobile app will revolutionize the way we detect and diagnose melanoma and, in the future, other skin conditions.

The DermaCompare™ patient application is available in Mac or Android based platforms and works using virtually any digital camera, including cell phones, iPads, tablets and other similar devices, to take Total Body Photography ("TBP") images and, in real-time, transmit these images for dermatological evaluation and identification of suspicious moles, lesions and other skin conditions. These images are then compared using Emerald's cloud database, as well as the patient's previous Total Body Photography images, which will dramatically enhance a physician's ability to detect Melanoma earlier, more accurately and more efficiently than other means of diagnosis.
