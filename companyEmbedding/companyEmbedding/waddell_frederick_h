History[edit]
Northern Trust was founded in 1889 by Byron Laflin Smith in a one-room office in the Rookery Building in Chicago's Loop, with a focus on providing trust and banking services for the city's prosperous citizens.[6] Smith provided 40% of the bank's original capitalization of $1 million, and counted such businessmen and civic leaders as Marshall Field, Martin A. Ryerson, and Philip D. Armour among the original 27 shareholders. Intimately acquainted with the operations of the bank, these men would personally examine Northern's assets and records at each year's end.
In October 1929, however, the flamboyant decade of the 1920s came to a sudden halt—the stock market crash led to a spectacular drop in prices, employment and production. As these troubles swept across the country, one bank after another closed. Two days after his inauguration on March 6, 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt closed all the banks in the United States. When they reopened a short time later, there was a great deal of uncertainty as to what might occur. Fortunately, the people in line outside the Northern bank offices were there to deposit money instead of withdraw it. Northern's conservative policies had served it well during the 1920s.[7]




The company's headquarters building at 50 South LaSalle Street in the Financial District of Chicago was completed in 1905 and was designed by Frost and Granger.[8] It is shown here in 1907.


By 1941 nearly half of all the bank's commercial accounts were drawn from outside the Chicago metropolitan area. During World War II, Northern once again took part in the government's war bond drives, and also provided loans for manufacturing war materials under special government programs. The war created more opportunities for the bank; all sectors of its business expanded, and by 1945 the Northern Trust had doubled in size.
The years after World War II brought even greater prosperity to the bank as it continued to expand its services. Still under the direction of Solomon Smith, management at the bank became more aware of electronic data processing and how this new technology could revolutionize the banking industry. During the 1950s, Northern was at the forefront of developing numerous automated banking services, including the first fully automated financial statements for trust clients.
When Solomon Smith died in 1963 and his son, Edward Byron Smith, assumed leadership of the bank, assets totaled more than $1 billion. Near the end of the decade, Northern became the first state-chartered bank from Illinois to open an office outside the United States.
Throughout the 1970s and 80s, Northern Trust acquired companies and expanded into Florida, Arizona, California and Texas. When oil prices dropped suddenly in the early 1980s, many South American nations realized they could not pay off their enormous bank loans. Northern suffered uncharacteristically high losses. Aggressive management, loan reserves, and write-off enabled the bank to restore its asset quality.
When Edward Byron Smith retired in 1979, he was succeeded by E. Norman Staub, followed a few years later by Philip W. K. Sweet, and then by Weston Christopherson, who is credited with guiding the bank through a difficult period when sour loans to Latin American countries were hurting profits. During Christopherson's six years at Northern Trust, profits rose from $34 million to $113 million[9] He continued with Northern Trust until his retirement in 1990, at which time Northern Trust was the 11th most profitable of the 100 largest banks in the United States.[10] When company veteran David W. Fox took over, he was only the seventh chief executive in the bank's existence. William A. Osborn was named president and chief operating officer in 1993 and became chairman and chief executive officer, in addition to president, in 1995. He stepped down as president in 2006 and as CEO on January 1, 2008. Frederick H. "Rick" Waddell then became president and CEO.
Northern Trust counts over 20% of the U.S.'s wealthiest families as its clients. It is also one of the largest global custodians in the world, serving the asset servicing needs of corporate and public retirement, foundations, endowment, fund managers, insurance companies and government funds.[11]

History[edit]
Northern Trust was founded in 1889 by Byron Laflin Smith in a one-room office in the Rookery Building in Chicago's Loop, with a focus on providing trust and banking services for the city's prosperous citizens.[6] Smith provided 40% of the bank's original capitalization of $1 million, and counted such businessmen and civic leaders as Marshall Field, Martin A. Ryerson, and Philip D. Armour among the original 27 shareholders. Intimately acquainted with the operations of the bank, these men would personally examine Northern's assets and records at each year's end.
In October 1929, however, the flamboyant decade of the 1920s came to a sudden halt—the stock market crash led to a spectacular drop in prices, employment and production. As these troubles swept across the country, one bank after another closed. Two days after his inauguration on March 6, 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt closed all the banks in the United States. When they reopened a short time later, there was a great deal of uncertainty as to what might occur. Fortunately, the people in line outside the Northern bank offices were there to deposit money instead of withdraw it. Northern's conservative policies had served it well during the 1920s.[7]




The company's headquarters building at 50 South LaSalle Street in the Financial District of Chicago was completed in 1905 and was designed by Frost and Granger.[8] It is shown here in 1907.


By 1941 nearly half of all the bank's commercial accounts were drawn from outside the Chicago metropolitan area. During World War II, Northern once again took part in the government's war bond drives, and also provided loans for manufacturing war materials under special government programs. The war created more opportunities for the bank; all sectors of its business expanded, and by 1945 the Northern Trust had doubled in size.
The years after World War II brought even greater prosperity to the bank as it continued to expand its services. Still under the direction of Solomon Smith, management at the bank became more aware of electronic data processing and how this new technology could revolutionize the banking industry. During the 1950s, Northern was at the forefront of developing numerous automated banking services, including the first fully automated financial statements for trust clients.
When Solomon Smith died in 1963 and his son, Edward Byron Smith, assumed leadership of the bank, assets totaled more than $1 billion. Near the end of the decade, Northern became the first state-chartered bank from Illinois to open an office outside the United States.
Throughout the 1970s and 80s, Northern Trust acquired companies and expanded into Florida, Arizona, California and Texas. When oil prices dropped suddenly in the early 1980s, many South American nations realized they could not pay off their enormous bank loans. Northern suffered uncharacteristically high losses. Aggressive management, loan reserves, and write-off enabled the bank to restore its asset quality.
When Edward Byron Smith retired in 1979, he was succeeded by E. Norman Staub, followed a few years later by Philip W. K. Sweet, and then by Weston Christopherson, who is credited with guiding the bank through a difficult period when sour loans to Latin American countries were hurting profits. During Christopherson's six years at Northern Trust, profits rose from $34 million to $113 million[9] He continued with Northern Trust until his retirement in 1990, at which time Northern Trust was the 11th most profitable of the 100 largest banks in the United States.[10] When company veteran David W. Fox took over, he was only the seventh chief executive in the bank's existence. William A. Osborn was named president and chief operating officer in 1993 and became chairman and chief executive officer, in addition to president, in 1995. He stepped down as president in 2006 and as CEO on January 1, 2008. Frederick H. "Rick" Waddell then became president and CEO.
Northern Trust counts over 20% of the U.S.'s wealthiest families as its clients. It is also one of the largest global custodians in the world, serving the asset servicing needs of corporate and public retirement, foundations, endowment, fund managers, insurance companies and government funds.[11]

History[edit]
Northern Trust was founded in 1889 by Byron Laflin Smith in a one-room office in the Rookery Building in Chicago's Loop, with a focus on providing trust and banking services for the city's prosperous citizens.[6] Smith provided 40% of the bank's original capitalization of $1 million, and counted such businessmen and civic leaders as Marshall Field, Martin A. Ryerson, and Philip D. Armour among the original 27 shareholders. Intimately acquainted with the operations of the bank, these men would personally examine Northern's assets and records at each year's end.
In October 1929, however, the flamboyant decade of the 1920s came to a sudden halt—the stock market crash led to a spectacular drop in prices, employment and production. As these troubles swept across the country, one bank after another closed. Two days after his inauguration on March 6, 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt closed all the banks in the United States. When they reopened a short time later, there was a great deal of uncertainty as to what might occur. Fortunately, the people in line outside the Northern bank offices were there to deposit money instead of withdraw it. Northern's conservative policies had served it well during the 1920s.[7]




The company's headquarters building at 50 South LaSalle Street in the Financial District of Chicago was completed in 1905 and was designed by Frost and Granger.[8] It is shown here in 1907.


By 1941 nearly half of all the bank's commercial accounts were drawn from outside the Chicago metropolitan area. During World War II, Northern once again took part in the government's war bond drives, and also provided loans for manufacturing war materials under special government programs. The war created more opportunities for the bank; all sectors of its business expanded, and by 1945 the Northern Trust had doubled in size.
The years after World War II brought even greater prosperity to the bank as it continued to expand its services. Still under the direction of Solomon Smith, management at the bank became more aware of electronic data processing and how this new technology could revolutionize the banking industry. During the 1950s, Northern was at the forefront of developing numerous automated banking services, including the first fully automated financial statements for trust clients.
When Solomon Smith died in 1963 and his son, Edward Byron Smith, assumed leadership of the bank, assets totaled more than $1 billion. Near the end of the decade, Northern became the first state-chartered bank from Illinois to open an office outside the United States.
Throughout the 1970s and 80s, Northern Trust acquired companies and expanded into Florida, Arizona, California and Texas. When oil prices dropped suddenly in the early 1980s, many South American nations realized they could not pay off their enormous bank loans. Northern suffered uncharacteristically high losses. Aggressive management, loan reserves, and write-off enabled the bank to restore its asset quality.
When Edward Byron Smith retired in 1979, he was succeeded by E. Norman Staub, followed a few years later by Philip W. K. Sweet, and then by Weston Christopherson, who is credited with guiding the bank through a difficult period when sour loans to Latin American countries were hurting profits. During Christopherson's six years at Northern Trust, profits rose from $34 million to $113 million[9] He continued with Northern Trust until his retirement in 1990, at which time Northern Trust was the 11th most profitable of the 100 largest banks in the United States.[10] When company veteran David W. Fox took over, he was only the seventh chief executive in the bank's existence. William A. Osborn was named president and chief operating officer in 1993 and became chairman and chief executive officer, in addition to president, in 1995. He stepped down as president in 2006 and as CEO on January 1, 2008. Frederick H. "Rick" Waddell then became president and CEO.
Northern Trust counts over 20% of the U.S.'s wealthiest families as its clients. It is also one of the largest global custodians in the world, serving the asset servicing needs of corporate and public retirement, foundations, endowment, fund managers, insurance companies and government funds.[11]

History[edit]
Northern Trust was founded in 1889 by Byron Laflin Smith in a one-room office in the Rookery Building in Chicago's Loop, with a focus on providing trust and banking services for the city's prosperous citizens.[6] Smith provided 40% of the bank's original capitalization of $1 million, and counted such businessmen and civic leaders as Marshall Field, Martin A. Ryerson, and Philip D. Armour among the original 27 shareholders. Intimately acquainted with the operations of the bank, these men would personally examine Northern's assets and records at each year's end.
In October 1929, however, the flamboyant decade of the 1920s came to a sudden halt—the stock market crash led to a spectacular drop in prices, employment and production. As these troubles swept across the country, one bank after another closed. Two days after his inauguration on March 6, 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt closed all the banks in the United States. When they reopened a short time later, there was a great deal of uncertainty as to what might occur. Fortunately, the people in line outside the Northern bank offices were there to deposit money instead of withdraw it. Northern's conservative policies had served it well during the 1920s.[7]




The company's headquarters building at 50 South LaSalle Street in the Financial District of Chicago was completed in 1905 and was designed by Frost and Granger.[8] It is shown here in 1907.


By 1941 nearly half of all the bank's commercial accounts were drawn from outside the Chicago metropolitan area. During World War II, Northern once again took part in the government's war bond drives, and also provided loans for manufacturing war materials under special government programs. The war created more opportunities for the bank; all sectors of its business expanded, and by 1945 the Northern Trust had doubled in size.
The years after World War II brought even greater prosperity to the bank as it continued to expand its services. Still under the direction of Solomon Smith, management at the bank became more aware of electronic data processing and how this new technology could revolutionize the banking industry. During the 1950s, Northern was at the forefront of developing numerous automated banking services, including the first fully automated financial statements for trust clients.
When Solomon Smith died in 1963 and his son, Edward Byron Smith, assumed leadership of the bank, assets totaled more than $1 billion. Near the end of the decade, Northern became the first state-chartered bank from Illinois to open an office outside the United States.
Throughout the 1970s and 80s, Northern Trust acquired companies and expanded into Florida, Arizona, California and Texas. When oil prices dropped suddenly in the early 1980s, many South American nations realized they could not pay off their enormous bank loans. Northern suffered uncharacteristically high losses. Aggressive management, loan reserves, and write-off enabled the bank to restore its asset quality.
When Edward Byron Smith retired in 1979, he was succeeded by E. Norman Staub, followed a few years later by Philip W. K. Sweet, and then by Weston Christopherson, who is credited with guiding the bank through a difficult period when sour loans to Latin American countries were hurting profits. During Christopherson's six years at Northern Trust, profits rose from $34 million to $113 million[9] He continued with Northern Trust until his retirement in 1990, at which time Northern Trust was the 11th most profitable of the 100 largest banks in the United States.[10] When company veteran David W. Fox took over, he was only the seventh chief executive in the bank's existence. William A. Osborn was named president and chief operating officer in 1993 and became chairman and chief executive officer, in addition to president, in 1995. He stepped down as president in 2006 and as CEO on January 1, 2008. Frederick H. "Rick" Waddell then became president and CEO.
Northern Trust counts over 20% of the U.S.'s wealthiest families as its clients. It is also one of the largest global custodians in the world, serving the asset servicing needs of corporate and public retirement, foundations, endowment, fund managers, insurance companies and government funds.[11]

When you decide it's time to choose new pieces for your home, Walmart can help with Every Day Low Prices. To get things started, make sure you have an idea of what you need, such as how much space you have and where you want the pieces to go. You might want to consider if you want a particular style of furniture or mix-and-match pieces based on what you see available. Save money while you're at it with our low prices, every day, on everything, including big-ticket items like living room furniture.Sofas, loveseats, sectionals and futonsDepending on the size of your living room, the sofa you choose will likely be the biggest piece of furniture in the room, especially if you choose a sectional. If you have a smaller living room, such as in a condominium or apartment, you may only have room for a loveseat or futon.Sofa   Depending on the size, sofas allow seating for two to four people. Sofas can range between around 30 inches and more than 110 inches wide   with most being between 50 and 80 inches wide   and are upholstered in materials like leather, faux leather, linen or microfiber. If you have frequent overnight guests or just want to have another sleeping option, you can choose a sofa sleeperLoveseat   For large living rooms, you can have both a sofa and a loveseat in the room. However, if your space is smaller, you may want to consider a loveseat as your primary piece. These are made from the same types of material as sofas. Loveseats seat two average-size people or three smaller people, such as kids, and are usually between 30 and 89 inches long in a multitude of colors.Sectional   If you have a lot of space in your living room, a sectional can be a great piece to have. Sectionals seat four people, six or more, and some even double as recliners on one end or both. Most recliners are in an "L" shape, but some have rounded backs in more of a "C" shape. Sectionals also come in a variety of coverings, such as linen, leather, faux leather, bonded leather or microfiber. The minimum size for a sectional is 60 inches, and these can be more than 100 inches too.Futon   These are like smaller versions of sleeper sofas, serving as a loveseat or bed depending on your needs. A futon has a single twin-size mattress that turns into the bottom and back of the futon when rearranged.Recliners and chairsIn conjunction with a loveseat or sofa, you may want to add a chair or two into the mix. These can be recliners or accent chairs.Recliners   These are deep, usually plush chairs that have backs that recline and legs that extend out, allowing you to lay almost flat in the chair. The materials are the same as the other furniture you can choose for the living room to allow you to match pieces or choose your favorite upholstery, and some have heating and massaging capabilities. There are even recliners that have power lift technology, which assists people who have difficulty getting up or sitting down.Accent chairs   These chairs run the gamut of styles, including armchairs and armless chairs in many styles like contemporary, modern and mid-century. Chairs, including recliners, are typically categorized by how wide the seating area is, and living room chairs range from 15 inches or less (ideal for little ones) to 36 inches or more.Accent tablesTo go with the seating choices you have made, you also need a table or two in your living room as well. These can be coffee tables, end tables and console tables.Coffee tables   These tables do more than allow you to rest coffee cups on them. They're usually set in front of a sofa or sectional and have storage area   open, closed or both   beneath the top. These tables take many shapes but are usually rectangular.End tables   End tables sit next to sofas, loveseats and chairs and are good places for table lamps to rest. End tables also have storage space and some also have a drawer for storage.Console tables   These are tall narrow tables that go behind a sofa or along a wall. Some just have a tabletop, and some have shelving underneath.Other living room furnitureOnce you have the main pieces, there are peripheral pieces you may want to add to complete your living room layout. ottomans   These are square, circular or rectangular pieces of furniture that you can use as an extra seat or as a footrest. Many also have storage space that you access through a lid on the top.bookcases   Bookcases allow you to store books or other media like DVDs and Blu-ray discs or items that you want to display like knickknacks.TV stands and entertainment centers   If you have a television or stereo system you want to have in the living room, you can place these appliances in an entertainment center or TV stand in a central location and arrange your seating around it.Show moreElectrode, Comp-167313230, DC-prod-dal2, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.15.0, SHA-06ca1a9068b558bd33bd1add57a0b13a52090f9f, CID-

That's why you should replace it every few years with a new mattress. Fortunately, technology has made it so that you have many mattress types to choose from, and these are available for all bed sizes. You can save money on your new mattress purchase because we have low prices, every day, on everything. You can even buy new bedding to go with the mattress as well.Mattresses and box springsThere are six basic sizes for mattresses: twin (30 inches by 75 inches), full (54 inches by 75 inches), twin XL (39 inches by 80 inches), queen (60 inches by 80 inches), king (76 inches by 80 inches) and California king (72 inches by 84 inches). This is important to know if you're buying a different-sized bed for your home. Once you know what size mattress you need, you can decide what type to purchase.Innerspring mattresses   One of the oldest and most popular styles of mattress, this type of mattress uses a wrapped steel support system. The style of the coils and how they're wrapped, padded and connected, differ by brand. Many innerspring mattresses have pillow tops on one side or both, although less expensive ones don't.Gel mattresses   Gel mattresses feature a foam material that contains gel to form the mattress's support, and that material provides varying levels of comfort and heat dissipation.Latex foam mattresses   Latex mattresses feature foam that comes from petroleum-based or plant-based materials, and they feature foam as part of the support system and in the outer layers.Memory foam mattresses   Also known as visco elastic foam, these mattresses include high-density polyurethane foam that's used as part of the support system and on the outer layers, which adapts to the shape of the sleepers.Hybrid mattresses   Hybrid mattresses combine the best parts of both innerspring and foam mattresses. Innerspring coils are interspersed with one or more kinds of foam support. This foam takes many forms, including latex, visco elastic or polyurethane. Some even combine innersprings with gel-filled foam for support.Pillow top mattresses   Pillow top mattresses are available on all types of bed mattresses, with the pillow top on one side or both, especially on higher-end mattresses. The thickness of the pillow top varies by mattress and can be made from fiber or foam materials.air mattresses   Although some air mattresses are only filled with a single pocket of air, some have multiple chambers to allow for more flexibility and are usually covered in a cloth or foam material that has padding underneath.Box springs are available for all sizes of mattresses and work best on mattresses that you flip every so often to keep the springs or foam from becoming weak. It also helps even the mattress out if the surface is uneven for any reason. If you have a platform bed or a one-sided mattress, you generally have no need for a box spring. However, if you have a warranty on your mattress, check your information. Some mattresses require the use of a box spring or the warranty is null and void. Waterbed mattressesAlthough the heyday of their popularity was back in the 1970s, some people still prefer to sleep on a waterbed. The gentle motion of the mattress helps some people sleep better than a traditional mattress can. Mattresses for waterbeds are available in all traditional sizes and feature an inner bladder that fills with water. Most waterbeds come with a low-wattage heater for those cold nights. Waterbeds have vinyl coverings that must be used specifically with waterbed frames. Some come with double-walled surfaces and reinforced corners for more leak protection.Mattress pads and toppersFor those who have a mattress without exterior padding or want additional padding to sleep, mattress pads and toppers are the answer. Mattress pads use many of the same materials as the mattresses themselves, including memory form and gel-filled foam. Some have fillings that are more like pillows and have down or down alternative as the padding. The thickness of mattress pads varies from 1 inch to 4 inches or more. mattress toppers are similar to mattress pads, but these sometimes go onto the fitted sheet covering the mattress rather than encasing it. These offer temperature control properties as well, especially the gel-filled ones.Show moreElectrode, Comp-115863242, DC-prod-dal1, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.15.0, SHA-06ca1a9068b558bd33bd1add57a0b13a52090f9f, CID-
