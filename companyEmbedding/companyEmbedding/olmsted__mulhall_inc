                                            Watch for FRAUD! I cannot give this a low enough review – do not work with Movement Mortgage!

First PREMIER® Bank Mastercard Credit Card


                                            Do you have to link your personal bank account to pay the fees for the card. How do you pay your bill monthly. I see other people comment about they took money out of there bank account. How did they get their bank information from.

Cultural Immersion
For US military officers, living in a foreign culture as an Olmsted Scholar delivers two years of constant surprises, intimidating at first then exhilarating. Overcoming challenges, large and small, develops a new kind of confidence that never goes away.
Years later, Scholars recognize that they earned their readiness to face the unknown from the Olmsted experience.

“The greatest leaders must be educated broadly.”

General George Olmsted


 





“The Olmsted experience helped create a foundation of understanding and insight that served me well as I went on my mission to the International Space Station with an international crew of diverse backgrounds.”

Colonel Michael Hopkins, NASA Astronaut 
OSC '03 Parma, Italy








“The Olmsted experience works because it attracts and promotes cultural curiosity. This is something I apply every day in interacting with others onboard.”

Lieutenant Commander Emily Bassett 
    Executive Officer, USS Arlington
OSC '09 Cadiz, Spain








“The Olmsted experience prepared me to rapidly adapt to new environments, which is why I thought it possible to launch a campaign for the Iowa House of Representatives with no previous political experience.”

Representative Kenneth Rizer, Colonel (Ret.)
OSC '98 Stockholm, Sweden
