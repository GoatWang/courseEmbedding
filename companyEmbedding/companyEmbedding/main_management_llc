What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

RETIREMENT PLANS 401k
The Main 401k solution offers a significant upgrade to the traditional defined contribution plan. It offers participants many advantages not available in traditional "do-it-yourself" 401(k) plans. The key differentiator is relieving employees of the burden of the asset allocation decisions that have the greatest impact on portfolio returns and placing that responsibility in the hands of investment professionals. 
Traditional plans require each plan participant to essentially act as the portfolio manager of their 401k plan assets. In other words the choice of whether to buy Emerging Market Bonds or Large Cap Value stocks are managed by participants. Typically though few of them have the time to effectively keep up with market fluctuations on an ongoing basis.
The Main Management 401k places critical asset allocation decisions into the hands of an experienced three person Investment Committee.  They actively manages four dynamic ETF risk based portfolios which provide solutions for participants from their 20s until well into their retirement years. As such Main Management becomes an investment fiduciary to the plan thus relieving the plan sponsor of this duty. 
To learn more about Main Management may improve the retirement benefits of a 401(k) plan and dramatically reduce the personal liability of plan fiduciaries, please call us (415) 217-5800.

  Strategies   FLAGSHIP
Active: US Large Cap Sector Rotation
Main Management was founded on the philosophy that sectors are a more efficient way to own equities than single stocks. Accordingly the strategy uses a disciplined investment process to rank and select market sectors that are trading below their historical averages on an absolute and relative basis. The firm also believes that undervalued sectors typically revert to their mean when the appropriate catalyst is present. A sector will be sold when its price target is achieved The strategy derives excess returns from the correct overweight and underweight of sectors relative to the S&P 500 benchmark. The portfolio is implemented using Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). Inception: September 2002.
 
BuyWrite: Hedged Equity 
The objective of the strategy is to provide investors with high single digit / low double digit returns during a positive or neutral equity market while providing investors with significant protection during down markets. Main Management seeks to achieve this investment objective by investing in a portfolio of exchange traded funds (ETFs) selected through fundamental reversion to the mean analysis while utilizing a covered call writing strategy to dampen volatility. The funds fundamental asset allocation may include equity investments, debt investments, and diversifying investments. The strategy is offered in both Separately Managed Accounts (SMA) and Limited Partnership Interest. Inception: September 2004.
 
All Asset: Global Balanced
The portfolio seeks to replicate the risks and returns of sophisticated endowments and foundations using liquid investment vehicles. The portfolio managers select from a wide array of diversified asset classes to create a comprehensive, globally diversified solution. The strategy aims to provide investors with tax-efficient, equity-like returns with substantially lower risk than the S&P 500 index. It maintains exposure to US Equities, International Equities, Fixed Income, and Diversifying/Non Correlated Investments and balances a core strategic asset allocation with carefully selected tactical trading strategies. Risk management includes controlling volatility with targeted selling of covered call options. Benchmark is 70% MSCI All Country World Index – 30% Barclays Aggregate Bond Index. Inception: November 2006.
 
International: Non-US Equity
Main Management seeks to achieve long term capital appreciation by investing in non U.S. country and sector indexes. The portfolio utilizes a dynamic asset allocation approach which combines the benefits of both strategic and tactical allocation strategies. It employs a top down assessment to identify undervalued economic regions, countries and sectors. Rigorous fundamental analysis and a proprietary weighting methodology are key components of a disciplined allocation process. Concurrently, tactical allocations will be used to anticipate and respond to opportunistic shifts in the market. Benchmark is the MSCI All Country World ex US index. Inception: December 2007.
Main Management claims compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS®)
Main Management is an investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.
To obtain a compliant presentation, and/or the firm’s list of composite descriptions, please contact Main Management at info@mainmgt.com

 
RISK BASED
Main recognizes the majority of portfolio performance is the result of allocation to the appropriate asset classes at the right point in the investment cycle. The portfolios are constructed using passive indexes through Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) to create comprehensive, diversified portfolios of equities and fixed income focusing on consistency of returns. Each approach is a derivation of the firm’s All Asset strategy, a global balanced approach, with variations based on risk and/or age parameters.

Growth
The Growth Portfolio has a baseline allocation of all global equities of which a portion may be allocated to a cash position. It is designed to achieve long-term equity-like returns while avoiding the full impact of major market corrections.
Intermediate Growth
The Intermediate Growth Portfolio has a 75% global equity and 25% fixed income allocation baseline where a portion of the equity may be allocated to a cash position. It is designed to achieve long-term equity-like returns while avoiding the full impact of major market corrections while experiencing less volatility than an all equity portfolio.
 Moderate Growth
The Moderate Growth Portfolio has a 50% global equity and 50% fixed income allocation where a portion of the equity may be allocated to a cash position. It is designed to participate in a rising equity environment while avoiding the full impact of major market corrections while experiencing substantially less volatility than an all equity portfolio.
 Conservative Growth
The Conservative Growth Portfolio has a 25% global equity and 75% fixed income allocation where a portion of the equity may be allocated to a cash position. It is designed to participate in a rising equity environment while avoiding the full impact of major market corrections and experiencing a portion of the volatility of an all equity portfolio.

  About Us   Our Team: Deeply Experienced, Uniquely Qualified
Main Management’s team includes seasoned professionals in the area of investments, client relationship management, and operations, plus an external Advisory Board of senior investment industry leaders. With more than 30 years average industry experience, members of the firm’s Investment Committee and Advisory Board contribute valuable real-world perspective to the investment decision making process. Our team-based approach ensures the consistent application of the firm’s process discipline and does not make the investment process reliant on any one individual. With significant personal investments in Main Management’s investment strategies, our team’s interests are 100% aligned with those of our clients.
 
Our Philosophy: Focus on Asset Allocation & Sector Analysis
We believe that asset allocation is the dominant driver of long-term portfolio returns.  In addition to size and style, fundamental sector analysis is crucial to portfolio returns.  When it comes to the implementation of well-diversified portfolios, we believe ETFs offer tremendous advantages over actively managed approaches in the areas of cost and tax efficiency, transparency, and trading flexibility.
 
What We Offer: A Solutions-Based Approach
Main Management constructs customized solutions to help high net worth individuals and institutions achieve their investment objectives.  Our flagship All Asset strategy represents the expression of our most broadly based asset allocation views and can serve as a standalone, turnkey total portfolio solution or be customized to complete a portfolio of existing holdings.  Covered call option overlays are used to dampen portfolio volatility and generate portfolio income.  For more targeted portfolio needs, we offer sub-strategies of the All Asset strategy.

  FAQs   Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)
ETFs are baskets of securities that track specific indexes, investment styles, industry sectors, regions, countries and commodities. ETFs trade like individual stocks on the major stock exchanges. Using ETFs allows Main Management to create comprehensive investment portfolios with broad diversification at a minimal expense.
ETFs provide:




Diversification
>> baskets of individual securities


Transparency
>> know what you own, real time pricing


Low expense ratios
>> high expense ratios adversely affect performance


Tax efficiency
>> minimize effect of capital gains distributions


Liquidity
>> volume does not equal liquidity






Realizing that markets, not security selection, produce returns, Main Management lowers individual issue selection risk (Lehman Brothers, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, AIG, Valeant) by reducing portfolio turnover and excessive transaction costs that so often fails active stock managers. As investors, we are not looking to find the needle in the haystack, but looking for the right haystack.


The Main Advantage

Focus on diversification, risk management, and prudent periodic rebalancing helps keep clients on track to meet their goals amid market fluctuations

However, it is recommended that our clients use specialists in each area. Estate planning with a Trust and Estates attorney, tax related matters with a C.P.A., and insurance with a qualified insurance agent and we can provide referrals where relevant.

Investment Process
What is your investment approach?
Main Management constructs customized solutions to help high net worth individuals and institutions achieve their investment objectives. The firm was founded on the philosophy that sectors/indexes are a more efficient way to own equities than single stocks.
The Active, our oldest portfolio, is a U.S. equity sector rotation strategy using Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) that aims to identify market sectors that look undervalued relative to their historical mean and to the S&P 500.

Does your firm pick stocks and bonds?
No, we believe that sector/asset allocation is the dominant driver of long-term portfolio returns. Rigorous fundamental analysis is a key component of identifying value in broad asset classes, sectors or industries.

FUND OVERVIEWMain BuyWrite Fund – A Core Holding within your Alternative Allocation



Main BuyWrite Fund

Inception Date:12/29/2015
Distribution Schedule: Quarterly
No Load


Institutional Share Class

Ticker: BUYWX
CUSIP:66538H708
12b-1 Fee: None

The Total Annual Fund Operating Expense: 2.28%
Net Expense Ratio: 1.20% 
(After fee waiver / expense reimbursement)
Minimum Investment: $100,000

Fund Objective

The objective of the Main BuyWrite Fund is to provide superior risk-adjusted total returns relative to Morningstar Option Writing Category by investing in a portfolio of exchange traded funds (ETFs) selected through fundamental reversion to the mean analysis while utilizing a covered call writing (selling) strategy in an effort to dampen volatility. Secured puts may also be written (sold) to potentially generate an additional source of portfolio return while providing equity exposure at pre-determined price targets.
There is no guarantee that the fund will achieve its objectives, generate profits or avoid losses.




Investment Philosophy – Our Approach Seeks out the Best Aspects of Active and Passive Management



Equity Investment Process – Global Macro with a Focus on Value
We are value investors and seek to own investments at attractive valuations relative to their historical valuations and their peers currently. In order to avoid the classic “Value Trap” we seek a catalyst that should lead to near-term price appreciation (mean reversion). We do not limit our search for value and will look across markets and asset classes in search of it.


Options Investment Process – May Effectively Reduce Downside Risk
Call options may be sold on 0 to 100% of the underlying ETF portfolio holdings in order to generate premium income which may provide an additional source of portfolio return and may reduce overall portfolio volatility. Call options are typically written one month out but may be written over one year out at the discretion of the investment committee. Options may be written “in the money”, “ at the money”, or “out of the money” on a position by position basis in order to target a specific level of the possible upside participation/downside protection of the portfolio. Options which have been written are monitored on a daily basis and may be purchased back in order to adjust the possible upside participation/downside protection of the portfolio.

Streamlined Investment and Order ManagementAs their business expanded, Main Management set out to find a streamlined platform to manage their trading workflow. “From a best practices standpoint, having an order management system for a firm our size was crucial to growth,” says Luke King, Vice President of Trading and Business Development. “Running trades and managing multiple custodians without an integrated system was very inefficient and time consuming. We also recognized that having robust controls and systems in place has a great deal of value, especially when working with institutional clients.”    Selecting the Right TechnologyTo find the best platform, Main Management identified these key requirements:Model Management: Main Management offers a solutions-based approach that requires both customized and standardized ETF investment strategies.  The strategies need to be implemented quickly, regardless of custodian or account specific requirements.Order Management and Execution: Main Management clients have assets across multiple custodians, including Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade. Creating orders and executing trades across multiple custodians to achieve consistent quality executions is a top priority.Integration: Timely and accurate data is critical to the success of a trade management platform. Seamless integration with the Advent Axys portfolio accounting system is required.ATOM Align BenefitsMain Management decided that ATOM Align was the best solution for their firm because it offers these key advantages:More consistent trade executions across different custodians. With ATOM Align, Main Management can manage trading across all accounts within one system, which allows them to meticulously track their performance and trade executions. “ATOM greatly streamlined the efficiency of our trading process,” King says. “Being able to trade multiple custodians through one platform definitely increases the consistency of our trade executions across our various custodial platforms.”More robust systems and controls for trading.

This means Main Management — and their clients — can have full confidence in their systematic and accurate trade management.Faster reactions to the market. ATOM Align’s streamlined modeling features, combined with its sophisticated order management system, allow Main Management to create trades for hundreds of accounts and execute trades across multiple custodians faster than ever before.Ease and speed of implementation.

BlazePortfolio provides full support for ATOM Align, including all server maintenance, regular upgrades, and bug fixes, as well as phone assistance during trading hours. In addition, BlazePortfolio quickly addresses and resolves all tickets sent to the support team. “We have been extremely happy with the level of service provided,” King says. “Whenever we have a question or an issue with the system, we always receive a quick response and resolution from the ATOM Align support team.”   ResultsFrom 2012 to 2014, the company has become significantly more scalable and has institutionalized their investment management process.

What Our Clients Say









"I began working with Main Street Management in July of 2007 and they made the transition as smooth as possible. Everything is completed in a timely manner and the financials are completed by the 15th of each month. Main Street Management delivers on what they say they are going to do and I know that the information is tracked correctly. I have worked with at least a dozen management companies and Main Street Management has really been the best!"


Michelle L., Developer/Builder





"I am a homeowner and Board Member in a neighborhood that is being managed by Main Street Management. Before they took over, we were faced with many unresolved issues. I can truly say without any reservations that my neighborhood is looking much better. Because of Main Street Management, I believe it is headed in the right direction."


Jeff S.





"When our Association was being turned over to the home owners, the new board was elected. The primary issue at hand had been the lack of responsiveness and comprehensive financial handling of our books. In reviewing management companies, Main Street Management, LLC stood out from the other companies. Since the end of 2007, the progress on our community and financial handling of books have dramatically improved. The home owners have already seen issues not resolved for years becoming addressed such as proper snow plowing, swimming pool area upgrades, and covenant review. The board would recommend Main Street Management to any other HOA looking for services."


Lola J. – Board Member of an HOA

LLCs (Limited Liability Companies)










LLC Basics




Limited liability companies combine the best parts of partnerships and corporations.


By Beth Laurence, J.D.




Share on Google Plus





Share on Facebook













 





A limited liability company (LLC) offers protection from personal liability for business debts, just like a corporation. However, unlike a corporation, which must pay its own taxes, an LLC is a pass-through tax entity: The profits and losses of the business pass through to its owners, who report them on their personal tax returns just as they would if they owned a partnership or sole proprietorship. Moreover, while setting up an LLC is more difficult than creating a partnership or sole proprietorship, running one is significantly easier than running a corporation.
Here are the main features of an LLC:
Limited Personal Liability
Like shareholders of a corporation, all LLC owners are protected from personal liability for business debts and claims. This means that if the business itself can't pay a creditor -- such as a supplier, a lender, or a landlord -- the creditor cannot legally come after an LLC member's house, car, or other personal possessions. Because only LLC assets are used to pay off business debts, LLC owners stand to lose only the money that they've invested in the LLC. This feature is often called "limited liability."
Exceptions to Limited Liability
While LLC owners enjoy limited personal liability for many of their business transactions, this protection is not absolute. This drawback is not unique to LLCs, however -- the same exceptions apply to corporations. An LLC owner can be held personally liable if he or she:

personally and directly injures someone
personally guarantees a bank loan or a business debt on which the LLC defaults
fails to deposit taxes withheld from employees' wages
intentionally does something fraudulent, illegal, or reckless that causes harm to the company or to someone else, or
treats the LLC as an extension of his or her personal affairs, rather than as a separate legal entity.

This last exception is the most important. If owners don't treat the LLC as a separate business, a court might decide that the LLC doesn't really exist and find that its owners are really doing business as individuals who are personally liable for their acts. To keep this from happening, make sure you and your co-owners:

Act fairly and legally. Do not conceal or misrepresent material facts or the state of your finances to vendors, creditors, or other outsiders.
Fund your LLC adequately. Invest enough cash in the business so that your LLC can meet foreseeable expenses and liabilities.
Keep LLC and personal business separate. Get a federal employer identification number, open up a business-only checking account, and keep your personal finances out of your LLC accounting books.
Create an operating agreement. Having a formal written operating agreement lends credibility to your LLC's separate existence. For more on this, see Nolo's article The LLC Operating Agreement.

For more information on LLC limited liability protection and the differences in state laws, see  LLCs and Limited  Liability - What Protection Do You Get?.  


Additional Protection: Business Insurance
A good liability insurance policy can shield your personal assets when limited liability protection does not. For instance, if you are a massage therapist and you accidentally injure a client's back, your liability insurance policy should cover you. Insurance can also protect your personal assets in the event that your limited liability status is ignored by a court.
In addition to protecting your personal assets in such situations, insurance can protect the LLC's assets from lawsuits and claims. But your LLC won't be protected if it doesn't pay its bills: Commercial insurance usually does not protect personal or corporate assets from unpaid business debts, whether or not they're personally guaranteed.
For more information on insurance, see Nolo's article Obtaining Small Business Insurance.
LLC Taxes
Unlike a corporation, an LLC is not considered separate from its owners for tax purposes. Instead, it is what the IRS calls a "pass-through entity," like a partnership or sole proprietorship. This means that business income passes through the business to the LLC members, who report their share of profits -- or losses -- on their individual income tax returns. Each LLC member must make quarterly estimated tax payments to the IRS.
While an LLC itself doesn't pay taxes, co-owned LLCs must file Form 1065, an informational return, with the IRS each year. This form, which partnerships also have to file, sets out each LLC member's share of the LLC's profits (or losses), which the IRS reviews to make sure LLC members are correctly reporting their income.
For more information on LLC taxes, see Nolo's article How LLCs Are Taxed.
LLC Management
The owners of most small LLCs participate equally in the management of their business. This arrangement is called "member management."
There is an alternative management structure -- somewhat awkwardly called "manager management" -- in which you designate one or more owners (or even an outsider) to take responsibility for managing the LLC. The nonmanaging owners (sometimes family members who have invested in the company) simply sit back and share in LLC profits.
In a manager-managed LLC, only the named managers get to vote on management decisions and act as agents of the LLC. Choosing manager management sometimes makes sense, but it might require you to deal with state and federal laws regulating the sale of securities. (For more information, see Nolo's Limited Liability Company (LLC) FAQ.)
Forming an LLC
To create an LLC, you file "articles of organization" (in some states called a "certificate of organization" or "certificate of formation") with the LLC division of your state government. This office is often in the same department as the corporations division, which is usually part of the secretary of state's office. Filing fees range from about $100 to $800. Now, in every state, you can  form an LLC with just one person.
Many states supply a blank one-page form for the articles of organization, on which you need only specify a few basic details about your LLC, such as its name and address, and contact information for a person involved with the LLC (usually called a "registered agent") who will receive legal papers on its behalf. Some states also require you to list the names and addresses of the LLC members.
In addition to filing articles of organization, you must create a written LLC operating agreement. You don't have to file your operating agreement with the state, but that doesn't mean you can get by without one. The operating agreement is a crucial document because it sets out the LLC members' rights and responsibilities, their percentage interests in the business, and their share of the profits.
To learn more about these and other details involved in setting up an LLC, read Nolo's article How to Form an LLC. To form your LLC right now, use Nolo's Online LLC, which will collect the required information and file your articles of organization with your state.
Ending an LLC
Under the laws of many states, unless your operating agreement says otherwise, when one member wants to leave the LLC, the company dissolves. In that case, the LLC members must fulfill any remaining business obligations, pay off all debts, divide any assets and profits among themselves, and then decide whether they want to start a new LLC to continue the business with the remaining members.
Your LLC operating agreement can prevent this kind of abrupt ending to your business by including "buy-sell," or buyout, provisions that set up guidelines for what will happen when one member retires, dies, becomes disabled, or leaves the LLC to pursue other interests. (For more information, see Nolo's article Plan Ahead for LLC Ownership Changes.)

What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

RETIREMENT PLANS 401k
The Main 401k solution offers a significant upgrade to the traditional defined contribution plan. It offers participants many advantages not available in traditional "do-it-yourself" 401(k) plans. The key differentiator is relieving employees of the burden of the asset allocation decisions that have the greatest impact on portfolio returns and placing that responsibility in the hands of investment professionals. 
Traditional plans require each plan participant to essentially act as the portfolio manager of their 401k plan assets. In other words the choice of whether to buy Emerging Market Bonds or Large Cap Value stocks are managed by participants. Typically though few of them have the time to effectively keep up with market fluctuations on an ongoing basis.
The Main Management 401k places critical asset allocation decisions into the hands of an experienced three person Investment Committee.  They actively manages four dynamic ETF risk based portfolios which provide solutions for participants from their 20s until well into their retirement years. As such Main Management becomes an investment fiduciary to the plan thus relieving the plan sponsor of this duty. 
To learn more about Main Management may improve the retirement benefits of a 401(k) plan and dramatically reduce the personal liability of plan fiduciaries, please call us (415) 217-5800.
