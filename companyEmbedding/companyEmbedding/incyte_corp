Eli Lilly beats profit and sales expectations; NDA for RA treatment to be delayed
Eli Lilly & Co.  reported a second-quarter net profit that rose to $1.01 billion, or 95 cents a share, from $747.7 million, or 71 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted EPS was $1.11, beating the FactSet consensus of $1.05. Revenue rose 8% to $5.82 billion, above the FactSet consensus of $5.59 billion, as strong growth in new pharmaceutical products helped offset weakness in animal health. For 2017, the drug giant expects adjusted EPS of $4.10 to $4.20, surrounding the FactSet consensus of $4.12, while the revenue outlook was raised to $22.0 billion to $22.5 billion from $21.8 billion to $22.3 billion. Separately, Lilly and Incyte Corp.  said a resubmission for the new drug application for a treatment of rheumatoid arthritis will be delayed beyond 2017, as the FDA has indicated a new clinical study is necessary. Lilly's stock was indicated slightly lower in premarket trade, while Incyte's stock tumbled 2.6%. Year to date, Lilly shares have rallied 15% while the S&P 500  has gained 10.3%.

Eli Lilly beats profit and sales expectations; NDA for RA treatment to be delayed
Eli Lilly & Co.  reported a second-quarter net profit that rose to $1.01 billion, or 95 cents a share, from $747.7 million, or 71 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted EPS was $1.11, beating the FactSet consensus of $1.05. Revenue rose 8% to $5.82 billion, above the FactSet consensus of $5.59 billion, as strong growth in new pharmaceutical products helped offset weakness in animal health. For 2017, the drug giant expects adjusted EPS of $4.10 to $4.20, surrounding the FactSet consensus of $4.12, while the revenue outlook was raised to $22.0 billion to $22.5 billion from $21.8 billion to $22.3 billion. Separately, Lilly and Incyte Corp.  said a resubmission for the new drug application for a treatment of rheumatoid arthritis will be delayed beyond 2017, as the FDA has indicated a new clinical study is necessary. Lilly's stock was indicated slightly lower in premarket trade, while Incyte's stock tumbled 2.6%. Year to date, Lilly shares have rallied 15% while the S&P 500  has gained 10.3%.

How AstraZeneca Failed Not Once — But Twice — In Cancer Drugs
AstraZeneca (AZN) not only failed in a lung cancer trial — which had the side effect of sending rival Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) spiraling — but its partnership with Dow's Merck (MRK) appears to be "an admission of defeat in the initial immuno-oncology race." Shares of AstraZeneca and Bristol-Myers sold off in droves early Thursday. On the stock market today, AstraZeneca took a pitfall to a five-month low, down 14.6%, near 29. Bristol, too,

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Incyte, Corp is an American pharmaceutical company based in Alapocas, Delaware.[3] The company was founded in Palo Alto, California in 1991 and went public in 1993.[1]
Incyte has one drug, Jakafi, which has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and has been prescribed to several thousands of patients in the United States.[3]
As of 2014 the company was developing baricitinib, an oral JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor drug for rheumatoid arthritis in partnership with Eli Lilly.[4][5] It gained EU approval in February 2017.[6] In April 2017, the US FDA issued a rejection, citing concerns about dosing and safety.[7][8]
As of 2016 epacadostat, an Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1) inhibitor, is in development for various cancers.[9] The ECHO-202 study (NCT02178722) is evaluating epacadostat in combination with Keytruda (pembrolizumab)*, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy.[10][11] In 2017 the phase III KEYNOTE-252/ECHO-301 trial (also with pembrolizumab[12]) reported good results for epacadostat (INCB024360) in some types of melanoma.[13]
Novartis acquired Incyte's c-Met inhibitor capmatinib (INC280, INCB028060), which is in Phase II clinical trial as monotherapy in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.[14]
History[edit]
In 2014, Incyte named Hervé Hoppenot president and CEO.[15] Hoppenot had previously served as the president of Novartis Oncology; he had been with Novartis since 2003.[15]
In September 2015, the company announced it had gained exclusive development and commercial right pertaining to Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine Co., Ltd's anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, SHR-1210, in a deal worth $795+ million.[16]

A Look at Incyte’s Product Portfolio

				Feb 28, 2017				11:22 am EDT            










Incyte’s product portfolio
Incyte’s (INCY) product portfolio includes drugs for oncology as well as non-oncology. For oncology, its product portfolio includes targeted therapies as well as immunotherapies. However, products marketed by Incyte only include Jakafi and Iclusig. Another product, baricitinib, is under pivotal studies for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.

The above chart shows the present status of drugs under development by Incyte. As we saw earlier, Jakafi is licensed to Novartis (NVS) for marketing outside the United States under the name Jakavi. Worldwide rights for the drug capmatinib are licensed to Novartis, while worldwide rights for the drug baricitinib are licensed to Eli Lilly (LLY).



Oncology products 
Incyte has classified its oncology product portfolio into the following two categories based on the method of treatment used for the disease:
targeted anti-cancer therapies
immuno-oncology or immunotherapies
Targeted anti-cancer therapies include drugs that target cancer cells but cause less damage to normal cells. Jakafi (ruxolitinib) and capmatinib are targeted-therapy drugs in Incyte’s portfolio.
Immunotherapies target a patient’s immune system to fight cancer cells. Epacadostat is an immunotherapy drug in Incyte’s portfolio.
Incyte added Iclusig to its portfolio after acquiring rights from Ariad Pharmaceuticals (ARIA) in June 2016. Iclusig (ponatinib) is approved for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia as well as Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia for patients who cannot be treated with other tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
On December 21, 2016, Incyte announced a global strategic research collaboration with Merus (MRUS). The collaboration involves the discovery and development of bispecific antibodies based on Merus’s Biclonics technology for the expansion of Incyte’s large molecule portfolio.
Non-oncology  
Non-oncology drugs include baricitinib and ruxolitinib. Baricitinib is licensed to Eli Lilly (LLY).
The European Commission approved a marketing authorization application for Olumiant (baricitinib), a drug for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, on February 13, 2017. Incyte will receive milestone payments of $65.0 million from Eli Lilly for baricitinib, which it will report in 1Q17.
Incyte also announced an agreement with Eli Lilly for the development and commercialization of ruxolitinib for the treatment of graft-versus-host disease in the United States. It entered into another agreement with Novartis for the development and commercialization of ruxolitinib outside the United States. The registration process for ruxolitinib in US markets was initiated in the second half of 2016.
To divest the risk, you can consider ETFs such as the PowerShares Dynamic Biotech & Genome ETF (PBE), which holds ~5.9% of its total assets in Incyte.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Non-oncology drugs include Baricitinib and Ruxolitinib. Baricitinib is licensed to Eli Lilly. Incyte will receive milestone payments from Lilly for Baricitinib after the approval of the drug and royalties thereafter. AbbVie’s (ABBV) Humira is also used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
Incyte also announced an agreement with Lilly for development and commercialization of Ruxolitinib for the treatment of graft-versus-host disease in the US markets and another agreement with Novartis for development and commercialization rights of Ruxolitinib outside the US markets.
Investors can consider ETFs like the PowerShares Dynamic Biotech and Genome ETF (PBE), which holds ~4.9% of its total assets in Incyte, in order to divest the risk.
