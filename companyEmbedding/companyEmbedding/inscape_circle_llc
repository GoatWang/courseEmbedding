This App Has Changed My Life
     

by

    Everyone MUST try this app! I never thought I could be someone who meditates regularly, until I found Inscape. I originally started by attending their studio classes, and then downloaded this app as I travel a great deal for work. It has absolutely everything you need to begin, maintain, and deepen a daily meditation practice. From the instruction to soothing music, this is the most well designed program I have come across in my years of searching for a way to consistently engage in meditation. Thank you to the Inscape team for creating something that has changed my life on a daily basis and, as a result, on a large scale!
  



Great second daily meditation

    I do a zen seated practice every morning but have had a hard time creating a habit for a second daily practice. I find in the evening, the rest guidance and lovely music make a great counter practice to my silent sitting and have finally gotten me on track for two practices daily. Highly recommended, haven't had a poor meditation here yet.
  



Exceptional App
     

by
        
          Cyranreg
        
        
      

    Very well put together. Numerous meditation approaches and options to customize individual sessions. One size does not fit all so the user is enabled to identify an technique that maximizes their individual benefits. Gentle reminders encourage consistent practice.I would encourage anyone with a desire to see the benefits of meditation to try this App. For maximum benefit, the in App purchases are a must.
