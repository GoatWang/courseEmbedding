Leadership















Joseph Logue
Defense and Intelligence Group Lead







Meet Joe
Executive Vice President 





Everything I know about leadership I learned on the football field.
There are 10 other people on the field looking to you for guidance and reassurance, making sure they are in the right place, making sure they know what they need to do. And then making sure you are calling the plays when you need to, to make sure that you win.
For me, those skills translate well to leading the firm’s defense, intelligence and international businesses. They also served me well in my previous life as an entrepreneur— I started my first company fresh out of college and sold it a decade later.

How would you characterize Booz Allen’s entrepreneuriual spirit? We have a conservative entrepreneurial spirit that we need to continue to foster to become that much more audacious. We’ve made tremendous progress but we still have a ways to go.
 
What do you do to foster that sense of audaciousness? Try to make sure people know that I believe if you don’t ever fail you aren’t being aggressive enough. I accept failure. I encourage it.
 
How did you come to have that philosophy? My background and experience. You have to be confident to know you can succeed. And if it doesn’t work, you are confident enough in your abilities to go do something else.
 
What are your tips for managing people and keeping them motivated? Management and inspiration is personal. You need to make sure that people continue to recognize that looking someone in the eyes and being in constant communication is what creates trust, loyalty, and helps to create opportunity for people around them.
 
What advice would you give to yourself as a young professional? Same advice I give my 19-year-old son: When you look back on a decision you made, if you can look yourself in the mirror and know that you did everything you could to make the best decision you could, the outcome doesn’t matter. Second, while people may question who you are and what you do, the only confidence that matters is the confidence you have in yourself. Third, at the root of it, people mostly are good at heart; believe in them. If you give them what they need to succeed and the room to do it, they will.
 
What do you do outside of work? I coach. Basketball, some football teams, because I played both. I played football in college, tight end and strong safety. I spend a lot of time with my family. We are active people. We ski in the spring, go to the beach in the summer.
 
What was a formative experience you had growing up? When I was a junior in high school, I was asked to convert a two-story American Legion home in Fayetteville, Pennsylvania, into two separate apartments—and I had no idea what to do. My brother-in-law gave me some guidance, gave me the tools. I learned how to build kitchens and bathrooms, do plumbing, create windows, create doorways, put in floors, over a summer. Every day there was failure, every day there was success. Every day you looked at a room that didn’t even exist yet and used your mind to try to create what the future was going to look like, and then you’d build it. That’s pretty much how I’ve lived.
 
How does that relate to what you do today? You can’t be an entrepreneur, you can’t be a leader, unless you can walk into an empty room and imagine what can be, and then fill it.
