Guigui has twice been honored by the City of Los Angeles for Artistic Contributions to Music Education.

All For One Media Corp. CEO, Brian Lukow, commented, "After an exhaustive search for the right Director, Martin Guigui's success and knowledge in the cross over worlds of the music industry and film business made him the obvious choice to direct 'Crazy for the Boys.'"  Martin Guigui added, "I have always wanted to find the right Musical to direct, and when 'Crazy for the Boys' landed in my world I was instantly enamored by its infectious songs, super hip girl band, and ever so relevant Anti-Bully theme."

"Crazy for the Boys" has been described as a modern day "Grease." It is based on the fictionalized back-story of the five girls who are in their senior year of High School, and built around an Anti-Bullying theme. "Crazy for the Boys" is a perfect teen "coming of age" musical dramedy completely capturing the nuances of High School: teen angst, unrequited love, the mean popular girl, and peer pressure. The movie features a full soundtrack/album of instantly likable pop songs and infectious choreography.
