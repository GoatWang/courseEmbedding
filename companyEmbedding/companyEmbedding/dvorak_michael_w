Hydrostatic drive system



Patent number:  9347554
                                            

Abstract:  A hydrostatic drive system for a machine is disclosed. The hydrostatic drive system includes a pump, a hydraulic motor configured to receive a pressurized fluid from the pump and a controller operably connected to the pump and the hydraulic motor. The controller is configured to receive an input signal indicative of a current machine speed and a desired machine speed. Further, the controller is configured to output a motor displacement command signal and a pump displacement command signal to adjust a displacement of the hydraulic motor and the pump respectively based on the input signal to maintain at least one of constant machine speed or constant acceleration or constant deceleration during adjustment of the pump displacement and the motor displacement.

Over-speed control system and method



Patent number:  9303633
                                            

Abstract:  A hydraulic power control system includes an engine driving a variable displacement pump. The variable displacement pump is fluidly connected to a first passageway and a second passageway, and has a selectively variable displacement that is adjustable in response to a pump displacement command signal. A hydraulic motor fluidly connected to the first and second passageways operates by a flow of hydraulic fluid originating from the pump. A controller receives an engine speed signal and adjusts pump displacement based on the engine speed signal to reduce the rotation speed of the pump when an overrun condition is present.

Hystat drive system having coasting functionality



Patent number:  9096230
                                            

Abstract:  A drive system for a machine is disclosed. The drive system may have an engine, a pump driven by the engine to pressurize fluid, a motor connected to the pump via an inlet passage and an outlet passage, and a traction device driven by the motor. The drive system may also have an operator input device movable from a neutral position through a range to a maximum displaced position to affect a speed of the engine, and a controller in communication with the input device and at least one of the pump and motor. The controller may be configured to gradually adjust a displacement of the at least one of the pump and motor to slow the traction device over a period of time after the operator input device is returned to the neutral position.

Hydraulic Drive System



Publication number:  20150198245
                                            

Abstract:  A drive system includes a continuously variable displacement pump and a motor hydraulically driven by the pump. A controller is configured to determine a motor displacement command to shift the motor from a first displacement to a second displacement, and a pump displacement command to change the displacement of the pump. The controller further coordinates transmittal of the pump displacement command and the motor displacement command to maintain the travel speed of the machine while changing the displacement of the pump and shifting the motor from the first motor displacement to the second motor displacement.

Hydrostatic circuits with variable charge and variable flushing systems



Patent number:  8833069
                                            

Abstract:  A closed hydrostatic circuit with variable charge and variable flushing systems is disclosed. A variable displacement charge pump is configured to supply charge fluid and pilot control fluid to the hydrostatic circuit. An electronically controlled pressure regulating valve is in communication with an output of the charge pump and is linked to a controller. When the hydrostatic control system detects a high hydraulic temperature condition, the electronically controlled pressure regulating valve, that is in communication with an output of the charge pump and that is linked to a controller, increases the charge pump flow. A bidirectional variable displacement hydrostatic motor is connected in parallel to two input/output lines. A flush valve is in communication with the hydrostatic motor and both input/output lines. The flush valve and hydrostatic motor are both in communication with the flush orifice and a flush relief valve.

Over-Speed Control System and Method



Publication number:  20140075930
                                            

Abstract:  A hydraulic power control system includes an engine driving a variable displacement pump. The variable displacement pump is fluidly connected to a first passageway and a second passageway, and has a selectively variable displacement that is adjustable in response to a pump displacement command signal. A hydraulic motor fluidly connected to the first and second passageways operates by a flow of hydraulic fluid originating from the pump. A controller receives an engine speed signal and adjusts pump displacement based on the engine speed signal to reduce the rotation speed of the pump when an overrun condition is present.

Traction Control System for a Hydrostatic Drive



Publication number:  20140069092
                                            

Abstract:  A hydraulic pump control circuit may include a pressure reducing valve selectively operable to limit the amount of fluid pressure available to an actuator operably coupled to a pump displacement volume adjusting mechanism of a variable displacement pump. The pump may be hydraulically coupled to a motor configured to provide a torque output. The reduced pressure to the actuator limits actuator travel, thereby limiting pump displacement. Accordingly, torque output of the motor may be reduced, thereby improving traction control.

DISABLING AN IMPLANTED MEDICAL DEVICE WITH ANOTHER MEDICAL DEVICE



Publication number:  20120197332
                                            

Abstract:  Various techniques for disabling a first implantable medical device (IMD) by modulation of therapeutic electrical stimulation delivered by a second medical device are described. One example method includes delivering therapeutic electrical stimulation from a more recently implanted second IMD at a higher average rate than the previously implanted first IMD so that only the more recently implanted IMD will administer therapy, and modulating stimulation by the more recently implanted IMD in order to send a disable command to the previously implanted IMD.
