SAN DIEGO and PHOENIX, July 25, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Creative Medical Technology Holdings, Inc. (OTCQB:CELZ), a clinical stage stem cell company, announced preclinical data showing exosomes harvested from its patented AmnioStem amniotic fluid stem cell, selectively inhibit growth of glioma brain cancer cells.  








Exosomes are nanoparticles generated by a variety of cells that are critically involved in intercellular communication.  The Company previously filed patents on the use of AmnioStem derived exosomes for treatment of stroke1.  The AmnioStem technology was originally licensed from the University of California San Diego (UCSD), under an exclusive agreement covering issued US Patent #7,569,3852.
"Having seen first-hand the devastation and lack of treatment options in glioma patients, I am excited about the prospect of developing a non-toxic biological approach that eventually may provide benefit to this group of patients," said Santosh Kesari, MD, Ph.D, FANA, FAAN, Chair and Professor, Department of Translational Neurosciences and Neurotherapeutics, John Wayne Cancer Institute, as well as Director of Neuro-oncology, Providence Saint John's Health Center and leads the Pacific Neuroscience Research Center at Pacific Neuroscience Institute.
"The filed patent application contains data showing that while AmnioStem derived exosomes inhibited proliferation of glioma cells, other stem cell types actually increased proliferation of glioma," said Thomas Ichim, Ph.D, Chief Scientific Officer of Creative Medical Technology Holdings.  "We are currently working under the possibility that AmnioStem stem cells may possess unique biological properties that are different from other types of stem cells."
"From a commercialization perspective, exosomes are simpler to manufacture, store, and deliver as compared to living cells.  Additionally, since exosomes are not replicating cells, we anticipate a less complicated FDA regulatory pathway as compared to cellular based products," said Timothy Warbington, President and CEO of Creative Medical Technology Holdings.

History
STEMCELL Technologies Inc. is a Canadian biotechnology company that develops specialty cell culture media, cell isolation systems and accessory products for life science research. Driven by science and a passion for quality, STEMCELL supports the advancement of scientific research around the world with our catalogue of more than 2000 cell biology research tools.
STEMCELL Technologies was launched in 1993 when founder and CEO Allen Eaves needed a way to meet the increasing demands for his standardized, cost-effective cell culture media for growing blood-forming stem cells. At the time, Eaves was a hematologist and cancer researcher heading the Terry Fox Laboratories (TFL) and head of clinical hematology at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. Unsatisfied with commercially available cell culture reagents, Eaves’ research group at the TFL began making their own hematopoietic stem cell culture media using the highest quality materials they could find. Colleagues also wanted to use this media, and Eaves was able to supplement his research funds by selling culture media to other lab groups.
Eventually the demand for the media from researchers around the world warranted building a designated clean room for production. The TFL did not have the funding and instead, Eaves was encouraged to purchase the business and create an independent company. Mortgaging his house and receiving a loan from Western Economic Diversification, Eaves was able to build a clean room and STEMCELL Technologies Inc. was born on July 2, 1993. STEMCELL has become the largest biotech company in Canada and continues to reinvest all profits back into developing products to better support the international research community.  As of 2017, the company employs more than 1000 people globally, with over one-third of those holding a PhD or MSc, and the majority of employees having a BSc or Engineering degree. A large number of the company’s employees are located in Vancouver, Canada with additional employees and facilities in 11 other countries.


Mission
To advance the pursuit of scientific knowledge by supplying high quality, innovative reagents, tools and services that enable life science research.


Vision
To have our products used in all research labs around the world, facilitating discoveries in life sciences.


Expertise
Company
STEMCELL specializes in developing cell culture media, cell separation systems, instruments and other reagents for use in life sciences research across the basic to translational research continuum. Our products are designed and developed by highly trained, world class scientists to streamline research protocols, reduce experimental variability, and increase the accuracy of results. We develop our product lines to support entire experimental workflows, from cell isolation through characterization, expansion, differentiation, maintenance and storage, and are always looking for ways to further support our customers through training, knowledge and new products. STEMCELL’s Research and Development team often collaborates with academic partners to develop, produce and distribute products specific to a given research field.
Products
In addition to expanding our original line of hematology products, we have grown our product portfolio to include a comprehensive suite of immune cell isolation tools as well as products that support research using pluripotent stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells. We have also developed suites of products optimized for neural, mammary, prostate, pulmonary, pancreatic, and intestinal cell biology research. Additionally, STEMCELL’s Contract Assay Services department supports researchers by developing tailor-made in vitro assays customized for their research needs. Finally, by offering accessory components such as primary cells, antibodies and cytokines, as well as labware and instruments via our Bioengineering division, STEMCELL provides scientists with all of the tools necessary to carry out their research.
Science Communications
We know that effective training, communication and collaboration is essential for science to happen. As a company, STEMCELL is deeply rooted in the scientific community and science education, and these values drive an ongoing effort to provide scientists with the resources that they need to keep current with the latest scientific advances and innovations in their fields. For example, our Education team provides hands-on training courses and workshops as well as proficiency testing for assay standardization and custom on-site education courses. We also produce professional quality videos that provide product support and education, as well as host webinars with field experts and offer free wallcharts, technical bulletins, blogs, newsletters and other communications resources to support the exchange of scientific knowledge and keep researchers informed about tools, tips and technologies in their fields.

HOLDINGS, INC. 

  NOTES
TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

AS OF
SEPTEMBER 30, 2016

(UNAUDITED)

 

NOTE 1 -
ORGANIZATION, DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS, AND BASIS OF
PRESENTATION  

 

Stemcell
Holdings, Inc., formerly known as Perfect Acquisition, Inc. (the
“Company”), a growth company, was incorporated under
the laws of the State of Delaware on December 31, 2015, with an
objective to acquire, or merge with, an operating business. On
March 24, 2016, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement
(the “Stock Purchase Agreement”) with Takaaki Matsuoka,
our President, CEO and Director. Pursuant to this Agreement, on
March 24, 2016 Takaaki Matsuoka transferred to the Company, 500
shares of the common stock of Stemcell Co., Ltd., a Japan
corporation (“Stemcell”), which represented all of its
issued and outstanding shares, in consideration of 5,000,000 JPY
($44,476). Following the effective date of the share purchase
transaction above on March 24, 2016, Stemcell Holdings, Inc. gained
a 100% interest in the issued and outstanding shares of
Stemcell’s common stock and Stemcell became a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Company. The Company conducts a regenerative
medicine-related business which includes but is not limited to the
culturing, storing and delivery of stem cells through
Stemcell.

 

The
accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of
the Company have been prepared in accordance with the rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC,
including the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X. In the
opinion of the management of the Company, all adjustments, which
are of a normal recurring nature, necessary for a fair statement of
the results for the three month period, have been made. Results for
the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the
results that might be expected for the entire fiscal year. When
used in these notes, the terms “Company”,
“we”, “us” or “our” mean the
Company. Certain information and note disclosure normally included
in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States of America has
been omitted from these statements pursuant to such accounting
principles and, accordingly, they do not include all the
information and notes necessary for comprehensive financial
statements and should be read in conjunction with our audited
financial statements for the year ended December 31,
2015.

 

NOTE 2 -
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

 

PRINCIPLES
OF CONSOLIDATION

 

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Stemcell Co., Ltd.
Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated.

 

ACCOUNTS
RECEIVABLE

 

Accounts
receivable are recognized and carried at the original invoice
amount less allowance for any uncollectible amounts. An estimate
for doubtful accounts is made when collection of the full amount is
no longer probable. Bad debts are written off as
incurred.

 

PROPERTY,
PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

 

Property,
plant and equipment (“PPE”) is stated at cost and
depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the
estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated
useful lives of our PPE are generally as follows: computer software
developed or acquired for internal use, 2 to 3 years; computer
equipment, 2 to 3 years; buildings and improvements, 5 to 15 years;
leasehold improvements, 2 to 10 years; and furniture and equipment,
1 to 5 years. Land is not depreciated.

 

FOREIGN
CURRENCY TRANSLATION

 

The
reporting currency of the Company is the United States Dollars
(“US$”) and the accompanying financial statements have
been expressed in US$. The Company maintains its books and record
in its local currency, Japanese YEN (“JPY”), which is a
functional currency as being the primary currency of the economic
environment in which its operation is conducted. In accordance with
ASC Topic 830-30, “Translation of Financial Statement”,
assets and liabilities of the Company whose functional currency is
not US$ are translated into US$, using the exchange rate on the
balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average
rates prevailing during the period. The gains and losses resulting
from translation of financial statements are recorded as a separate
component of accumulated other comprehensive income within the
statements of shareholders’ equity.

 

Transactions
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are
translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates
prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional
currency are translated into the functional currency using the
applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting
exchange differences are recorded in the statements of
operations. 

 

Translation
of amounts from the local currency of the Company into US$1 has
been made at the following exchange rates:




 



September
30, 2016





Current
JPY: US$1 exchange rate



101.33





Average
JPY: US$1 exchange rate



108.48




 

RELATED
PARTY TRANSACTION

 

A related
party is generally defined as (i) any person that holds 10% or more
of the Company’s securities and their immediate families,
(ii) the Company’s management, (iii) someone that directly or
indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control
with the Company, or (iv) anyone who can significantly influence
the financial and operating decisions of the Company. A transaction
is considered to be a related party transaction when there is a
transfer of resources or obligations between related parties. The
Company conducts business with its related parties in the ordinary
course of business.

 

Transactions
involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on
an arm's-length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive,
free market dealings may not exist. Representations about
transactions with related parties, if made, shall not imply that
the related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent
to those that prevail in arm's-length transactions unless such
representations can be substantiated.

 

COMPREHENSIVE
INCOME OR LOSS

 

ASC Topic
220, “Comprehensive Income”, establishes standards for
reporting and display of comprehensive income or loss, its
components and accumulated balances. Accumulated comprehensive
income, as presented in the accompanying statements of
shareholders’ equity consists of changes in unrealized gains
and losses on foreign currency translation. This comprehensive
income or loss is not included in the computation of income tax
expense or benefit.

REVENUE
RECOGNITION  

 

The
Company applies paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification for revenue recognition. The Company will
recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. The
Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when
all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of
an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the
services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales price
is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably
assured. The Company provides the warranty for the delivery of its
service. If the Company cannot deliver its service to customers
successfully, the Company retry its operation until the delivery is
completed.

 

INCOME
TAXES

 

The
Company follows Section 740-10-30 of the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and
liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that
have been included in the financial statements or tax returns.
Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on
the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of
assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the
year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax
assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent
management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets
will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
the Statements of Operations in the period that includes the
enactment date. The Company adopted section 740-10-25 of the FASB
Accounting Standards Codification ("Section 740-10-25"). Section
740-10-25 addresses the determination of whether tax benefits
claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be
recorded in the financial statements. Under Section 740-10-25, the
Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax
position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position
will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based
on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits
recognized in the financial statements from such a position should
be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than
fifty percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate
settlement. Section 740-10-25 also provides guidance on
de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income
taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased
disclosures. The Company had no material adjustments to its
liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits according to the
provisions of Section 740-10-25.

 

As of
September 30, 2016, the Company did not have any significant
unrecognized uncertain tax positions.

 

The
Company conducts its major businesses in Japan and is subject to
tax in this jurisdiction. As a result of its business activities,
the Company files tax returns that are subject to examination by
the local tax authority.

 

Enterprise
income tax in Japan is generally charged at 29.97% of a
company’s assessable profit. The Company’s subsidiaries
incorporated in Japan are subject to Japanese enterprises income
tax at the applicable tax rates on the taxable income as reported
in their Japanese statutory accounts in accordance with the
relevant enterprises income tax laws applicable to foreign
enterprises.

 

The
Company is governed by the Income Tax Law of Japan as well as Tokyo
Local Income Tax Law (“the Income Tax Laws”). Under the
Income Tax Laws, Corporations in Tokyo, Japan are generally subject
to an income tax at an effective rate of 29.97% on income as
reported in their statutory financial statements after appropriate
tax adjustments unless the enterprise is located in specially
designated regions of cities for which more favorable effective tax
rates apply.

 

 
NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN

 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared on a
basis of accounting assuming that the Company is a going concern
that contemplates realization of assets and satisfaction of
liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company is
considered a start-up company and has not yet generated continuous
revenue. Additionally, 69% of the revenues of the Company were from
the related party for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.
These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern. The Company will offer
noncash consideration and seek equity lines as a means of financing
its operations. If the Company is unable to obtain
revenue-producing contracts or financing or if the revenue or
financing it does obtain is insufficient to cover any operating
losses it may incur, it may substantially curtail or terminate its
operations or seek other business opportunities through strategic
alliances, acquisitions or other arrangements that may dilute the
interests of existing stockholders.

 

NOTE 4 -
RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS

 

On January
27, 2016, Mr. Jeffrey DeNunzio, the former sole shareholder of the
Company, consummated a sale of 40,000,000,000 shares of our common
stock to Dr. Takaaki Matsuoka., for an aggregate purchase price of
$30,000. Following the closing of the share purchase transaction,
Dr. Matsuoka gained a 100% interest in the issued and outstanding
shares of our common stock. Commensurate with the closing, the
Company, filed with the Delaware Secretary of State, a Certificate
of Amendment to change the name of Registrant to Stemcell Holdings,
Inc.

 

On January
27, 2016, Mr. Jeffrey DeNunzio resigned as our Chief Executive
Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Director, Secretary,
and Treasurer.

 

On January
27, 2016, Dr. Takaaki Matsuoka was appointed as Chief Executive

and Treasurer.

On March
24, 2016, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with
Takaaki Matsuoka. Pursuant to this Agreement, on March 24, 2016

of the common stock of Stemcell Co., Ltd., a Japan corporation
(“Stemcell”), which represented all of its issued and
outstanding shares, in consideration of 5,000,000 JPY
(approximately $44,476). This is a merger of entities under common

revenues and nominal assets.

  NOTES
TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

AS OF
SEPTEMBER 30, 2016

(UNAUDITED)

 

NOTE 1 -
ORGANIZATION, DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS, AND BASIS OF
PRESENTATION  

 

Stemcell
Holdings, Inc., formerly known as Perfect Acquisition, Inc. (the
“Company”), a growth company, was incorporated under
the laws of the State of Delaware on December 31, 2015, with an
objective to acquire, or merge with, an operating business. On
March 24, 2016, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement
(the “Stock Purchase Agreement”) with Takaaki Matsuoka,
our President, CEO and Director. Pursuant to this Agreement, on
March 24, 2016 Takaaki Matsuoka transferred to the Company, 500
shares of the common stock of Stemcell Co., Ltd., a Japan
corporation (“Stemcell”), which represented all of its
issued and outstanding shares, in consideration of 5,000,000 JPY
($44,476). Following the effective date of the share purchase
transaction above on March 24, 2016, Stemcell Holdings, Inc. gained
a 100% interest in the issued and outstanding shares of
Stemcell’s common stock and Stemcell became a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Company. The Company conducts a regenerative
medicine-related business which includes but is not limited to the
culturing, storing and delivery of stem cells through
Stemcell.

 

The
accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of
the Company have been prepared in accordance with the rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC,
including the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X. In the
opinion of the management of the Company, all adjustments, which
are of a normal recurring nature, necessary for a fair statement of
the results for the three month period, have been made. Results for
the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the
results that might be expected for the entire fiscal year. When
used in these notes, the terms “Company”,
“we”, “us” or “our” mean the
Company. Certain information and note disclosure normally included
in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States of America has
been omitted from these statements pursuant to such accounting
principles and, accordingly, they do not include all the
information and notes necessary for comprehensive financial
statements and should be read in conjunction with our audited
financial statements for the year ended December 31,
2015.

 

NOTE 2 -
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

 

PRINCIPLES
OF CONSOLIDATION

 

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Stemcell Co., Ltd.
Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated.

 

ACCOUNTS
RECEIVABLE

 

Accounts
receivable are recognized and carried at the original invoice
amount less allowance for any uncollectible amounts. An estimate
for doubtful accounts is made when collection of the full amount is
no longer probable. Bad debts are written off as
incurred.

 

PROPERTY,
PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

 

Property,
plant and equipment (“PPE”) is stated at cost and
depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the
estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated
useful lives of our PPE are generally as follows: computer software
developed or acquired for internal use, 2 to 3 years; computer
equipment, 2 to 3 years; buildings and improvements, 5 to 15 years;
leasehold improvements, 2 to 10 years; and furniture and equipment,
1 to 5 years. Land is not depreciated.

 

FOREIGN
CURRENCY TRANSLATION

 

The
reporting currency of the Company is the United States Dollars
(“US$”) and the accompanying financial statements have
been expressed in US$. The Company maintains its books and record
in its local currency, Japanese YEN (“JPY”), which is a
functional currency as being the primary currency of the economic
environment in which its operation is conducted. In accordance with
ASC Topic 830-30, “Translation of Financial Statement”,
assets and liabilities of the Company whose functional currency is
not US$ are translated into US$, using the exchange rate on the
balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average
rates prevailing during the period. The gains and losses resulting
from translation of financial statements are recorded as a separate
component of accumulated other comprehensive income within the
statements of shareholders’ equity.

 

Transactions
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are
translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates
prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional
currency are translated into the functional currency using the
applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting
exchange differences are recorded in the statements of
operations. 

 

Translation
of amounts from the local currency of the Company into US$1 has
been made at the following exchange rates:




 



September
30, 2016





Current
JPY: US$1 exchange rate



101.33





Average
JPY: US$1 exchange rate



108.48




 

RELATED
PARTY TRANSACTION

 

A related
party is generally defined as (i) any person that holds 10% or more
of the Company’s securities and their immediate families,
(ii) the Company’s management, (iii) someone that directly or
indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control
with the Company, or (iv) anyone who can significantly influence
the financial and operating decisions of the Company. A transaction
is considered to be a related party transaction when there is a
transfer of resources or obligations between related parties. The
Company conducts business with its related parties in the ordinary
course of business.

 

Transactions
involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on
an arm's-length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive,
free market dealings may not exist. Representations about
transactions with related parties, if made, shall not imply that
the related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent
to those that prevail in arm's-length transactions unless such
representations can be substantiated.

 

COMPREHENSIVE
INCOME OR LOSS

 

ASC Topic
220, “Comprehensive Income”, establishes standards for
reporting and display of comprehensive income or loss, its
components and accumulated balances. Accumulated comprehensive
income, as presented in the accompanying statements of
shareholders’ equity consists of changes in unrealized gains
and losses on foreign currency translation. This comprehensive
income or loss is not included in the computation of income tax
expense or benefit.

REVENUE
RECOGNITION  

 

The
Company applies paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification for revenue recognition. The Company will
recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. The
Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when
all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of
an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the
services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales price
is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably
assured. The Company provides the warranty for the delivery of its
service. If the Company cannot deliver its service to customers
successfully, the Company retry its operation until the delivery is
completed.

 

INCOME
TAXES

 

The
Company follows Section 740-10-30 of the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and
liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that
have been included in the financial statements or tax returns.
Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on
the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of
assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the
year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax
assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent
management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets
will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
the Statements of Operations in the period that includes the
enactment date. The Company adopted section 740-10-25 of the FASB
Accounting Standards Codification ("Section 740-10-25"). Section
740-10-25 addresses the determination of whether tax benefits
claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be
recorded in the financial statements. Under Section 740-10-25, the
Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax
position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position
will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based
on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits
recognized in the financial statements from such a position should
be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than
fifty percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate
settlement. Section 740-10-25 also provides guidance on
de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income
taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased
disclosures. The Company had no material adjustments to its
liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits according to the
provisions of Section 740-10-25.

 

As of
September 30, 2016, the Company did not have any significant
unrecognized uncertain tax positions.

 

The
Company conducts its major businesses in Japan and is subject to
tax in this jurisdiction. As a result of its business activities,
the Company files tax returns that are subject to examination by
the local tax authority.

 

Enterprise
income tax in Japan is generally charged at 29.97% of a
company’s assessable profit. The Company’s subsidiaries
incorporated in Japan are subject to Japanese enterprises income
tax at the applicable tax rates on the taxable income as reported
in their Japanese statutory accounts in accordance with the
relevant enterprises income tax laws applicable to foreign
enterprises.

 

The
Company is governed by the Income Tax Law of Japan as well as Tokyo
Local Income Tax Law (“the Income Tax Laws”). Under the
Income Tax Laws, Corporations in Tokyo, Japan are generally subject
to an income tax at an effective rate of 29.97% on income as
reported in their statutory financial statements after appropriate
tax adjustments unless the enterprise is located in specially
designated regions of cities for which more favorable effective tax
rates apply.

 

 
NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN

 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared on a
basis of accounting assuming that the Company is a going concern
that contemplates realization of assets and satisfaction of
liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company is
considered a start-up company and has not yet generated continuous
revenue. Additionally, 69% of the revenues of the Company were from
the related party for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.
These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern. The Company will offer
noncash consideration and seek equity lines as a means of financing
its operations. If the Company is unable to obtain
revenue-producing contracts or financing or if the revenue or
financing it does obtain is insufficient to cover any operating
losses it may incur, it may substantially curtail or terminate its
operations or seek other business opportunities through strategic
alliances, acquisitions or other arrangements that may dilute the
interests of existing stockholders.

 

NOTE 4 -
RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS

 

On January
27, 2016, Mr. Jeffrey DeNunzio, the former sole shareholder of the
Company, consummated a sale of 40,000,000,000 shares of our common
stock to Dr. Takaaki Matsuoka., for an aggregate purchase price of
$30,000. Following the closing of the share purchase transaction,
Dr. Matsuoka gained a 100% interest in the issued and outstanding
shares of our common stock. Commensurate with the closing, the
Company, filed with the Delaware Secretary of State, a Certificate
of Amendment to change the name of Registrant to Stemcell Holdings,
Inc.

 

On January
27, 2016, Mr. Jeffrey DeNunzio resigned as our Chief Executive
Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Director, Secretary,
and Treasurer.

 

On January
27, 2016, Dr. Takaaki Matsuoka was appointed as Chief Executive
Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Director, Secretary,
and Treasurer.

(CELZ), a clinical stage stem cell company, announced today filing of a patent application covering the use of its AmnioStem Universal Donor stem cell product as a treatment of radiation toxicity.  The Company plans to leverage the ability of its amniotic fluid based stem cell product to induce a process termed "neurogenesis" in which specific areas of the brain are activated to repair damaged tissue.  The AmnioStem product is derived from amniotic fluid, and possesses advantages of fetal stem cells without harming the fetus."Having seen first-hand in my brain cancer patients the horrific effects of post-treatment radiation toxicity, I am excited about the prospect of having something to offer that potentially could reduce cognitive impairment in this group of patients," said Santosh Kesari, MD, PhD, FANA, FAAN, scientific advisory board member to Creative Medical Technology Holdings, Inc. and patent coauthor.  Dr. Kesari is Chair and Professor, Department of Translational Neurosciences and Neurotherapeutics, John Wayne Cancer Institute, as well as Director of Neuro-oncology, Providence Saint John's Health Center and leads the Pacific Neuroscience Research Center at Pacific Neuroscience Institute."Numerous research data support superior effects of the AmnioStem stem cell product in comparison to other stem cell types in terms of growth factor production, regenerative activity and lower cost of manufacturing," said Thomas Ichim, Ph.D, Chief Scientific Officer of Creative Medical Technology Holdings.  "It is exciting for us to develop a rather novel approach to a problem that limits potentially curative effects of existing treatments for brain cancers.""In the situation of radiation countermeasures, our product falls under the FDA 'animal rule', which allows for FDA clearance on the basis of studies in two validated animal models1. This potentially rapid path to market positions the Company for collaboration and funding from agencies such as BARDA2,3 which have previously supported stem cell companies for radiation production," said Timothy Warbington, President and CEO of Creative Medical Technology Holdings, Inc.In November 2016, the Company obtained an exclusive license from the University of California San Diego (UCSD) for issued patent #7,569,385 covering amniotic fluid derived stem cells4.  These stem cells, which are the basis for the Company's AmnioStem product, have the ability to regenerate injured neurons and protect brain function in animal models neurological insults5.About Creative Medical Technology HoldingsCreative Medical Technology Holdings, Inc. is a clinical stage biotechnology company currently trading on the OTCQB under the ticker symbol CELZ.
