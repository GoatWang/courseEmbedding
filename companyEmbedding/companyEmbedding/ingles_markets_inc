History[edit]
The first Ingles store was opened by second-generation grocer Robert P. Ingle in 1963 and located in Asheville, North Carolina.[2] From the beginning, it was known as "Ingles" and not "Ingle's".[7]
In 1982, Ingles purchased a milk processing and packaging plant from Sealtest, which it operates as Milkco Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary.[8] Two-thirds of Milkco's business, which was later expanded beyond dairy to include products such as citrus, tea, and bottled water, is from food service distributors, grocery warehouses, and independent specialty retailers located in 17 states as of 2010.[3] Ingles became a publicly traded company in 1987.[3]
In the 2000s, the chain started building "Ingles Gas Express" gas stations with many of its newer stores.[citation needed]
In February 2005, Ingles Markets announced it would restate financial statements for fiscal 2002 and 2003 and the first three quarters of fiscal 2004, to correct the accounting for vendor allowances and certain other items.[9] The restatement was a significant factor in January 2006 announcement that Ingles received a Wells notice from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.[10]
Following the death of Robert Ingle on March 6, 2011,[11] his son Robert P. Ingle II became CEO.[12]
In December 2012 and December 2013, the company collaborated with Eblen Charities' St. Nicholas Project on what they called "Ingles Toy Store," offering "toys, games, clothes and stocking stuffers" to needy North Carolina families.[13]
Locations[edit]
Ingles operates 190 stores in six southeastern states:[4]

Alabama: 1
Georgia: 70
North Carolina: 63
South Carolina: 35
Tennessee: 20
Virginia: 1

Ingles also owns and operates Sav-Mor Foods, which includes seven locations in North Carolina and one each in South Carolina and Tennessee.[citation needed]
Substantially all of Ingles' stores are located within 280 miles (450 km) of its warehouse located in Black Mountain, North Carolina.[3]
Competition[edit]
Local competitors include Bi-Lo, Food City, Food Lion, Harris Teeter, Harveys, Kroger, Lowes Foods, Publix, and United Grocery Outlet.[14]

History[edit]
The first Ingles store was opened by second-generation grocer Robert P. Ingle in 1963 and located in Asheville, North Carolina.[2] From the beginning, it was known as "Ingles" and not "Ingle's".[7]
In 1982, Ingles purchased a milk processing and packaging plant from Sealtest, which it operates as Milkco Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary.[8] Two-thirds of Milkco's business, which was later expanded beyond dairy to include products such as citrus, tea, and bottled water, is from food service distributors, grocery warehouses, and independent specialty retailers located in 17 states as of 2010.[3] Ingles became a publicly traded company in 1987.[3]
In the 2000s, the chain started building "Ingles Gas Express" gas stations with many of its newer stores.[citation needed]
In February 2005, Ingles Markets announced it would restate financial statements for fiscal 2002 and 2003 and the first three quarters of fiscal 2004, to correct the accounting for vendor allowances and certain other items.[9] The restatement was a significant factor in January 2006 announcement that Ingles received a Wells notice from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.[10]
Following the death of Robert Ingle on March 6, 2011,[11] his son Robert P. Ingle II became CEO.[12]
In December 2012 and December 2013, the company collaborated with Eblen Charities' St. Nicholas Project on what they called "Ingles Toy Store," offering "toys, games, clothes and stocking stuffers" to needy North Carolina families.[13]
Locations[edit]
Ingles operates 190 stores in six southeastern states:[4]

Alabama: 1
Georgia: 70
North Carolina: 63
South Carolina: 35
Tennessee: 20
Virginia: 1

Ingles also owns and operates Sav-Mor Foods, which includes seven locations in North Carolina and one each in South Carolina and Tennessee.[citation needed]
Substantially all of Ingles' stores are located within 280 miles (450 km) of its warehouse located in Black Mountain, North Carolina.[3]
Competition[edit]
Local competitors include Bi-Lo, Food City, Food Lion, Harris Teeter, Harveys, Kroger, Lowes Foods, Publix, and United Grocery Outlet.[14]

Ingles Markets
Company Profile
Robert Ingle's background certainly qualified him to know the preferences of shoppers in his territory. A member of a third generation grocery family, he worked in a grocery store started by his grandfather in Asheville, North Carolina where the company headquarters is still located.

Robert Ingle, founder and president ofIngles Supermarket,shown here in 1976

Elmer Ingle closed the family store in 1956 and young Robert attended the University of Miami. From 1961 to 1963 he was back in the Carolinas working for the chain of Colonial Stores until he secured financing to open his first Ingles store in Asheville in 1963.
Robert Ingle opened the first Ingles supermarket in Asheville, North Carolina in 1963. He saw an opportunity to invest in smaller towns and rural communities throughout North and South Carolina that were being underserved by large grocery chains. It was a strategy that proved so successful that expansion into similar communities in Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama and Virginia soon followed. Ingles now operates approximately 200 stores in six southeastern states with annual sales of almost $4 billion.

The first facility was small, crowded and staffed by Ingle, his wife and a small dedicated group of employees. Competition was fierce, with chains such as Winn-Dixie, A&P and Colonial controlling 93 percent of the area's food sales. Yet Ingle was determined to break in.
Early on, Ingles implemented a successful strategy of real estate investment in the communities it served, often owning the real estate on which its stores are located. Ingles today owns two-thirds of the real estate on which it operates.
He cut prices, extended store hours to include Sundays and holidays, advertised specials, expanded the supermarket, set up mass merchandise displays, offered games, stamps and other promotional items and generally, ran what he called "a circus" in order to get people in the door.
In 1982, Ingles found a strategic partner by purchasing a milk processing facility. Milkco, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary, not only supplies Ingles stores with the freshest dairy products, fruit juices and bottled waters, but also sells its products to other retailers, wholesalers and food service distributors. Annual production at Milkco has grown from 5 million gallons in 1982 to over 60 million gallons today.

Ingles #130301 Long Shoals Road, Arden, NC

In 1987, the Company became publicly traded on the Nasdaq Stock Markets's National Market under the symbol IMKTA.
Ingles self-distributes its stores' merchandise from its distribution center on the outskirts of Asheville, North Carolina, where its headquarters is also located. The distribution center is strategically located adjacent to Interstate 40 and in close proximity to Interstate 26. To facilitate its high standards of quality and freshness, the company's highly efficient warehouse and distribution center is within 250 miles of Ingles' 200+ retail stores.
Ingles strives to provide one-stop shopping convenience to its valued customers. Ingles supermarkets offer customers a wide variety of nationally advertised food products, including grocery, meat, produce, deli and bakery departments. In addition, the company offers pharmacies and fuel at the majority of its 200 plus locations.
The same customer focus and commitment to quality and convenience on which Robert Ingle founded the business in 1963, continues today throughout the organization. Ingles offers a full variety of brand name products supplemented with Ingles' own Laura Lynn brand products which are equal or superior to National Brands and guaranteed by Ingles Markets. Ingles Private Label products are named after Mr. Ingle's daughter, Laura Lynn Ingle.

History[edit]
The first Ingles store was opened by second-generation grocer Robert P. Ingle in 1963 and located in Asheville, North Carolina.[2] From the beginning, it was known as "Ingles" and not "Ingle's".[7]
In 1982, Ingles purchased a milk processing and packaging plant from Sealtest, which it operates as Milkco Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary.[8] Two-thirds of Milkco's business, which was later expanded beyond dairy to include products such as citrus, tea, and bottled water, is from food service distributors, grocery warehouses, and independent specialty retailers located in 17 states as of 2010.[3] Ingles became a publicly traded company in 1987.[3]
In the 2000s, the chain started building "Ingles Gas Express" gas stations with many of its newer stores.[citation needed]
In February 2005, Ingles Markets announced it would restate financial statements for fiscal 2002 and 2003 and the first three quarters of fiscal 2004, to correct the accounting for vendor allowances and certain other items.[9] The restatement was a significant factor in January 2006 announcement that Ingles received a Wells notice from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.[10]
Following the death of Robert Ingle on March 6, 2011,[11] his son Robert P. Ingle II became CEO.[12]
In December 2012 and December 2013, the company collaborated with Eblen Charities' St. Nicholas Project on what they called "Ingles Toy Store," offering "toys, games, clothes and stocking stuffers" to needy North Carolina families.[13]
Locations[edit]
Ingles operates 190 stores in six southeastern states:[4]

Alabama: 1
Georgia: 70
North Carolina: 63
South Carolina: 35
Tennessee: 20
Virginia: 1

Ingles also owns and operates Sav-Mor Foods, which includes seven locations in North Carolina and one each in South Carolina and Tennessee.[citation needed]
Substantially all of Ingles' stores are located within 280 miles (450 km) of its warehouse located in Black Mountain, North Carolina.[3]
Competition[edit]
Local competitors include Bi-Lo, Food City, Food Lion, Harris Teeter, Harveys, Kroger, Lowes Foods, Publix, and United Grocery Outlet.[14]

Ingles CFO Ron Freeman ... said the continued mispunctuation is a nod to the old-school ways of store naming. “We’ve used ‘Ingles’ without the apostrophe ever since our first store opened in 1963,” he said. "Pictures of our first store and our first newspaper ad don’t have the apostrophe,” he said. “It’s somewhat unique, but not entirely uncommon in the retail industry.

^ Barrett, Mark (March 31, 2014). "Ingles eyes bigger South Asheville store". Asheville Citizen-Times. Retrieved 2014-05-31. Ingles faces renewed competition in the South Asheville market.

Learn & Grow At Ingles
Jim Lanning was born and raised in the mountains of Western North Carolina. At the young age of 16, he began his life long career with Ingles Markets as a service clerk. In 1977, he graduated from TC Roberson High School located in Asheville, North Carolina. He continued his employment with Ingles and was soon promoted to stock clerk and shortly thereafter to Grocery Manager. Continuing to grow his career with Ingles, Lanning was promoted to Assistant Manager. Realizing the importance of an education, Lanning chose to continue his schooling at Western Carolina University, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration.
After obtaining his college degree, Lanning’s career progressed and he was promoted to the position of Store Manager. Lanning was willing to make any move the company requested to better himself and Ingles Markets. He was continually challenged to take on larger stores and show results. In 1995, Lanning was promoted to District Manager. He was responsible for the northeast Georgia region and proved successful in this role. In 2003, Robert Ingle selected Jim Lanning to serve as President of Ingles Markets, Incorporated.
