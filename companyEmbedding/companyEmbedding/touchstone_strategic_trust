What is Distinctively Active?
                            
                            At Touchstone Investments, we recognize that not all mutual fund companies are created equal. Our commitment to being Distinctively Active means the employment of a fully integrated and rigorous process for identifying and partnering with asset managers who sub-advise our mutual funds and advocating a robust approach to portfolio construction that either uses active strategies as a standalone or serves as a complement to passive strategies.  That is the power of Distinctively Active.

About Us
Home › Our Company › About Us
Access to Experience
Touchstone Investments helps investors achieve their financial goals by providing access to a distinctive selection of institutional asset managers who are known and respected for proficiency in their specific area of expertise. Learn more.
Recognizing that mastery of all investment disciplines is beyond the scope of any one firm, the use of sub-advisors allows Touchstone to offer an array of strategically focused funds across styles and asset classes. Touchstone's fund lineup includes U.S. equity, international/global equity, U.S. fixed income, diversified income, multi-asset and alternative investment funds.
Touchstone's investment professionals are responsible for the selection, monitoring and replacement of each sub-advisor, subject to the approval of Touchstone Funds' Board of Trustees. Our professionals use a due diligence process commensurate with the standards and guidelines typically used by sophisticated institutional investors and are responsible for the oversight of each sub-advisor including the adherence to each fund's stated investment objective, style integrity, return objective and risk parameters. Touchstone believes that this comprehensive approach to selecting and monitoring of our sub-advisors helps to maximize fund performance over the long-term.
 
Sub-Advisor Selection and Monitoring
Touchstone follows a diligent process when conducting a search for a new sub-advisor. Intensive evaluation leads to a selection of a sub-advisor only if the firm has demonstrated proficiency in its area of declared expertise over a sustained period of time. Specific selection criteria are developed based on the product objective and both qualitative and quantitative evaluations are performed.
We oversee each fund and each manager relative to expectations that were established during the selection process. A formal quantitative analysis is completed quarterly and a qualitative review is performed at least annually in which we reassess the sub-advisor's investment capabilities and supporting infrastructure.
Touchstone Funds have been created to meet defined investment goals and risk-return objectives. Our rigorous sub-advisor selection process and robust oversight approach are designed to ensure that we deliver on our commitment of providing access to institutional asset managers with the goal of achieving favorable long term results.

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices

              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.
