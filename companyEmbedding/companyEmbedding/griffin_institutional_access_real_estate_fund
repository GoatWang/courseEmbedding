How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks

              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

© 2017 Griffin Institutional Access™ Real Estate Fund. All rights reserved.

By “Invest Like an Institution,” we mean that Griffin Institutional Access™ Real Estate Fund enables individuals to invest in an investment structure (a combination of private real estate funds and public real estate securities) frequently chosen by institutions, large and small, as their preferred structure for real estate investments. We also mean the Fund is managed by sub-advisors who only advise institutions. Finally, we mean that investors in this Fund invest alongside numerous institutions such as pension funds and insurance companies; a portion of their dollars are invested in the same private equity real estate funds as those owned by institutions.
By “Your Public and Private Real Estate Investment Solution,” we mean that Griffin Institutional Access Real Estate Fund, which offers investors a blend of public and private real estate investments selected and managed by leading institutions (the Fund’s sub-advisors), delivers an investment solution. The Fund may be considered a “solution” because it provides an array of potential benefits including current income, less volatility, modest market correlation, pricing transparency, and periodic liquidity.
This website is neither an offer to sell nor the solicitation of an offer to buy any security. Only the prospectus can make such an offer. Therefore, a copy of the prospectus must be made available to you in connection with the offering. This marketing material must be read in conjunction with the prospectus in order to understand fully all of the implications and risks of the offering of securities to which it relates. Because it is a summary, it may not contain all of the information that is important to you. To understand The Griffin Institutional Access Real Estate Fund offering fully, you should read the entire prospectus and Risk Factors carefully to make an investment.

About Institutional Access™ Real Estate Fund

Griffin Institutional Access Real Estate Fund (the "Fund")’s investment objective is to generate a return comprised of both current income, capital appreciation, moderate volatility and low correlation to the broader markets. The Fund strategically invests in an actively-managed combination of large, established private real estate funds and public real estate securities. The most compelling feature of the Fund is the expertise of a highly-experienced execution team.
The Fund’s advisor, Griffin Capital Advisor, the sponsor and portfolio manager; Aon Hewitt Investment Consulting, sub-advisor of private real estate funds; and CenterSquare Investment Management, sub-advisor of public real estate securities, bring decades of hands-on experience, substantial track records, complementary skill sets and robust execution capabilities together to deliver a powerful investment product customized for individual investors.

© 2017 Griffin Institutional Access™ Real Estate Fund. All rights reserved.

By “Invest Like an Institution,” we mean that Griffin Institutional Access™ Real Estate Fund enables individuals to invest in an investment structure (a combination of private real estate funds and public real estate securities) frequently chosen by institutions, large and small, as their preferred structure for real estate investments. We also mean the Fund is managed by sub-advisors who only advise institutions. Finally, we mean that investors in this Fund invest alongside numerous institutions such as pension funds and insurance companies; a portion of their dollars are invested in the same private equity real estate funds as those owned by institutions.
By “Your Public and Private Real Estate Investment Solution,” we mean that Griffin Institutional Access Real Estate Fund, which offers investors a blend of public and private real estate investments selected and managed by leading institutions (the Fund’s sub-advisors), delivers an investment solution. The Fund may be considered a “solution” because it provides an array of potential benefits including current income, less volatility, modest market correlation, pricing transparency, and periodic liquidity.
This website is neither an offer to sell nor the solicitation of an offer to buy any security. Only the prospectus can make such an offer. Therefore, a copy of the prospectus must be made available to you in connection with the offering. This marketing material must be read in conjunction with the prospectus in order to understand fully all of the implications and risks of the offering of securities to which it relates. Because it is a summary, it may not contain all of the information that is important to you. To understand The Griffin Institutional Access Real Estate Fund offering fully, you should read the entire prospectus and Risk Factors carefully to make an investment. Use of this website is subject to its Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy.
