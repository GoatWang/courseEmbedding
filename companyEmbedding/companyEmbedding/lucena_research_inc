How can financial firms compete when the BlackRock’s of the world have stock-picking-super-robots?
 
OK, ok, don’t panic. Yet. BlackRock’s big news this week caused lots of buzz around the financial news media, propelling some fear, uncertainty and doubt for smaller firms already intimidated by the $5 trillion AUM big boys’ teams of PhD quants – let alone stock-picking-super-robots. Let’s get a few things straight.

Lucena was founded by former F-15 pilot Tucker Balch, Ph.D. Tucker earned a doctorate in Robotics at Georgia Tech in 1999 and began a research career in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Carnegie Mellon University.
Throughout his academic career Tucker was intrigued by the challenge of applying Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to investment decision-making. He later returned to Georgia Tech where he is developing a graduate program that combines Artificial Intelligence and Finance. In recent years, Tucker and some of his most talented students perfected a pattern matching algorithm to create an advanced and reliable investment decision support tool for traders.
John Cornwell was one of Tucker’s top students: He led the implementation of Lucena’s proprietary IP. While at Georgia Tech, Tucker and John participated in a unique accelerator program called Flashpoint.
Flashpoint’s mission is to introduce experienced and successful entrepreneurs to promising early-stage startups. The underlying goal is to match each start up with a mentor, to help them validate and refine their business model before a large investment or effort is undertaken. Erez Katz, a self-made serial entrepreneur and an expert in building and growing SaaS (Software as a Service or cloud-based) Technology companies, was assigned as Lucena’s mentor.
While working together, a mutual appreciation for each other’s talent was formed and the decision was made to join forces, raise seed money, and swiftly embark on an unbelievable journey to grow Lucena into a recognized powerhouse in the investment professional community.
Lucena’s ultimate goal is to bring awareness of the power of Machine Learning pattern analysis, and to revolutionize the underserved investment professional community by providing the tools and technology not normally available to businesses of their size.
Lucena brings quantitative analysis and statistical Machine Learning solutions to hedge funds, wealth advisers and advanced individual investors.
Our cloud-based Artificial Intelligence decision support technology enables short term investors and traders to find market opportunities and to reduce risk in their portfolio using technical and fundamental quantitative pattern matching.
 
We provide:

Machine Learning algorithms focused on investment applications
Equity trend forecasting
Advanced event studies
Portfolio optimization
Hedging tactics

Our quantitative tools may improve the performance of your existing strategies, validate new strategies before investment, maximize the consistency of returns, and minimize volatility.  We are also available on demand to provide consulting support.
 
Use Lucena’s QuantDesk™ software to scientifically validate your investment plan, leverage Machine Learning for price prediction, and bound risk with advanced hedging algorithms.

Optimize Portfolio Allocation for your risk tolerance
 
Our Portfolio Optimizer builds on Markowitz’s ideas, but with features that enable it to be tailored to your needs
 



What’s your risk level? Choose from three options: Minimum Risk, Maximum Return, and Balanced
Do you have insight about future prices? If so you can enter a forecast for each equity to help the optimizer determine allocations
Do you have a negative outlook? In addition to long only allocations, our optimizer can also generate long/short and short only portfolios
Use our forecasts: The optimizer can also use our proprietary price forecaster to inform recommended allocations
Are you interested to optimize across entire asset classes instead of stocks? If so, you can ask the optimizer to assess appropriate indexes instead of equities

 
 
 




 

How Portfolio Optimizer Helps
 
Serious investors use optimizers to reduce risk while maintaining returns:

Reduce risk: The first thing you will notice when you use a portfolio optimizer is that the volatility in your portfolio will be reduced dramatically. We often see volatility cut in half for our clients’ portfolios
Preserve return: Our optimizer finds the statistically highest yield portfolio for your level of risk

 
 
 


Based on Nobel Prize winning approach
 

Data: 7000 North American equities including: NYSE, NYSE ARCA, NASDAQ, AMEX, OTC (stocks, ETFs, ADRs). Over 100 indices, including major indices published by Dow Jones and S&P
Lucena now supports International Equities
Core algorithm: We use the efficient frontier approach pioneered by Harry Markowitz, with extensions that allow long and short positions as well as custom risk levels
Optimization: Our system uses a high performance convex optimization algorithm to find the best allocation
Risk level: Three settings: Minimum Risk, Maximum Return, Balanced (for maximum Sharpe Ratio)
Constraints: You can set upper and lower allocation limits for each equity
Alpha: Use our forecasting tool, or input your positive or negative sentiment for each equity

Share Article


















New predictive data and sophisticated index products backed by quantitative analysis are now offered to major financial institutions worldwide







Erez Katz - CEO

Financial firms need technology to compete in the marketplace and Lucena Research is leveling the playing field.


Atlanta, GA (PRWEB)
March 14, 2017
 Lucena Research, a leader in predictive analytics and machine-learning intelligence, and Nasdaq announced they are bringing to market new data and index product offerings utilizing unique Nasdaq data sets combined with Lucena’s machine learning expertise and its flagship analytics product QuantDesk®.
QuantDesk enables hedge funds, portfolio managers and other investment professionals to leverage predictive analytics in their investment practice. The open nature of the platform along with its user-friendly interface enables clients to easily and affordably validate, refine, and deploy winning trading strategies. “We are honored to partner directly with Nasdaq, whose leadership has technology in their DNA. Financial firms need technology to compete in the marketplace and Lucena Research is leveling the playing field,” said Erez Katz, Co-Founder and CEO.
Tucker Balch, Ph.D. led the Lucena team in the integration effort with Nasdaq’s Index and Product Group. “Nasdaq is bringing an exciting and powerful set of data sets to the table,” Balch said. “Some of the feeds use Natural Language Processing algorithms to literally ‘read’ news and social media, providing quantifiable information ranging from macro economic data to stock-specific factors. Lucena’s machine learning technology ferrets out the relationships between these feeds to provide predictive and adaptive models. We have demonstrated time and again how significantly we can enhance a portfolio manager’s decision making.”
Machine Learning algorithms enable QuantDesk to ingest, analyze and extract value from novel signals from multiple sources. The technology can identify which signals offer synergistic effects. By combining multiple signals appropriately Lucena enhances predictability and automatically adjusts to changing conditions. This combination of predictive data sources and algorithms that optimally utilize them enables customers to rapidly build and deploy customized data feeds and risk models.
