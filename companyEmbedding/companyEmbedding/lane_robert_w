Robert W. LaneChairman and CEO
2000-2009






Robert W. Lane retired as Chairman of Deere & Company's Board of Directors in February 2010. He succeeded Hans W. Becherer who retired as Chairman in August 2000. Lane also served as John Deere's CEO from 2000-2009, succeeded by Samuel R. Allen as both CEO and Chairman.
Lane joined John Deere in 1982, following an early career in global banking. He managed various operations within the Worldwide Construction Equipment Division and later served as president and chief operating officer of Deere Credit, Inc. In 1992, he joined the Worldwide Agricultural Equipment Division where, as senior vice president, he directed equipment operations in Latin America, Australia, East Asia and South Africa.
Lane was elected chief financial officer in 1996, and two years later moved to Germany where, as managing director, he led Deere's agricultural equipment operations in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, India and the nations of the former Soviet Union. He returned to the United States as president of the Worldwide Agricultural Equipment Division in 1999; subsequently he was elected Deere & Company’s President and Chief Operating Officer.
During his leadership, Lane guided Deere to record growth and success.Deere & Company's net income reached unprecedented levels for five consecutive years, surpassing $2 billion in 2008. Revenues more than doubled between 2000 and 2008.
Lane established the SVA model, which helped the company attain world-class status in asset efficiency and return on investment. His focus on global expansion led to significant investments throughout the world, most notably in Brazil, India and China. Deere's traditional factories were reworked and modernized, and at the same time, Deere's dealer organizations worldwide were significantly upgraded to better support the advanced needs of customers.
Aiming to attract and retain the best global talent from all backgrounds, Lane was the force behind the company's performance management system, its leadership development process, and a global team enrichment initiative.
Currently serving on the boards of BMW AG, General Electric Company, Northern Trust Corporation, and Verizon Communications Inc., Lane is also a trustee of the University of Chicago. He is an honorary director of the Lincoln Park Zoo, Chicago, a national director of the Lyric Opera of Chicago, and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.
Born in Washington, D.C. (1949), Lane graduated with high honors from Wheaton College in Illinois (1972), and earned a Master of Business Administration degree from The University of Chicago Graduate School of Business (1974).

Robert W Lane – Business Professional 






























Skip to content



Robert W Lane
Business Professional 







About Me 

Hello!!
I am a business professional who has spent the last 16 successful years in Restaurant Management. I enjoy the fast pace and ever changing environment of the restaurant industry and have been able to amass a multitude of skills and knowledge from my experience. The skill set you acquire from such a diverse environment – where you handle many facets of the business daily is very unique. A single day as a Manager in a restaurant will have you overseeing the execution of exceptional customer service, ordering and receiving, scheduling, interviews, business process analysis, managing inventory, quality control, and leading a team.
As awsome and rewarding as a manager in Restaurant Operations is, there are some downsides. As a Restaurant manager you find yourself working when the majority of others are not -such as nights, weekends and holidays. This has the tendency to create a challenging domestic life. With three rapidly growing children and an even quicker filling social calendar I made the decision to go back to school. I figured with the experience I was gaining at work a B.S. in Business Administration would only help position myself for a transition into a new industry.

Deere's CEO concentrates on running smarter, faster and leaner to nurture global growth at the $21.9 billion, 168-year-old company.

"Our products," boasts Deere & Co. Chairman and CEO Robert W. Lane, "continue to stand alone in productivity, innovation and value." Lane, only the eighth chief executive in the company's 168-year history, is clearly committed to maintaining that tradition of excellence. But since becoming CEO in millennium year 2000, Lane, IW's CEO of the Year for 2005, has been equally committed to growing Moline, Ill.-based Deere into a business that is as great as he believes its products to be. In short, he's committed to running smarter, faster and leaner. Such a strategic commitment could sound presumptuous, Lane acknowledges, particularly in the context of an iconic U.S. manufacturing company whose agricultural roots are long and deep, a company with enviable market shares, a stellar dealer network, a strong balance sheet and lots of loyal employees. But the reality, relates Lane, is that Deere, best known for its top-performing farm machinery with the distinctive yellow deer logo, was underperforming as a business when he became CEO. The company was "margin lean" and "asset heavy." Factories were running at a steady pace in a business that is cyclical, seasonal and variable. "This company did many great things, but it did things in an expensive way," he says. In Lane's judgment, Deere's overall performance was "O.K., but not great. Adequate might be the right word."  Adequate is a decidedly inadequate description of Deere's recent business performance. Although substantial fourth-quarter production cutbacks had a negative impact on results, Deere still posted sales and revenues of $21.9 billion in fiscal 2005, which ended Oct. 31, 2005, and earnings were a record $1.447 billion. That's remarkable, since fiscal 2004, Lane's fourth full year in the CEO's chair, had yielded a financial bumper crop. Net income more than doubled from fiscal 2003, reaching a then-record $1.4 billion. Sales and revenue rose 29% to $19.99 billion. Assets relative to sales came down. Margins went up. For the company's equipment divisions, operating return on operating assets, now one of the key measures of business success at Deere, more than doubled to 25.5%. Shareholder value added, basically operating profit minus the pretax cost of capital and another key business metric, was just above $1 billion, twice what it had ever been before and a dramatic turnaround from five years of negative numbers.  Under Lane's leadership, inventory and other costs have been cut, non-productive assets have been pared, and Deere is running leaner, more like, well, a deer. Lane's ability to conceive, communicate and execute new ideas that could take the company to the next level were among the reasons Deere's board five years ago chose him to succeed Hans Becherer as CEO. Indeed, Lane's consistency, focus, vision, direction and unwavering integrity are among the qualities that most impress John Lawson, a former senior vice president at Deere who retired just over three years ago. "Once he and the team that I was privileged to be a part of deliberated on [making Deere more successful], that correction was established and communicated, and, to my knowledge, today still is the center of what they're driving for." Operating return on operating assets and shareholder value added, key performance metrics, top the discussion, right after safety, at every Deere factory Lane visits. And Deere's performance goals remain ambitious. For example, in Deere's three equipment divisions -- agricultural equipment, commercial and consumer equipment, and construction and forestry equipment -- the annual, middle-of-the-sales-cycle target for operating return on operating assets is 20%. Shareholder value added for the whole company, including financial services, is expected to be consistently positive, with the goal of an annual gains of 6% to 7%.  "If you really want to sustain [these] results, anything that's not contributing to them has to go away," Lane insists. "One of the reasons the business is so much stronger now -- and arguably in five years or more we could begin to maybe say it's a great business -- is that every single product line has to carry its weight," he explains. "Where you have too many fixed assets, you need to get rid of them. Our asset turn has gone from about one to two. People are learning to work with much fewer assets."   Robert W. LaneChairman and CEO,Deere & Co.,Moline, Ill.  Born: Washington, D.C., on Nov. 14, 1949Education: B.A. (high honors), Wheaton College; M.B.A., University of Chicago Graduate School of BusinessExperience: Joined Deere in 1982, initially managing operations within the Worldwide Construction Equipment Division. Has served as senior vice president and president of the Worldwide Agricultural Equipment Division. Has been president and COO of Deere Credit Inc. Was Deere CFO from January 1996 until March 1998 and was president and COO of Deere & Company prior to being named chairman and CEO in August 2000.People at Deere -- at least its 18,800 salaried employees -- are also working with performance plans tied to their responsibilities and development potential. Annual bonuses for salaried workers are linked to operating return on operating assets in Deere's three equipment divisions and to return on equity in its financial services operation. Longer-term payouts are possible and tied to returns exceeding the cost of capital during several years.                               As he has talked to employees about Deere's new discipline, Lane has spoken to union leadership, suppliers and dealers and has used the same language, another practice for which he's admired. "We have not done the job for our shareholders that we need to do," Lane told United Auto Workers president Stephen Yokich early on. He told suppliers: "We are going to run a better business, and that means you need to run a better business." He told dealers: "You're going to have to change to be in line with us." Whether Lane was on a factory floor talking to an individual, or dealers, or customers or his senior team, "he was steadfast," former senior vice president Lawson recalls. And while there's still a family feel to Deere, probably a product of its agricultural roots and persisting images of farm families and their values that date back to the 19th century, "this is not a family," Lane unapologetically states. "It's a team, a high-performance team. And sadly on a high-performance team those who don't pull their weight aren't on the team."  However, Lane, a former banker who served as Deere's CFO from January 1996 to March 1998, is not just a "numbers" person. Deere, he emphasizes, can't just cut its way to better business performance. So Lane also is leading the company and its 46,000 worldwide employees in what he terms disciplined global growth. "We aren't the market leader in everything we do. But we have the aspiration to be pre-eminent in those markets and with those customers whom we chose to serve," he says. The company's global reach is expanding. Sales outside the U.S. and Canada have doubled since 1999, accounting for nearly half of Deere's farm-machinery sales in fiscal 2004 and nearly one-third of overall equipment sales. During the past two years, Deere has announced plans to build a new tractor factory in Montenegro, Brazil, that's expected to be in production by mid-2006. It has opened a seeding-equipment assembly plant in Orenburg, Russia. It is building a new engineering and IT support center near its tractor plant in Pune, India. And Deere has broken ground for a new transmission factory in China. At the same time, Lane is determined to deliver to customers -- especially those linked to the land -- tools that will improve their productivity. For example, the 8030 series tractor now being produced features an infinitely variable transmission and a global-positioning guidance system called AutoTrac designed to eliminate missed rows or overlapped tracks during seeding, spraying and cultivating. "This is not just telling you where you are. It's actually running the machine," brags Lane. Similarly, a Deere technologically advanced tree-harvesting machine known as wheeled loader allows its operator, who's in contact with the mill, to select single trees and set them out in a precise pickup plan as part of an inventory management chain that follows the common factory principles of just-in-time and produce-to-order. Deere also is adding large-scale baling and spraying products to its offerings and moving deeper into products and services needed by commercial mowers and professional landscapers. Lane would be the first to emphasize that neither Deere's improving results nor its better ideas and best practices are his. To him, they are Deere's. In speeches to employees, reports to shareholders and interviews with reporters, Lane refers to "the skills of our people," the dramatic progress "we've made," and the success in creating a performance-based culture that "we've had." It's a practice the late Peter Drucker, who observed management leaders think and say "we" rather than "I," would approve of. Yes, Lane acknowledges, Deere's board does hold him responsible for results. "They should hold me responsible. If I don't deliver the performance, then I'm the one who has to leave," he says. "On the other hand, as we are delivering results, they are the results of a whole team of people around me," he stresses.  "The goal I have had is to surround myself with people who are smarter than I am, have a similar passion and possess the very high values that Deere stands for. And if you're going to do that, you have to listen to them," he says. "So I do try to listen to them -- a lot. And [I] end up, often, doing what they recommend, which is often different from or at least a revision of what I was initially thinking," he says.  "As we are successful there is no question that there is a whole group of people who can take a bow," says Lane.

The Place of Product Design and Aesthetics in Consumer Research



Robert W. Veryzer, Jr., Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute

ABSTRACT -     Product design and aesthetics research is still in its infancy even though  it has periodically received attention from consumer researchers as well as researchers in  other disciplines. The scope and direction of this stream of research has yet to be  clearly defined, and the stream's relationship to consumer research continues to be rather  vague. This paper examines the place of product design and aesthetics research in consumer  research. The paper begins by discussing design and aesthetics and provides some  background concerning the study of these topics. The efforts of consumer researchers in  these areas and the unique suitability of the discipline of consumer research for studying  product design and aesthetics are then discussed. Finally, recommendations are presented  concerning the significant research questions and issues that need to be addressed if this  area is to become a viable stream in consumer research.

 Advances in Consumer Research Volume 22, 1995       Pages 641-645 THE PLACE OF PRODUCT DESIGN AND AESTHETICS IN CONSUMER RESEARCH Robert W. Veryzer, Jr., Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute ABSTRACT -  Product design and aesthetics research is still in its infancy even though  it has periodically received attention from consumer researchers as well as researchers in  other disciplines. The scope and direction of this stream of research has yet to be  clearly defined, and the stream's relationship to consumer research continues to be rather  vague. This paper examines the place of product design and aesthetics research in consumer  research. The paper begins by discussing design and aesthetics and provides some  background concerning the study of these topics. The efforts of consumer researchers in  these areas and the unique suitability of the discipline of consumer research for studying  product design and aesthetics are then discussed. Finally, recommendations are presented  concerning the significant research questions and issues that need to be addressed if this  area is to become a viable stream in consumer research. INTRODUCTION There is a growing recognition that product design is emerging as a key  marketing element (Kotler and Rath 1984; Holbrook and Zirlin 1985; Wallendorf 1980). This  is especially true of the portions of product design that involve construction for human  interaction and aesthetics. Design, which refers to the organization of elements of an  object, and aesthetics are inherently linked since the design or physical form of a  product encompasses aesthetic aspects of the product (e.g., shape, color, texture, etc.).  The importance of product design as a determinant of consumer behavior is increasing as  the technology gaps between companies become smaller and companies are able to produce  products that are similar with respect to features, quality, and costs (i.e., price). Despite the growing awareness of the influence that product design can  have on product preferences, surprisingly little in the way of design or aesthetic theory  has been advanced that aids in our understanding of how people respond to design or how  aesthetic responses are formed (Berlyne 1974, p. 5; Gorski 1987, p. 68). Disciplines such  as industrial (product) design [The phrase "industrial design," which is a  holdover from the days of the industrial revolution, has served to obscure the profession  charges with shaping most of the products that are produced and sold. Industrial designers  (e.g., Henry Dreyfuss, Raymond Loewy, etc.) are concerned with enhancing the appearance of  manufactured products as well as improving their utility.] are looking to the  psychological sciences to address the lack of design theory (Gorski 1987). The progress of  consumer researchers in this area has been limited and sporadic. As a result of the  absence of theory, there continues to be a great deal of unease when it comes to making  decisions about design and managing design projects. This is particularly problematic for  managers charged with transferring new technology out of the laboratory and into the  market. It is at this point that design and aesthetics play a crucial role in  communicating a product's identity and use to consumers.  DESIGN AND AESTHETICS  The term "design" may be used to refer to a process or to a  particular (product) composition. For the development of consumer and industrial products  this process typically involves collaboration among industrial (product) designers,  engineers, marketing experts, scientists, technicians, as well as others (Izzi and Caplan  1972). The objective of the design process is to produce a product "design."  "Design" as it is used to refer to a particular product configuration (i.e.,  arrangement of elements or parts) may be viewed as involving a number of important  considerations. A successful (i.e., "good," optimal) design is one that performs  its intended function(s) well, is economical (i.e., profitable for the manufacturer and a  good value for the consumer), and is pleasant to behold. In addition, product design  (i.e., configuration) plays a crucial role in communicating a product's use (i.e.,  function) and operating procedure to the consumer (e.g., Norman 1988). The ability of a  design to communicate a product's function and use to the consumer through its form is  paramount since part of the role of a product's design is to interpret technology. This  facet of design is growing in importance as the products that we interact with on a daily  basis are increasingly becoming more complex. Thus, from a functional or operational point  of view a key design issue is how to structure a product so as to promote or maximize  (product) interpretation, understanding, and use (e.g., performance, safety). Product design (i.e., industrial design) is perhaps most associated with  aesthetic considerations (Bel Geddes 1934, pp. 222-241). While aesthetic considerations  (e.g., shape, symmetry, texture, etc.) usually pertain to the external surface(s) which  house or protect the inner workings (e.g., mechanical or electrical components) of a  product, these considerations are not entirely independent of other design concerns. For  example, aesthetic considerations are influenced by (product) structure (i.e., mechanisms  and components that allow the product to perform a particular function). This is  especially true of designs that strive to communicate the function of a product rather  than to conceal it. In such cases, many elements of a product design that are thought of  as being "aesthetic" (e.g., shape) are, in fact, frequently the principal means  by which the purpose and use of the object are communicated. This is particularly true  today since computer chip technology has freed many products from having to assume forms  determined by the larger mechanical components used in the past. Thus, aesthetic  considerations in product design can be quite complex and broad in scope since aesthetics  (i.e., form, configuration) often plays a central role in object perception, recognition,  interpretation, understanding, and use. Product aesthetics (i.e., design) can exert a significant influence on  consumer behavior (e.g., Veryzer 1993). Enhanced product appearance can certainly be  advantageous in a commercial sense, even for utilitarian products. Although product  aesthetics is central to product design, it is this facet that is least well understood.  Despite the relatively long duration of aesthetics study in disciplines such as  philosophy, art criticism, art history, psychology, anthropology, experimental aesthetics,  industrial design, (and more recently consumer research), there has been a striking  inability to formulate a coherent theory with respect to the aesthetic aspect of design.  Progress in this area has been inhibited by two unresolved issues that are fundamental to  aesthetics research. The first issue concerns the locus of aesthetic experience. The  crucial question is whether aesthetic experience emanates from the object or is generated  by the perceiver of the object. This issue is apparent in a number of ongoing debates such  as whether or not beauty is governed by rules and whether or not aesthetic response is  subjective. A second issue concerns the nature of the aesthetic value of an object. Some  aestheticians (e.g., Bullough 1912, pp. 783-785) maintain that "aesthetic  objects" belong to a special class of objects consisting chiefly of works of fine art  and natural phenomena (e.g., the human body, landscapes). Furthermore, it is often held  that aesthetic appreciation (i.e., experience) can only take place when the object is  viewed without attention to any practical or utilitarian consideration (e.g., Bullough  1912). This view, which has resulted in a "philosophy of art" definition being  associated with the term "aesthetics," is divergent from the classical roots of  aesthetics (e.g., Plato, The Republic) as well as the view of aestheticians who hold a  wider conception of aesthetics (e.g., Berlyne 1974, p.1).  Even though design and aesthetics have been studied for quite some time,  there continues to be a great deal of uncertainty and ambiguity concerning them. This is  due primarily to the absence of theory which encourages the impression that  "good" design is a rather arbitrary affair (Finn 1990). While the personCproduct relationship which is design is a complex  one, it is likely to seem less arbitrary as we learn to better identify and differentiate  its essential parts and the factors that influence responses to it. PRODUCT DESIGN AND AESTHETICS IN CONSUMER RESEARCH Since design and aesthetics are potentially important factors in the  selection of many, if not most, products, it is not surprising that consumer researchers  have found them worthwhile to study. Consumer researchers have tended to focus on the  aesthetic aspect of product design. This is not surprising since this is a central concern  of design and most personCproduct relationships  (i.e., interactions) begin with (the perception of) a product's appearance (Izzi and  Caplan 1972).  Beginning with some early explorations in the mid-1970s and early 1980s  (e.g., Holbrook 1980; Olson 1981; Sewall 1978; Wallendorf 1980) a "slender stream of  research in consumer aesthetics" began to flow (Holbrook and Zirlin 1985, p. 2).  Consumer researchers began to grapple with some of the significant questions concerning  aesthetic responses such as: "What is an aesthetic response?" and "How are  aesthetic responses formed?" (e.g., Holbrook 1980; Olson 1981). Much of this early  work was concerned with determining what the aesthetic aspect of consumption is and how  aesthetic phenomena could be researched. Consumer researchers debated the definition and  scope of consumer aesthetics - with some in the field preferring to apply aesthetic  experience only to so called "artistic" or "cultural products"  (Holbrook 1980), while others acknowledged that virtually any product has an aesthetic  component (Holbrook and Zirlin 1985; Olson 1981). Although this latter view, which is  consistent with an industrial design perspective, seems to have gained general acceptance  among consumer researchers, the tendencies to associate aesthetics with "art"  and "emotion," to discount its systematic influence, and to discuss  "aesthetic objects" are still present within the consumer research discipline. Even though the aesthetic aspect of product design has been introduced  into the field of consumer research, our understanding of the phenomenon has not advanced  much beyond that which we inherited from other disciplines. There are a number of reasons  that the discipline of consumer research has not made more progress in the areas of  product design and aesthetics. Perhaps the most important reasons for the slow rate of  progress are that the relevance of product design for consumer research and design's  applicability to a broad range of products have been largely overlooked. Part of the  reason for this may be due to conceptions of design and aesthetics as being essentially  superficial styling or as pertaining primarily to works of art. Such views cast the  influence and scope of design and aesthetics in very narrow terms. This tends to minimize  design's importance (i.e., relevance to most product purchase situations) and obscure its  relationship to other areas that are of interest to consumer researchers (e.g., attitude,  involvement, diffusion of innovations, etc.). Many of the obstacles that have limited  consumer researchers progress in the areas of design and aesthetics are the same  fundamental issues that have impeded researchers in other disciplines that have studied  these topics. The fundamental design issue concerns how to best configure a product. This  issue is extremely complex because peoples' interactions with product designs involve  multiple design considerations (e.g., function, communication/interpretation, aesthetics)  that affect a number of different reactions (e.g., understanding, aesthetic response) to  the product (design). Issues such as the locus of aesthetic experience and the nature of  an "aesthetic object" (i.e., what constitutes an aesthetic object) continue to  stir debate and cloud aesthetic research (Holbrook and Zirlin 1985). These fundamental  issues must be addressed if design and aesthetics research is to become a viable stream in  consumer research.  Although there are a number of obstacles that must be overcome, there is  perhaps no discipline more ideally suited for the study of product design than that of  consumer research. This discipline offers the unique combination of scientific research  methods and a tangible research context (i.e., marketing, consumer/product focus). The  consumer/product context (as opposed to an "art" context) is extremely helpful  for investigating design and aesthetics questions because it allows philosophical  questions to be recast in a more concrete form. This can be done because  "successful" or "good" design in a marketing context is more easily  defined (i.e., more objective) than it is in an "art" context. This is not to  say that "good" design should be defined solely in terms of success in the  marketplace or that it will always result in high sales or increased market share. Rather,  this context provides a means for assessing the effects of a design because they are  manifest in observable behavior (e.g., product purchase) which is not shrouded in the  subtleties of "artistic appreciation." Consumer research offers a more direct,  concrete context in which to investigate the influence of design and the factors that  underlie peoples' responses to it (e.g., cultural influences, psychological influences,  visual organization principles, etc.). If consumer researchers are to make a genuine contribution to our  understanding of design and aesthetics beyond those made by other disciplines, the unique  research context that our field offers must be embraced. This means that the applied  consumer/product context of consumer research must be evident in the view of design that  the discipline adopts and the products on which it focuses. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CONSUMER RESEARCH In order for design and aesthetics research to progress researchers must  address the fundamental issues that have inhibited the development of theory. Moreover,  consumer researchers need to develop new ways of thinking about design and aesthetics that  reflect an applied consumer/product context.  It is important for consumer researchers to adopt a conceptualization of  design that acknowledges the different aspects of product design (i.e., functional,  communicative, and aesthetic) and the relationships and trade-offs among them. These  aspects represent different roles that the design of a product can play. The roles are the  different but often interrelated bases for the interaction between person and object  (i.e., consumer and product). The various aspects of product design play a vital role in  the interaction between consumer and product and thus may affect consumer behavior (e.g.,  comprehension, categorization, aesthetic response, preference, choice, use/performance,  etc.). In addition to adopting a conceptualization that reflects the various  roles that design plays in a consumer behavior context, a more complete understanding of  each design aspect is needed. The functional aspect of product design would seem to be  relatively straight forward. This aspect of a product's design is often thought to fall  almost entirely within the domain of engineering design. However, when considered in terms  of the consumerCproduct interaction a broader  view of the functional aspect of design emerges. For example, a screwdriver may be used to  turn screws or pry things open; shoes may be worn on feet or used to hammer tacks into a  wall. An object's form or configuration determines what one can use the object to do.  [This view of the functional aspect of design raises some interesting questions concerning  design to guard against product misuse as well as other safety issues.] While there is a  certain truth to the maxim "form follows function" this saying tends to obscure  the fact that function follows (i.e., is determined by) form. The form/function  distinction is somewhat misleading because the form (i.e., configuration) of a product  determines both how the product looks (i.e., aesthetics) and how it might be used (i.e.,  function).  The communicative aspect or role of design (e.g., product semantics) needs  to be explicitly differentiated from other design considerations and studied. This aspect  involves visual and iconic cues that help people to interpret what an object does and how  it is operated or used (e.g., the environmental controls in most recent automobiles use  the color red to indicate warm air and blue to indicate cool air). The ability of a  product (design) to effectively communicate its function and how it may be properly  operated can greatly facilitate successful personCproduct  interaction. Thus, the communicative aspect of design may affect how consumers perceive  and categorize a product (e.g., product class, complexity level/technological  sophistication), influence their attitude toward its use (e.g., difficult to use), and  shape their perception of the risks involved in purchasing the product (e.g., afraid they  will never use it because it is too difficult to figure out). Design which makes a product  more intelligible assists interpretation and enhances personCproduct interaction. Ultimately, the communicative  aspect of a design can make a product easier to use and thereby increase the utility of  the product. Progress in the area of the aesthetic aspect of design will depend on  consumer researchers' willingness to adopt (maintain) a more practical view of aesthetics  than has been adopted by other disciplines (except industrial design). The view of  aesthetics as pertaining only to art objects is too limited for consumer aesthetics and,  as was pointed out earlier, is not completely true to the classical roots of aesthetic  inquiry (e.g., Plato, The Republic). Consumer researchers should embrace a more inclusive  view of aesthetic experience. An aesthetic response has been defined as a response arising  from the interaction between an object's appearance (i.e., characteristics and  configuration) and the perceiver of the object (Berlyne 1974; Veryzer 1993). [This  definition reflects a visual orientation but may be adapted to reflect other orientations  (e.g., auditory, tactile, etc.).] This definition allows for the possibility that  virtually any product can be appreciated in an aesthetic sense (Berlyne 1974; Wallendorf  1980). Although this definition recognizes that all product designs involve an aesthetic  component, is does not suggest that aesthetic response plays a significant role in the  purchase of every product. Another feature of this definition is that it clearly  acknowledges the interaction between the perceiver and the object (i.e., product) in the  formation of an aesthetic response. Consumer researchers must also address questions concerning a product's  "nature" (i.e., aesthetic vs. utilitarian). Distinctions are often made between  "aesthetic" and "utilitarian" objects (e.g., Holbrook 1980; Holbrook  and Zirlin 1985). Clear distinctions such as these can be difficult to make because all  objects have an aesthetic component in that they have a physical form or appearance that  can be perceived and thus give rise to an aesthetic response (Berlyne 1974, p. 1; Holbrook  and Zirlin 1985; Wallendorf 1980). Likewise, one can argue that every object, even  "art" objects, may serve a utilitarian purpose or function (e.g., plays, music,  novels, and movies can be used to entertain; paintings and sculpture can be used to  establish a mood in a living or work space). Furthermore, distinctions concerning the  "aestheticness" (i.e., aesthetic or utilitarian nature) of an object imply that  aesthetic experience emanates from the object. While the aesthetic vs. utilitarian  distinction may possibly be made with respect to how a particular object is viewed or used  (i.e., consumed) by a particular person on a particular occasion, such a distinction is  person and situation specific (i.e., dependent). For example, consider the use of  "utilitarian" objects such as railroad paraphernalia (e.g., lanterns, railroad  track, railroad cars, crossing gates, etc.) to decorate the interior of a restaurant. In  such instances there is an inversion of a product's apparent nature from utilitarian to  aesthetic because of circumstances particular to the perceiver or as in this case the  situation. Thus, the aesthetic vs. utilitarian distinction is not intrinsic to an object.  Although some objects may be more likely to be appreciated primarily in either an  aesthetic or utilitarian sense within the context of a particular culture (i.e.,  situation), how the object is ultimately perceived is determined in large measure by the  perceiver and the underlying factors that affect his or her perception (e.g., culture,  psychological characteristics, etc.). A more useful way of classifying products may be to focus on the aesthetic  and/or utilitarian intention (i.e., the purpose or aim of the interest in the object) of  the perceiver. This approach acknowledges the role of the perceiver as well as the  situational factors in determining the "nature" (aesthetic or utilitarian) of an  object. For example, an antique clock could potentially be appreciated for primarily  aesthetic or utilitarian reasons. The degree to which it is appreciated for either one or  both of these things is not fixed by the object (e.g., clock) itself but rather can vary  depending on the "intention" (i.e., reason for examining the object) of the  perceiver of the object on a particular occasion. Clearly, there may be factors such as  culture or situation specific influences (e.g., peer group, economic circumstances) that  encourage a tendency to appreciate a product in a particular manner (i.e., aesthetic or  utilitarian). Thus, to some degree intention may be "fixed" (i.e., determined)  by factors external to the product (e.g., in one culture a play may be a way of imparting  history or values while in another culture the play may be viewed as entertainment).  Another way of looking at products involves the sentient nature of (a  response to) an object. "Sentientality" refers to the degree to which the design  of a product consistently promotes a particular sensation or feeling (e.g., aesthetic  response) across perceivers of the product. Sentientality is concerned with the  consistency of the response to the product rather than whether the response is positive or  negative. Therefore, high-sentientality can refer to either a consistently positive or  consistently negative (or consistently neutral) response. In the case of products  exhibiting high-sentientality, it is likely that the consistent (i.e., systematic)  response is due to underlying factors that consciously or unconsciously influence peoples  reactions to the object (e.g., visual organization principles - unity, proportion, etc.).  [See Veryzer 1993 for a discussion of the Design Principle Algorithm explanation of  aesthetic response.] Products that do not foster consistent responses across perceivers  can be said to exhibit low-sentientality. In such cases, responses to product design are  likely to reflect primarily idiosyncratic influences (e.g., person specific experiences).  Sentientality acknowledges the role of the product in forming responses to design.  However, it is likely to be dependent, in part, on things such as internalized visual  organization principles and prevalent aesthetic associations (i.e., association between an  element or characteristic of an object and a previously encountered object or situation)  that the perceiver has developed. Thus, the sentientality exhibited by a product is not  necessarily intrinsic to the product itself (e.g., products that display the colors  associated with a particular school may be prized in the region near the school but  treated indifferently outside of that region).  FIGURE 1 PRODUCT DESIGN DISPOSITION GRID These two dimensions (i.e., continuums), perceiver intention and product  sentientality, can be combined to form a grid that can be used to "classify"  products according to the perceiver's intention toward the product (i.e., aesthetic and/or  utilitarian interest) and the degree to which the product fosters a systematic response  when perceived. In Figure 1, the four panels of the grid represent different product  "natures" or dispositions with respect to consumer response to product design. A  consumer's response may reflect a utilitarian or aesthetic intention or possibly both. For  products where the perceiver's current intention is utilitarian the response would involve  a reaction to the product's abilities (or suitability) to perform a given task (e.g.,  frustration because a product is difficult to operate). For products where the perceiver's  current intention involved aesthetic appreciation the reaction would be an aesthetic  response. In cases where the perceiver's intention concerns both utilitarian and aesthetic  appreciation both types of responses would be involved. Sentientality refers to the  consistency of these "intention-based" responses. That is, the degree to which a  product promotes a consistent response with respect to aesthetic- and/or utilitarian-based  responses. For example, consumers may consistently appreciate the accuracy of a particular  digital wristwatch in keeping time (i.e., high-sentientality of utilitarian-based  intention). However, consumers may have a wide variety of reactions to the watch's  appearance (i.e., low-sentientality of aesthetic-based intention). In the event forces  external to the product shift, the "disposition" of the product may change  (e.g., new technology could make the watch obsolete; a "back-to-basics" trend  could lead consumers to view the high-tech. look of digital watches negatively).  The product design disposition grid is one approach to understanding  product responses to design and the mutable nature of products. The approach acknowledges  the roles of both the product and the perceiver in forming a response to a (product)  design. An approach such as this would seem to offer a perspective that is less  problematic with respect to the changeable nature of products than the traditional  aesthetic vs. utilitarian distinction. In addition to the areas that relate directly to the fundamental issues of  design and aesthetics, there are a number of other important research questions that need  to be investigated. More research is needed to identify factors that influence peoples'  responses to product designs (e.g., psychological factors, culture, socio-economic  factors, gender, visual organization principles, prototypicality, etc.). Another area that  requires further study concerns the relationship between product "disposition"  and fashion cycles. Changes in product preference patterns suggest that a disruption or  shift in a product's sentientality may have occurred. A better understanding of the  process by which such shifts occur could lead to a more complete understanding of fashion  as it pertains to product design. The development of methods for studying the consumerCproduct interaction should also receive more  attention. Ultimately, methods are needed that can guide decisions concerning product  configuration. Finally, the relationships between design and other streams in consumer  research need to be explored. The often subtle and unconscious influence of design and  aesthetics on consumers' product perceptions may have an indirect affect on a broad range  of behaviors. Design and aesthetics may be a factor in areas of interest to consumer  researchers such as attitude formation, brand choice, categorization, involvement,  symbolic consumption, etc. CONCLUSION Design is an important variable that can have a significant impact on  consumers' responses to products. As such, it is a legitimate marketing interest that  merits the attention of consumer researchers. The discipline of consumer research is well  suited for studying product design and aesthetics because of its research methods and its  applied consumer/product context. The ability to make new and meaningful contributions to  our knowledge of design and aesthetics will depend on utilization of this context in order  to address the issues that continue to inhibit progress in these areas. If this stream is  to become viable, the ambiguities surrounding conceptions of design and aesthetics as well  as the questions concerning the products suitable for study must be addressed. Although  the discipline of consumer research has not rushed to investigate or embrace the study of  design and aesthetics, it has in the past clearly shown that it is open to exploring areas  such as these. However, the burden falls, as it should, on the researchers investigating  these topics to demonstrate that design and aesthetic considerations are important and  relevant to consumer research. In order to do this consumer researchers must be willing to  approach design and aesthetics from their own perspective and formulate new ways of  thinking about these topics that reflect the unique perspective of the consumer research  discipline.
