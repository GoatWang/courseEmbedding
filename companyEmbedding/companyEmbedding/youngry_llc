Announcement




Naturally Wholesome Products LLC is voluntarily recalling gallon and pint containers of Half & Half labeled under the brand name Wholesome Country Creamery due to the presence of Alkaline Phosphatase found in samples during routine testing. Naturally Wholesome Products LLC has received no reports of illnesses related to the affected product and is removing the product from the market out of the abundance of caution.All gallon and pint containers involved in this recall have a batch code of 4052917 or 2060517. Distribution of the affected product was limited in scope. No other Naturally Wholesome Products LLC products are affected by this recall.The company initiated this voluntary recall because, in routine testing, samples of the affected product were found to contain Alkaline Phosphatase, an enzyme naturally present in raw milk but not in milk that has been properly pasteurized. The North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, during a follow-up investigation of the plant, identified 2 batches of Half & Half that were not pasteurized per the requirements of the Pasteurized Milk Ordinance.The recall involves 244 units of the affected product which was distributed only in North Carolina. The company is actively notifying customers and is in the process of retrieving the affected product.How to Identify The Recalled ProductThis recall includes only gallon and pint containers of Half & Half that carry the Wholesome Country Creamery brand name. The containers have a small white sticker reading: 4052917 or 2060517.No other Naturally Wholesome Products LLC products are included in this recall.Naturally Wholesome Products LLC has ceased distribution of the affected product and recovery is actively underway. Consumers who have this product should not consume it. They should discard it and may return the product container to the place of purchase for a full refund or exchange. Consumers with questions can contact the company at (336) 468-1520.Because the presence of Alkaline Phosphatase in milk suggests the milk may not have been pasteurized sufficiently, it is possible that pathogens present in the raw milk to begin with, including Salmonella, Campylobacter, Listeria, and/or E. coli, have survived and, if ingested, could cause gastrointestinal infection and its potential ensuing complications.

We will utilize ad networks and sponsored content opportunities.  Why We Founded ThisEntrepreneurship means more small businesses and competition amongst the field. This competition drives innovation, fair prices, and wages. For the past several decades though, entrepreneurship had been on the decline and the strive to build a legacy for oneself had fallen to the wayside. Fortunately the likes of Mark Zuckerburg and Elon Musk realizing their dream and vision have inspired a new generation of entrepreneurs to believe in their creations that will change the world. We are once again unafraid to dream. And no one knows more about capturing the American Dream than Ankur K Garg. Immigrating to the States at an early age, Garg has thrived building empires for others. His latest success, Shredz, saw the company prosper from packaging supplements in-home to becoming the mogul fitness empire that they are today. He helped introduce the legitimacy of social media to business, by seeing a newly formed company reach grow from $90,000 to $5 million in just one year. Now, he’s turning his sights to realizing his own vision by supporting the launch of Youngry™. His co-founder, Ash Kumra, is an award winning entrepreneur, author, public speaker and talk show host recognized twice by the White House as an entrepreneur making an impact. He is also an authority on entrepreneurship, social media & branding by authoring the book series "Confessions from an Entrepreneur", spoken to over 10,000 people and has been cited in 100's of articles including Forbes Magazine, Huffington Post, American Express Forum, Entrepreneur Magazine, Startup America/Up Global, LA Times, OC Register, Tedx & The White House. Ash has also hosted over 100 interview with business mavens, authors, entrepreneurs and celebrities who have achieved their dreams and goals. Prizes “Social Media Momentum” Strategy Session (virtual) with social media expert, media personality and author Shama Hyder.One hour lunch in Los Angeles with 4 time Grammy award winner and Black Eyed Peas member Apl.De.ApA TV Spot on Live With Lisa on Cox Cable hosted by former Miss Nevada and serial entrepreneur Lisa Song.A one year online entrepreneurship mentoring packaging session and LA office space from Expert Dojo.

Join & Invest In Our Movement!
We have opened the ground floor to people passionate about entrepreneurship to own a piece of our democratized media platform and have their voice heard in shaping the stories that we'll be covering!
Youngry™ is for the global entrepreneur community (both our young/hungry minded audience and the mentors that help make them a success). We are seeking $50,000 to turn our vision into reality. Use Of Fund Highlights
$50k goal

Editorial Content Site: We will feature mentors, contributors to provide guidance.
We will also launch our e-commerce storefront in full force so we can monetize from day one.
$500k goal and beyond

Youngry™ will begin to adapt the ESPN/Live Stream and VOD Entrepreneur Video Library portion. This will be a 24/7 and live stream and video on demand feed. Part of the capital will be going into developing and marketing this concept. Not only will there be a constant news cycle of events going around the world, but entrepreneurs will be able to go through the vast library of contributors and other great minds to learn.
We will also begin creating original content. These will be full in-depth articles, videos, and native advertisements. Initially we will be doing this for just sponsored posts but will be expanding its selection. Letter from the Co-Founder
The most exciting thing about being a part of this venture is that I get to partner with you. With Title III, we will be participating in building a voice that is no longer controlled by the few with vested interests in pushing and promoting their own agendas. Now each of us, the hard working - never sleeping - entrepreneurs (please tell me I'm not the only one out there) will be able to let a media platform know what you want to see covered.
I am passionate about Youngry because I see its potential to transform how we share memories. My generation is entering into a time of our lives where we’re creating memorable life experiences every day. My whole dream was to provide a product that inspires the experience, captures the moment, and enables people to share them in personal way.
Sincerely,

Ankur K Garg

What is Youngry?

We are a next generation media company celebrating entrepreneurship. We will provide news content, distribution of original video programming, and products/services to help one become a better entrepreneur and business creator. 




How will you make money?



How will you make money?

We will fund our business primarily through an e-commerce store front selling motivational “Youngry” entrepreneur inspired clothing and premium media featuring top successful entrepreneurs (audio, e-books, video courses, live events). We have already established a partnership with one of Amazon’s top e-commerce programs Amazon Exclusives. Through this we will create a store front on Youngry.com,have Amazon assisting with sales/marketing and have already generated revenues! We also will make revenues secondary with selected ad/sponsor supported content.




What are the biggest risks you will face?



What are the biggest risks you will face?

First and foremost - you may lose all your money so please don't invest more than you can afford to lose.
In investing, greater risks can yield sometimes the best gains. We are projecting to be a revenue substantial generating company within our first 12 months. However there is a chance we might have to do a followup capital raise for additional sales/marketing if our projections require more time. 
Also we are media company and might face economic and natural factors out of our control that could affect consumer e-commerce purchasing and advertisements/sponsor.s 




Where are you in the process of building the product?



Where are you in the process of building the product?

We are developing our online editorial platform (text, video, audio) and have sourced 20 article contributors to start writing. We intend to have this live nearing the end of our campaign. 
We are also working with amazon.com to develop our youngry.com storefront and Amazon seller package.  We intend to have this live nearing the end of our campaign. 




What makes you better than your competitors?



What makes you better than your competitors?

We are e-commerce focused as a revenue versus online advertising/sponsorship (which is traditionally the norm for digital content media companies). Specifically our business model is unique in that we continue to drive more value for our audience with both free and premium content. See below for more info on this:
We provide an online editorial platform (text, video, audio) featuring top mentors, serial entrepreneurs and influencers as contributors on topics most pertinent to help the young and hungry minded entrepreneurs succeed on Youngry.com, social media and affiliated channels.
We will take the most popular articles and entrepreneur themes and provide various e-commerce products (digital books, live events, webinars) featuring the original contributors. The contributors will participate in revenue sharing opportunities with these products and the Youngry audience will now develop a deeper relationship with the people who are helping them!
Youngry will also offer a 24/7 online video stream (both live video and video on demand) of global entrepreneurship efforts (fireside chats, panels, pitch contests, keynote speeches, important conferences) and Youngry live events. We likely will have this hosted on our Facebook page so it’s a viral social tool, keep video hosting costs down and even anticipate this to generate sponsorships.
We are one of the first media campaigns in the nation to do a Title III campaign as our first source of investment seeking.
Youngry is for the global entrepreneur community and we plan to promote success stories in many under-served markets including:
MillennialsGen ZImmigrants College StudentsWomen Minority EntrepreneursPolitica/ActivistSocial Impact
We are developing a proprietary content model as well to help us democraticlly approve early stage entreprenuer success stories. This will leverage public social media data, public company traction accolades and sectors.

Risks








No market for the services we provide currently exists

While markets exist for certain of our services, there is little precedent or basis of comparison for the aggregatedplatform-based services that we provide. Although we have identified what we believe to be a need in the market forour services, there can be no assurance that demand or a market will develop or that we will be able to create aviable business. Our future financial performance will depend, at least in part, upon the introduction and marketacceptance of our services. Potential customers may be unwilling to accept, utilize or recommend any of ourproposed services. If we are unable to commercialize and market our proposed services when planned, we may notachieve any market acceptance or generate revenue.



We have yet to generate any generated revenue and do not foresee generating any revenue in the near future;consequently, we will be reliant on external financing

We are a startup company and our business model currently focuses obtaining $50,000 over the next two monthsfrom this Offering, rather than generating revenue. While we intend to generate revenue in the future, we cannotassure you when or if we will be able to do so.We rely on external financing to fund our operations. We anticipate, based on our current proposed plans andassumptions relating to our operations (including the timetable of, and costs associated with, new productdevelopment) that, if the Minimum Amount is raised in this Offering, it will be sufficient to satisfy our contemplatedcash requirements through approximately two months, assuming that we do not accelerate the development of otheropportunities available to us, engage in an extraordinary transaction or otherwise face unexpected events, costs orcontingencies, any of which could affect our cash requirements.We expect capital outlays and operating expenditures to increase over the next several years as we expand ourinfrastructure, commercial operations, development activities and establish offices. Our future funding requirementswill depend on many factors, including but not limited to the following:* The cost of expanding our operations;* The financial terms and timing of any collaborations, licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter;* The rate of progress and cost of development activities;* The need to respond to technological changes and increased competition;* The costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights;* The cost and delays in product development that may result from changes in regulatory requirements applicable toour products; * Sales and marketing efforts to bring these new product candidates to market;* Unforeseen difficulties in establishing and maintaining an effective sales and distribution network; and* Lack of demand for and market acceptance of our products and technologies.We may have difficulty obtaining additional funding and we cannot assure you that additional capital will beavailable to us when needed, if at all, or if available, will be obtained on terms acceptable to us. If we raiseadditional funds by issuing additional debt securities, such debt instruments may provide for rights, preferences orprivileges senior to the Securities. In addition, the terms of the debt securities issued could impose significantrestrictions on our operations. If we raise additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements, wemight be required to relinquish significant rights to our technologies or product candidates, or grant licenses onterms that are not favorable to us. If adequate funds are not available, we may have to delay, scale back, or eliminatesome of our operations or our research development and commercialization activities. Under these circumstances, ifthe Company is unable to acquire additional capital or is required to raise it on terms that are less satisfactory thandesired, it may have a material adverse effect on its financial condition.



We have no operating history upon which you can evaluate our performance, and accordingly, our prospectsmust be considered in light of the risks that any new company encounters

We were organized under the laws of Delaware on June 14, 2016. Accordingly, we have no history upon which anevaluation of our prospects and future performance can be made. Our proposed operations are subject to all businessrisks associated with new enterprises. The likelihood of our creation of a viable business must be considered in lightof the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications, and delays frequently encountered in connection with theinception of a business, operation in a competitive industry, and the continued development of advertising,promotions, and a corresponding client base. We anticipate that our operating expenses will increase for the nearfuture. There can be no assurances that we will ever operate profitably. You should consider the Company'sbusiness, operations and prospects in light of the risks, expenses and challenges faced as an early-stage company.



In order for the Company to compete and grow, it must attract, recruit, retain and develop the necessarypersonnel who have the needed experience.

Recruiting and retaining highly qualified personnel is critical to our success. These demands may require us to hireadditional personnel and will require our existing management personnel to develop additional expertise. We faceintense competition for personnel. The failure to attract and retain personnel or to develop such expertise coulddelay or halt the development and commercialization of our product candidates. If we experience difficulties inhiring and retaining personnel in key positions, we could suffer from delays in product development, loss ofcustomers and sales and diversion of management resources, which could adversely affect operating results. Ourconsultants and advisors may be employed by third parties and may have commitments under consulting or advisorycontracts with third parties that may limit their availability to us.



The development and commercialization of our services is highly competitive

We face competition with respect to any products that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future. Ourcompetitors include major companies worldwide. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial,technical and human resources than we have and superior expertise in developing and marketing entrepreneurs andstartup companies and thus may be better equipped than us to develop and commercialize these services. Thesecompetitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel. Smaller or early stage companiesmay also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large andestablished companies. Accordingly, our competitors may commercialize products more rapidly or effectively thanwe are able to, which would adversely affect our competitive position, the likelihood that our services will achieveinitial market acceptance and our ability to generate meaningful additional revenues from our products.



We plan to implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business

There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the marketsare not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services, wemay invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines ofbusiness and/or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not provefeasible. We may not be successful in introducing new products and services in response to industry trends ordevelopments in technology, or those new products may not achieve market acceptance. As a result, we could losebusiness, be forced to price products and services on less advantageous terms to retain or attract clients, or be subjectto cost increases. As a result, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.



The Company's success depends on the experience and skill of the board of directors, its executive officers andkey employees.

The Company is a startup company and currently only employs two individuals. The success of the Company willdepend on the performance and continued retention of these key employees, particularly its president, Ash Kumra.The Company has or intends to enter into an employment agreement with Mr. Kumra although there can be noassurance that it will do so or that Mr. Kumra, or any member of the board of directors or executive officer willcontinue to be employed or engaged by the Company for a particular period of time. The loss of Mr. Kumra or anymember of the board of directors or executive officer would adversely affect the Company's business operations,financial condition and cash flow.



The amount of capital the Company is attempting to raise in the Offering is not enough to sustain the Company'scurrent business plan.

In order to achieve the Company's near and long-term goals, the Company will need to procure funds in addition tothe amount raised in the Offering. There is no guarantee the Company will be able to raise such funds on acceptableterms or at all. If we are not able to raise sufficient capital in the future, we will not be able to execute our businessplan, our continued operations will be in jeopardy and we may be forced to cease operations and sell or otherwisetransfer all or substantially all of our remaining assets, which could cause a Purchaser to lose all or a portion of hisor her investment.



Although dependent on certain key personnel, the Company does not have any key man life insurance policies onany such individuals.

While the Company is dependent on its two employees, in particular its president, Ash Kumra, in order to conductits operations and execute its business plan, the Company has not purchased any insurance policies with respect tothe death or disability of those individuals. Therefore, in the event that any of the Company's employees die orbecome disabled, the Company will not receive any insurance proceeds as compensation for such person's absence.The loss of such person could would negatively affect the Company and its operations.



The proceeds from the Offering are necessary to the Company's operations

Without the proceeds of the Offering, the Company will not be able to sustain its operations. The Company does nothave adequate alternative sources of capital and therefore, is entirely dependent on this Offering. If the Company hasmisjudged the amount of capital it needs or needs additional capital in the future, it may not be able to obtain suchcapital and would not be able to continue operations. This provides the Company with very little financial flexibilityto adapt to the market and industry in which it operates. This lack of capital and flexibility could harm the Companyand cause a Purchaser to lose all or a portion of his or her investment.



We have not prepared any audited financial statements

Investors have no audited financial information regarding the Company's capitalization or assets or liabilities onwhich to make an investment decision. If you feel the information provided in this Offering is insufficient to make asound and informed investment, you should not invest in the Company.



We are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, networth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the US and various foreign jurisdictions.

Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. In theordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination isuncertain. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable: (i) there is no assurance that the finaldetermination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our income tax provisions,expense amounts for non-income based taxes and accruals and (ii) any material differences could have an adverseeffect on our financial position and results of operations in the period or periods for which determination is made.



We are not subject to Sarbanes-Oxley regulations and lack the financial controls and safeguards required ofpublic companies.

We do not have the internal infrastructure necessary, and are not required, to complete an attestation about ourfinancial controls that would be required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. There can be noassurance that there are no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the quality of our financial controls.We expect to incur additional expenses and diversion of management's time if and when it becomes necessary toperform the system and process evaluation, testing and remediation required in order to comply with themanagement certification and auditor attestation requirements.



Changes in employment laws or regulation could harm our performance.

Various federal and state labor laws govern our relationship with our employees and affect operating costs. Theselaws include minimum wage requirements, overtime pay, healthcare reform and the implementation of the PatientProtection and Affordable Care Act, unemployment tax rates, workers' compensation rates, citizenship requirements, union membership and sales taxes. A number of factors could adversely affect our operating results,including additional government-imposed increases in minimum wages, overtime pay, paid leaves of absence andmandated health benefits, mandated training for employees, increased tax reporting and tax payment, changingregulations from the National Labor Relations Board and increased employee litigation including claims relating tothe Fair Labor Standards Act.



Maintaining, extending and expanding our reputation and brand image are essential to our business success

We seek to maintain, extend, and expand our brand image through marketing investments, including advertising andconsumer promotions, and product innovation. Increasing attention on marketing could adversely affect our brandimage. It could also lead to stricter regulations and greater scrutiny of marketing practices. Existing or increasedlegal or regulatory restrictions on our advertising, consumer promotions and marketing, or our response to thoserestrictions, could limit our efforts to maintain, extend and expand our brands. Moreover, adverse publicity aboutregulatory or legal action against us could damage our reputation and brand image, undermine our customers'confidence and reduce long-term demand for our products, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or notmaterial to our operations.In addition, our success in maintaining, extending, and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt toa rapidly changing media environment. We increasingly rely on social media and online dissemination ofadvertising campaigns. The growing use of social and digital media increases the speed and extent that informationor misinformation and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us, our brands or our products onsocial or digital media, whether or not valid, could seriously damage our brands and reputation. If we do notestablish, maintain, extend and expand our brand image, then our product sales, financial condition and results ofoperations could be adversely affected.



The Company's products may be generated by third-party vendors over which the Company has little control;product quality concerns could negatively affect the Company's business.

The Company's success depends in large part on sales of e-commerce and entertainment products, such as digitalbooks and live webinars and other events. These products may be manufactured or tickets to Company events maybe sold by third-party vendors instead of by the Company's employees. While the Company intends to implementrigorous standards in selecting vendors and enforcing product quality standards, if products taken to market are ofpoor quality, the Company's product sales and reputation will suffer.



We must correctly predict, identify, and interpret changes in consumer preferences and demand, offer newproducts to meet those changes, and respond to competitive innovation.

Consumer preferences our products change continually. Our success depends on our ability to predict, identify, andinterpret the tastes and habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to consumer preferences. If we do notoffer products that appeal to consumers, our sales and market share will decrease. We must distinguish betweenshort-term fads, mid-term trends, and long-term changes in consumer preferences. If we do not accurately predictwhich shifts in consumer preferences will be long-term, or if we fail to introduce new and improved products tosatisfy those preferences, our sales could decline. In addition, because of our varied customer base, we must offer anarray of products that satisfy the broad spectrum of consumer preferences. If we fail to expand our product offeringssuccessfully across product categories, or if we do not rapidly develop products in faster growing and moreprofitable categories, demand for our products could decrease, which could materially and adversely affect ourproduct sales, financial condition, and results of operations.In addition, achieving growth depends on our successful development, introduction, and marketing of innovativenew products and line extensions. Successful innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer andconsumer acceptance, to obtain, protect and maintain necessary intellectual property rights, and to avoid infringingthe intellectual property rights of others and failure to do so could compromise our competitive position andadversely impact our business.



Evolving tax, environmental, and safety or other regulations or failure to comply with existing licensing,labeling, trade, and other regulations and laws could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financialcondition.

Our activities or products, both in and outside of the United States, are subject to regulation by various federal, state,provincial and local laws, regulations and government agencies, including the U.S. Federal CommunicationsDivision (“FCC”), U.S. Federal Trade Commission, and the U.S. Departments of Commerce and Labor, as well assimilar and other authorities outside of the United States, International Accords and Treaties and others, includingvoluntary regulation by other bodies. These laws and regulations and interpretations thereof may change, sometimesdramatically, as a result of a variety of factors, including political, economic or social events. We are also regulated with respect to matters such as licensing requirements, trade and pricing practices, tax, anti-corruption standards,advertising and claims, and environmental matters. The need to comply with new, evolving or revised tax,environmental, labeling or other laws or regulations, or new, or changed interpretations or enforcement of existinglaws or regulations, may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Further, if we are found tobe out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations in these areas, we could be subject to civil remedies,including fines, injunctions, termination of necessary licenses or permits, or recalls, as well as potential criminalsanctions, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business. Even if regulatory review does not result inthese types of determinations, it could potentially create negative publicity or perceptions which could harm ourbusiness or reputation.



Changes in government regulation could adversely impact our business

The media, television, internet and entertainment industries are subject to extensive legislation and regulation at thefederal and local levels and, in some instances, at the state level. Many aspects of such regulation are currently thesubject of judicial and administrative proceedings, legislative and administrative proposals, and lobbying efforts byus and our competitors. Legislation under consideration could entirely rewrite our principal regulatory statute, andthe FCC and/or Congress may attempt to change the classification of or change the way that our platform and ecommerceproducts are regulated and/or change the framework under which broadcast signals are carried, removethe copyright compulsory license and changing rights and obligations of our competitors. We expect that courtactions and regulatory proceedings will continue to refine our rights and obligations under applicable federal, stateand local laws, which cannot be predicted. Modifications to existing requirements or imposition of newrequirements or limitations could have an adverse impact on our business.



Net neutrality could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations

On February 26, 2015, the FCC ruled in favor of net neutrality by reclassifying Internet broadband access as atelecommunications service and thus applying Title II (common carrier) of The Communications Act of 1934 toInternet service providers. This new classification could result in increased barriers to entry and costs that we mayby necessity pass off to our customers. Therefore, the FCC ruling and its consequences could adversely affect ourbusiness and results of operations.



We may not be able to adapt to new content distribution platforms and to changes in consumer behavior resultingfrom these new technologies

We must successfully adapt to technological advances in our industry, including the emergence of alternativedistribution platforms. Our ability to exploit new distribution platforms and viewing technologies will affect ourability to maintain or grow our business and may increase our capital expenditures. Additionally, we must adapt tochanging consumer behavior driven by advances such as DVRs, video-on-demand, online based content delivery,Blu-ray™ players, game consoles and mobile devices. Such changes may impact the revenue we are able to generatefrom our traditional distribution methods by decreasing the viewership of our networks on cable and other MVPDsystems. If we fail to adapt our distribution methods and content to emerging technologies, our appeal to ourtargeted audiences might decline and there would be a materially adverse effect on our business and results ofoperations.



New technologies may make our products and services obsolete or unneeded.

New and emerging technological advances, such as mobile computing devices that allow consumers to obtaininformation and view content may adversely impact or eliminate the demand for our products and services. Theincreasing availability of content on such devices, the improved video quality of the content on such devices andfaster wireless delivery speeds may make individuals less likely to purchase our services. Our success can depend onnew product development. The entertainment and communications industry is ever-changing as new technologiesare introduced. Advances in technology, such as new video formats, downloading or alternative methods of productdelivery and distribution channels, such as the Internet, or certain changes in consumer behavior driven by these orother technologies and methods of delivery, could have a negative effect on our business. These changes couldlower cost barriers for our competitors desiring to enter into, or expand their presence in, the interactive servicesbusiness. Increased competition may adversely affect our business and results of operations.



We face risks relating to competition for the leisure time and discretionary spending of audiences, which hasintensified in part due to advances in technology and changes in consumer expectations and behavior.

Our business is subject to risks relating to increasing competition for the leisure time and discretionary spending ofconsumers. We compete with all other sources of entertainment and information delivery. Technologicaladvancements, such as new video formats and Internet streaming and downloading of programming that can beviewed on televisions, computers and mobile devices have increased the number of entertainment and informationdelivery choices available to consumers and intensified the challenges posed by audience fragmentation. The increasing number of choices available to audiences, including low-cost or free choices, could negatively impact notonly consumer demand for our products and services, but also advertisers' willingness to purchase advertising fromus. Our failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to new technologies and changes in consumer expectations andbehavior could significantly adversely affect our competitive position and its business and results of operations.



Piracy of the Company's content may decrease the revenues received from the sale of our content and adverselyaffect our businesses.

The piracy of our content, products and other intellectual property poses significant challenges for us. Technologicaldevelopments, such as the proliferation of cloud-based storage and streaming, increased broadband Internet speedand penetration and increased speed of mobile data transmission have made it easier to create, transmit, distributeand store high quality unauthorized copies of content in unprotected digital formats, which has in turn encouragedthe creation of highly scalable businesses that facilitate, and in many instances financially benefit from, such piracy.Piracy is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack effective copyright and technical legalprotections or enforcement measures, and illegitimate operators based in these parts of the world can attract viewersfrom anywhere in the world. The proliferation of unauthorized copies and piracy of the Company's content,products and intellectual property or the products it licenses from others could result in a reduction of the revenuesthat the Company receives from the legitimate sale, licensing and distribution of its content and products. TheCompany devotes substantial resources to protecting its content, products and intellectual property, but there can beno assurance that the Company's efforts to enforce its rights and combat piracy will be successful.



Our success depends on consumer acceptance of our content and we may be adversely affected if our contentfails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or the costs to create or acquire content increase

We create and acquire media and entertainment content, the success of which depends substantially on consumertastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. The success of these businesses depends on ourability to consistently create, acquire, market and distribute video streams, webinars, digital books and other contentthat meet the changing preferences of the broad domestic and international consumer market. We have invested, andwill continue to invest, substantial amounts in our content, including in the production of original content, beforelearning the extent to which it would earn consumer acceptance.We also obtain a significant portion of our content from third parties, such as streaming media services, freelancewriters, photographers and other suppliers. Competition for popular content is intense, and we may have to increasethe price we are willing to pay or be outbid by our competitors for popular content. Entering into or renewingcontracts for such programming rights or acquiring additional rights may result in significantly increased costs.There can be no assurance that revenue from these contracts will exceed our cost for the rights, as well as the othercosts of producing and distributing the content. If our content does not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance, or ifwe cannot obtain or retain rights to popular content on acceptable terms, or at all, our businesses may be adverselyaffected.



Our business could be adversely affected if there is a decline in advertising spending

A decline in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy in general could cause current or prospectiveadvertisers to spend less on advertising or spend their advertising dollars in other media. Advertising expendituresalso could be negatively affected by (i) increasing audience fragmentation caused by increased availability ofalternative forms of leisure and entertainment activities; (ii) the increased use of digital video recorders to skipadvertisements; (iii) pressure from public interest groups to reduce or eliminate advertising of certain products;(iv) new laws and regulations that prohibit or restrict certain types of advertisements; and (v) natural disasters,extreme weather, acts of terrorism, political uncertainty or hostilities, because there may be uninterrupted newscoverage of such events that disrupts regular ad placement. In addition, advertisers' willingness to purchaseadvertising time from the Company may be adversely affected by a decline in customers and audience ratings forour content.



We derive substantial revenues from the sale of advertising, and a decrease in overall advertising expenditurescould lead to a reduction in the amount of advertising that companies are willing to purchase and the price atwhich they purchase it.

Expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical and have become less predictable in recent years, reflecting domesticand global economic conditions. If the economic prospects of advertisers or current economic conditions worsen,such conditions could alter current or prospective advertisers' spending priorities. In particular, advertisers in certainindustries that are more susceptible to weakness in domestic and global economic conditions, such as beauty,fashion and retail and food, account for a significant portion of our advertising revenues, and weakness in theseindustries could have a disproportionate negative impact on our advertising revenues. Declines in consumerspending on advertisers' products due to weak economic conditions could also indirectly negatively impact our advertising revenues, as advertisers may not perceive as much value from advertising if consumers are purchasingfewer of their products or services. As a result, our advertising revenues are less predictable.



Fluctuations in the mix of customer demand for our various types of solution offerings could impact ourfinancial performance and ability to forecast performance.

Due to fluctuations in customer tastes and general economic conditions, customer demand for the range of ourofferings varies from time to time and is not predictable. For example, demand for e-commerce products relating toone particular entrepreneur will depend on a myriad of factors, including the success of that entrepreneur, amount ofpublicity and support engendered by the Company, and the nature of the entrepreneur's business. In addition, ourgross margins vary by customer and by segment and the mix of services provided to our customers could impact ourresults of operations as certain of our customers and segments have different gross margin profiles. Generally, theprofitability of an account increases over time. As a result, the mix of solutions we provide to our customers variesat any given time, both within a quarter and from quarter-to-quarter. These variations in service mix impact grossmargins and the predictability of gross margins for any period. You should not rely on the results of any one quarteras an indication of our future performance.



Our operating results may fluctuate due to factors that are difficult to forecast and not within our control

Our past operating results may not be accurate indicators of future performance, and you should not rely on suchresults to predict our future performance. Our operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past, and couldfluctuate in the future. Factors that may contribute to fluctuations include:* changes in aggregate capital spending, cyclicality and other economic conditions, or domestic and internationaldemand in the industries we serve;* our ability to effectively manage our working capital;* our ability to satisfy consumer demands in a timely and cost-effective manner;* pricing and availability of labor and materials;* our inability to adjust certain fixed costs and expenses for changes in demand;* shifts in geographic concentration of customers, supplies and labor pools; and* seasonal fluctuations in demand and our revenue.



If we fail to attract and retain enough sufficiently trained customer service associates and other personnel tosupport our operations, our business and results of operations will be seriously harmed.

We rely on customer service associates, and our success depends to a significant extent on our ability to attract, hire,train and retain qualified customer service associates. Companies in our industry, including us, experience highemployee attrition. Our attrition rate for our customer service associates who remained with us following a 90-daytraining and orientation period was on average approximately 5% per month. A significant increase in the attritionrate among our customer service associates could decrease our operating efficiency and productivity. Our failure toattract, train and retain customer service associates with the qualifications necessary to fulfill the needs of ourexisting and future clients would seriously harm our business and results of operations.



Our ability to sell our products and services is dependent on the quality of our technical support services, and ourfailure to offer high quality technical support services would have a material adverse effect on our sales andresults of operations

Once our products are deployed within our end-customers' operations, end-customers depend on our technicalsupport services to resolve any issues relating to these products. If we do not effectively assist our customers indeploying these products, succeed in helping our customers quickly resolve post-deployment issues, and provideeffective ongoing support, our ability to sell additional products and services to existing customers would beadversely affected and our reputation with potential customers could be damaged. As a result, our failure to maintainhigh quality support services would have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.



We may be adversely affected by cyclicality, volatility or an extended downturn in the United States or worldwideeconomy, or in or related to the industries we serve.

Our revenues are generated primarily from servicing entrepreneurs seeking to hire qualified marketing professionalsin the media industry and from customers seeking to purchase e-commerce products relating to such entrepreneurs.Demand for these professionals tends to be tied to economic and business cycles. Increases in the unemploymentrate, specifically in the technology and other vertical industries we serve, cyclicality or an extended downturn in theeconomy could cause our revenues to decline. Therefore, our operating results, business and financial conditioncould be significantly harmed by an extended economic downturn or future downturns, especially in regions orindustries where our operations are heavily concentrated. Further, we may face increased pricing pressures during such periods as customers seek to use lower cost or fee services, which may adversely affect our financial conditionand results of operations.



We are subject to rapid technological change and dependence on new product development

Our industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological developments, frequent new productintroductions and enhancements, continually evolving business expectations and swift changes. To competeeffectively in such markets, we must continually improve and enhance its products and services and develop newtechnologies and services that incorporate technological advances, satisfy increasing customer expectations andcompete effectively on the basis of performance and price. Our success will also depend substantially upon ourability to anticipate, and to adapt our products and services to our collaborative partner's preferences. There can beno assurance that technological developments will not render some of our products and services obsolete, or that wewill be able to respond with improved or new products, services, and technology that satisfy evolving customers'expectations. Failure to acquire, develop or introduce new products, services, and enhancements in a timely mannercould have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Also, to the extent one or more of ourcompetitors introduces products and services that better address a customer's needs, our business would beadversely affected.



Failure to obtain new clients or renew client contracts on favorable terms could adversely affect results ofoperations.

We may face pricing pressure in obtaining and retaining our entrepreneur and startup clients. Our clients may beable to seek price reductions from us when they renew a contract, when a contract is extended, or when the client'sbusiness has significant volume changes. They may also reduce services if they decide to move services in-house.On some occasions, this pricing pressure results in lower revenue from a client than we had anticipated based on ourprevious agreement with that client. This reduction in revenue could result in an adverse effect on our business andresults of operations.Further, failure to renew client contracts on favorable terms could have an adverse effect on our business. Ourcontracts with clients generally run for several years and include liquidated damage provisions that provide for earlytermination fees. Terms are generally renegotiated prior to the end of a contract\'s term. If we are not successful inachieving a high rate of contract renewals on favorable terms, our business and results of operations could beadversely affected.
