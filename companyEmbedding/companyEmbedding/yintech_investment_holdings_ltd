How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

Beyond Tesla: 7 stocks driving the autonomous car revolution
              
              Look at these component manufacturers rather than the car companies, says Jeff Reeves.

These 7 highly taxed companies need Congress to finally act on tax reform
              
              It wasn’t Trump’s “movement” that lifted stocks late last year, says Jeff Reeves. It was the promise of lower corporate tax rates.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Dollar turns lower for the week following GDP report
              
              The U.S. dollar fell on Friday, erasing its gains for the week after a read on economic growth came in below expectations, though analysts said the beleaguered currency was potentially nearing a bottom.              
              
            

3:47 p.m. July 28, 2017






Dollar rises from 13-month low
              
              The U.S. dollar rises on Thursday, gaining against major rivals in what analysts suggest a mild consolidation following precipitous declines over recent weeks.

Here's Why Yintech Investment Holdings Ltd. Lost Its Luster and Fell as Much as 13%
More than a quarter of Yintech's commissions and fees are about to disappear. 











                Sean Williams
            

                (TMFUltraLong)



            
            Apr 24, 2017 at 11:28PM
            
            





What happened
Shares of Yintech Investment Holdings (NASDAQ:YIN), a China-based company that allows investors to buy and sell precious-metal commodities online, such as gold and silver, tumbled as much as 13% during Monday's trading session. The culprit appears to be an April 24-dated 6-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
So what
According to today's filing, Yintech was notified by the Guangdong Precious Metals Exchange, one of three exchanges that the company operates on, that: "it had adjusted its spot commodity trading business in light of new market development, and in particular, it will terminate the trading of all the current products on the exchange on May 6, 2017." It continued: "As a result, we will no longer be able to generate revenue from our business carried out on the Guangdong Precious Metals Exchange after May 6, 2017.

According to Yintech's 6-K filing, the Guangdong Exchange accounted for 41% of the company's commissions and fees last year, and as of March 2017 this figure was down to 26% of commissions and fees.
The filing suggests uncertainty on whether new products will be introduced at some point in the future, or even how the new trading rules will affect the Guangdong Exchange. In the interim, Yintech plans to divert its capital investments away from the Guangdong Exchange and toward the Shanghai Gold Exchange and Tianjin Precious Metals Exchange, which are unaffected by today's news.





Now what
Today's news is yet another reminder of how unpredictable China and its investments can be at times.
Yintech, according to Wall Street's estimates, was on track to earn $2.63 in EPS this year, which made it one of the best bargains on paper based on a P/E comparison to other investment service providers. However, today's news clearly changes the game. Yintech is set to lose about a quarter of its revenue, and there's little telling what that might do to the company's profits at this point.
As a faint glimmer of hope, it is possible that we see business from Guangdong diverted to the other two precious-metal exchanges, thus minimizing the impact of todays' news in the months to come. The problem is we just don't know, and this uncertainty is what's fueling the highly emotional trading of investors today in Yintech's stock. Hopefully we'll get a little more bottom-line clarity from management in the weeks to come.

Comment Guidelines
 

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.

We estimate that we will receive net proceeds from this offering of 
approximately US$90.2 million if the over-allotment option is not exercised, and
US$104.3 million if the over-allotment option is exercised, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated offering expenses
payable by us. In addition, we expect to receive net proceeds of approximately
US$10 million from the Concurrent Private Placement.

The primary purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our 
shares for the benefit of all shareholders, retain and attract talented
employees by providing them with equity incentives and obtain additional
capital. We plan to use the net proceeds of this offering and the Concurrent
Private Placement as follows:

. US$30 million to invest in information technology infrastructure and 
  proprietary software;

. US$30 million to develop new businesses including our trading service business 
  on Shanghai Gold Exchange and trading service for other commodities;

. US$20 million to promote our brand and services; and

. the remaining amount for general corporate purposes, including working capital 
  needs and potential acquisitions.

The foregoing represents our current intentions with respect of the use and
allocation of the net proceeds of this offering and the Concurrent Private
Placement based upon our present plans and business conditions, but our
management will have significant flexibility and discretion in applying the net
proceeds of this offering and the Concurrent Private Placement. The occurrence
of unforeseen events or changed business conditions may result in application of
the net proceeds of this offering and the Concurrent Private Placement in a
manner other than as described in this prospectus. You must rely on the judgment
of our management as to the use of the net proceeds from this offering and the
Concurrent Private Placement, and such use may not produce income or increase
our ADS price.

In utilizing the proceeds from this offering and the Concurrent Private
Placement, we are permitted under PRC laws and regulations to provide funding to
our PRC subsidiaries only through loans or capital contributions, and only if we
satisfy the applicable government registration and approval requirements. We
cannot assure you that we will be able to meet these requirements on a timely
basis, if at all.

Pending any use described above, we plan to invest our net proceeds in
short-term interest-bearing, debt instruments or demand deposits.


The online spot commodity trading market is highly competitive and fragmented
for trading service providers like us. As of December 31, 2015, there were over
1,000 active trading service providers that operate on over 350 exchanges
nationwide. The trading service providers compete with each other for customers
and trading volume based on factors including brand, technology, research and
customer services.

According to Euromonitor, we were the largest online provider of spot commodity
trading services in China by customer trading volume in 2015, with a market
share of approximately 4.0% in terms of trading volume of individual investors.
We had a market share, in terms of trading volume of individual investors, of
approximately 15.5% on the Tianjin Precious Metals Exchange and approximately
10.4% on the Guangdong Precious Metals Exchange, in 2015. Our customer trading
volume on Tianjin Precious Metals Exchange was the largest among all service
providers on the exchange from 2012 to 2015. Our customer trading volume on
Guangdong Precious Metals Exchange ranked, among all service providers, No. 7 in
2014, No. 3 in the first nine months of 2015 and No. 1 in the fourth quarter of
2015. Our customer trading volume on the Shanghai Gold Exchange has been growing
rapidly since our recent commencement of operation on the exchange in
November 2015.

In addition, there are also over 20 commercial banks operating as financial
members on the Shanghai Gold Exchange, through which individual customers can
open accounts and trade gold and other precious metals on that exchange.
However, we believe that in most cases, these banks only offer a trading channel
to their existing customers as part of their overall banking package and do not
provide specialized services for spot commodity trading. Recently, attracted by
a booming online spot commodity trading market, certain Internet companies such
as NetEase, Inc., also launched a spot commodity trading service. Differing from
our strategy of focusing on premier customers, NetEase sets low deposit
requirements for account opening and gained a large customer base with small
average invested amounts in a relatively short period.

Although some of our competitors may have greater financial resources or a
larger customer bases than we do, we believe that our proprietary technology
platform, our focus on premier customers, our comprehensive customer services
and strong brand recognition in the industry, will enable us to compete
effectively in the fast evolving online spot commodity trading industry in
the PRC.


Company Description
We are the largest online provider of spot commodity trading services in China
by customer trading volume in both 2014 and 2015, according to Euromonitor. We
currently facilitate the trading by individual customers of silver, gold and
other precious metals and commodities on three leading exchanges


 in China,
namely the Shanghai Gold Exchange, the Tianjin Precious Metals Exchange and the
Guangdong Precious Metals Exchange, which were the three largest exchanges for
online spot commodity trading in China in terms of trading volume in 2015,
respectively. We were the largest service provider by customer trading volume on
the Tianjin Precious Metals Exchange from 2012 to 2015, and the largest service
provider on the Guangdong Precious Metals Exchange in the fourth quarter of
2015. We commenced our operation on the Shanghai Gold Exchange in November 2015
and our customer trading volume has been growing rapidly since then.

Online spot commodity trading recently emerged as an alternative investment
product in China, with aggregate trading volume growing at a CAGR of 35.4% from
2011 to 2015 and reaching RMB29.0 trillion (US$4.5 trillion) in 2015. We believe
such growth is largely attributable to the distinctive features of online spot
commodity trading. Its deposit-based leverage trading method offers relatively
high volatility trading opportunities which appeal to a group of individual
investors. Compared with other leveraged trading products such as futures, spot
commodity trading enjoys the following benefits: (i) its underlying assets,
primarily silver and gold, are more familiar to individual investors, (ii) the
spot commodity contract is less complex, and (iii) its trading hours are longer
and continuous. Compared with China's commodity futures markets, which had an
aggregate trading volume of RMB136.5 trillion (US$21.1 trillion) in 2015, the
spot commodity market is still small and we believe it has strong growth
potential.

We focus on premier customers and generally require each customer to deposit at
least RMB100,000 (US$15,437) for account activation. Based on our experience,
the total invested amount of a customer is often significantly higher. We
believe this strategy helps us focus our resources on providing better services
and build a base of customers with greater sophistication and risk tolerance,
who are more suited to leveraged spot commodity trading. As of December 31,
2015, there were more than 50,000 customers who opened and activated accounts
with us, among which more than 24,000 executed trades during the year ended
December 31, 2015, with an aggregate trading volume of RMB659.7 billion
(US$101.8 billion).

We provide our customers with comprehensive services, including account opening,
investor education, market information, research, live discussion boards and
real-time customer support. Most services are delivered online through our
proprietary client software and call center, and we do not operate physical
branches. Our client software provides not only market information and analysis,
but also interactive functions including live discussion boards and instant
messaging with customer service representatives, which we believe enhance our
customers' engagement. Internally, we collect and analyze customer behavior and
communications data from our client software, customer relationship management
system and the exchanges, which allow us to better understand, attract and serve
our customers.

We strive to minimize conflicts of interest with our customers, which we believe
is essential for our long-term success. Under the trading rules of the three
exchanges we operate on, we do not set, quote or influence the trading prices,
and cannot access our customers' money. On the Tianjin Precious Metals Exchange
and the Guangdong Precious Metals Exchange, we are required to serve as
counterparty to our customers' trades. We entered into a risk and return 
transfer arrangement in 2015 to pass the risks and returns associated with such 
principal positions to a third party fund, which means we do not gain from our 
customers' losses or lose from their gains. On the Shanghai Gold Exchange, we 
serve as an agent and do not hold principal positions.

Commodities trading in China is a bit different than here in the States due to several issues ranging from the complex (the structure of the Government) to the simple (day to day trading), but when two of the three exchanges a company trades on, the company’s future will be difficult no matter any other issues. This is what is facing our Zacks Bear of the Day, Yintech Investment Holdings Limited (YIN  -  Free Report)	.This Zacks ranked #5 (Strong Sell) is an online provider of spot commodity trading services primarily in China. The Company provides services which includes account opening, investor education, market information, research, live discussion boards and real-time customer support. It facilitates the trading by individual customers of silver, gold and other precious metals and commodities on exchanges, Shanghai Gold Exchange, Tianjin Precious Metals Exchange and Guangdong Precious Metals Exchange. Yintech Investment Holdings Limited is headquartered in Shanghai, China.Recent NewsIn early May Yintech was informed that the Guangdong Precious Metals Exchange would terminate all trading of current products.  The exchange accounted for 41% of Yintech’s commissions and fees last year.  Then on June 2, the Tianjin Precious Metals Exchange announced that they will adjust their spot commodity trading business in attempts to reduce trading risks.  According to the press release, “[the exchange] will suspend the opening of new trading positions for all spot commodities traded on the exchange starting on June 12, 2017. The closing of existing trading positions will not be affected. As a result, Yintech will no longer be able to generate significant revenue from its business carried out on the Tianjin Precious Metals Exchange after June 12, 2017. It is expected that the Company's results of operation will be significantly impacted by this development.”Management’s TakeAccording to Mr. Wenbin Chen, Chairman and CEO, “We fully support the Chinese Government's ongoing efforts to clean up the spot commodities trading market. While our business will be affected in the short-term, we believe the industry will come out leaner, cleaner and better regulated and we expect to come out in a stronger competitive position. We have a leading market position in the Shanghai Gold Exchange, which is regulated by the People's Bank of China and is the only national-level spot commodity exchange in China. We have always been committed to maintaining the highest operational standards within the industry and I believe our business on the Shanghai Gold Exchange still has huge potential to grow. Looking forward, our strategy is to become a provider of diversified investment and trading services to individual investors in China. Our core strength lies in our deep understanding of, and extensive experience in serving, Chinese individual investors, which can be easily leveraged for other investment and trading products. We have identified a few promising areas and are in advanced stages of preparation for launching new products in the coming quarters.""The Guangdong Precious Metals Exchange recently terminated trading of all products on the exchange while the Tianjin Precious Metals Exchange reduced its leverage ratios by roughly half. Both of these changes will impact our customer trading volumes and revenues during the second quarter. We nevertheless remain optimistic in maintaining healthy profit margins during the second quarter due to cost saving initiatives on advertising and variable employee compensation."Price and Earnings Consensus GraphAs you can see in the chart below, both the stock price and future earnings expectations have collapsed since the exchanges made their moves.Yintech Investment Holdings Limited Price and Consensus Yintech Investment Holdings Limited Price and Consensus | Yintech Investment Holdings Limited QuoteDeclining Earnings EstimatesDue to the closure and significant reduction in business availability in two of their three exchanges earnings estimates have dropped for FY 17 and FY 18 over the past 30 days; FY 17 fell from $2.62 to $1.59, and FY 18 plummeted from $3.22 to $1.45.Zacks' 2017 IPO Watch ListBefore looking into the stocks mentioned above, you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on Zacks' radar.
