FRANKLIN, Tenn., July 18, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Apogee Informatics Corporation, a privately-held healthcare information services provider, has been working with doctors and nurses to transform medical data into actionable information for the past 13 years. Their team of engineers and medical professionals work to provide hospitals and healthcare groups with the insight and vision into their patient, operations, financial, and medical data. The products and services create an open, dynamic view of data that is traditionally difficult to access, process and use. 








HealthCor, a healthcare business development, strategy, and sales organization, specializes in development and distribution of healthcare technology-enabled solutions. Through its alliance with SurgiCor, a large orthopedic distributor, and other affiliates, HealthCor engages a large network of professionals to bring great technology to market. From Josh Ritter, of HealthCor, "We're excited to partner with Apogee as we believe their delivery of real-time healthcare information is the key to enabling protocol-driven responses to a variety of healthcare's challenges and inefficiencies."
Through this partnership, Apogee and HealthCor intend to develop real-time responses to healthcare's challenges. Leveraging Apogee's ability to convert EHR and other healthcare IT system data into real-time actionable information with HealthCor's expertise in healthcare business development and distribution, Apogee and HealthCor will expand their healthcare information network, increase network information volume, and further develop critical healthcare operational, workflow, and financial responses to healthcare's challenges. "Healthcor is the ideal partner because of its demonstrated ability to reach healthcare decision makers at their highest level and keen business development skills that will help enhance Apogee's growing product portfolio and enhance Apogee's expanding national client footprint.  They understand Apogee's vision for healthcare transformation," Dr. David Klubert, Apogee's Board Chairman added.
Given the current need providers and healthcare administrators have to unlock and better utilize EHR data, focus on interoperability, and simulate outcomes, Apogee and HealthCor are poised to bring critical real-time, technology-enabled services to the healthcare system. With this unlocked information, providers now leverage relevant dashboards and visualizations, timely protocol-based push notifications and responses, and actionable operational reporting to operate more efficiently.

HealthCor Management, L.P.
Fundamental Healthcare Investment ManagerEstablished 2005About UsHealthCor is an experienced value based investor that is dedicated to identifying global healthcare and life science equity securities that are mispriced.HealthCor Management, L.P.'s ("HealthCor") two co-founders, Joe Healey and Art Cohen, have an extensive career of equity investing in the sector through numerous market cycles and have co-invested together for over 15 years as a team.  From its base in New York City, HealthCor launched its long-short equity hedge fund strategy on September 1, 2005.
Since then, HealthCor has leveraged its security selection expertise across a platform of healthcare focused products.  HealthCor became registered with the Securities Exchange Commission as an investment adviser on March 30, 2012 under the U.S. Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.Investment ApproachHealthCor uses a bottom-up fundamental research driven approach to security selection.HealthCor’s investment professionals  leverage their specialized knowledge of key medical, scientific, regulatory and intellectual property data with a bottom-up fundamental research driven approach to security selection.  Idea generation is catalyst driven and every position is judged on its own ability to generate profits consistent with its risk reward profile. The firm is characterized by intensive financial analysis and places a premium on strong balance sheets, cash flow, top line organic growth and earnings revisions as well as management teams that seek to grow shareholder value. HealthCor takes into account industry themes such as utilization, consolidation, and regulatory activity when investing and concentrates in high conviction names which demonstrate margin of safety attributes.The firm invests on a balanced basis across the sector where it organizes itself around the major sub-sectors of:

Pharmaceuticals
Medtech
Biotech
Services

StrategyHealthCor’s investment strategies have different risk reward objectives consistent with their mandates. The long-short equity strategy for example, seeks to achieve superior risk-adjusted returns through investments in equity and equity-related instruments and has demonstrated a proven ability to preserve capital in down markets. The strategy employs a modest amount of leverage and a large short portfolio predominantly consisting of stock specific ideas each intended to generate profits.   All HealthCor strategies benefit from the same rigorous bottom-up fundamental research process focused on generating the best ideas for security selection while employing a disciplined and structured approach to portfolio management. In addition, HealthCor acts as a sub-adviser to several multi-manager mutual funds and a UCITS fund. Separately, HealthCor's affiliate, HealthCor Partners Management, L.P., manages a private equity strategy which is a separately registered entity.Idea generation is catalyst driven and every position is judged on its own ability to generate profits consistent with its risk reward profile.Executive Committee & Senior Management

HealthCor Partners Out Seeking $300M For Fund II

HealthCor Partners Management, an investor in fast-growing health care and life sciences companies, is out seeking $300 million—a tally that would double the firm’s assets under management if achieved.
The New York-based firm is part of the HealthCor Group, a hedge-fund manager and private equity shop with more than $3 billion under management. According to its Web site, HealthCor Partners has three senior managing directors. They are Jeffrey C. Lightcap, previously a senior managing director at mid-market buyout shop JLL Partners from 1997 to mid-2006; Arthur B. Cohen, who served as portfolio manager at hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors from 2000 until March 2005 before co-founding HealthCor Group two months later; and Joseph P. Healey, who like Cohen was a portfolio manager at SAC Capital Advisors from 2000 until March 2005 before co-founding HealthCor Group.
The HealthCor Partners Web site lists eight professionals altogether, and altogether HealthCor Group has more than 25 investment professionals.
HealthCor Partners is believed to have set out this fall to raise Healthcor Partners Fund II LP with the help of Mercury Capital Advisors, the placement agent that spun out of Merrill Lynch in late 2009 following the firm’s acquisition by Bank of America. The HealthCor Partners Web site says the firm already has $300 million in assets under management, although I was unable to determine where the money comes from, or how it’s organized.
The firm makes investments of $5 million to $25 million as part of growth financings, leveraged buyouts and special situations, including restructurings. The principals take a hands-on approach to their portfolio companies, providing help with sales, marketing, regulatory compliance, add-on acquisitions, among other functions.
The firm’s Web site lists eight “select portfolio companies.” Among them are Practice Partners in Healthcare, a Birmingham, Ala.-based firm that develops and manages ambulatory surgery centers; Paradigm Spine, a New York-based company that supplies spinal implants used by orthopedic surgeons; and Velcera, a Yardley, Pa.-based company that makes medications to treat pets.
