Description




ITEX Corporation operates a marketplace (the Marketplace) in which products and services are exchanged by Marketplace members utilizing ITEX dollars.

The Company services its member businesses through its independent licensed brokers and franchise network (individually, broker and together, the Broker Network) in the United States and Canada. Its Marketplace provides a forum for members to purchase from and sell their products and services to other members using ITEX dollars instead of the United States dollars and Canadian dollars (USD or cash). The Company's Brokers are independent contractors. The Company's corporate staff, brokers and their staff, and outside contractors support the Marketplace. Its brokers provide Marketplace members with information on products and services that are available locally, nationally and in Canada.
