This Amendment No. 1 (the “Amendment”)
amends and supplements the Schedule 13D filed by the Reporting Persons on January 19, 2016 (the “Original Schedule 13D”
and, as amended and supplemented by this Amendment, the “Schedule 13D”) with respect to the Common Units of
the Issuer. Capitalized terms used in this Amendment and not otherwise defined shall have the same meanings ascribed to them in
the Original Schedule 13D.
Item 2. Identity and Background.
This Amendment amends and restates the second
and third paragraphs of Item 2 of the Original Schedule 13D in their entirety as set forth below.
“TPG Advisors VII holds 100 shares of common
stock, and has appointed one of the two board members, of Enfield Holdings Advisors, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Enfield
Holdings Advisors”), which is the general partner of Enfield Holdings, which directly holds 54,312,781 Series B Preferred
Units. Because of the relationship of TPG Advisors VII to Enfield Holdings, TPG Advisors VII may be deemed to beneficially own
the Series B Preferred Units.
Messrs. Bonderman and Coulter are sole shareholders
of TPG Advisors VII. Because of the relationship of Messrs. Bonderman and Coulter to TPG Advisors VII, each of Messrs. Bonderman
and Coulter may be deemed to beneficially own the Series B Preferred Units. Messrs. Bonderman and Coulter disclaim beneficial ownership
of the Common Units except to the extent of their pecuniary interest therein.”
This Amendment amends and restates the sixth
and seventh paragraphs of Item 2 of the Original Schedule 13D in their entirety as set forth below.
“The present principal occupation of David
Bonderman is officer, director and/or manager of affiliated entities of TPG Advisors VII.
The present principal occupation of James G.
Coulter is officer, director and/or manager of affiliated entities of TPG Advisors VII.”
Item 4. Purpose of Transaction.
This Amendment amends and restates the eleventh
paragraph of Item 4 of the Original Schedule 13D in its entirety as set forth below.
“Amended and Restated Coordination
Agreement 
The Amended and Restated Coordination and Securityholders’
Agreement, dated as of March 3, 2017 (the “Coordination Agreement”), by and among Enfield Holdings, Enfield
Holdings Advisors, WSEP Egypt Holdings, LP, WSIP Egypt Holdings, LP (together with WSEP Egypt Holdings, LP, and each of their affiliates,
the “GS Investors”), TPG VII Egypt Finance, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“TPG VII Egypt
Finance”) and TPG Advisors VII (together with TPG VII Egypt Finance and each of their affiliates, the “TPG Investors”
and together with the GS Investors, the “Investors”) sets forth certain agreements, including with respect to
governance, transfer restrictions, the purchase of additional securities, the exercise of rights under the Registration Rights
Agreement and certain other matters.”
This Amendment amends and restates the thirteenth
paragraph of Item 4 of the Original Schedule 13D in its entirety as set forth below.

Page 5 of 10 Pages
 

“The Coordination Agreement generally restricts
any transfers of any Partnership Securities, Series B Preferred Units, converted Common Units or common stock of Enfield Holdings
Advisors (collectively, the “Securities”) by any Investor, except (i) transfers to an affiliate of that Investor,
so long as that transferee remains an affiliate following the transfer and (ii) transfers pursuant to foreclosure by a lender on
such Securities pursuant to any loan agreement to which such Investor is a party and such Securities are pledged as collateral.
If any Investor wishes to transfer any Securities to anyone else, that Investor is subject to the other Investors’ right
of first offer (in the case of Partnership Securities, shares of common stock or Series B Preferred Units to address a regulatory
concern) and tag-along rights. Enfield Holdings Advisors has a call right to acquire all of the shares of common stock of Enfield
Holdings Advisors owned by any Investor and their affiliates who collectively cease to own 10% of the issued and outstanding Partnership
Securities for the aggregate purchase price paid for such shares.”
 
Item 5. Interest in Securities of the Issuer.
 
This Amendment amends and restates the second
and third paragraphs of Item 5 of the Original Schedule 13D in their entirety as set forth below.
 
“ (a)-(b) The following disclosure assumes
there are a total of 397,195,606 Common Units outstanding, which includes (i) 342,882,825 Common Units outstanding as of February
8, 2017, as set forth in the Issuer’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, filed with
the Commission on February 15, 2017, and (ii) 54,312,781 Common Units deliverable upon conversion of the Series B Preferred Units
reported herein.
 
Pursuant to Rule 13d-3 under the Act, the Reporting
Persons may be deemed to beneficially own 54,312,781 Common Units, which constitutes approximately 13.7% of the outstanding Common
Units.”
 
Item 6. Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or Relationships with
Respect to Securities of the Issuer.
 
This Amendment amends and restates Item 6 of
the Original Schedule 13D by adding the paragraphs set forth below immediately after the first paragraph.
“Margin Loan Facility
TPG VII Egypt Finance, as borrower (the “Borrower”),
entered into (i) a Margin Loan Agreement (the “Loan Agreement”), dated as of March 3, 2017 (the “Loan
Closing Date”) with JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., London Branch, as lender (the “Lender”), and (ii)
a Pledge and Security Agreement (the “Borrower Security Agreement”), dated as of the Loan Closing Date with
the Lender, pursuant to which the Borrower pledged all of its Class A Units of Enfield Holdings and its rights under the Second
Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of Enfield Holdings, dated as of March 3, 2017, as collateral to secure repayment
of amounts outstanding under the Loan Agreement. As of the Loan Closing Date, Enfield Holdings entered into (i) a Guarantor Pledge
and Security Agreement (the “Guarantor Pledge Agreement” and, collectively with the Borrower Security Agreement,

Series B Preferred Units, and any Common Units into which such Series B Preferred Units are converted, and the Borrower’s
rights under the Issuer LPA and the Registration Rights Agreement, as collateral to secure repayment of amounts outstanding under
the Loan Agreement (the “Guarantor Collateral”), and (ii) a non-recourse Guarantee (the “Guarantee”
and, collectively with the Loan Agreement and the Borrower Security Agreement, the “Loan Documents”) with the
Lender, pursuant to which Enfield Holdings unconditionally guarantees the obligations payable by the Borrower under the Loan Agreement
in an amount not to exceed the Guarantor Collateral.
The loans mature on or about March 3, 2022.
Upon the occurrence of certain events that are customary for this type of loan, the Lender may exercise its rights to require
the Borrower to pre-pay the loan proceeds, post additional collateral, or foreclose on, and dispose of, the pledged Series B Preferred
Units and pledged Common Units in accordance with the Loan Documents.
