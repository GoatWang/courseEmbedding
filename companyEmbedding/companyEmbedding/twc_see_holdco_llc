Â 

    As described in more detail below, on the same day as the

    ÂTWC GroupÂ) and Comcast consummated the TWC
    Redemption, the TWE Redemption and the Exchange (collectively,
    the ÂTWC/Comcast TransactionsÂ). Under the terms of

    that held both cable systems and cash. In accordance with the
    terms of the agreement which governed the TWE Redemption (the
    ÂTWE RedemptionÂ AgreementÂ), TWE redeemed
    ComcastÂs interest in TWE in exchange for one of TWEÂs
    subsidiaries that held both cable systems and cash. In
    accordance with the terms of the agreement which governed the
    Exchange (as amended, the ÂExchange AgreementÂ), TW NY

    RedemptionÂ Agreement, the TWE RedemptionÂ Agreement and
    the Exchange Agreement, are collectively referred to as the
    ÂTWC/Comcast Agreements.Â

Â 

The TWC RedemptionÂ Agreement.Â Â Pursuant to
    the TWC RedemptionÂ Agreement, dated as of AprilÂ 20,
    2005, as amended, among TWC and certain other members of the TWC
    Group and Comcast, the TWC Redemption was effected and
    ComcastÂs interest in TWC was redeemed on JulyÂ 31,
    2006, immediately prior to the Adelphia Acquisition. The TWC
    RedemptionÂ Agreement required that TWC redeem all of the
    TWC ClassÂ A common stock held by TWE HoldingsÂ II Trust
    (ÂComcast TrustÂ IIÂ), a trust that was
    established for the benefit of Comcast, in exchange for 100% of
    the common stock of Cable HoldcoÂ II Inc. (ÂCable
    HoldcoÂ IIÂ), then a subsidiary of TWC. At the time of
    the TWC Redemption, Cable HoldcoÂ II held both certain cable
    systems previously owned directly or indirectly by TWC
    (ÂTWC RedemptionÂ SystemsÂ) serving approximately
    589,000 basic subscribers and approximately $1.9Â billion in
    cash, subject generally to the liabilities associated with the
    TWC RedemptionÂ Systems. Certain specified assets and
    liabilities of the TWC RedemptionÂ Systems were retained by
    TWC.

Â 

    The TWC RedemptionÂ Agreement contains closing adjustments
    to be paid in cash based on (1)Â the relative growth or
    decline in the number of basic video subscribers served by the
    TWC RedemptionÂ Systems as compared to the relative growth
    or decline in the number of basic video subscribers served by
    the other cable systems operated by TWC and (2)Â the excess,
    if any, of the net liabilities of the TWC
    RedemptionÂ Systems over an agreed upon threshold amount.

Â 

    The TWC RedemptionÂ Agreement contains various customary
    representations and warranties of the parties thereto including
    representations by TWC as to the absence of certain changes or
    events concerning the TWC RedemptionÂ Systems, compliance
    with law, litigation, employee benefit plans, property,
    intellectual property, environmental matters, financial
    statements, regulatory matters, taxes, material contracts,
    insurance and brokers. The representations and warranties of the
    parties to the TWC RedemptionÂ Agreement generally survive
    the closing of the TWC Redemption for a period of one year and
    certain representations and warranties either did not survive
    the closing of the TWC Redemption, survive indefinitely or
    survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of
    limitations (giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or
    extension thereof).

Â 

    The TWC RedemptionÂ Agreement contains customary
    indemnification obligations on the part of the parties thereto
    with respect to breaches of representations, warranties and
    covenants and certain other matters, generally subject to a
    $20Â million threshold and $200Â million cap, with
    respect to certain of TWCÂs representations and warranties
    regarding the TWC RedemptionÂ Systems and related matters,
    and with respect to certain representations and warranties of
    the Comcast parties relating to litigation, financial
    statements, finderÂs fees and certain regulatory matters.

Â 

TWC/Comcast Tax Matters Agreement.Â Â In
    connection with the closing of the TWC Redemption, TWC, Cable
    HoldcoÂ II and Comcast entered into the Holdco Tax Matters
    Agreement (the ÂTWC/Comcast Tax Matters AgreementÂ).
    The TWC/Comcast Tax Matters Agreement allocates responsibility
    for income taxes of Cable HoldcoÂ II and deals with matters
    relating to the income tax consequences of the TWC Redemption.
    This agreement contains representations, warranties and
    covenants relevant to such income tax treatment. The TWC/Comcast
    Tax Matters Agreement also contains indemnification obligations
    relating to the foregoing.

Â 

The TWE RedemptionÂ Agreement.Â Â Pursuant to
    the TWE RedemptionÂ Agreement, dated as of AprilÂ 20,
    2005, as amended, among TWC and Comcast, ComcastÂs interest
    in TWE was redeemed on JulyÂ 31, 2006, immediately prior to
    the Adelphia Acquisition. Prior to the TWE Redemption, TWE
    Holdings I Trust (ÂComcast TrustÂ IÂ), a trust
    established for the benefit of Comcast, owned a 4.7% residual
    equity interest in TWE. Pursuant to the TWE
    RedemptionÂ Agreement, TWE redeemed all of the TWE residual
    equity interest held by Comcast TrustÂ I in exchange for
    100% of the limited liability company interests of Cable
    HoldcoÂ III LLC (ÂCable HoldcoÂ IIIÂ), then a
    subsidiary of TWE. At the time of the TWE Redemption, Cable
    HoldcoÂ III held both certain cable systems previously owned
    or operated directly or indirectly by TWE (the ÂTWE
    RedemptionÂ SystemsÂ) serving approximately 162,000
    subscribers and approximately $147Â million in cash, subject
    generally to the liabilities associated with the TWE
    RedemptionÂ Systems. Certain specified assets and
    liabilities of the TWE RedemptionÂ Systems were retained by
    TWE.

Â 

    The TWE RedemptionÂ Agreement contains closing adjustments
    to be paid in cash based on (1)Â the relative growth or
    decline in the number of basic video subscribers served by the
    TWE RedemptionÂ Systems as compared to the relative growth
    or decline in the number of basic video subscribers served by
    the other cable systems owned by TWE and (2)Â the excess, if
    any, of the net liabilities of the TWE RedemptionÂ Systems
    over an agreed upon threshold amount.

Â 

    The TWE RedemptionÂ Agreement contained various customary
    representations and warranties of the parties thereto including
    representations by TWE as to the absence of certain changes or
    events concerning the TWE RedemptionÂ Systems, compliance
    with law, litigation, employee benefit plans, property,
    intellectual property, environmental matters, financial
    statements, regulatory matters, taxes, material contracts,
    insurance and brokers. The representations and warranties of the
    parties to the TWE RedemptionÂ Agreement generally survive
    the closing of the TWE RedemptionÂ Agreement for a period of
    one year and certain representations and warranties either
    survive indefinitely or survive until the expiration of the
    applicable statute of limitations (giving effect to any waiver,
    mitigation or extension thereof).

Â 

    The TWE RedemptionÂ Agreement contained customary
    indemnification obligations on the part of the parties thereto
    with respect to breaches of representations and warranties and
    covenants and certain other matters, generally subject to a
    $6Â million threshold and $60Â million cap, with respect
    to certain representations and warranties of TWE regarding the
    TWE RedemptionÂ Systems and related matters, and with
    respect to certain representations and warranties of the Comcast
    parties relating to litigation, financial statements,
    finderÂs fees and certain regulatory matters.

Â 

The Exchange Agreement.Â Â Pursuant to the
    Exchange Agreement, dated as of AprilÂ 20, 2005, as amended,
    among TWC, TW NY and Comcast, the Exchange closed on
    JulyÂ 31, 2006, immediately after the Adelphia Acquisition.
    Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, TW NY transferred all
    outstanding limited liability company interests of certain newly
    formed limited liability companies (collectively, the ÂTW
    NewcosÂ) to Comcast in exchange for all limited liability
    company interests of certain newly formed limited liability
    companies or limited partnerships, respectively, owned by
    Comcast (collectively, the ÂComcast NewcosÂ). In
    addition, TWC paid Comcast approximately $67Â million in
    cash for certain adjustments related to the Exchange. Included
    in the systems TWC acquired in the Exchange were cable systems
    (i)Â that were owned by the Century-TCI joint venture in the
    Los Angeles, California area and the Parnassos joint venture in
    Ohio and Western New York and (ii)Â then owned by Comcast
    located in the Dallas, Texas, Los Angeles, California, and
    Cleveland, Ohio areas.

Â 

    The Exchange Agreement contains various customary
    representations and warranties of the parties thereto (which
    generally survive for a period of 12Â months after the
    closing of the Exchange), including representations concerning
    the cable systems subject to the Exchange Agreement originally
    owned by TWC or Comcast as to the absence of certain changes or
    events, compliance with law, litigation, employee benefit plans,
    property, intellectual property, environmental matters,
    financial statements, regulatory matters, taxes, material
    contracts, insurance and brokers. The Exchange Agreement also
    contained representations regarding the accuracy of certain of
    the representations of Adelphia set forth in the Purchase
    Agreements for events, circumstances and conditions occurring
    after the closing of the TW NY Adelphia Acquisition.

Â 

    The Exchange Agreement contains customary indemnification
    obligations on the part of the parties thereto with respect to
    breaches of representations, warranties, covenants and certain
    other matters. Each partyÂs indemnification obligations
    with respect to breaches of representations and warranties
    (other than certain specified representations and warranties)
    are subject to (1)Â with respect to cable systems originally
    owned by TWC that were acquired by Comcast, a $5.7Â million
    threshold and $19.1Â million cap, (2)Â with respect to
    cable systems originally owned by Adelphia that were initially
    acquired by TWC pursuant to the TW NY Purchase Agreement and
    then transferred to Comcast pursuant to the Exchange Agreement,
    a $74.6Â million threshold and $746Â million cap,
    (3)Â with respect to cable systems originally owned by
    Comcast that were acquired by TWC, a $41.5Â million
    threshold and $415Â million cap, and (4)Â with respect

    initially acquired by Comcast pursuant to the Comcast Purchase
    Agreement and then transferred to TWC pursuant to the Exchange
    Agreement, a $34.9Â million threshold and $349Â million
    cap. In addition, no party is required to indemnify the other
    for breaches of representations, warranties or covenants
    relating to assets or liabilities initially acquired from
    Adelphia and then transferred to the other party, unless the
    breach is of a representation, warranty or

About Holdco, LLC

   Time Warner Cable (TWC) helped put cable on the map as one of the early US providers. The company is part of Charter Communications, the #2 US cable company after Comcast. TWC has operations in more than two dozen states across the country. It serves more than 16 million mostly residential customers (about 700,000 business customers) with video, high-speed data (primarily through ISP brand Road Runner), and voice offerings, as well as security and home management. In addition to video, voice, and data, other business services include networking and transport, outsourced IT, and cloud computing. TWC was acquired by Charter in mid-2016 and will be rebranded Spectrum.
  
Change in Company Type

   The acquisition of TWC as well as Bright House Networks makes Charter Communications one of the largest cable companiesin the US. Cable companies have faced threats from streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon.com. The streaming services reach many subscribers over the networks of the cable providers. TWC brings not only a sizable number of business and residential subscribers to the new company, but access to content as well.
  
Operations

   TWC also operates local news broadcasting stations in New York (including New York City), North Carolina, and Texas, regional sports networks, as well as a news, sports, and entertainment online portal.
  

   The company generates about 80% of revenue from its residential services; business services and advertising account for about 15% and 5%, respectively.
  
Geographic Reach

   Its core service areas are in New York, the Midwest, Texas, the Carolinas, and southern California, but it has operations in nearly 30 states.
  
Sales and Marketing

   TWC markets its products and services via a host of direct channels (online, telemarketing, e-mail marketing, door-to-door sales), as well as through third-party partners and retailers. In 2015 TWC served approximately 10.8 million residential video subscribers, 12.7 million residential high-speed data subscribers, 6.3 million residential voice subscribers and 1.2 million Intelligent Home customers. The company has ramped up its advertising budget, spending about $720 million on advertising n 2015, compared to $684 million in 2014 and $676 million in 2013.
  
Financial Performance

   The company has seen strong revenue growth over the last decade. Sales in 2015 rose 4% to $23.7 billion on higher business service revenue from growth in high-speed data, voice subscribers and higher wholesale transport revenue. Residential services revenue rose on an increase in high-speed data subscribers and higher average revenue per subscriber.
  

   Despite the growth in revenue, TWC's's net income dropped 9% to $1.8 billion due to higher programming and content and sales and marketing expenses.
  

   In 2015 cash flow from operations rose about $190 million from 2014 to $6.5 billion.
  
Strategy

   Growth in TWC's residential operations has slowed in recent years as it operates in mature, competitive markets. The company seeks to extend its services to mobile devices and to non-TV devices to help it retain and gain customers. In a deal with Microsoft, TWC will make its TV app available for the Xbox One video game and entertainment system. Consumers with an Xbox Live account will have access to free and subscription On Demand titles. TWC teamed up with Boingo to provide Passpoint roaming access to their subscribers. Qualified TWC Internet customers and Boingo subscribers can connect to secure WiFi networks at thousands of locations, including 25 high traffic airports in the U.S.
  

   Expanding options for its customers us important as alternatives to cable and satellite TV profilerate. While TWC carries competitors such as Netflix and Hulu via its ISP, such services could eat into TWC's more profitable cable business. Another potential problem for TWC is the Federal Communications Commission's vote to regulate the Internet like a utility. That could prevent TWC and its competitors (or eventual partner, Comcast) from finding sources of revenue in different tiers of service.
  

   The company is focused on improving the quality and reliability of its residential products and offering distinguished customer service. TWC expects to see continued strong growth in its business services segment; it predicts revenue of more than $5 billion from those offerings by 2018.
  
Mergers and Acquisitions

   Acquisitions have played their part in TWC's strategy. In 2014, the company closed its acquisition of DukeNet Communications. The $600 million purchase bolstered TWC's business services wholesale transport offerings by adding some 8,700 route miles in the southeastern US to the company's fiber optic network.
