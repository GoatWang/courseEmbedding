Company[edit]
BlueMountain, a private company formed in 2003,[2] was reported to manage financial assets of US$22 billion in 2016.[3] It invests in public equity, fixed income, and alternative investments.[4]
The company made a reputation in part by making trades with JPMorgan Chase in the wake of the 'London whale' trading loss in the bank's London branch.[3][5] BlueMountain has offices in New York and London.[6]
Personnel[edit]
Andrew Feldstein is BlueMountain's chief executive officer[3] and co-chief investment officer, with a 10-year career at JP Morgan before co-founding the hedge fund.[3][2][5] Harvard Professor and former Federal Reserve Board member Jeremy C. Stein was hired in 2015 as a consultant to BlueMountain.[3]
Investment[edit]
The firm has invested in Puerto Rican debt and reportedly been active, including through DCI Group, in opposing efforts to give the commonwealth access to bankruptcy.[7] After a debt relief program was passed by Congress in June, 2016, a film company with reported ties to George Soros released two titles targeting Blue Mountain, and specifically its holdings in Puerto Rico’s power authority (PREPA) debt, among others for the impact of the financial crisis on health and education on the island.[8]

NEW YORK, Oct. 6, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- In a move geared to support its growth efforts in the Western United States, BlueMountain Capital Management, a private investment firm with over $22 billion in assets under management, announced today it has appointed Summer Jarratt as Client Advisor overseeing its West Coast business development and client service.  Ms. Jarratt's hire is designed to enhance BlueMountain's growing West Coast investor base and build on the momentum of recently secured agreements for new mandates with the Orange County (CA) Employees Retirement System and the New Mexico Public Employees Retirement Association (NM PERA).  Ms. Jarratt will report to Noam Leslau, BlueMountain Capital Management's US Head of Client Advisory.

"Summer is a seasoned professional with granular knowledge of the challenges and opportunities that can be found in partnering with US institutional allocators," said Noam Leslau. "She comes to us with an established network and is extremely well-versed in customized, high-end client service.  Summer will be instrumental in increasing our growing West Coast footprint and further establishing our position as a premier institutional asset manager."
Prior to joining BlueMountain, Ms. Jarratt co-managed client relationships and business development for Empyrean Capital Partners, a private investment firm with over $2 billion in assets under management.
