Profile  




Profile

	Founding partner Arthur N. Greenberg views his more than 50 years of  law practice as “a complete professional life and an intellectual, emotional and personal challenge beyond my highest expectations.  I have solved many, many problems for clients who have expressed their appreciation and gratitude and I have had the great pleasure watching our Firm, which started with three lawyers, grow and prosper.”

In Court, In the Spotlight

	From the time of his graduation in the first class of UCLA Law School, Mr. Greenberg’s  practice included complex litigation and multimillion dollar business transactions over decades involving high-stake legal matters and legal firsts.  Selected by his peers, Mr. Greenberg is included in the book “Best Lawyers in America.”  He feels too young to have been referred to as a “Legend” in a recent edition of the publication “Super Lawyers of Southern California,” a term frequently used by others to describe him.

Defining a Firm, Shaping Southern California

	As Mr. Greenberg’s many legal achievements shaped the Firm and Southern California’s evolving legal landscape, he simultaneously established a strong philanthropic tradition at the Firm.  This was an expression of both a professional obligation and a personal belief  that as lawyers, all of us are required to help maintain the philanthropic and cultural life of our community.  As such, Mr. Greenberg became a contributor to, and officer and director of, numerous organizations serving the community, the state and the nation.  In addition, he has been joined in such organizations by other members of the Firm.

	Mr. Greenberg continues his active role as the Firm’s legal lion and is a regular guiding presence to his colleagues.  His vision for the Firm remains as it was at its founding in 1959.  He says, “I want Greenberg Glusker to be known as dedicated to achieving our clients’ goals in an honorable, ethical fashion and as a firm of lawyers with the highest skills, intelligence and integrity.”

                              worldwide
                              The field of "Oxygen Activation" has attracted considerable interest recently, not only because it presents challenges in
                                 those fields of basic research that aim to understand the fundamental aspects of chemical and biological reactions that involve
                                 dioxygen, but also because of its wide range of practical implications in such diverse fields as medicine, synthesis of pharmaceuticals
                                 and other organic compounds, materials science, and atmospheric science. This is the second of two volumes that focus on the
                                 subject of oxygen activation, the first slanted toward chemistry and the second toward biological chemistry. We planned these
                                 volumes to be more general than many monographs of this sort, not as detailed summaries of the authors' own research but rather
                                 as general overviews of the field. Our choice of topics was strongly influenced by our syllabus for a course entitled "Oxygen
                                 Chemistry," which two of us have twice taught jointly at UCLA. Definition of important issues, horizons, and future prospects
                                 was an important goal, and, although totally comprehensive coverage was not possible, we believe that we have chosen a representative
                                 selection of research topics current to the field. We have targeted this work to a diverse audience ranging from professionals
                                 in fields from physics to medicine to beginning graduate students who are interested in rapidly acquiring the basics of this
                                 field
