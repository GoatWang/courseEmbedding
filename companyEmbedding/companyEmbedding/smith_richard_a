 Product Description 

In 2008, many of the foremost scholars on the life and teachings of Joseph Smith participated in a lecture series that provided fresh, faithful perspectives about the prophet. This book offers in print the transcripts of those lectures, which were published in an audio CD collection titled Joseph Smith’s Prophetic Ministry: A Year-by-Year Look at His Life and Teachings. Each chapter focuses on one year from 1830 to 1844, providing an overview of key events of that year and discussing a key doctrine or historical event tied to that year.The book format allows easy access to the insights in the lectures.
Poignant and previously unknown insights into the Prophet’s life and teachings help readers experience the qualities that inspired the early Saints.
Each of the contributors is either on the Religious Education faculty at BYU or part of the team working on the landmark Joseph Smith Papers series.
Includes introductory chapters on the Prophet’s early years.Other contributors include Ronald Barney, Alexander Baugh, Richard Bennett, Ronald Esplin, Spencer Fluhman, Steven Harper, William Hartley, Andrew Hedges, Robert Millet, Grant Underwood, and Robert Woodford.

  Comprehensive year-by-year examination of the life of Joseph SmithBy Brent, Submitted on 2015-02-25This book is a comprehensive year-by-year examination of the life of Joseph Smith. Each chapter is by scholars who are experts on Joseph Smith. Most every chapter offers new perspectives or additional information that cannot be found in other published works about the prophet's life. This book helps readers better understand the historical circumstances surrounding the Restoration and the life of Joseph Smith. It provides an increased appreciation for Joseph Smith and the early Saints. A must read for serious and casual students of the prophet's life and teachings.

Tangos songs This has been an exciting time for Professor Smith, a time of growth and change. In 2012 and 2013 Smith traveled to 11 countries around the globe performing music from his 13 releases and collaborating with a group of international all-stars on "Tangos" - the deepest and most engaging release of his career. The reason why Richard's new global approach works so well is simple, he is a globally connected person, living abroad 3 months out of every year. For half of 2012 the globetrotting guitarist was visiting professor at Agder University, Norway, one of Europe's finest conservatories. It was a good fit, for Scandinavia has long been known for it's unique, influential music. While in Northern Europe, Smith debuted his L.A.

In Greece he became a director of the Aegean Cultural Initiative, an organization that brings together multiple cultures and global music leaders. In Sicily, the land of his ancestors, (Smith's Italian name is Pacifico) !he toured and recorded a duet project with one of the great guitar virtuosos in Europe Francesco Buzzurro. He traveled to South Africa and Tahiti - where he led an all-star band featuring jazz phenoms Eric Marienthal and Dan Siegel - for an exclusive Jazz cruise, and London, England, where he now directs the only overseas program for the USC Thornton School of music - ranked with Julliard as one of the top music schools in the World. And in the course of these travels he fell in love with TANGO. 'Tangos' is deep, soulful, fresh, Innovative, global!"I found that wherever I went, my friends and colleagues loved tango! On one side, there is smooth, romantic, flirtatious music - which I admit, I love to write! but then, I discovered this intense music of passion, Tango, and there is a difference between the two."   ...See Full Description
