Lord Bennett Chair




































R&D Chair
Incorporated's R&D Chair was developed for the offices of Snap Fort Greene in conjunction with Design NYC. Built from elements purchased at your local hardware store, this DYI chair is easy to assemble and customizable. Special thanks to Meghan Eplett for her help on the graphics.











R50S Upholstery Series

















































































Silkscreen Storage
With the Silkscreen Storage, Incorporated is exploring simple plywood box shapes with silkscreened with graphics that express the wood grain.











Endless Chair
The Endless chair was developed from the outline of a chair constructed in sheet metal and clad with fabric or felt. Two chair profiles allow for any combination of curves. Because they can be used individually or in groups, they work well for food and beverage establishments. The Endless Chair is currently not in production.

Ladder Shelving
Ladder shelving is an adjustable shelving system based on the painters ladder that could be used for commercial or residential applications.











Box Slot Lighting
Incorporated's Box Slot Light was developed as a lighting solution for the 9/11 Memorial Exhibition. The exhibitions walls needed to be evenly lit in a clean modern way from the ground. The Box Slot was our translation of this idea into a fixture. It can use LED or T5 fluorescent tubes and comes in black, white or walnut finishes.





BOX SLOT LIGHITING IN WALNUT






Folding Spider Table
This radial table can be folded for storage.











Potluck Light
Incorporated’s Potluck lighting extends the investigation of their “Endless Furniture” propositions which explores systemic ordering and modular relationships, offering infinite possibility for the objects ultimate configuration, color and size. Functionally, the Potluck embraces the modern need for flexibility. The light qualities possible in this system include task lighting, up lighting, under-table foot lighting and bounced lighting. Theoretically, it offers a visual metaphor for an open-ended design process. The consumer by selecting the color and configuration desired can share authorship of the object with the designer in the context of the commercial transaction. One can imagine an endless landscape of Potluck lights in ever changing configurations defined by the consumer. The form of Potluck is borrowed from the simple industrial geometries of the pots, pans and bake forms found in commercial kitchens.
















Zerforated Chair
















Man Ray Award
After many successful collaborations with The Jewish Museum in Manhattan, Incorporated was asked to design the first in a series of Man Ray awards recognizing persons who contribute to the arts. This years winner was Cindy Sherman. Because the award was related to Man Ray, Incorporated used his art as the starting point; specifically his use of perception of form. The concept was to create a shadow of an award that could also be used as a bookend.





















Endless Storage


























Branch Table
A tree grows in Beta. The Incorporated Branch Table explores systems of branching and random order to create a side table of unique design. Mimicking the geometry of a tree, the Branch Table was developed in collaboration with Guy Snover from the Stevens Institute of Technology, the oldest engineering school in the United States. The Branch Table utilizes a computer algorithm to grow one of kind branching objects, each one unique. These unique branch structures are then fabricated in this case using stereolithography 3D printing technologies. Each Branch Table is just one iteration of endless random geometric possibilities.

Hex Chair & Ottoman
Incorporated’s Hex Ottoman extends the Hex series into the realm of upholstered goods. The series originated with the Hex table which explores systemic ordering and modular relationships, offering infinite possibility for the table’s ultimate configuration and size. Functionally, the Hex Ottoman embraces the modern need for flexibility. Theoretically, it offers a visual metaphor for the design process – the suggestion of an open-ended repetition that counters the conventional architectural fascination with a teleological development from idea to conception. One can imagine an endless landscape of Hex furnishings in ever changing configurations. On one hand, the form of the Hex Ottoman is indebted to the timeless geometry of nature, a foundation for architectural principles. On the other hand, it enters the historic discourse of American minimalism.

Functionally, the table embraces the modern need for flexibility. Theoretically, it offers a visual metaphor for the design process – the suggestion of an open-ended repetition that counters the conventional architectural fascination with a teleological development from idea to conception. The design also explores the relationship of surface to space; its steel material combines utility and ornament, albeit in a subtle, modernist guise. On one hand, the form of the Hex Table is indebted to the timeless geometry of nature, a foundation for architectural principles. On the other hand, it enters the historic discourse of American minimalism, in which the relationships between parts and the phenomenology of form was paramount.
