NEW YORK, Feb. 15, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Solus Alternative Asset Management LP today announced that veteran high yield and distressed portfolio managers Scott Martin and C.J. Lanktree will join the firm's investment team. Most recently, Mr. Martin and Mr. Lanktree served as Co-Heads of Deutsche Bank's Distressed Products Group.  Both will join Solus effective March 1 as portfolio managers, reporting to President and Chief Investment Officer, Christopher Pucillo. 
"Our investment team has worked with Scott and C.J. on numerous distressed investment transactions over the years.  With their deep experience and understanding of complex restructurings, they will be a tremendous asset to Solus," said Pucillo.  "We are excited they are joining us as we continue to enhance and build out our platform of investment strategies."
"In today's macroeconomic environment, we are seeing an increasing number of opportunities across various credit strategies, including investments in late stage bankruptcy claims," said Mr. Lanktree. "These investments can provide uncorrelated, low volatility returns with significant downside protection."  
"Solus has a long history of success and is one of the most respected event and credit investment managers in the industry," said Mr. Martin. "I'm looking forward to working with Chris and the Solus team."   
"We are extremely fortunate and proud to be able to add these experienced and respected distressed investors to the Solus team," said Steven Renehan, Solus CEO. "They fit perfectly into our core competencies and deep value driven investment process."
Mr. Martin and Mr. Lanktree have, respectively, 17 and 12 years of financial analysis and investment experience. At Deutsche Bank, they oversaw a multi-billion dollar portfolio and were instrumental in the firm's participation in complex restructurings and reorganizations such as Lehman Brothers, Enron, Visteon, and Refco. 
Mr. Martin joined Deutsche Bank as a distressed investment analyst in 1995, rising to the position of distressed trader and portfolio manager before being named Co-Head of the Distressed Products Group in 2009.   Mr. Martin holds a BS in Commerce from the University of Virginia and an MBA from Columbia Business School.
Mr. Lanktree began his career at Salomon Smith Barney as an investment banking analyst in its Telecom and Media Group in 2001.  He joined Deutsche Bank in 2003 as a distressed investment analyst.  After serving as a distressed trader and portfolio manager, he was named Co-Head, along with Mr. Martin, in 2009.  Mr. Lanktree holds a BBA in Finance and a BA in Computer Applications from the University of Notre Dame.
