We estimate that the net proceeds to us from this offering will be approximately
$21.3 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering
expenses payable by us. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option
in full, the net proceeds to us will be approximately $24.8 million.

The principal reasons for this offering are to provide working capital, increase
our visibility in the market place and create a public market for our common
stock.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for working capital and
other general corporate purposes, including to finance our expected growth,
develop new products or fund capital expenditures. We may also use a portion of
the net proceeds to repay borrowings under our credit facility or term loan, or
to expand our existing business through acquisitions of other businesses,
products or technologies. However, we do not have agreements or commitments for
any specific repayments or acquisitions at this time.

Pending the uses mentioned above, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this
offering in short-term, interest bearing obligations, investment grade
instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the
U.S. government. Our management will have broad discretion in the application of
the net proceeds to us from this offering, and investors will be relying on the
judgment of our management regarding the application of the proceeds.


The optical networking industry is extremely competitive with many large vendors
of optical networking products and is characterized by continuous innovation.
Several of our competitors have preferred supplier relationships with service
providers.

As the demand for bandwidth has increased, the need for different technologies
to satisfy these needs has become more acute. The development of next generation
technologies, however, is a costly, time-consuming endeavor. We believe our
patented technologies provide the highest reach and capacity in the industry and
give us substantial advantages over our competition. Further, we believe
focusing on technologies, such as 100Gbps, ROADM and Packet Optical Transport
Systems, with a focus on simplifying the transition to higher bandwidth optical
networks, provides us with a competitive advantage over our competitors.

The principal competitive factors in our industry include price, product
performance, technology compatibility, quality, ability to meet customer
specifications, time to market, time to delivery, technical support
capabilities, breadth of product offerings, and record of innovation. We believe
that our optical networking solutions compare favorably to our competitors’
products in the markets in which we compete.

Our primary competitors in the submarine market include Alcatel-Lucent Submarine
Networks, SAS, Coriant GmbH, Huawei Marine Networks Co., Limited, NEC
Corporation and TE Subcom, a TE Connectivity Ltd. company. In the terrestrial
market, our primary competitors include Alcatel-Lucent S.A., Ciena Corporation,
Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., Infinera Corporation and Coriant GmbH. Many of our
competitors have significantly more financial, technical, marketing and other
resources than we have, may devote greater resources to the promotion, sale and
support of their technology than we can, have more extensive customer bases than
we have and have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we
have. In addition, many of our competitors expend a greater amount of funds on
research and development. However, we believe our reach, capacity and current
100Gbps capabilities allow us to differentiate ourselves both in terms of
technology and price.


Company Description
We are a leading provider of high-capacity, cost-effective optical transport
solutions, supporting the high growth in global demand for bandwidth. We sell
our high-capacity optical transport solutions to telecommunications service
providers, content service providers, enterprises and government


 entities
worldwide to support their deployments of long-haul terrestrial and submarine
optical cable networks. We believe that our proprietary Wise Raman optical
amplification technology allows for capacity and reach performance advantages
over competitive products that are based upon conventional Erbium-Doped Fiber
Amplifier, or EDFA, technology.

We believe that we differentiate ourselves from our competitors through our
innovative, proprietary products and our industry-leading cost-efficient
operating structure. We have developed a portfolio of intellectual property with
more than 180 U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications. We have
operations in the United States and the United Kingdom, with an engineering team
that includes industry-recognized technical experts.

Our solutions are capable of spanning over 1,500 kilometers with capacity of 64
Terabits per second, or Tbit/s. Our solutions are purpose-built for varying
customer demands of capacity, reach and cost. The modular nature of our
solutions allows for capital-efficient capacity expansion over time, as the
customer’s bandwidth needs grow.

We believe our leadership in high-performance optical solutions positions us to
continue to win new customers, expand our footprint within existing customers
and, ultimately, assist our customers in preparing for increasing demand on
their networks. Our capability and expertise as a turnkey solution provider,
including the supply and installation of submerged infrastructure, has been a
key differentiator for us in recent years, particularly in submarine projects.

We have an extensive operating track record, having deployed our solutions for
more than 10 years in 60 countries across five continents. Due to our outsourced
manufacturing model, we believe that we have the capability to support high
revenue growth, while controlling operating costs.

We were incorporated in Delaware in January 1998 under the name Bandwith
Solutions, Inc. and changed our name to Xtera Communications, Inc. in 1999. We
are headquartered in Allen, Texas. Our principal executive offices are located
at 500 W. Bethany Drive, Suite 100, Allen, TX 75013. Our telephone number is
