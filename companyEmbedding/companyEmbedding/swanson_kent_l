        liquid carnitine
Some say liquid is more effective so I gave it a try. It has a sweet fruit punch flavor. The tablets worked better for me but that could be personally. I often avoid added potassium, sodium, and malic acid. I say try it if you're interested. There was nothing wrong with the product itself. It may work well for you personally.

        Excellent Fat Burner
This is an incredible supplement for anyone, esp. those of us who are getting older with systems that are slowing. I take a tablespoon in the morning--midafternoon and before bed and a fairly empty stomach. It is incredible at burning belly fat and all body fat. With diet and exercise it cannot be beat.

I like to keep my body fat percentage as close to 12% as possible. Along with a good, clean diet and exercise program, I use this supplement to help me with my goal.

        Great taste, Great Product
I use this along with a clean diet and consistent exercise (resistance and cardio). I wish I could say that the fat melts off but I cannot say that. Honestly, a gradual decrease in fat is apparent but you must also do your part. Do so and you will not be disappointed.

        Energy
My doctor explained the entire krebs cycle that works on a cellular level to create energy, and the necessity of having adequate carnitine levels for it to work. Lab tests showed my carnitine levels to be very low, which explained my lack of energy. I've been taking 2 ounces of l-carnitine in the morning for over a year. It definitely gets me thru my day. The taste is pleasant. It is sweetened with stevia instead of a toxic artificial sweetener. I mix it with a glass of water to take my other supplements. It's a good value and it is effective.

        Liquid L'Carnitine for Heart Health
My husband and I have been taking this daily for several months as recommended by Dr Steven Sinatra, the integrative cardiologist. We are very pleased with the Swanson price and quality. The taste isn't too sweet and it's easier on our stomachs then pills or capsules.

        BEST IN LIQUID FORM
L-Carnitine is really great stuff!! It really does do all the things they write about it in the Swanson description that accompanies the product listing. I take it to keep my heart healthy, strong, and energized, as well as to keep any fatty build-up away from my heart. I like this liquid form very much. In fact the liquid L-Carnitine is the only form I will take. L-Carnitine does not encapsulate well, thus the tablets are the ubiquitous available pill form. The tablets don't hold up well; they are hygroscopic, and the moisture they attract and absorb makes them soft and a real challenge to gag down. . . . And I can and do take handfulls of nicely made tablets and capsules of civilized size all at one time very easily. I had stopped taking L-Carnitine until I came upon this very nice, easy-to-use, tasty liquid form, which I take every morning and recommend to you.

        Better than a pill
I used to pay a lot more for L-Carnitine in pill form and it was nowhere near as effective as this product. The liquid is easier to swallow and you don't have to worry if it is dissolving so your body can put it to use.

        Easy to Take
My cardiologist recommended that I take L-Carnitine. I take a lot of supplements and hate swallowing pills, so the liquid makes it easy to take. It actually tastes good and I can add it to a smoothie. It does seem to make me feel stronger and I lost some weight.

        liquid carnitine
Some say liquid is more effective so I gave it a try. It has a sweet fruit punch flavor. The tablets worked better for me but that could be personally. I often avoid added potassium, sodium, and malic acid. I say try it if you're interested. There was nothing wrong with the product itself. It may work well for you personally.

        Excellent Fat Burner
This is an incredible supplement for anyone, esp. those of us who are getting older with systems that are slowing. I take a tablespoon in the morning--midafternoon and before bed and a fairly empty stomach. It is incredible at burning belly fat and all body fat. With diet and exercise it cannot be beat.

I like to keep my body fat percentage as close to 12% as possible. Along with a good, clean diet and exercise program, I use this supplement to help me with my goal.

        Great taste, Great Product
I use this along with a clean diet and consistent exercise (resistance and cardio). I wish I could say that the fat melts off but I cannot say that. Honestly, a gradual decrease in fat is apparent but you must also do your part. Do so and you will not be disappointed.

        Energy
My doctor explained the entire krebs cycle that works on a cellular level to create energy, and the necessity of having adequate carnitine levels for it to work. Lab tests showed my carnitine levels to be very low, which explained my lack of energy. I've been taking 2 ounces of l-carnitine in the morning for over a year. It definitely gets me thru my day. The taste is pleasant. It is sweetened with stevia instead of a toxic artificial sweetener. I mix it with a glass of water to take my other supplements. It's a good value and it is effective.

        Liquid L'Carnitine for Heart Health
My husband and I have been taking this daily for several months as recommended by Dr Steven Sinatra, the integrative cardiologist. We are very pleased with the Swanson price and quality. The taste isn't too sweet and it's easier on our stomachs then pills or capsules.

        BEST IN LIQUID FORM
L-Carnitine is really great stuff!! It really does do all the things they write about it in the Swanson description that accompanies the product listing. I take it to keep my heart healthy, strong, and energized, as well as to keep any fatty build-up away from my heart. I like this liquid form very much. In fact the liquid L-Carnitine is the only form I will take. L-Carnitine does not encapsulate well, thus the tablets are the ubiquitous available pill form. The tablets don't hold up well; they are hygroscopic, and the moisture they attract and absorb makes them soft and a real challenge to gag down. . . . And I can and do take handfulls of nicely made tablets and capsules of civilized size all at one time very easily. I had stopped taking L-Carnitine until I came upon this very nice, easy-to-use, tasty liquid form, which I take every morning and recommend to you.

        Better than a pill
I used to pay a lot more for L-Carnitine in pill form and it was nowhere near as effective as this product. The liquid is easier to swallow and you don't have to worry if it is dissolving so your body can put it to use.

        Easy to Take
My cardiologist recommended that I take L-Carnitine. I take a lot of supplements and hate swallowing pills, so the liquid makes it easy to take. It actually tastes good and I can add it to a smoothie. It does seem to make me feel stronger and I lost some weight.

 A breakthrough foundation for healthy skin Harnesses the power of the amino acid proline to work from the inside out Vegetarian alternative to animal-based collagen products The amino acid proline has been an ingredient in moisturizing skin creams and serums for many years. Now you can put proline to work for your skin from the inside with L-Hydroxyproline. As a precursor to the formation of collagen, L-Hydroxyproline nourishes the structural foundation of healthy skin, supports moisture retention within the tissues and helps fight the visible signs of aging.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
