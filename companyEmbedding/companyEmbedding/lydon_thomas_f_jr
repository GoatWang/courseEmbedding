Overview


Description
                      Millions of investors have been left to pick up the pieces and figure out where it all went wrong over the last couple of years. They're furious with the "professionals," and determined to regain control of their own investments. This book gives them the easy-to-use tools they need to do just that: simple tools based on techniques that have earned a 26.1% positive return over the past decade, while the S+P 500 was plummeting by 37.4%. For the first time, Thomas F. Lydon, Jr. brings together two of this generation's most well-proven investment approaches: low-cost, flexible ETFs and powerful trend following strategies, along with basic technical analysis tools. You'll learn how to quickly identify markets that are about to plummet, get out of the way, and how to identify markets that are headed up, and capture all the profit they're getting ready to deliver. Lydon shows how to systematically remove the emotion from investing, and replace it with simple mathematical tools that work consistently well: tools like the 200-day and 50-day moving average, which are easy enough for any investor to utilize. By the time they finish this book, investors will know how to make a plan that works, stick to that plan, and reap the rewards, even as others are mourning their lost assets.
