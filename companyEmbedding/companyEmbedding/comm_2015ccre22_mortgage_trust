How cash-out refinancing works



The cash out refinance is designed to accomplish two goals — to improve on the terms of an existing home loan and deliver additional funds at a low interest rate. Other types of mortgage refinance include the rate and term refinance, in which the new loan amount is equal to the remaining balance on the old mortgage, and the limited cash out refinance, in which the closing costs are added wrapped into the new loan, increasing its balance.It only makes sense to undertake a cash-out refinance if the new loan comes with a better refinance rate or more favorable terms (replacing an adjustable rate home loan with a fixed rate mortgage, for example).

Refinance with cash out: conforming loans
It is important to note that cash out refinancing generally costs more than rate and term or limited cash out refinancing. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, for example, require lenders to collect surcharges for these loans (called “conforming” mortgages) because they are considered riskier.
The added costs of cash out refinancing can be substantial and should be considered carefully. If, for example, a homeowner wishes to refinance a $200,000 mortgage and take an additional $10,000 cash out, there may be no extra costs (the new loan amount is less than 60 percent of the home’s value and the borrower has a 700 FICO score, for example). On the other hand, if the homeowner has a 650 FICO and the new loan amount is 83 percent of the property value, it would cost an extra $6,300 to borrow $10,000!
In general, cash out refinancing is likely to be the lowest cost option when the amount of additional cash is relatively high. In the above example, the added costs come to 63 percent of the amount borrowed. If the homeowner were to take $100,000 cash out, however, the added costs come to nine percent of the amount borrowed — a considerably lower figure. The chart below shows the added costs, which depend on the borrower’s credit score and the loan-to-value ratio. Notice cash out is limited to 85 percent of the property value.




What is cash-out refinancing?
A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

Glossary Terms
​ Cash-Out Refinancing

A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

​ Equity

The difference between the fair market value of an asset (like a home) and the amount of debt against that asset (like a mortgage balance).

​  Rate and Term Refinancing

A mortgage refinance that replaces the existing mortgage with a new one but does not disburse cash to the borrower. Rate and term refinancing is undertaken simply to improve on the terms of the old loan – reducing the interest rate is a popular goal.

​  Refinance 

Refinancing means replacing one loan with a new, better loan. Improving the terms of a loan can mean obtaining a lower interest rate, a lower monthly payment, replacing an adjustable or variable rate loan with a fixed-rate loan or increasing the size of the loan and taking the difference in cash.

Cash-Out Refinance Pros
Cash out refinancing offers a few advantages over other sources of funds:

Because it’s secured by real estate, the interest rate is lower than rates for unsecured financing.
Because it’s a first mortgage, the interest rate is lower than rates for home equity loans, which are usually second mortgages.
The interest may be tax-deductible. Check with a tax pro.



Cash-Out Refinance Cons

Underwriting guidelines are stricter than for rate and term refinancing.
Costs are higher because surcharges are assessed against the entire refinance, not just the amount of cash out.
Cash out refinancing takes longer than setting up a home equity loan or personal (unsecured) loan.
Increasing the loan-to-value to over 80 percent requires mortgage insurance.







 



Alternatives to cash-out refinancing
Homeowners considering a cash out refinance should compare the costs of all available options:

Rate and term refinance plus a home equity loan (if terms of existing loan can be bettered)
Adding just a home equity loan (if existing loan cannot be improved)
Taking a personal loan (if credit rating is good and costs are low)
Consolidating debt with a debt management plan or balance transfer card

Cash out refinancing is a valid strategy for financing anything from college tuition to debt consolidation to home improvements. However, homeowners should run the numbers and consider the total cost of borrowing — lender fees, interest rates and third party costs — before committing.

Will you save money by refinancing your current loan?
A mortgage refinance can mean big savings, but it may come at a price in the short term. The decision to refinance generally comes down to whether you'll be in your home long enough for your monthly savings to outweigh the upfront refinancing costs. Our Refinance Calculator can help you determine the amount of time you'll need to stay in your home after refinancing your mortgage to breakeven and cover your costs.

Breakeven Analysis







                                    Monthly Payment
                                    ?
There are several ways to calculate your refinance breakeven. The "quick and dirty" method involves dividing the difference in your monthly payment by the refinancing costs. That isn't necessarily the most accurate method, and the longer you've been paying your current loan, the less accurate that breakeven calculation is. In addition, this method won't help you if your refinancing from a 30-year mortgage to a 15-year loan.










                                    Interest Expense
                                    ?
The next method is based on the difference in  interest expense between your current loan and a refinance mortgage. Your breakeven is that point in which the total interest savings equals the cost of refinancing. This method allows you to compare loans with different terms.










                                    Mortgage Tax Deduction
                                    ?
If you itemize your deductions when you file your taxes, it affects your breakeven point. Higher interest rates mean higher mortgage deductions. Refinancing to a lower rate decreases your mortgage interest deduction.










                                    Pay Down Existing Mortgage
                                    ?
You can choose to refinance or leave your mortgage alone, but you have another option -- use your cash to pay down your mortgage balance instead of spending it on refinancing. You can reamortize your loan to reduce your payment or accelerate your repayment. This breakeven method measures how long it would take for your refinance payment less the reamortized payment on your current mortgage to cover the costs of refinancing.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

capacities indicated on the Exhibit Index) with respect to the 26 Broadway      
Mortgage Loan, which constituted approximately 7.7% of the asset pool of        
the issuing entity as of its cut-off date.  The 26 Broadway Mortgage Loan       
is an asset of the issuing entity and is part of a loan combination that        
includes the 26 Broadway Mortgage Loan and three other pari passu loans,        
which are not assets of the issuing entity. A pari passu portion of the         
loan combination was securitized in the COMM 2015-DC1 Mortgage Trust            
transaction, Commission File Number 333-193376-16 (the "COMM 2015-DC1           
Transaction"). This loan combination, including the 26 Broadway Mortgage        
Loan, is being serviced and administered pursuant to the pooling and            
servicing agreement for the COMM 2015-DC1 Transaction, which is                 
incorporated by reference as Exhibit 4.2 to this Annual Report on Form          
10-K.  KeyBank National Association, as the master servicer under the           
pooling and servicing agreement for the COMM 2015-DC1 Transaction, is           
also the primary servicer of this loan combination.  The responsibilities       
of KeyBank National Association, as primary servicer of this loan               
combination, are subsumed within its responsibilities as master servicer        
under the pooling and servicing agreement for the COMM 2015-DC1                 
Transaction.

Item 1117 of Regulation AB, Legal Proceedings.                                  

The registrant knows of no material pending legal proceeding involving the      
trust or any party related to the trust, other than routine litigation          
incidental to the duties of those respective parties, and the following,        
with respect to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee,             
certificate administrator and custodian, Deutsche Bank Trust Company            
Americas, as certificate administrator and custodian, Keybank National          
Association, as master servicer, and CWCapital Asset Management LLC, as         
special servicer:                                                               

On June 18, 2014, a group of institutional investors filed a civil              
complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County,       
against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., in its capacity as trustee under 276            
residential mortgage backed securities ("RMBS") trusts, which was later         
amended on July 18, 2014, to increase the number of trusts to 284 RMBS          
trusts. On November 24, 2014, the plaintiffs filed a motion to voluntarily      
dismiss the state court action without prejudice. That same day, a group        
of institutional investors filed a civil complaint in the United States         
District Court for the Southern District of New York (the "District             
Court") against Wells Fargo Bank, alleging claims against the bank in its       
capacity as trustee for 274 RMBS trusts (the "Complaint"). In December          
2014, the plaintiffs' motion to voluntarily dismiss their original state        
court action was granted. As with the prior state court action, the             
Complaint is one of six similar complaints filed contemporaneously              
against RMBS trustees (Deutsche Bank, Citibank, HSBC, Bank of New York          
Mellon and US Bank) by a group of institutional investor plaintiffs. The        
Complaint against Wells Fargo Bank alleges that the trustee caused losses       
to investors and asserts causes of action based upon, among other things,       
the trustee's alleged failure to (i) enforce repurchase obligations of          
mortgage loan sellers for purported breaches of representations and             
warranties, (ii) notify investors of alleged events of default purportedly      
caused by breaches by mortgage loan servicers, and (iii) abide by               
appropriate standards of care following alleged events of default. Relief       
sought includes money damages in an unspecified amount, reimbursement of        
expenses, and equitable relief. Other cases (collectively, the "Additional      
Complaints") alleging similar causes of action have been filed against          
Wells Fargo Bank and other trustees in the same court by RMBS investors in      
these and other transactions, and these cases have been consolidated            
before the same judge. On January 19, 2016, an order was entered in             
connection with the Complaint in which the District Court declined to           
exercise jurisdiction over 261 trusts at issue in the Complaint; the            
District Court also allowed Plaintiffs to file amended complaints if they       
so chose, and three amended complaints have been filed. There can be no         
assurances as to the outcome of the litigation, or the possible impact          
of the litigation on the trustee or the RMBS trusts. However, Wells Fargo       
Bank denies liability and believes that it has performed its obligations        
under the RMBS trusts in good faith, that its actions were not the cause        
of any losses to investors, and that it has meritorious defenses, and it        
intends to contest the plaintiffs' claims vigorously.                           

On June 18, 2014, a group of investors, including funds managed by              
Blackrock Advisors, LLC, PIMCO-Advisors, L.P., and others, filed a              
derivative action against Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas ("DBTCA")        
and Deutsche Bank National Trust Company ("DBNTC") in New York State            
Supreme Court purportedly on behalf of and for the benefit of 544               
private-label RMBS trusts asserting claims for alleged violations of the        
U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (TIA), breach of contract, breach of           
fiduciary duty and negligence based on DBNTC and DBTCA's alleged failure        
to perform their duties as trustees for the trusts. Plaintiffs subsequently     
dismissed their state court complaint and filed a derivative and class          
action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of        
New York on behalf of and for the benefit of 564 private-label RMBS             
trusts, which substantially overlapped with the trusts at issue in the          
state court action. The complaint alleges that the trusts at issue have         
suffered total realized collateral losses of U.S. $89.4 billion, but the        
complaint does not include a demand for money damages in a sum certain.         
DBNTC and DBTCA filed a motion to dismiss, and on January 19, 2016, the         
court partially granted the motion on procedural grounds: as to the 500         
trusts that are governed by Pooling and Servicing Agreements, the court         
declined to exercise jurisdiction. The court did not rule on substantive        
defenses asserted in the motion to dismiss as to the 64 trusts formed           
under indentures for which it retained jurisdiction. Instead, the court         
ordered plaintiffs to file an amended complaint as to those indenture           
trusts. On February 23, 2016, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint as to       
62 of the 64 indenture trusts included in the original U.S. District Court      
complaint.  DBNTC and DBTCA will have an opportunity to file new defensive      
motions with respect to this amended complaint. It is anticipated that          
plaintiffs will, in the near future, file a new state court complaint as        
to some or all of the 500 trusts governed by Pooling and Servicing              
Agreements which were dismissed from the U.S. District Court action.            

On December 30, 2015, IKB International, S.A. and IKB Deutsche                  
Industriebank A.G. filed a Summons With Notice in New York state                
court naming as defendants DBNTC and DBTCA, as trustees of 37 RMBS trusts       
(the "IKB Action"). The claims in the IKB Action appear to be                   
substantively similar to the SDNY Action. The IKB Action is not styled          
as a putative class action, but may attempt to bring derivative claims          
on behalf of the named RMBS Trusts. DBTCA intends to vigorously defend          
the IKB Action.                                                                 

DBTCA has no pending legal proceedings (including, based on DBTCA's             
present evaluation, the litigation disclosed in the foregoing paragraphs)       
that would materially affect its ability to perform its duties as               
Certificate Administrator and Custodian under the Pooling and Servicing         
Agreement for this transaction.                                                 

On February 23, 2016, a certificateholder of the J.P. Morgan Chase              
Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust, Series 2007-CIBC18 (the "Trust"),         
filed suit in the Supreme Court of New York, County of New York, against        
KeyBank National Association and Berkadia Commercial Mortgage LLC               
(collectively, the "Servicers"). The suit was filed derivatively on             
behalf of the Trust. The action was brought in connection with the              
Servicers' determination of the fair value of a loan, secured by the            
Bryant Park Hotel in New York City, held by the Trust and sold to an            
assignee of the Trust's directing certificateholder, pursuant to an             
exercise of the fair value option. There can be no assurances as to             
the outcome of the action or the possible impact of the litigation on           
the Servicers. Both Servicers deny liability, believe that they                 
performed their obligations in accordance with the terms of the Pooling         
and Servicing Agreement applicable to the Trust, and intend to contest          
the claims asserted against them.                                               

On December 17, 2015, U.S. Bank National Association, the trustee under         
five (5) pooling and servicing agreements for (i) Wachovia Bank                 
Commercial Mortgage Trust 2007-C30, (ii) COBALT CMBS Commercial Trust           
2007-C2, (iii) Wachovia Bank Commercial Mortgage Trust 2007-C31, (iv)           
ML-CFC Commercial Mortgage Trust 2007-5 and (v) ML-CFC Commercial               
Mortgage Trust 2007-6 commenced a proceeding with the Second Judicial           
District Court of Ramsey County, Minnesota ("Court") for a declaratory          
judgment as to the proper allocation of certain proceeds in the alleged         
amount of $560 million ("Disputed Proceeds") received by CWCapital              
Asset Management LLC ("CWCAM") in connection with the sale of the Peter         
Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town property in New York, New York (the          
"Property") securing loans held by those trusts.  CWCAM was the special         
servicer of the Property. The petition requests the court to instruct           
the trustee, the trust beneficiaries, and any other interested parties          
as to the amount of the Disputed Proceeds, if any, that constitute              
penalty interest and/or the amount of the Disputed Proceeds, if any,            
that constitute gain-on-sale proceeds, with respect to each trust. On           
February 24, 2016, CWCAM made a limited appearance with the Court to            
file a motion to dismiss this proceeding based on lack of jurisdiction,         
mootness, standing, and forum non conveniens.  There can be no                  
assurances as to the outcome of this motion or the proceeding or the            
possible impact on CWCAM. However, CWCAM believes that it has performed         
its obligations under the related pooling and servicing agreements in           
good faith, and that the Disputed Proceeds were properly allocated to           
CWCAM as penalty interest, and it intends to vigorously contest any             
claim that such Disputed Proceeds were improperly allocated as penalty          
interest.

      Fitch to Rate COMM 2015-CCRE22 Commercial Mortgage Trust Pass-Through 
      Ctfs; Presale Issued
    





March 12, 2015 07:32 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report on Deutsche Bank Securities, 
      Inc.'s COMM Mortgage Trust 2015-CCRE22 Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through 
      Certificates.
    

      Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as 
      follows:
    

      --$46,400,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$178,900,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$108,950,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$79,800,000 class A-SB 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$200,000,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$293,492,000 class A-5 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;

      --$68,066,000c class D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$27,550,000c class E 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable.

      (b) Class A-M, B and C certificates may be exchanged for class PEZ 
      certificates, and class PEZ certificates may be exchanged for class A-M, 
      B, and C certificates.
    

      (c) Privately placed and pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of March 9, 2015. Fitch does not expect to rate the $43,757,000 
      interest-only class X-D, the $16,207,000 class F, the $24,309,000 class 
      G or the $38,894,958 class H certificates.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 65 loans secured by 74 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $1.3 
      billion, as of the cutoff date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by German American Capital Corporation, Cantor Commercial Real Estate 
      Lending, L.P., Natixis Real Estate Capital LLC and The Bank of New York 
      Mellon.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 73.3% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 82.8%, and asset summary reviews on 82.8% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      High Fitch Leverage: The pool's Fitch DSCR and LTV are 1.10x and 114.3%, 
      respectively. This represents higher leverage than other recent 
      Fitch-rated fixed-rate multiborrower transactions. The 2014 average 
      Fitch DSCR was 1.19x and the average Fitch LTV was 106.2%.
    

      High New York Concentration: The largest state concentration is New York 
      (22.37%), with four of the largest 10 concentrations (22.4%) secured by 
      properties located in New York City. The next largest state 
      concentrations are Texas (11.5%), California (8.0%), New Jersey (7.4%) 
      and Minnesota (7.4%). The largest loan in the pool (7.7%) is secured by 
      a property located in downtown Manhattan.
    

      Collateral Quality: As a percentage of Fitch inspected properties, 35.1% 
      of the pool received a property quality grade of "B+" or higher. Three 
      loans (10.5% of the pool) received property quality grades of "A-". Only 
      one inspected property (0.79%) received a property quality grade below a 
      "B-". Further, three loans (10.0% of the pool) are collateralized by 
      leased fee positions, two of which are located in Manhattan.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 17.3% below the 
      most recent net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a recent 
      NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing during this 
      period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level NCF could 
      result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted loans, and 
      could result in potential rating actions on the certificates. Fitch 
      evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to COMM 2015-CCRE22 
      certificates and found that the transaction displays slightly above 
      average sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which 
      NCF declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'A-sf' could result. In a more severe scenario, 
      in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the 
      junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB+sf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on pages 10 - 11.
    

      The master servicer will be Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, 
      rated 'CMS1-' by Fitch and the special servicers will be LNR Partners 
      LLC and Midland Loan Services, rated 'CSS1-'and 'CSS1' by Fitch.

Approximately $894.7 Million of Structured Securities Affected


New York, January 27, 2017 -- Moody's Investors Service has affirmed the ratings on six classes in COMM 
2015-CCRE22 Mortgage Trust as follows: 




Cl. A-1, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously on Mar 
3, 2016 Affirmed Aaa (sf)


Cl. A-2, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously on Mar

3, 2016 Affirmed Aaa (sf)


Cl. A-SB, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously on Mar 
3, 2016 Affirmed Aaa (sf)




RATINGS RATIONALE




The ratings on six P&I classes were affirmed because the transaction's 
key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value 
(LTV) ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio 
(DSCR) and the transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), are 
within acceptable ranges.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 5.1% 
of the current balance, compared to 5.8% at Moody's 
last review. Moody's base expected loss plus realized losses is 
now 5.1% of the original pooled balance, compared 
to 5.8% at the last review. Moody's provides 
a current list of base expected losses for conduit and fusion CMBS transactions 
on moodys.com at http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255.




FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.




Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The principal methodology used in these ratings was "Approach to Rating 
US and Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014. 
Please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




DESCRIPTION OF MODELS USED




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, 
which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit 
enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, 
Moody's actual and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property 
quality grade (which reflects the capitalization rate Moody's uses 
to estimate Moody's value). Moody's fuses the conduit 
results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured 
credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents 10% 
or greater of the current pool balance. 




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan 
sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. 
Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, 
including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 27, 
the same as at Moody's last review.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the January 12, 2017 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by 1.0% to $1.284 
billion from $1.296 billion at securitization. The 
certificates are collateralized by 65 mortgage loans ranging in size from 
less than 1% to 7.8% of the pool, with the 
top ten loans (excluding defeasance) constituting 52.0% 
of the pool.




Nine loans, constituting 9.5% of the pool, are 
on the master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes 
loans that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part 
of the CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As 
part of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency 
reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that 
could affect performance.




One loan, the Lions Run Apartments Loan ($5.2 million 
-- 0.4% of the pool), is currently in special 
servicing. The loan is secured by a 208-unit garden-style 
multifamily property located in Harker Heights, Texas. The 
property was transferred to the special servicer in September 2016 due 
to imminent default for delinquent payments. 




Moody's has also assumed a high default probability for one poorly 
performing loan, constituting 1.1% of the pool, 
and has estimated an aggregate loss of approximately $6 million 
(a 32% expected loss on average) from the specially serviced and 
troubled loans.




Moody's received full and partial year 2015 operating results for 89% 
of the pool, and full or partial year 2016 operating results for 
90% of the pool (excluding specially serviced and defeased loans). 
Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 122%, compared 
to 123% at Moody's last review. Moody's conduit 
component excludes loans with structured credit assessments, defeased 
and CTL loans, and specially serviced and troubled loans. 
Moody's net cash flow (NCF) reflects a weighted average haircut 
of 6.4% to the most recently available net operating income 
(NOI). Moody's value reflects a weighted average capitalization 
rate of 9.4%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.45X and 0.85X, 
respectively, compared to 1.45X and 0.84X at the last 
review. Moody's actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF 
and the loan's actual debt service. Moody's stressed 
DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and a 9.25% stress rate 
the agency applied to the loan balance.




The top three conduit loans represent 22% of the pool balance. 
The largest loan is the 26 Broadway Loan ($100.0 million 
-- 7.8% of the pool), which represents a pari-passu 
portion of a $220 million mortgage loan. The loan is secured 
by an 29-story, 840,000 square foot (SF) landmark Class 
B office building located in Manhattan's financial district on the 
corner of Broadway and Beaver Street. The building contains approximately 
794,000 SF of office, 26,000 SF of storage space, 
and 19,000 SF of retail space. The property was 81% 
occupied as of June 2016. The property is also encumbered by $50.0 
million of mezzanine debt held outside the trust. Moody's LTV and 
stressed DSCR on the mortgage loan are 130% and 0.75X, 
respectively, the same as the Moody's last review.




The second largest loan is the Wells Fargo Portfolio Loan ($92.1 
million -- 7.2% of the pool), which is secured 
by six cross-collateralized, cross-defaulted Class 
B/C single-tenant office buildings located in Virginia, Georgia, 
South Carolina, and North Carolina. The properties, 
which are 100% leased to Wells Fargo under individual leases and 
a master lease, total over 1.6 million SF and have a variety 
of uses. The master lease expires in September 2024. Wells 
Fargo has termination options, but must pay a fee equal to the net 
present value of the annual base rent for the remaining term. To 
account for the single-tenant exposure, Moody's stressed 
the value of the properties by utilizing a Lit/Dark analysis. Moody's 
LTV and stressed DSCR are 123% and 0.99X, respectively, 
compared to 125% and 0.98X at the last review.




The third largest loan is the 3 Columbus Circle Loan ($85.0 
million -- 6.6% of the pool), which is secured 
by a 26-story, 526,000 SF component of a 740,000 
SF Class A office building located directly off Columbus Circle in Manhattan, 
New York. The A-note represents a pari-passu interest 
in a $350.0 million mortgage loan. The collateral 
consists of units one through 20 in a 21-unit condominium. 
The non-collateral units are owned by Y&R, which also 
leases an additional 159,000 SF (30% of NRA) at the property 
that is part of the collateral. The property underwent a major 
renovation between 2011 and 2013 at a reported cost of $101 million 
(or $136 PSF). The property was 94% occupied as of 
September 2016. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 113% and 
0.79X, respectively, the same as Moody's last review.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the credit rating action on the support provider and in relation to 
each particular credit rating action for securities that derive their 
credit ratings from the support provider's credit rating. 
For provisional ratings, this announcement provides certain regulatory 
disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned, and 
in relation to a definitive rating that may be assigned subsequent to 
the final issuance of the debt, in each case where the transaction 
structure and terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive 
rating in a manner that would have affected the rating. For further 
information please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the 
respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this credit rating action, 
and whose ratings may change as a result of this credit rating action, 
the associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.


Please see www.moodys.com for any updates on changes to 
the lead rating analyst and to the Moody's legal entity that has issued 
the rating.


Please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page on www.moodys.com 
for additional regulatory disclosures for each credit rating.

NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE ACCURACY, TIMELINESS, COMPLETENESS, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OF ANY SUCH RATING OR OTHER OPINION OR INFORMATION IS GIVEN OR MADE BY MOODY’S IN ANY FORM OR MANNER WHATSOEVER. Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable). This document is intended to be provided only to “wholesale clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. By continuing to access this document from within Australia, you represent to MOODY’S that you are, or are accessing the document as a representative of, a “wholesale client” and that neither you nor the entity you represent will directly or indirectly disseminate this document or its contents to “retail clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors. It would be reckless and inappropriate for retail investors to use MOODY’S credit ratings or publications when making an investment decision. If in doubt you should contact your financial or other professional adviser. Additional terms for Japan only: Moody's Japan K.K. (“MJKK”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody's Group Japan G.K., which is wholly-owned by Moody’s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

How cash-out refinancing works



The cash out refinance is designed to accomplish two goals — to improve on the terms of an existing home loan and deliver additional funds at a low interest rate. Other types of mortgage refinance include the rate and term refinance, in which the new loan amount is equal to the remaining balance on the old mortgage, and the limited cash out refinance, in which the closing costs are added wrapped into the new loan, increasing its balance.It only makes sense to undertake a cash-out refinance if the new loan comes with a better refinance rate or more favorable terms (replacing an adjustable rate home loan with a fixed rate mortgage, for example).

Refinance with cash out: conforming loans
It is important to note that cash out refinancing generally costs more than rate and term or limited cash out refinancing. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, for example, require lenders to collect surcharges for these loans (called “conforming” mortgages) because they are considered riskier.
The added costs of cash out refinancing can be substantial and should be considered carefully. If, for example, a homeowner wishes to refinance a $200,000 mortgage and take an additional $10,000 cash out, there may be no extra costs (the new loan amount is less than 60 percent of the home’s value and the borrower has a 700 FICO score, for example). On the other hand, if the homeowner has a 650 FICO and the new loan amount is 83 percent of the property value, it would cost an extra $6,300 to borrow $10,000!
In general, cash out refinancing is likely to be the lowest cost option when the amount of additional cash is relatively high. In the above example, the added costs come to 63 percent of the amount borrowed. If the homeowner were to take $100,000 cash out, however, the added costs come to nine percent of the amount borrowed — a considerably lower figure. The chart below shows the added costs, which depend on the borrower’s credit score and the loan-to-value ratio. Notice cash out is limited to 85 percent of the property value.




What is cash-out refinancing?
A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

Glossary Terms
​ Cash-Out Refinancing

A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

​ Equity

The difference between the fair market value of an asset (like a home) and the amount of debt against that asset (like a mortgage balance).

​  Rate and Term Refinancing

A mortgage refinance that replaces the existing mortgage with a new one but does not disburse cash to the borrower. Rate and term refinancing is undertaken simply to improve on the terms of the old loan – reducing the interest rate is a popular goal.

​  Refinance 

Refinancing means replacing one loan with a new, better loan. Improving the terms of a loan can mean obtaining a lower interest rate, a lower monthly payment, replacing an adjustable or variable rate loan with a fixed-rate loan or increasing the size of the loan and taking the difference in cash.

Cash-Out Refinance Pros
Cash out refinancing offers a few advantages over other sources of funds:

Because it’s secured by real estate, the interest rate is lower than rates for unsecured financing.
Because it’s a first mortgage, the interest rate is lower than rates for home equity loans, which are usually second mortgages.
The interest may be tax-deductible. Check with a tax pro.



Cash-Out Refinance Cons

Underwriting guidelines are stricter than for rate and term refinancing.
Costs are higher because surcharges are assessed against the entire refinance, not just the amount of cash out.
Cash out refinancing takes longer than setting up a home equity loan or personal (unsecured) loan.
Increasing the loan-to-value to over 80 percent requires mortgage insurance.







 



Alternatives to cash-out refinancing
Homeowners considering a cash out refinance should compare the costs of all available options:

Rate and term refinance plus a home equity loan (if terms of existing loan can be bettered)
Adding just a home equity loan (if existing loan cannot be improved)
Taking a personal loan (if credit rating is good and costs are low)
Consolidating debt with a debt management plan or balance transfer card

Cash out refinancing is a valid strategy for financing anything from college tuition to debt consolidation to home improvements. However, homeowners should run the numbers and consider the total cost of borrowing — lender fees, interest rates and third party costs — before committing.

Will you save money by refinancing your current loan?
A mortgage refinance can mean big savings, but it may come at a price in the short term. The decision to refinance generally comes down to whether you'll be in your home long enough for your monthly savings to outweigh the upfront refinancing costs. Our Refinance Calculator can help you determine the amount of time you'll need to stay in your home after refinancing your mortgage to breakeven and cover your costs.

Breakeven Analysis







                                    Monthly Payment
                                    ?
There are several ways to calculate your refinance breakeven. The "quick and dirty" method involves dividing the difference in your monthly payment by the refinancing costs. That isn't necessarily the most accurate method, and the longer you've been paying your current loan, the less accurate that breakeven calculation is. In addition, this method won't help you if your refinancing from a 30-year mortgage to a 15-year loan.










                                    Interest Expense
                                    ?
The next method is based on the difference in  interest expense between your current loan and a refinance mortgage. Your breakeven is that point in which the total interest savings equals the cost of refinancing. This method allows you to compare loans with different terms.










                                    Mortgage Tax Deduction
                                    ?
If you itemize your deductions when you file your taxes, it affects your breakeven point. Higher interest rates mean higher mortgage deductions. Refinancing to a lower rate decreases your mortgage interest deduction.










                                    Pay Down Existing Mortgage
                                    ?
You can choose to refinance or leave your mortgage alone, but you have another option -- use your cash to pay down your mortgage balance instead of spending it on refinancing. You can reamortize your loan to reduce your payment or accelerate your repayment. This breakeven method measures how long it would take for your refinance payment less the reamortized payment on your current mortgage to cover the costs of refinancing.
