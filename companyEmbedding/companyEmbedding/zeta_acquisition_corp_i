Zeta Global acquires Boomtrain to bolster its machine learning tech

Mira’s Prism is a $99 headset vying to become the Google Daydream of augmented reality












Zeta Global, the marketing automation platform founded by David A. Steinberg and former Apple CEO John Sculley, today announced that it has acquired Boomtrain, a machine-learning centric marketing platform. Sources close to the company tell us that the price of the acquisition was between $35 million and $40 million. Boomtrain had raised a total of $14.77 million before today’s acquisition.
This marks Zeta’s tenth acquisition in the ten years since it was founded and today’s news follows the company’s $140 million Series F round in April, which valued the company at around $1.3 billion.
As Zeta co-founder and CEO Steinberg told me, the team was looking at acquiring a machine-learning centric marketing firm that could help it jump-start its own efforts in this area (where it already has a number of patents). Zeta’s competitors like Adobe and its Marketing Cloud are obviously moving in the same direction. With Boomtrain, which had a strong focus on publishing, Zeta found a company that could form the core of its offering going forward.
The plan is to keep the current Boomtrain product portfolio running for the foreseeable future, but what Steinberg got most excited about is the plan to use this acquisition to use Boomtrain’s machine learning smarts across the Zeta product portfolio. “We will merge 100 percent of its machine learning, decisioning and marketing automation in our entire marketing cloud,” he said. “It’s a big deal for us technologically. We looked at this and thought: is this a buy or a build?”
In the end, the team decided that the only way to get up to speed fast enough was to acquire the technology and the team. “Our existing team is amazing,” Steinberg said. “But we really felt like this team brought a new vision in where the industry was going from an AI/machine learning perspective. For us, without question, this was all about time. It would have taken our team a long time to do with and we’d have to hire somebody like [Boomtrain CTO and co-founder] Chris [Monberg] anyway.”
Boomtrain’s roughly 60 employees in the U.S. and Bangalore will join Zeta, which will keep Boomtrain’s Bangalore office as its third location in India. While Boomtrain also offers some agency services to its clients, Steinberg was pretty clear that Zeta won’t focus on this. “We are not an agency. We don’t want to be in the agency business,” he noted. “We are a software company.”

FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS
 
Certain
statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are “forward-looking statements” (within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) regarding the plans and objectives of management for future operations. Such statements
involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements of
Zeta Acquisition Corp. I (the “Company”) to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements
expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements included herein are based on current expectations
that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. The Company’s plans and objectives are based, in part, on assumptions involving
the continued expansion of business. Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to, among other things,
future economic, competitive and market conditions and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to
predict accurately and many of which are beyond the control of the Company. Although the Company believes its assumptions underlying
the forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could prove inaccurate and, therefore, there can be no assurance
the forward-looking statements included in this Report will prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent
in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation
by the Company or any other person that the objectives and plans of the Company will be achieved.

 


 
 
 
PART
I
 
Item
1. Business.
 
Zeta
Acquisition Corp. I (“we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” or the “Registrant”)
was incorporated in the State of Delaware on November 16, 2007. Since inception, the Company has been engaged in organizational
efforts and obtaining initial financing. The Company was formed as a vehicle to pursue a business combination and has
made no efforts to identify a possible business combination. As a result, the Company has not conducted negotiations
or entered into a letter of intent concerning any target business. The business purpose of the Company is to seek the acquisition
of, or merger with, an existing company. The Company selected December 31 as its fiscal year end.
 
The
Company is currently considered to be a “blank check” company. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”)
defines those companies as “any development stage company that is issuing a penny stock, within the meaning of Section 3
(a)(51) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and that has no specific business
plan or purpose, or has indicated that its business plan is to merge with an unidentified company or companies.” Under SEC
Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, the Company also qualifies as a “shell company,” because it has no or nominal assets
(other than cash) and no or nominal operations. Many states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the
sale of securities of “blank check” companies in their respective jurisdictions. Management does not intend to undertake
any efforts to cause a market to develop in our securities, either debt or equity, until we have successfully concluded a business
combination. The Company intends to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for so long as it is subject
to those requirements.
 
In
addition, the Company is an “emerging growth company”, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012
(“JOBS Act”), and may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable
to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required
to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and exemptions from the requirements
of Sections 14A(a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to hold a nonbinding advisory vote of shareholders on executive
compensation and any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
 
The
Company has also elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section
102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act. This election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different
effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election,
our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.
 
We
will remain an “emerging growth company” until the earliest of (1) the last day of the fiscal year during which our
revenues exceed $1 billion, (2) the date on which we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three year period,
(3) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common equity securities
pursuant to an effective registration statement filed pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities
Act”), or (4) when the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the
last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter. To the extent that we continue to qualify as a “smaller
reporting company”, as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, after we cease to qualify
as an emerging growth company, certain of the exemptions available to us as an emerging growth company may continue to be available
to us as a smaller reporting company, including: (1) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of
Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act; (2) scaled executive compensation disclosures; and (3) the requirement to provide only
two years of audited financial statements, instead of three years.
 


 1 
 

 
The
Company was organized as a vehicle to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business seeking
the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation. The Company’s principal business objective for the next 12
months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate,
short-term earnings. The Company will not restrict its potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry
or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business.
 
The
analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of the officers and directors of the Company.  As
of this date, the Company has not entered into any definitive agreement with any party regarding business opportunities for the
Company.  The Company has unrestricted flexibility in seeking, analyzing and participating in potential business opportunities
in that it may seek a business combination target located in any industry or location. In its efforts to analyze potential acquisition
targets, the Company will consider the following kinds of factors:
 

a)Potential
  for growth, indicated by new technology, anticipated market expansion or new products;
 

b)Competitive
  position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry
  segment as well as within the industry as a whole;
 

c)Strength
  and diversity of management, either in place or scheduled for recruitment;
 

d)Capital
  requirements and anticipated availability of required funds, to be provided by the Company
  or from operations, through the sale of additional securities, through joint ventures
  or similar arrangements or from other sources;
 

e)The
  cost of participation by the Company as compared to the perceived tangible and intangible
  values and potentials;
 

f)The
  extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced; and
 

g)The
  accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw materials, services, professional
  assistance and other required items.
 
In
applying the foregoing criteria, no one of which will be controlling, management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances
and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Potentially available business opportunities
may occur in many different industries, and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation
and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. Due to the Company’s limited capital available
for investigation, the Company may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the opportunity to be acquired. In
evaluating a prospective business combination, we will conduct as extensive a due diligence review of potential targets as possible
given the lack of information which may be available regarding private companies, our limited personnel and financial resources
and the inexperience of our management with respect to such activities. We expect that our due diligence will encompass, among
other things, meetings with the target business’s incumbent management and inspection of its facilities, as necessary, as
well as a review of financial and other information which is made available to us. This due diligence review will be conducted
either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage, including but not limited to attorneys, accountants,
consultants or such other professionals. At this time the Company has not specifically identified any third parties that it may
engage. The costs associated with hiring third parties to complete a business combination target may be significant and are difficult
to determine as such costs may vary depending on a variety of factors, including the amount of time it takes to complete a business
combination, the location of the target company and the size and the complexity of the target company. Our limited funds and the
lack of full-time management will likely make it impracticable to conduct a complete and exhaustive investigation and analysis
of a target business before we consummate a business combination. Management decisions, therefore, will likely be made without
detailed feasibility studies, independent analysis, market surveys and the like which, if we had more funds available to us, would
be desirable. We will be particularly dependent in making decisions upon information provided by the promoters, owners, sponsors
or others associated with the target business seeking our participation.
 


 2 
 
 
The
time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete a business combination cannot presently
be ascertained with any degree of certainty. The amount of time it takes to complete a business combination, the location of the
target company and the size and complexity of the business of the target company are all factors that determine the costs associated
with completing a business combination transaction. The time and costs required to complete a business combination transaction
can be ascertained once a business combination target has been identified. Any costs incurred with respect to evaluation of a
prospective business combination that is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us.
 
Competition
 
In
identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business
objective similar to ours. There are numerous “public shell” companies either actively or passively seeking operating
businesses with which to merge in addition to a large number of “blank check” companies formed and capitalized specifically
to acquire operating businesses. Additionally, we are subject to competition from other companies looking to expand their operations
through the acquisition of a target business. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying
and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human
and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these
competitors. Our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses is limited by our available financial resources.
This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business.
 
Any
of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. Our management
believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give
us a competitive advantage over privately-held entities with a business objective similar to ours to acquire a target business
on favorable terms.
 
If
we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the
target business. Many of our target business’ competitors are likely to be significantly larger and have far greater financial
and other resources than we will. Some of these competitors may be divisions or subsidiaries of large, diversified companies that
have access to financial resources of their respective parent companies. Our target business may not be able to compete effectively
with these companies or maintain them as customers while competing with them on other projects. In addition, it is likely that
our target business will face significant competition from smaller companies that have specialized capabilities in similar areas.
We cannot accurately predict how our target business’ competitive position may be affected by changing economic conditions,
customer requirements or technical developments. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have
the resources to compete effectively.
 
Form
of Acquisition
 
The
manner in which the Company participates in an opportunity will depend upon the nature of the opportunity, the respective needs
and desires of the Company and the promoters of the opportunity, and the relative negotiating strength of the Company and such
promoters.
 
It
is likely that the Company will acquire its participation in a business opportunity through the issuance of common stock or other
securities of the Company. Although the terms of any such transaction cannot be predicted, it should be noted that in certain
circumstances the criteria for determining whether or not an acquisition is a so-called “tax free” reorganization
under Section 368(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) depends upon whether the owners
of the acquired business own 80% or more of the voting stock of the surviving entity. If a transaction were structured to take
advantage of these provisions rather than other “tax free” provisions provided under the Code, all prior stockholders
would in such circumstances retain 20% or less of the total issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity. Under other
circumstances, depending upon the relative negotiating strength of the parties, prior stockholders may retain substantially less
than 20% of the total issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity. This could result in substantial additional dilution
to the equity of those who were stockholders of the Company prior to such reorganization.
 


 3 
 
 
The
stockholders of the Company will likely not have control of a majority of the voting securities of the Company following a reorganization
transaction. As part of such a transaction, all or a majority of the Company’s directors may resign and one or more new
directors may be appointed without any vote by stockholders.
 
In
the case of an acquisition, the transaction may be accomplished upon the sole determination of management without any vote or
approval by stockholders. In the case of a statutory merger or consolidation directly involving the Company, it will likely be
necessary to call a stockholders’ meeting and obtain the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding securities.
The necessity to obtain such stockholder approval may result in delay and additional expense in the consummation of any proposed
transaction and will also give rise to certain appraisal rights to dissenting stockholders. Most likely, management will seek
to structure any such transaction so as not to require stockholder approval.
 
It
is anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant
agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial
cost for accountants, attorneys and others. If a decision is made not to participate in a specific business opportunity, the costs
theretofore incurred in the related investigation might not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached for the
participation in a specific business opportunity, the failure to consummate that transaction may result in the loss to the Company
of the related costs incurred.
 
We
presently have no employees apart from our management. Our officers and directors are engaged in outside business activities and
anticipate that they will devote very limited time to our business until the acquisition of a successful business opportunity
has been identified. We expect no significant changes in the number of our employees other than such changes, if any, incident
to a business combination.

Common
Stock
 
Our
Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $.0001 per share (the

Dividend
Policy
 
The
Company has not declared or paid any cash dividends on its common stock and does not intend to declare or pay any cash dividend
in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends, if any, is within the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend

Item
6. Selected Financial Data.
 
As
a “smaller reporting company” as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide this
information.
 
Item
7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
 
The
Company was organized as a vehicle to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business seeking
the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation. Our principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond
such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate, short-term
earnings. The Company will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical
location and, thus, may acquire any type of business.
 


 5 
 
 
The
Company currently does not engage in any business activities that provide cash flow.  During the next twelve months
we anticipate incurring costs related to:
 


(i)
filing
  Exchange Act reports, and

 


(ii)
investigating,
  analyzing and consummating an acquisition.

 
We
believe we will be able to meet these costs through use of funds in our treasury, through deferral of fees by certain service
providers and additional amounts, as necessary, to be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders, management or other investors.
As of the date of the period covered by this report, the Company has $5,060 in cash. There are no assurances that the Company
will be able to secure any additional funding as needed. Currently, however our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent
upon our ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and
repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Our ability to continue as a going concern is
also dependent on our ability to find a suitable target company and enter into a possible reverse merger with such company. Management’s
plan includes obtaining additional funds by equity financing through a reverse merger transaction and/or related party advances,
however there is no assurance of additional funding being available.
 
The
Company may consider acquiring a business which has recently commenced operations, is a developing company in need of additional
funds for expansion into new products or markets, is seeking to develop a new product or service, or is an established business
which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital. In the alternative, a business
combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which
desires to establish a public trading market for its shares while avoiding, among other things, the time delays, significant expense,
and loss of voting control which may occur in a public offering.
 
Our
management has not had any contact or discussions with representatives of other entities regarding a business combination with
us. Any target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development
or growth, including entities without established records of sales or earnings. In that event, we will be subject to numerous
risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies.
In addition, we may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk, and, although
our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, there can be no assurance that we
will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks. Our management anticipates that it will likely be able to effect only
one business combination, due primarily to our limited financing and the dilution of interest for present and prospective stockholders,
which is likely to occur as a result of our management’s plan to offer a controlling interest to a target business in order
to achieve a tax-free reorganization. This lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk in investing in us,
because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another.
 
The
Company anticipates that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky. Through information received
from industry professionals and publications such as the Reverse Merger Report, our management believes that there are numerous
firms seeking the perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation. Such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly
traded corporation include, among other things, facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be
obtained, providing liquidity for the principals of and investors in a business, creating a means for providing incentive stock
options or similar benefits to key employees, and offering greater flexibility in structuring acquisitions, joint ventures and
the like through the issuance of stock. Potentially available business combinations may occur in many different industries and
at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities
extremely difficult and complex.
  
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
 
As
of December 31, 2016, the Company had total assets equal to $5,060 comprised of cash and cash equivalents.  This compares
with assets equal to $7,427, comprised of cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2015.  As of December 31, 2016,
the Company’s liabilities totaled $225,795, comprised of accounts payable, accrued interest, accrued expenses and notes
payable to stockholders. This compares with total liabilities of $196,910, comprised of accounts payable, accrued interest, accrued
expenses and notes payable to stockholders, as of December 31, 2015. The Company can provide no assurance that it
can continue to satisfy its cash requirements for at least the next twelve months.

The
following is a summary of the Company’s cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities
for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:
 


  
Fiscal Year 
Ended 
December 31, 
2016  
Fiscal Year

Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities 
 22,500  
 25,000 

Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents 
$(2,367) 
$4,433 

 
The
Company has nominal assets and has generated no revenues since inception. The Company is also dependent upon the receipt of capital
investment or other financing to fund its ongoing operations and to execute its business plan of seeking a combination with a
private operating company. In addition, the Company is dependent upon certain related parties to provide continued funding and
capital resources. If continued funding and capital resources are unavailable at reasonable terms, the Company may not be able
to implement its plan of operations.
 
Results
of Operations
 
The
Company has not conducted any active operations since inception, except for its efforts to locate suitable acquisition candidates. No
revenue has been generated by the Company from November 16, 2007 (Inception) to December 31, 2016.  It is unlikely the
Company will have any revenues unless it is able to effect an acquisition or merger with an operating company, of which there
can be no assurance.  It is management’s assertion that these circumstances may hinder the Company’s ability
to continue as a going concern.  The Company’s plan of operation for the next twelve months shall be to continue its
efforts to locate suitable acquisition candidates. 
 
For
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, the Company had a net loss of $31,252, comprised of legal, accounting, audit, and other
professional service fees incurred in relation to the preparation and filing of the Company’s periodic reports and general,
administrative, and interest expenses.
 
For
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, the Company had a net loss of $32,109, consisting of legal, accounting, audit, and other
professional service fees incurred in relation to the preparation and filing of the Company’s periodic reports and general,
administrative, and interest expenses.
 
Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements
 
The
Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect
on the Company’s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity,
capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.

conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform our audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. The company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control
over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
of the company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining,
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Zeta
Acquisition Corp. I, as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two
years ended December 31, 2016, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Nature
  of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies

 
Nature
of Operations
 
Zeta
Acquisition Corp. I (the "Company") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 16, 2007. The
Company was organized as a vehicle to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business seeking
the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation. The Company's principal business objective for the next twelve
(12) months and beyond will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business. The Company will not
restrict its potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire
any type of business.
 
Liquidity
 
Since
its inception, the Company has generated no revenues and has incurred a net loss of $270,735. Since inception, the Company has
been dependent upon the receipt of capital investment or other financing to fund its continuing activities. The Company has not
identified any business combination and therefore, cannot ascertain with any degree of certainty the capital requirements for
any particular transaction. In addition, the Company is dependent upon certain related parties to provide continued funding and
capital resources but it is uncertain whether this funding will continue. The accompanying financial statements have been presented
on the basis of the continuation of the Company as a going concern and do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability
and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the
Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
 
Use
of Estimates
 
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
Cash
and Cash Equivalents
 
For
purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three (3) months
or less to be cash equivalents.

Nature
  of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

 
Income
Taxes
 
The
Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, which requires the recognition of deferred
tax liabilities and assets at currently enacted tax rates for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included
in the financial statements or tax returns. A valuation allowance is recognized to reduce the net deferred tax asset to an amount
that is more likely than not to be realized. 
 
Fair
Value of Financial Instruments
 
Pursuant
to ASC Topic 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, the Company is required to estimate the fair value of all
financial instruments included on its balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. The Company considers the carrying value
of cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable, accrued expenses, accrued interest, and notes payable to stockholders to approximate
fair value due to their short maturities.
 
Net
Loss Per Share
 
Basic
loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. The
Company currently has no dilutive securities and as such, basic and diluted loss per share are the same for all periods presented.
 
Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements
 
On
January 1, 2015, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board, (“FASB”), Accounting Standards Update,
(“ASU”), No. 2014-10, which eliminates the concept of a development stage entity, (“DSE”), in its entirety
from United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, (“U.S. GAAP”). In accordance with ASU No. 2014-10, the
Company has removed labeling the financial statements as a DSE and has eliminated inception-to-date information in the financial
statements.
 
In
August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40) "Disclosure
of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern." The objective of the guidance is to require management
to explicitly assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain
circumstances. In connection with each annual and interim period, management will assess if there is substantial doubt about an
entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the issuance date of an entity's financial statements. The
new standard defines substantial doubt and provides examples of indicators thereof. The definition of substantial doubt incorporates
a likelihood threshold of "probable" similar to the current use of that term in U.S. GAAP for loss contingencies. The
new standard will be effective for all entities in the first annual period ending after December 15, 2015. Earlier application
is permitted. The Company has adopted this standard.
 


 
2.
Notes
  Payable, Stockholders

 
During
2016, various stockholders loaned the Company $22,500 and were issued unsecured promissory notes which bear interest of 6% and
are due on demand. During 2015 stockholders loaned the company $35,000, along with note reductions of $10,000. Similar stockholder
loans amounted to $15,000 during 2014, $25,000 during 2013, $25,000 during 2012, $35,000 during 2010, and $25,000 during 2009.
Interest of $42,145 and $32,410 was accrued and unpaid at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

as may be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors.

Common
  Stock

 
The
Company is authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of common stock with such designations, voting and other rights and preferences
as may be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors. During December 2007, the Company issued 5,000,000 shares of
its common stock pursuant to a private placement for $50,000.  
 


 
5.
Income
  Taxes

 
The
Company has reviewed its tax positions as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and has not identified any positions that are uncertain.
Income tax returns filed and to be filed for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015, and 2016 are open to review by the Internal
Revenue Service.
 
The
tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the Company's net deferred tax asset at December
31, 2016 and 2015 are as follows:

 (81,400)

Net deferred tax asset recognized 
$--  
$-- 

 
A
full valuation allowance has been recorded against the Company's deferred tax asset because, based on the weight of available
evidence, it is more likely than not that such benefits will not be realized. As of December 31, 2016, the Company has a net operating
loss carryforward for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately $42,100. The net operating loss carryforward will
begin to expire in 2029.
 
The
benefit from income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the United States (US) federal income tax rate of thirty-four
percent (34%) in 2016 and 2015 to loss before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 as follows:

Item
9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.
 
There
are not and have not been any disagreements between the Company and its accountants on any matter of accounting principles, practices
or financial statement disclosure.
 
Item
9A. Controls and Procedures.
 
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
 
The
Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms.  Disclosure controls and procedures
include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer
in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management,
including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar
functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
 
In
accordance with Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15, an evaluation was completed under the supervision and with the participation
of the Company’s management, including the Company’s President and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of
the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this
Annual Report.  Based on that evaluation, the Company’s management including the President and Chief Financial
Officer, concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual
Report on Form 10-K, were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s
reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act was recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified
in the Commission’s rules and forms.
 
Evaluation
of Internal Controls and Procedures
 
Our
management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s
internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
 
Our
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
 


 
●
Pertain
  to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
  of the assets of the Company;

 
 
 

 
●
Provide
  reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
  with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with
  authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and 

 


 
●
Provide
  reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets
  that could have a material effect on financial statements.

 
As
of December 31, 2016, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based
on the framework in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting
was effective as of December 31, 2016.
 
This
Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding our internal
controls over financial reporting.  Management’s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public
accounting firm pursuant to Section 404(c) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act that permit us to provide only management’s report
in this annual report.
 
Changes
in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting
 
There
have been no significant changes to the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during our last
fiscal quarter of the year ended December 31, 2016, that materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal controls over financial reporting.

Compliance
with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
 
Section 16(a)
of the Exchange Act requires the Company’s directors and officers, and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of a registered
class of the Company’s equity securities, to file reports of beneficial ownership and changes in beneficial ownership of
the Company’s securities with the SEC on Forms 3, 4 and 5. Officers, directors and greater than 10% stockholders are required
by SEC regulation to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.
 
Based
solely on the Company’s review of the copies of the forms received by it during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016
and written representations that no other reports were required, the Company believes that no person who, at any time during such
fiscal year, was a director, officer or beneficial owner of more than 10% of the Company’s common stock failed to comply
with all Section 16(a) filing requirements during such fiscal years.
 
Code
of Ethics
 
We
have not adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer,
principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions in that our officers and directors serve in
these capacities.
 
Nominating
Committee
 
We
have not adopted any procedures by which security holders may recommend nominees to our Board of Directors.
  
Audit
and Compensation Committee
 
The
Board of Directors acts as the audit committee. The Company does not have a qualified financial expert at this time because it
has not been able to hire a qualified candidate. Further, the Company believes that it has inadequate financial resources at this
time to hire such an expert.  The Company intends to continue to search for a qualified individual for hire.
 
Item
11. Executive Compensation.
 
The
following table sets forth the cash and other compensation paid by the Company to its officers and directors during the fiscal

The
following compensation discussion addresses all compensation awarded to, earned by, or paid to the Company’s officers and
directors. The Company’s officers and directors have not received any cash or other compensation since inception. They will
not receive any compensation until the consummation of an acquisition. No compensation of any nature has been paid for on account
of services rendered by the officers and directors in such capacity. Our officers and directors intend to devote very limited
time to our affairs.
 
It
is possible that, after the Company successfully consummates a business combination with an unaffiliated entity, that entity may
desire to employ or retain our management for the purposes of providing services to the surviving entity.
 
No
retirement, pension, profit sharing, stock option or insurance programs or other similar programs have been adopted by the Company
for the benefit of its employees.
 
There

	ZETA ACQUISITION CORP. I




	(A Development Stage Company)









	Notes to Condensed Financial Statements




	(Unaudited)




	June 30, 2013











	1.  






	Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies











	Nature of Operations







	Zeta Acquisition Corp. I (the "Company") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 16, 2007.  The Company is a new enterprise in the development stage as defined by Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 915,

	Development Stage Entities

	.  The Company was organized as a vehicle to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation.  The Company's principal business objective for the next twelve (12) months and beyond will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business.  The Company will not restrict its potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business.







	Liquidity







	Since its inception, the Company has generated no revenues and has incurred a net loss of $160,686.  Since inception, the Company has been dependent upon the receipt of capital investment or other financing to fund its continuing activities.  The Company has not identified any business combination and therefore, cannot ascertain with any degree of certainty the capital requirements for any particular transaction.  In addition, the Company is dependent upon certain related parties to provide continued funding and capital resources.  The accompanying financial statements have been presented on the basis of the continuation of the Company as a going concern and do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.







	Use of Estimates







	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.







	Cash and Cash Equivalents







	For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three (3) months or less to be cash equivalents.

	Notes to Condensed Financial Statements (continued)




	(Unaudited)











	1.  






	Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies (continued)











	Income Taxes







	The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740,

	Income Taxes

	, which requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets at currently enacted tax rates for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns.  A valuation allowance is recognized to reduce the net deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized.







	Fair Value of Financial Instruments







	Pursuant to ASC Topic 820-10,

	Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

	, the Company is required to estimate the fair value of all financial instruments included on its balance sheet as of June 30, 2013.  The Company considers the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable, accrued interest, accrued expenses, and notes payable to stockholders to approximate fair value due to their short maturity.







	Net Loss Per Share







	Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period.  The Company currently has no dilutive securities and as such, basic and diluted loss per share are the same for all periods presented.







	Interim Financial Statements







	The unaudited interim financial information included in this report reflects normal recurring adjustments that management believes are necessary for a fair statement of the results of operations, financial position, and cash flows for the periods presented.  This interim information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes contained in the Company′s Form 10-K filed March 28, 2013.







	The results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for other interim periods or the full year.







	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements







	Management does not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or cash flow.

	2.  






	Notes Payable, Stockholders











	During 2013, various stockholders loaned the Company $25,000 and were issued unsecured promissory notes which bear interest at 6% and are due on demand.  Similar stockholder loans amounted to $25,000 during 2012, $35,000 during 2010, and $25,000 during 2009.  Interest of $13,912 was accrued and unpaid at June 30, 2013.







	During 2007, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note to a stockholder and officer of the Company in the amount of $10,000.  The note was non-interest bearing and was repaid from the proceeds of the sale of common stock.











	3.  






	Preferred Stock











	The Company is authorized to issue 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock with such designations, voting and other rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors.











	4.  






	Common Stock











	The Company is authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of common stock with such designations, voting and other rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors.  During December 2007, the Company issued 5,000,000 shares of its common stock pursuant to a private placement for $50,000.











	5.  






	Income Taxes











	The Company has approximately $54,600 in gross deferred tax assets at June 30, 2013 resulting from capitalized start-up costs and net operating losses.  A valuation allowance has been recorded to fully offset these deferred tax assets as the future realization of the related income tax benefit is uncertain.














	6.  






	Commitment











	The Company utilizes the office space and equipment of an officer and director at no cost on a month-to-month basis.  Management estimates such amounts to be de minimis.

	Forward Looking Statement Notice







	Certain statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are “forward-looking statements” (within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) in regard to the plans and objectives of management for future operations. Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements of Zeta Acquisition Corp. I (“we”, “us”, “our” or the “Company”) to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements included herein are based on current expectations that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. The Company's plans and objectives are based, in part, on assumptions involving the continued expansion of business. Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond the control of the Company. Although the Company believes its assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could prove inaccurate and, therefore, there can be no assurance the forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report will prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any other person that the objectives and plans of the Company will be achieved.







	Description of Business







	The Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware on November 16, 2007 (Inception) and maintains its principal executive office at 666 Walnut Street, Suite 2116, Des Moines, Iowa 50309. Since inception, the Company has been engaged in organizational efforts and obtaining initial financing. The Company was formed as a vehicle to pursue a business combination through the acquisition of, or merger with, an operating business. The Company filed a registration statement on Form 10-SB with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 1, 2008, and since its effectiveness, the Company has focused its efforts to identify a possible business combination.







	The Company, based on proposed business activities, is a “blank check” company. The SEC defines those companies as "any development stage company that is issuing a penny stock, within the meaning of Section 3(a)(51) of the Securities Exchange Act 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and that has no specific business plan or purpose, or has indicated that its business plan is to merge with an unidentified company or companies." Many states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of "blank check" companies in their respective jurisdictions. The Company is also a “shell company,” defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act as a company with no or nominal assets (other than cash) and no or nominal operations. Management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in our securities, either debt or equity, until we have successfully concluded a business combination. The Company intends to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for so long as we are subject to those requirements.









	In addition, the Company is an “emerging growth company”, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (“JOBS Act”), and may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and exemptions from the requirements of Sections 14A(a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to hold a nonbinding advisory vote of shareholders on executive compensation and any golden parachute payments not previously approved.





	 




	The Company has also elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act. This election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.

	We will remain an “emerging growth company” until the earliest of (1) the last day of the fiscal year during which our revenues exceed $1 billion, (2) the date on which we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three year period, (3) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement filed pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (4) when the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of 

	the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter. To the extent that we continue to qualify as a “smaller reporting company”, as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, after we cease to qualify as an emerging growth company, certain of the exemptions available to us as an emerging growth company may continue to be available to us as a smaller reporting company, including: (1) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act; (2) scaled executive compensation disclosures; and (3) the requirement to provide only two years of audited financial statements, instead of three years.








	The Company was organized as a vehicle to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation. The Company’s principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with an operating business. The Company will not restrict its potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business.



	 



	The Company currently does not engage in any business activities that provide cash flow.  During the next twelve months we anticipate incurring costs related to:







	(i)       filing Exchange Act reports, and






	(ii)      investigating, analyzing and consummating an acquisition.



	 



	We believe we will be able to meet these costs through use of funds in our treasury, through deferral of fees by certain service providers and additional amounts, as necessary, to be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders, management or other investors. As of the date of the period covered by this report, the Company has $16,151 in cash. There are no assurances that the Company will be able to secure any additional funding as needed.  

	Currently, however, our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Our ability to continue as a going concern is also dependent on our ability to find a suitable target Company and enter into a possible reverse merger with such Company. Management’s plan includes obtaining additional funds by equity financing through a reverse merger transaction and/or related party advances, however there is no assurance of additional funding being available.










	The Company may consider acquiring a business which has recently commenced operations, is a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or markets, is seeking to develop a new product or service, or is an established business which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital. In the alternative, a business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares while avoiding, among other things, the time delays, significant expense, and loss of voting control which may occur in a public offering.

	Since our Registration Statement on Form 10-SB went effective, our management has not had any contact or discussions with representatives of other entities regarding a business combination with us. Any target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or earnings. In that event, we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. In addition, we may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk, and, although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks.

	Our management anticipates that it will likely be able to effect only one business combination, due primarily to our limited financing and the dilution of interest for present and prospective stockholders, which is likely to occur as a result of our management’s plan to offer a controlling interest to a target business in order to achieve a tax-free reorganization. This lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk in investing in us, because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another.




	 





	The Company anticipates that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky. Because of general economic conditions, rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital, our management believes that there are numerous firms seeking even the perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation. Such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include, among other things, facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained, providing liquidity for the principals of and investors in a business, creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, and offering greater flexibility in structuring acquisitions, joint ventures and the like through the issuance of stock. Potentially available business combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex.







	Liquidity and Capital Resources









	As of June 30, 2013, the Company had current assets equal to $16,151, comprised exclusively of cash and cash equivalents.  This compares with current assets of $5,737

	,

	comprised of cash and cash equivalents and prepaid expenses as of December 31, 2012.

	 

	The Company’s current liabilities as of June 30, 2013 totaled $126,837, comprised of accounts payable, accrued interest, accrued expenses and notes payable to stockholders.  This compares with liabilities of $103,712,

	 

	comprised of accounts payable, accrued interest, accrued expenses and notes payable to stockholders, as of December 31, 2012.

	 

	The Company can provide no assurance that it can continue to satisfy its cash requirements for at least the next twelve months.









	The following is a summary of the Company's cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 and for the cumulative period from November 16, 2007 (Inception) to June 30, 2013:

	The Company has nominal assets and has generated no revenues since inception. The Company is also dependent upon the receipt of capital investment or other financing to fund its ongoing operations and to execute its business plan of seeking a combination with a private operating company. In addition, the Company is dependent upon certain related parties to provide continued funding and capital resources. If continued funding and capital resources are unavailable at reasonable terms, the Company may not be able to implement its plan of operations.

	Results of Operations







	The Company has not conducted any active operations since inception, except for its efforts to locate suitable acquisition candidates. No revenue has been generated by the Company from November 16, 2007 (Inception) though June 30, 2013. It is unlikely the Company will have any revenues unless it is able to effect an acquisition or merger with an operating company, of which there can be no assurance.  It is management's assertion that these circumstances may hinder the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  The Company’s plan of operation for the next twelve months shall be to continue its efforts to locate suitable acquisition candidates. 







	For the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, the Company had a net loss of $6,749 and $12,711, respectively, consisting of interest expense and legal, accounting, audit, and other professional service fees incurred in relation to the preparation and filing of the Company’s periodic reports.  This compares with a net loss of $6,314 and $11,662 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012, respectively, consisting of interest expense, and legal, accounting, audit, and other professional service fees incurred in relation to the preparation and filing of the Company’s periodic reports.







	For the period from November 16, 2007 (Inception) to June 30, 2013, the Company had a net loss of $160,686 comprised exclusively of interest expense and legal, accounting, audit, and other professional service fees incurred in relation to the formation of the Company, the filing of the Company’s Registration Statement on Form 10-SB in February of 2008, and the filing of the Company’s periodic reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K.







	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements









	The Company does not have any

	off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company’s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.

	Subject to the terms and conditions of this Note, and for good and valuable consideration the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged,
