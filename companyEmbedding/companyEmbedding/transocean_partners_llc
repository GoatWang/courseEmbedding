Should You Buy Transocean Ltd. Or Transocean Partners LLC? - Transocean Ltd. (NYSE:RIG) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGOÂ»Should You Buy Transocean Ltd. Or Transocean Partners LLC?Sep.12.14 | About: Transocean Ltd. (RIG) Rupert Hargreaves Long only, value, contrarian, Deep ValueA Pauper in the Midst of WealthSummaryTransocean Partners is an attractive proposition.The partnership has a simple structure, and the dividend is covered.The partnership will grow at the expense of the parent.Which is the better investment, Transocean (NYSE:RIG) or its new master limited partnership, Transocean Partners LLC (NYSE:RIGP).
There are three key points that make the partnership a more attractive investment proposition than its larger parent.
Earnings Strength
Probably one of the most attractive qualities about Transocean Partners is the simplicity of the partnership's rig fleet. As found within its prospectus, on page 2, this table shows the partnership's current fleet, the ownership percentage and period contracted out.

Contract expirations are staggered over the next six years. So, if management can find new customers, there should be almost no disruption in income through to 2020. Even then, the staggered nature of the contracts should mean that the partnership's income continues to flow. For this reason, it seems reasonable to suggest that Transocean Partners' income will stay relatively stable over the next few years.
What's more, with only three drilling units in the fleet, the partnership's partners/investors are able to keep an eye on what the fleet is doing and how it's acting. The parent, Transocean, is much more difficult to keep tabs on.
For most investors, myself included, simplicity is often best, and Transocean Partners' fleet is simple and easy to understand. In comparison, here's an overview of Transocean's fleet.

Transocean's large, varied fleet gives the company an edge over its peers, but you really need to understand the dynamics of the rig market to understand the company and its direction. There is reason to suggest that Transocean's earnings will be highly volatile over the next few years as the rig market goes through a period of change. Seadrill's view on the industry.
Room to grow
My own portfolio is mostly made up of small-caps, not because of their potential for growth, but for their simplicity. Small-caps, compared to many multi-billion dollar companies, are easy to understand, balance sheets are less complex, management teams are relatively easy to keep an eye on and products can be understood -- of course, there is more risk.
Transocean Partners is a simple company; three drilling units is not hard to understand, and all three are contracted out for the next few years, removing much of the risk currently associated with the offshore drilling market.
What's more, the partnership's income will be stable, contract day rates are locked in and potential for growth is already well-documented. On page 3 of the partnership's prospectus, the following information can be found:
"Under an omnibus agreement to be entered into on or before the closing of this offering, Transocean will grant us a right of first offer for its remaining ownership interests in each of the RigCos should Transocean decide to sell such interests. Transocean also will be required to offer us the opportunity to purchase not less than a 51 percent interest in four of the six drillships listed below within the five years following the closing of this offering at a purchase price equal to the greater of the fair market value (taking into account the anticipated cash flows under the associated drilling contracts) or the all-in construction cost, plus transaction costs. Transocean will select which of these rigs it will offer to us, the timing of the offers and whether it will offer us the opportunity to purchase a greater than 51 percent interest in any offered rig."

These rigs are as follows:

So, in addition to the partnership's existing fleet of three contracted units, an additional six unit interests are available to the partnership through to mid-2017. These six interests are already contracted, for the most part, through to the mid-2020s. While Transocean itself does have the ability to keep these units, as covered below, it's likely that the company will drop the units down [to Transocean Partners] in order to free up cash for the dividend distribution or to pay down debt.
Whatever the case, the partnership's unitholders are set to benefit, as the distribution is bound to grow as these units are delivered.
Unfortunately, if Transocean does drop down its newer drilling units into the partnership to free up cash, the parent will have trouble growing. Indeed, as I have covered in depth here, Transocean is going to struggle to grow over the next few years as the company's old, low-spec fleet struggles in a hostile market environment. The article linked above gives a much more detailed overview of the market, which I encourage you to read if you haven't already.
Dependable dividends
Transocean Partners intends to pay quarterly distributions of $0.3625 per common unit, or $1.45 per unit on an annualized basis. This is covered on page 12 of the partnership's prospectus, and works out as a gross distribution of 5.21% at current levels. While this yield is less than the yield being offered by Transocean's shares, (7.98%), the payout does look to be more secure, with better long-term growth prospects.
Within Transocean Partners' prospectus, the partnership states, on page 20 (and page 61), that its distribution ($1.45 annualized) will work out at around $100 million per year, $25 million per quarter paid from "available cash". The partnership actually sets out how much cash it will have available for distribution on page 64 of the prospectus. Management sets out distribution figures over a three-year period.

Year ended December 31, 2013, the partnership had $173 million available for distribution, covering the estimated distributions 1.7x. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2014, just before listing, the partnership had $204 million available for distribution, and for the forecasted twelve months ending September 30, 2015, the company will have $110 million for distribution, covering the distributions 1.1x. Cash available for distribution should increase as the partnership acquires more drilling units from the parent.
So the dividend of Transocean Partners looks to be relatively secure, with room for growth over the long term. However, Transocean's dividend payout, which is currently equal to a yield of just over 8%, looks to be under threat. According to analysts at UBS:
"... our current estimates the company will need to tap into the full $3 bil revolver in 2015-2016 and will still be drawing down cash. In 2015, we believe Transocean will have to make the decision to either reduce the dividend or increase its debt. Our earnings forecasts are not worst case scenario and assume most of the currently idle rigs return to work in 2015 and that the currently stacked rigs remain stacked... we believe dayrate pressure will persist given limited rig tenders (demand) and fierce competition, with dayrates already down 25%-40% from peak levels. Regular dropdown proceeds from the MLP should help bolster Transocean's FCF; however it will not be enough, in our view..."
Of course, this is the view from only one set of analysts, and Transocean does have the drop-down option to increase cash. When Transocean Partners take on new units from the parent, Transocean will receive a cash infusion, with which it will be able to bulk up the dividend payout.
Once again, Transocean is at the mercy of falling day rates; if the rates remain buoyant, then the payout is safe. If rates fall, as expected, then the sustainability of the payout will be called into question. Of course, this is only the view from one set of analysts. Management was actually quizzed on the sustainability of the dividend payout on the Q2 call.


Analyst: "... this is a tough question, but I would really appreciate a thoughtful answer... if you had to choose between an investment grade rating and maintaining your current dividend, what do you think is more important to you and the Board?"
Steven Newman - President and CEO: "... the decision is never that simple... the Company has to pull, before we start thinking about pulling the dividend lever. So we will continue evaluate the Company's ongoing investment in new build drilling rigs... We will evaluate the strength and quality of our balance sheet and the opportunities is available to us... we'll ask the board to engage in a thoughtful review over the coming months and in anticipation of the May 2015 Annual General Meeting make a decision on the dividend... we are committed to maintaining a competitive and sustainable dividend..."

So, Transocean is likely to consider a payout cut if things are not going to plan. As of yet, the payout seems secure, but Transocean Partners' payout seems to have better long-term outlook.
The bottom line
All in all, when choosing the between Transocean and its partnership, it appears as if the partnership is the better opportunity. Transocean Partners is able to cover its payout, and income is, to a certain extent, locked in over the next few years. What's more, as Transocean drops down rigs to free up cash for itself, the partnership's income and distribution should only grow.

Transocean Ltd. Increases Consideration for Acquisition of Transocean Partners LLC
November 21, 2016
 Exchange ratio increased to 1.20 shares of Transocean per Transocean Partners common unit in the all equity transaction  Zug, Switzerland /Â  London - November 21, 2016 - Transocean Ltd. (NYSE: RIG) and Transocean Partners LLC (NYSE: RIGP) today announced that Transocean has agreed to increase to 1.20 Transocean shares (from 1.1427 Transocean shares) the consideration for its pending acquisition of each outstanding common unit of Transocean Partners not already owned by Transocean in a share-for-unit merger transaction.Â  Transocean expects to issue approximately 23.8 million shares in the merger.  The transaction is subject to the approval of the holders of Transocean Partners' common units pursuant to its limited liability company agreement. As Transocean has already committed to voting its approximately 21.3 million common units in favor of the merger, a vote in favor of the merger by approximately 9.9 million (or approximately 50.1%) of the approximately 19.7 million common units not held by Transocean will be required to approve the merger. Subject to customary approvals and conditions, including receipt of approval from Transocean Partners common unitholders, the transaction is expected to close in early December 2016.  The Transocean Partners special meeting, which has been adjourned, reconvenes on Tuesday, December 6, 2016, at 3:00 p.m. local time at Transocean Partners' offices at 40 George Street, 4th Floor, London, England W1U 7DW, United Kingdom.  The increase in consideration was approved on behalf of Transocean Partners by the Conflicts Committee of its Board of Directors, which is comprised of the members of its Board of Directors who are independent and unaffiliated with Transocean.  The Board of Directors of Transocean Partners and the Conflicts Committee of Transocean Partners have each recommended that Transocean Partners' common unitholders vote "FOR" the proposal to approve the amended merger agreement providing for the increased consideration and the merger.  Unitholders who need assistance in voting their Transocean Partners' common units, or who have questions, are encouraged to contact the company's proxy solicitor, Innisfree M&A Incorporated, at (888) 750-5834 from U.S. and Canada or (412) 232-3651 from other countries.

In this series, we look through the most recent Dividend Channel ''DividendRank'' report, and then we cherry pick only those companies that have experienced insider buying within the past six months. The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money â maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both.

Transocean will maintain the remaining 49 percent, non-controlling interest.Relationship With TransoceanTransocean Ltd is an international offshore oil and gas well driller, operating or holding interest in 77 rigs. Transoceanâs size and international exposure provides strength to Transocean Partners. According to a recent S-1 filing, the company believes the relationship will âprovide us with access to leading international energy companies, as well as suppliers."âTransoceanâs operational and managerial expertise will enable us to compete more effectively for contract opportunities,â it continues.Related: Advanced Drainage Systems Looks To Overcome Uneven FinancialsThe relationship also grants Transocean Partners first rights to buy Transoceanâs stake in its rigs should it decide to divest. Transocean Partners will also have the right to buy at least 51 percent interest in six deep-sea drilling rigs currently under construction. Transocean will pick when and what rigs will be for sale; however, the offering must occur within five years of Transocean Partners' IPO.The BusinessTransocean Partners' business objective is to generate a consistent cash flow through operation of its fleet of rigs. To accomplish this task, the company intends to acquire stable, safe oil-producing rigs that will support its intention of growing its quarterly cash dividend for investors.Â Currently, the company believes it is in a position to be able to meet its stated objective by maintaining long-term contracts with customers. The current average contract term is 4.1 years.Â  According to its S-1 filing, the company âbelieves these agreements will enhance cash flow dependability and predictability, providing us with the financial stability we needs to make cash distributions.âUpon closing its IPO, the company will be financially flexible to work out future acquisitions and will have the means to do so. A $300 million undrawn revolver will be available for use in executing its acquisition and expansion plans.Transocean Partners is currently well capitalized. Over the preceding two years, net income has been positive, earning $255 million in 2012 and $189 million in 2013. The decline is most likely because of a temporary decline in revenue efficiency during 2013.Â As of March 31, 2014, the company is operating at a level not previously seen, with 100 percent of rigs operating at a 98 percent revenue efficiency.Â Deal ReviewTransocean Partners will be issuing its $350 million IPO through Morgan Stanley and Barclays. According to its S-1 filing, it will offer 17.5 million shares between $19 and $21 per share.Disclosure: At the time of this writing, the author holds not positions in the mentioned securities.See more from BenzingaAdvanced Drainage Systems Looks To Overcome Uneven FinancialsIPO Lookout: Lots of Action This Week, But Is Anything A Worthwhile Investment?How Did Investors Beat The Market On Friday?Â© 2014 Benzinga.com.

The offshore drilling market is highly competitive with numerous industry
participants, none of which has a dominant market share. Drilling contracts are
generally awarded through competitive bidding processes, where our customers and
potential customersâ main considerations are price, quality and technical
capability of services and equipment. Industry supply and demand economics play
an important role in the contractual terms, including the dayrates, we and our
customers ultimately agree to. As a result of these economic forces, in general,
and the increased number of newbuild units entering the drilling market,
specifically, our ability to obtain future drilling contracts, if at all, may be
subject to increased competition and impact our dayrates and utilization rates.

In recent years, oil companies have placed increased emphasis on exploring for
hydrocarbons in deeper waters. This deepwater focus is due, in part, to
technological developments that have made such exploration more feasible and
cost effective. Therefore, water depth capability is a key component in
determining rig suitability for a particular drilling project. We believe that
our fleet of recently constructed high-specification drilling rigs provides us
with a competitive advantage over competitors with older fleets.


Company Description
We are a growth-oriented limited liability company recently formed by
Transocean, one of the worldâs largest offshore drilling contractors, to own,
operate and acquire modern, technologically advanced offshore drilling rigs. Our
initial assets consist of 51 percent interests in the RigCos that own


 and
operate three ultra-deepwater drilling rigs that are currently operating in the
U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Transocean owns the remaining 49 percent noncontrolling
interest in each of the RigCos. We generate revenue through contract drilling
services, which involves contracting our mobile offshore drilling fleet, related
equipment and work crews on a dayrate basis to large international energy
companies to drill oil and gas wells.

Our drilling rigs currently operate under long-term contracts with Chevron and
BP, two leading international energy companies, with an average remaining
contract term of approximately 4.1 years as of July 7, 2014. We believe that our
drilling contracts will generate stable and reliable cash flows over their term.
We intend to use the relationships and expertise of Transocean to re-contract
our fleet when the existing contracts expire and identify opportunities to
expand our fleet through acquisitions.

The following table provides information about the rigs in our initial fleet:

(1)Contract start and completion dates are estimated. Contracts could be longer 
   in duration because of a provision that allows the customer to finish 
   drilling a well-in-progress and due to other factors not under our control. 
   New contracts do not commence until the prior contract has been completed.  

(2)Represents the maximum contractual operating dayrate (which could change 
   in the future due to cost escalations), but excludes amortization of drilling 
   contract intangible revenues and certain cash and non-cash pre-operating 
   revenues that terminate at the end of the rigsâ current contracts. 

   The average dayrate actually earned over the term of the contract will 
   reflect various reduced rates received under the contract as a result of 
   time billed according to standby rates, waiting-on-weather rates, maintenance 
   rates or any other similar rates, which are typically less than the contract 
   dayrate. In addition, the amount shown does not reflect incentive programs, 
   which are typically based on the rigâs operating performance against a 
   performance curve. For the three months ended March 31, 2014, average daily 
   revenue was $533,200, $579,700 and $467,200 for Discoverer Inspiration , 
   Discoverer Clear Leader and Development Driller III , respectively, and 
   the revenue efficiency of the rigs in our initial fleet was 98 percent. 
   For the year ended December 31, 2013, average daily revenue was $500,700, 
   $450,500 and $416,100 for Discoverer Inspiration , Discoverer Clear Leader 
   and Development Driller III , respectively, and the revenue efficiency of 
   the rigs in our initial fleet was 86 percent. 

(3)The dayrate for the remainder of the contract is linked to the standard 
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil price with a floor of $40 per barrel 
   resulting in a contract dayrate of $400,000 and a ceiling of $70 per barrel 
   resulting in a contract dayrate of $500,000, before cost escalation 
   adjustments of $50,000 per day and pre-operating revenues of $19,000 per 
   day.
