Description



Description
																Gibson Ricky Skaggs Distressed MM mandolin #5 – these are few and far between!  All documents included.  Please email for additional photos

Hand Carved Solid Red Spruce top
Hand Carved Solid Hard Eastern Flamed Maple back, sides, and neck.
Mammoth Ivory Nut
Ebony extended/Pearl Dot Fingerboard Inlay with medium fretwire
1923 Reproduction Flowerpot Headstock Inlay Distressed
Radiused Dovetail Joint
Thin “speed” neck
Tone Guard
Embroidered case cover
Limited production of 30

The result of over a year of close development with the legendary musician, this signature model mandolin is closely based on Ricky’s 1923 Lloyd Loar F-5—an instrument revered for its tone and playability. The light Cremona Sunburst finish gracefully accents the premium, red spruce top and maple back and sides. With a tap-tuned top for crisp chops and articulate lines, exquisite binding and headstock inlay, and a comfortable “speedneck” profile—an exact replica of Ricky’s F-5—the Ricky Skaggs Distressed Master Model represents the finest in quality and craftsmanship.

Paul Drinkwater/NBC



The last time Ricky Gervais hosted the Golden Globes, he offended a whole lot of people. But perhaps no dig was more discussed than his jokes about Mel Gibson. (In case your memory escapes you, let us leave you with this line: "I like a drink as much as the next man, unless the next man is Mel Gibson.")So when it came time in tonight's show to introduce the Expendables 3 actor, the entire world braced for the inevitable awkward moment. And, ever the crowd-pleaser, Gervais took a few digs indeed. "A few years ago on this show, I made a joke about Mel Gibson getting a bit drunk and saying a few unsavory things," he began. "We have all done it. I wasn't judging him. But now I find myself in the awkward position of having to introduce him again."



CLICK: Golden Globes 2016 Winners: The Complete List 






Gervais mentioned that he put the blame on NBC for the slightly undesirable matchup, and then segued into yet another...dark joke. "Mel blames—we know who Mel blames," he said cheekily.But luckily for everyone bracing for a fight, Mel took it all in good fun. He entered the stage giving a good-natured chuckle, and proceeded to play along with Ricky for a bit that can only be described as bizarre. "I love seeing Ricky once every three years because it reminds me to get a colonoscopy," ribbed Gibson, before generously offering to "put him to sleep." Ouch.Unfortunately, that was the end of what the TV audience was privy to, because the rest of their exchange was far too inappropriate for broadcast; cue the censors! But if you're looking to take it R-rated, our lip-syncing experts believe that Gervais uttered the question "What the f--k does sugar t--s even mean?" (That of course refers to Gibson's infamous insult directed at a female police officer during a 2006 DUI arrest, but we'll let you use your imagination). Oddly enough, Gibson was able to laugh it all off and go on to present his award. Whatever works, guys?

Description



Description
Gibson Ricky Skaggs Distressed MM mandolin #2 – these are few and far between!  All documents included.

Hand Carved Solid Red Spruce top
Hand Carved Solid Hard Eastern Flamed Maple back, sides, and neck.
Mammoth Ivory Nut
Ebony extended/Pearl Dot Fingerboard Inlay with medium fretwire
1923 Reproduction Flowerpot Headstock Inlay Distressed
Radiused Dovetail Joint
Thin “speed” neck
Tone Guard
Embroidered case cover
Limited production of 30

The result of over a year of close development with the legendary musician, this signature model mandolin is closely based on Ricky’s 1923 Lloyd Loar F-5—an instrument revered for its tone and playability. The light Cremona Sunburst finish gracefully accents the premium, red spruce top and maple back and sides. With a tap-tuned top for crisp chops and articulate lines, exquisite binding and headstock inlay, and a comfortable “speedneck” profile—an exact replica of Ricky’s F-5—the Ricky Skaggs Distressed Master Model represents the finest in quality and craftsmanship.
