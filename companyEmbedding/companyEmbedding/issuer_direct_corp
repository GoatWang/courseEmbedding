Meet our Senior Leadership Team































Management








Brian R. Balbirnie
President and Chief Executive Officer



Issuer Direct’s CEO, Brian Balbirnie, has his roots in Toronto and Connecticut, where, like any self-respecting youth, he despised Brussels sprouts. 
 Fast forward to 2006, when, after decades of experience in emerging industries and observing the troubling, multi-vendor disclosure process that many companies had in place, Brian founded Issuer Direct — the first regulatory self-filing platform to the SEC.  Over the years, Issuer Direct has grown to be one of the largest complete-platform plays for the public company marketplace. Along the way, it has garnered numerous awards, including being named a Deloitte Fast 500.  While his company’s growth is incredibly satisfying, one of Brian’s greatest joys is seeing his employees leverage their professional success to create and experience fulfilling personal lives. 
 When he’s not busy at the company’s helm, Brian enjoys — shhh! — quiet time to think and a darn good oatmeal raisin cookie.









Steve Knerr
Chief Financial Officer



A Garden State native, Steve Knerr headed south for college, earning a B.S. in Business Administration from the University of Richmond.  Steve joined Issuer Direct through its acquisition of Precision IR in 2013 and later became CFO.  Previously he was vice-president, assistant controller of RHI Entertainment (Sonar Entertainment), accounting manager at Chesapeake Corporation and started his career as an audit professional with KPMG. 
Steve appreciates Issuer Direct’s small-company feel and the opportunity to work across departments with talented colleagues who wear many hats to get the job done. 
When Steve’s not at work, this former University of Richmond Intramural Ping Pong Champion (Gooo, SPIDERS!) is kept spinning by his three sons under the age of 6! There’s nothing like family … and Philly cheesesteaks and soft pretzels.









Michael Colon
Vice President of Corporate Development



When he’s not fulfilling his role as Vice President of Corporate Development, Miguel “Michael” Colón is known as Professor Colón, teaching Chabot College students about the world of entrepreneurship.The San Francisco native, who holds a B.A. in management and an MBA from St. Mary’s College of California, has several successful ventures under his belt, including being the founder and CEO of SEC Compliance Services, a full-service XBRL and EDGAR provider. 
When he’s not thriving working with his people, the entrepreneurs, Michael likes to enjoy a good steak and a 21-year-old scotch, sometimes mulling over yet another role he could fulfill: playing Han Solo in a galaxy far, far away. Find that funny? Laugh it up, fuzzball!

A proud native Texan, Director of Marketing Angie Goertz shines big and bright like the stars at night in her role promoting Issuer Direct’s products and services.  Angie holds a B.S. in Advertising from the University of Texas (Hook 'em Horns) and brings years of experience in marketing strategy and the development of successful marketing campaigns and multi-touch, integrated lead-generation programs. She’s inspired daily by her creative, passionate colleagues and the empowering environment they collaborate in. 
When not busy with tweets, banners and SEO/SEM, Angie’s even busier keeping up with her three children in baseball, cheerleading, softball and volleyball. When she does kick back, it’s on the beach to a stream of ‘80s tunes. She believes her dog, Bozley Higgens, is the coolest Basset Hound ever, and that fellow Texas native Matthew McConaughey was put on this earth to act and one day make her happy — alright, alright, alright!









James Michael
Vice President of Sales, North America



It’s fitting that Vice President of Sales North America — and Issuer Direct’s favorite funnyman — James Michael was born in Canada but raised in the United States. “Northern born but Southern by the grace of God!” he shouts on occasion from his desk.  A highly experienced sales professional, James thrives on working with clients and helping them meet their vision and goals. He also finds it quite satisfying when his colleagues do the same in their personal lives: from houses and cars to bratty kids — just kidding.  
When not going full speed at work, he likes to hop on his motorcycle or spend time with his wife and daughters. Also fitting for this global, multi-tasking, hilarious VP: If he could play any movie character, it would be the multiple roles by fellow funnyman Mel Brooks in “History of the World.”









Eddie Tobler
Vice President of Stock Transfer



A North Carolina native with a bachelor’s in landscape design and an MBA, Vice President of Stock Transfer Eddie Tobler brings creative problem solving and business smarts to his role at Issuer Direct. 
Eddie has more than a decade of experience in finance, banking, back-office clearing OPS, software- and IT-surrounding banking systems, customer service with both issuers and their shareholders, annual and special meetings, and fulfillment and logistics associated with multi-faceted mailings. 
On the job, Eddie appreciates working and learning from his unique colleagues. Off the clock, he’s in the great outdoors, hunting and fishing, or contributing to charitable efforts to benefit children and education.









Kate Trimble
Director of Human Resources



As Issuer Direct’s Human Resources Manager, Kate Trimble has a certain je ne sais quoi. 
Raised in Georgia and North Carolina, Kate earned a B.A. in French and an M.A. in Teaching English as a Second Language, which she put to excellent use by teaching English to Vietnamese and Laotian refugees. She also has more than 20 years of experience working in human resources for employers great and small, profit and non-profit. And she has several years’ retail management experience, where she developed her people skills!
Kate fills her free time gardening, reading, traveling and staying away from liver and okra. She has two cats, a son and an “awful” husband who won’t let her add a dog to their family. If only she were like her favorite fictional character, Professor McGonagall, and could wave her magic wand!









John Yapundich
Director of Disclosure, Platform Sales



“D” is for Issuer Direct’s dynamic Director of Disclosure, Platform Sales, John Yapundich.  John was born and raised in Sacramento, CA, where his room and the same sailing ships wallpaper still stand today under his parents’ watchful eye. After earning a B.S. in Business Administration from Cal State, he went on to become a founding partner of EDGARfilings, Ltd. and project lead and co‐creator of EDGARizer® — SEC EDGAR conversion software and EDGARforms.com, which was successfully sold to Thompson Reuters.  
            But John hasn’t always been suit and tie. One year, he lived on St. Thomas, soaking up a minimalist island existence. Now back on the mainland, he enjoys pursuing a healthy lifestyle through outdoor recreational activities, gardening and delicious, healthy cooking.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.
