"Still funny after all these years and a great price." - By 
Michael Serrano  (Windsor, Ct USA)


While you can purchase the entire collection, this collection of 12 Roasts is a great bargain. The roasts are still funny after all these years. Plus you also get a few extras, two Dean Martin specials from the mid 70's. You also get some skits from the Dean Martin show, as well as interviews with some of the stars who were on the roasts. I remember growing up and my parents watching these shows, and I would sneak out of bed and watch from the top of the stairs, trying not to laugh out loud. While I do cringe at some of the "jokes" at the expense of Sammy Davis Jr., we all know that these stars actually were friends in real life. The entire collection sells for quite a bit more money, with many celebrities of dubious distinction. This set includes Johnny Carson, Bob Hope, Jack Benny, Jimmy Stewart, ... full review

"This is a great collection and on white" - By 
Chadladage 


This is a great collection and on white. It is clear and new... I have to warn you, when you start playing the first album you will want to start cooking, open some nice red wine and relax... invite friends and family and let them hear what real cool music is.

"Full Show--- What a show" - By 
Hatarwi 


Only complaint-- can't wait for the other shows to come out. This is a great product, well worth the price. It brings back fond memories when i was a kid watching this with my parents. He is so smooth and was truly undervalued as a performer. The guests seem to have an easy time and experience also. Just a very good product, makes you miss the good variety shows, As a kid, did not understand the "gold diggers" now, i can appreciate them more.

"Classic Fun!" - By 
Joe Bozzano 


These roasts are hilarious and not one cuss word in the series. I know its crazy to think people were able to be funny without use of the f word or explicit sexual content but there was a time...
