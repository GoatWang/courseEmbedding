Guidant offers fee-based Financial Planning services as the core of the services we provide to individuals and families seeking to build, preserve and manage wealth over time. Fee-based financial plans allow us to work in your  best interest.
We enjoy conversing with our clients. Guidant Wealth Advisors gathers relevant financial information and examines your current financial situation against your future financial goals. We develop a stratetgic plan for you to pursue your goals.
Your comprehensive financial plan will be designed to help you work toward achieving multiple financial and lifestyle goals and will address every area of your financial future.




Wealth Management

Investment Management

Advanced Retirement Planning
 





Risk Management
Protecting yourself, your loved ones or your business against unexpected events is a fundamental aspect of financial planning. Closing the gap on potential risks can be tricky without a comprehensive plan and process that methodically evaluates all potential risk factors. 
That’s why risk analysis is an integral part of our ongoing process. We continually 


identify and analyze all risk factors and


make objective and unbiased recommendations   


to provide you with the confidence you seek.
 
Tax Planning
Nearly all financial decisions have tax ramifications. Tax liabilities associated with 


income, estate, gift, state, excise, sales taxes 


can take a real toll on your wealth. Our team of experienced professionals can help coordinate the various aspects of your financial plan to maximize tax-efficient strategies in line with your overall financial goals.  




.
Insurance 
When planning for long-term healthcare needs, it’s important to keep in mind that:

Medicare is not nursing home insurance and does not cover long-term care 
Private medical insurance or Medicare supplement plans do not cover maintenance care 

Long-term care insurance can help manage healthcare costs and reduce the impact of inflation while helping to ensuring your healthcare needs, and those of loved ones, are covered well into the future. Adequate financial planning now can help prevent a lifetime of assets from falling short when you need them most.

 
Estate Planning
Preserving wealth from one generation to the next can be complex and time-consuming. Guidance from a competent, experienced advisor can go a long way toward helping make sure your financial success is shared with your family, friends and the charitable organizations you designate, according to your wishes. 
We will help you articulate your estate planning goals and we will work closely with your tax and legal advisors to help ensure your financial plan reflects your estate planning needs. Or, if you prefer, we can provide our own team of professional advisors adept at the intricacies of estate and tax planning*. Whether you use a trust or another method for accomplishing your long-term estate planning goals, we can assist you in navigating today’s complicated tax and estate laws. *Legal services are not offered by LPL Financial or Guidant Wealth Advisors.
Unique Survivorship Program

Legacy Planning

Charitable giving can provide tax benefits for you and your heirs. A full assessment of the short- and long-term tax and estate planning implications is conducted to help you pursue your wealth management objectives.





















 


Education Planning
Whether you’re paying tuition costs now or saving for a future goal, it’s important to help ensure that your education strategy is compatible with your retirement income and related financial objectives. Tax considerations and retirement income needs must be weighed and evaluated before choosing a specific strategy. It’s important to remember that while education expenses can be funded through borrowing, retirement expenses cannot. 
Since we’re an independent firm, we’re under no pressure to recommend proprietary education savings programs or investment products. Our only concern is which program best addresses your needs. The following are among the most popular education savings plans available today: 

529 Plans 
Coverdell Education Savings Accounts 
Uniform Gifts to Minors Act 
Uniform Transfers to Minors Act   

An extended team of specialistsIn addition to comprehensive financial management, clients of Guidant Wealth Advisors enjoy access to a team of outside allied professionals.* Each is a specialist in related personal financial disciplines: 



Attorneys
Bankers
Estate Planners
Tax Planners and Preparers
Insurance Experts




*Allied professionals are referrals to outside service providers that are not affiliated with, nor endorsed by, LPL Financial or Guidant Wealth Advisors.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
