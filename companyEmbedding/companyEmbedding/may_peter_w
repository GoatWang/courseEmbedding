Bridgewater, Connecticut (CT), US 


This is the Bridgewater, CT home of financier Peter W. May, known as Maywood. Peter W. May is the President and founding partner of Trian Partners, a New York-based investment management firm launched in November 2005. Mr. May also serves as Vice Chairman and a director of Trian Acquisition I Corp. (AMEX: TUX.U), a publicly traded blank check company formed to effect a business combination, and as non-executive Vice Chairman and a director of Wendy's/Arby's Group, Inc. (formerly Triarc Companies, Inc. ("Triarc")) (WEN), which is the third largest quick-service restaurant company in the United States and is the franchisor for the Wendy's® and Arby's® restaurant systems. This estate is one of the largest and most expensive in Litchfield County. Mr. May, a multimillionaire part-time resident, is the town's largest taxpayer. The home has a private golf course, wine vineyards, a tennis court, and pool, among many other amenities. Because no matter how wealthy or powerful you are, you cannot buy booze in Bridgewater. Bridgewater is the state's last dry town. 

In addition, Mr. May serves as a director and chairman of the compensation committee of Deerfield Capitol Corp. (NYSE:DFR). Mr. May served as President and Chief Operating Officer of Triarc from April 1993 through June 2007. Prior to joining Triarc, Mr. May was President and Chief Operating Officer of Trian Group, Inc., which provided investment banking and management services for entities controlled by him. Mr. May also served as President and Chief Operating Officer and a director of Triangle Industries, Inc., which, through wholly-owned subsidiaries, was, at the time, a manufacturer of packaging products (through American National Can Company), copper electrical wire and cable and steel conduit and currency and coin handling products. Mr. May is the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of The Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York, where he led the turnaround of this major academic health center from serious financial difficulties to what is today one of the most profitable and fastest growing academic medical centers in the United States. In addition, Mr. May is a Trustee of the University of Chicago, a member of its Executive Committee, and a member of the Advisory Council on the Graduate School of Business at The University of Chicago. Mr. May is also a Trustee of Carnegie Hall and a partner of the Partnership for New York City, as well as the past Chairman of the UJA Federation's "Operation Exodus" campaign and an honorary member of the Board of Trustees of The 92nd Street Y. He is a founding member of the Laura Rosenberg Memorial Foundation for Pediatric Leukemia Research and is Chairman of the Board of The Leni and Peter May Family Foundation. He was first elected a director of the Company in May 2008. He is also a Director at Tiffany & Co., where he is a Member of the Compensation Committee, Stock Option Committee, and Finance Committee.
Peter May holds AB and MBA degrees from the University of Chicago and is a Certified Public Accountant (inactive). Mr. May also holds an Honorary Doctorate in Humane Letters from The Mount Sinai School of Medicine. Key Skills: multi-divisional operations, brand management, investor relations, and finance. 

Maywood is a private estate, home to Maywood Gardens, located in the southern tip of Litchfield County, Connecticut. The home has at least 5 bedrooms, 6 bathrooms and 5,755 square feet of living space, which does not include the greenhouses, guest cottages, and apartments. Classic architecture combined with several traditional gardens grace the property and its panoramic view of the Berkshire foothills. The gardens immediately surrounding the main residence are formally structured, and lead out to more naturalized gardens and woodland trails. Various production gardens are integrated into the forty-acre landscape, providing fresh cut flowers, vegetables, and field crops which are available for sale at the Bridgewater Village Store, Bridgewater, CT. In an effort to enhance the agricultural focus of the property, a two acre vineyard was planted in 2002 and 2003, producing our first vintage of Chardonnay and Cabernet Franc in 2005. The grapes are carefully grown, handpicked, and handcrafted to deliver a superb wine. Due to local laws, Maywood is not allowed to sell their wine in the town of Bridgewater as it is the only dry town the state of Connecticut. While Maywood is a private property, and generally not open to the public, visitors are welcome each June to Maywood's Annual Garden Tour. Gregory L. Bollard is the manager of the estate.
