SunPower Corporation is an American energy company that designs and manufactures crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells and solar panels based on an all-back-contact solar cell invented at Stanford University. The company is majority owned by Total, the fourth largest publicly-listed energy company in the world and is publicly traded on the NASDAQ as SPWR.

History[edit]
SunPower was started when Richard Swanson, a professor of electrical engineering at Stanford University, was awarded grants to support his solar power explorations. With the help of these funds – as well as financial support from two venture capital firms – SunPower was officially incorporated in April 24, 1985. The original plan was to develop and market solar concentrator systems.
In 1990 the company received a research and development contract from EPRI and the US Dept. of Energy. Two years later, SunPower began shipping concentrator cells to customers. In 1995 SunPower's all-back contact solar cells powered Honda's solar car to victory in the annual Darwin to Adelaide race across Australia beating the second place winner by one full day. In 1997, the company's solar cells were used in the NASA Pathfinder high altitude aircraft.[2]
in 2002, Cypress Semiconductor invested $8 million in SunPower. The following year Tom Werner joined as CEO. In 2004, SunPower opened manufacturing facilities in the Philippines and Bavaria. The company held an IPO in 2005.
In January 2007, SunPower acquired PowerLight Corporation, a large-scale solar power systems company.[2][3] In February 2010, it acquired Europe's SunRay Renewable Energy for $277 million.[4]
In April 2011, Total S.A. agreed to buy 60% of SunPower for US$1.38 billion.[5] In December 2011, the company announced an agreement to acquire Tenesol SA.[6] In 2013 SunPower acquired Greenbotics, Inc., maker of robotic solar panel cleaning products and services for large-scale solar power plants.[7]
Cells[edit]
The company's main product is a high-efficiency solar cell, trademarked "Maxeon", the same size and shape as conventional 6-inch/160 mm single-crystal silicon cells, packaged into conventional 60-cell solar panels. The cells have a conversion efficiency of 21.5%, and each panel produces up to 345 W; typical conventional panels produce up to 250 to 270 W.[8][9]
Silicon solar cells typically consist of a thin layer of silicon chemically treated to produce an electrically active layer near the front that produces electricity when the sun shines on it. Collecting that energy is normally handled via a series of very fine wires embedded on the front. There is an inherent paradox in the wiring design; larger wires lower electrical resistance and improve energy collection but reflect light that would otherwise reach the cell and improve energy creation. The wires are normally made of silver for a variety of reasons, although less expensive copper and aluminum wiring has been attempted with no great market success. The circuit is completed by a thin layer of aluminum that is deposited on the back of the cell.
The Maxeon design starts with the same basic silicon cell, but changes the electrical connections. The silver wiring on the front is eliminated and replaced by a transparent electrode material, similar to the materials used in LCD televisions and similar devices. These electrodes have poorer electrical characteristics than silver, but by covering the entire face of the cell they improve overall performance, while eliminating light blockage. The back of the cell replaces the thin aluminum layer with a thicker copper one, which both improves electrical performance as well as offering a much more physically robust platform while eliminating corrosion that occurs in the aluminum over time.[10] On June 23, 2010, The company announced that it has produced a full-scale solar cell with a sunlight to electricity conversion efficiency of 24.2 percent, a world record confirmed by the U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL).[11]
After the cells are constructed, conventional assembly system uses a robot to place the cells into a grid of 6 columns of 10 cells - other arrangements are used, but rare outside commercial settings. As they are placed, wiring consisting of a strip of silver is woven between the cells and soldered to the connectors on the front and back. A small amount of space is required between the cells to allow the strips to pass over and under the cells. The layout takes place on top of a plastic sheet known as the backsheet, and the cells and wiring are glued to the sheet as the assembly advances. When the glue dries, the resulting laminate is ready for assembly into a panel, which consists of gluing the cell side of the laminate to a glass sheet, adding a junction box for electrical connections, and adding an aluminum frame around the outside for mechanical robustness. Different assembly systems may use different steps, but the end result is a glass sheet on top, cells and wiring in the middle, and the backsheet on the back.
The company's panels are similar in concept and layout, but include a number of additional changes to further improve the system. Instead of using silver strips to connect the cells together, which is no longer needed due to the lack of silver on the cells, its panels use a robust edge-connector that includes a built-in strain relief to reduce mechanical stress. According to the company, these changes eliminate 85% of the failures in conventional designs, which is due primarily to corrosion and electrical breaks. Only 14% of failures are due to cell or component failures.[10]
The downside to these design changes is cost, both the materials and construction methods are more expensive and drive up the price of the panels. However, the price of the panel is not the only input to a solar power system's total cost, and in recent years it accounts for much less than half of the total. In this case, using a more expensive panel can actually produce a lower overall system cost if savings can be found in installation time or there are artificial limits on system size. These are both true in the case of residential installs, where the roof defines the total size of the system that can be installed, and the cost of labor is the largest single cost of the system. Simply replacing conventional panels with SunPower panels will increase the total power of the system as much as 25% without having any effect on install times, in which case the total install cost in terms of price per watt can improve in spite of higher prices on the panels.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

SunPower Corporation is an American energy company that designs and manufactures crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells and solar panels based on an all-back-contact solar cell invented at Stanford University. The company is majority owned by Total, the fourth largest publicly-listed energy company in the world and is publicly traded on the NASDAQ as SPWR.

History[edit]
SunPower was started when Richard Swanson, a professor of electrical engineering at Stanford University, was awarded grants to support his solar power explorations. With the help of these funds – as well as financial support from two venture capital firms – SunPower was officially incorporated in April 24, 1985. The original plan was to develop and market solar concentrator systems.
In 1990 the company received a research and development contract from EPRI and the US Dept. of Energy. Two years later, SunPower began shipping concentrator cells to customers. In 1995 SunPower's all-back contact solar cells powered Honda's solar car to victory in the annual Darwin to Adelaide race across Australia beating the second place winner by one full day. In 1997, the company's solar cells were used in the NASA Pathfinder high altitude aircraft.[2]
in 2002, Cypress Semiconductor invested $8 million in SunPower. The following year Tom Werner joined as CEO. In 2004, SunPower opened manufacturing facilities in the Philippines and Bavaria. The company held an IPO in 2005.
In January 2007, SunPower acquired PowerLight Corporation, a large-scale solar power systems company.[2][3] In February 2010, it acquired Europe's SunRay Renewable Energy for $277 million.[4]
In April 2011, Total S.A. agreed to buy 60% of SunPower for US$1.38 billion.[5] In December 2011, the company announced an agreement to acquire Tenesol SA.[6] In 2013 SunPower acquired Greenbotics, Inc., maker of robotic solar panel cleaning products and services for large-scale solar power plants.[7]
Cells[edit]
The company's main product is a high-efficiency solar cell, trademarked "Maxeon", the same size and shape as conventional 6-inch/160 mm single-crystal silicon cells, packaged into conventional 60-cell solar panels. The cells have a conversion efficiency of 21.5%, and each panel produces up to 345 W; typical conventional panels produce up to 250 to 270 W.[8][9]
Silicon solar cells typically consist of a thin layer of silicon chemically treated to produce an electrically active layer near the front that produces electricity when the sun shines on it. Collecting that energy is normally handled via a series of very fine wires embedded on the front. There is an inherent paradox in the wiring design; larger wires lower electrical resistance and improve energy collection but reflect light that would otherwise reach the cell and improve energy creation. The wires are normally made of silver for a variety of reasons, although less expensive copper and aluminum wiring has been attempted with no great market success. The circuit is completed by a thin layer of aluminum that is deposited on the back of the cell.
The Maxeon design starts with the same basic silicon cell, but changes the electrical connections. The silver wiring on the front is eliminated and replaced by a transparent electrode material, similar to the materials used in LCD televisions and similar devices. These electrodes have poorer electrical characteristics than silver, but by covering the entire face of the cell they improve overall performance, while eliminating light blockage. The back of the cell replaces the thin aluminum layer with a thicker copper one, which both improves electrical performance as well as offering a much more physically robust platform while eliminating corrosion that occurs in the aluminum over time.[10] On June 23, 2010, The company announced that it has produced a full-scale solar cell with a sunlight to electricity conversion efficiency of 24.2 percent, a world record confirmed by the U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL).[11]
After the cells are constructed, conventional assembly system uses a robot to place the cells into a grid of 6 columns of 10 cells - other arrangements are used, but rare outside commercial settings. As they are placed, wiring consisting of a strip of silver is woven between the cells and soldered to the connectors on the front and back. A small amount of space is required between the cells to allow the strips to pass over and under the cells. The layout takes place on top of a plastic sheet known as the backsheet, and the cells and wiring are glued to the sheet as the assembly advances. When the glue dries, the resulting laminate is ready for assembly into a panel, which consists of gluing the cell side of the laminate to a glass sheet, adding a junction box for electrical connections, and adding an aluminum frame around the outside for mechanical robustness. Different assembly systems may use different steps, but the end result is a glass sheet on top, cells and wiring in the middle, and the backsheet on the back.
The company's panels are similar in concept and layout, but include a number of additional changes to further improve the system. Instead of using silver strips to connect the cells together, which is no longer needed due to the lack of silver on the cells, its panels use a robust edge-connector that includes a built-in strain relief to reduce mechanical stress. According to the company, these changes eliminate 85% of the failures in conventional designs, which is due primarily to corrosion and electrical breaks. Only 14% of failures are due to cell or component failures.[10]
The downside to these design changes is cost, both the materials and construction methods are more expensive and drive up the price of the panels. However, the price of the panel is not the only input to a solar power system's total cost, and in recent years it accounts for much less than half of the total. In this case, using a more expensive panel can actually produce a lower overall system cost if savings can be found in installation time or there are artificial limits on system size. These are both true in the case of residential installs, where the roof defines the total size of the system that can be installed, and the cost of labor is the largest single cost of the system. Simply replacing conventional panels with SunPower panels will increase the total power of the system as much as 25% without having any effect on install times, in which case the total install cost in terms of price per watt can improve in spite of higher prices on the panels.
Development in stock exchange[edit]
The company's shares have been listed on the Photovoltaik Global 30 Index since the beginning of this stock index in 2009.

History[edit]
SunPower was started when Richard Swanson, a professor of electrical engineering at Stanford University, was awarded grants to support his solar power explorations. With the help of these funds – as well as financial support from two venture capital firms – SunPower was officially incorporated in April 24, 1985. The original plan was to develop and market solar concentrator systems.
In 1990 the company received a research and development contract from EPRI and the US Dept. of Energy. Two years later, SunPower began shipping concentrator cells to customers. In 1995 SunPower's all-back contact solar cells powered Honda's solar car to victory in the annual Darwin to Adelaide race across Australia beating the second place winner by one full day. In 1997, the company's solar cells were used in the NASA Pathfinder high altitude aircraft.[2]
in 2002, Cypress Semiconductor invested $8 million in SunPower. The following year Tom Werner joined as CEO. In 2004, SunPower opened manufacturing facilities in the Philippines and Bavaria. The company held an IPO in 2005.
In January 2007, SunPower acquired PowerLight Corporation, a large-scale solar power systems company.[2][3] In February 2010, it acquired Europe's SunRay Renewable Energy for $277 million.[4]
In April 2011, Total S.A. agreed to buy 60% of SunPower for US$1.38 billion.[5] In December 2011, the company announced an agreement to acquire Tenesol SA.[6] In 2013 SunPower acquired Greenbotics, Inc., maker of robotic solar panel cleaning products and services for large-scale solar power plants.[7]
Cells[edit]
The company's main product is a high-efficiency solar cell, trademarked "Maxeon", the same size and shape as conventional 6-inch/160 mm single-crystal silicon cells, packaged into conventional 60-cell solar panels. The cells have a conversion efficiency of 21.5%, and each panel produces up to 345 W; typical conventional panels produce up to 250 to 270 W.[8][9]
Silicon solar cells typically consist of a thin layer of silicon chemically treated to produce an electrically active layer near the front that produces electricity when the sun shines on it. Collecting that energy is normally handled via a series of very fine wires embedded on the front. There is an inherent paradox in the wiring design; larger wires lower electrical resistance and improve energy collection but reflect light that would otherwise reach the cell and improve energy creation. The wires are normally made of silver for a variety of reasons, although less expensive copper and aluminum wiring has been attempted with no great market success. The circuit is completed by a thin layer of aluminum that is deposited on the back of the cell.
The Maxeon design starts with the same basic silicon cell, but changes the electrical connections. The silver wiring on the front is eliminated and replaced by a transparent electrode material, similar to the materials used in LCD televisions and similar devices. These electrodes have poorer electrical characteristics than silver, but by covering the entire face of the cell they improve overall performance, while eliminating light blockage. The back of the cell replaces the thin aluminum layer with a thicker copper one, which both improves electrical performance as well as offering a much more physically robust platform while eliminating corrosion that occurs in the aluminum over time.[10] On June 23, 2010, The company announced that it has produced a full-scale solar cell with a sunlight to electricity conversion efficiency of 24.2 percent, a world record confirmed by the U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL).[11]
After the cells are constructed, conventional assembly system uses a robot to place the cells into a grid of 6 columns of 10 cells - other arrangements are used, but rare outside commercial settings. As they are placed, wiring consisting of a strip of silver is woven between the cells and soldered to the connectors on the front and back. A small amount of space is required between the cells to allow the strips to pass over and under the cells. The layout takes place on top of a plastic sheet known as the backsheet, and the cells and wiring are glued to the sheet as the assembly advances. When the glue dries, the resulting laminate is ready for assembly into a panel, which consists of gluing the cell side of the laminate to a glass sheet, adding a junction box for electrical connections, and adding an aluminum frame around the outside for mechanical robustness. Different assembly systems may use different steps, but the end result is a glass sheet on top, cells and wiring in the middle, and the backsheet on the back.
The company's panels are similar in concept and layout, but include a number of additional changes to further improve the system. Instead of using silver strips to connect the cells together, which is no longer needed due to the lack of silver on the cells, its panels use a robust edge-connector that includes a built-in strain relief to reduce mechanical stress. According to the company, these changes eliminate 85% of the failures in conventional designs, which is due primarily to corrosion and electrical breaks. Only 14% of failures are due to cell or component failures.[10]
The downside to these design changes is cost, both the materials and construction methods are more expensive and drive up the price of the panels. However, the price of the panel is not the only input to a solar power system's total cost, and in recent years it accounts for much less than half of the total. In this case, using a more expensive panel can actually produce a lower overall system cost if savings can be found in installation time or there are artificial limits on system size. These are both true in the case of residential installs, where the roof defines the total size of the system that can be installed, and the cost of labor is the largest single cost of the system. Simply replacing conventional panels with SunPower panels will increase the total power of the system as much as 25% without having any effect on install times, in which case the total install cost in terms of price per watt can improve in spite of higher prices on the panels.

History[edit]
SunPower was started when Richard Swanson, a professor of electrical engineering at Stanford University, was awarded grants to support his solar power explorations. With the help of these funds – as well as financial support from two venture capital firms – SunPower was officially incorporated in April 24, 1985. The original plan was to develop and market solar concentrator systems.
In 1990 the company received a research and development contract from EPRI and the US Dept. of Energy. Two years later, SunPower began shipping concentrator cells to customers. In 1995 SunPower's all-back contact solar cells powered Honda's solar car to victory in the annual Darwin to Adelaide race across Australia beating the second place winner by one full day. In 1997, the company's solar cells were used in the NASA Pathfinder high altitude aircraft.[2]
in 2002, Cypress Semiconductor invested $8 million in SunPower. The following year Tom Werner joined as CEO. In 2004, SunPower opened manufacturing facilities in the Philippines and Bavaria. The company held an IPO in 2005.
In January 2007, SunPower acquired PowerLight Corporation, a large-scale solar power systems company.[2][3] In February 2010, it acquired Europe's SunRay Renewable Energy for $277 million.[4]
In April 2011, Total S.A. agreed to buy 60% of SunPower for US$1.38 billion.[5] In December 2011, the company announced an agreement to acquire Tenesol SA.[6] In 2013 SunPower acquired Greenbotics, Inc., maker of robotic solar panel cleaning products and services for large-scale solar power plants.[7]
Cells[edit]
The company's main product is a high-efficiency solar cell, trademarked "Maxeon", the same size and shape as conventional 6-inch/160 mm single-crystal silicon cells, packaged into conventional 60-cell solar panels. The cells have a conversion efficiency of 21.5%, and each panel produces up to 345 W; typical conventional panels produce up to 250 to 270 W.[8][9]
Silicon solar cells typically consist of a thin layer of silicon chemically treated to produce an electrically active layer near the front that produces electricity when the sun shines on it. Collecting that energy is normally handled via a series of very fine wires embedded on the front. There is an inherent paradox in the wiring design; larger wires lower electrical resistance and improve energy collection but reflect light that would otherwise reach the cell and improve energy creation. The wires are normally made of silver for a variety of reasons, although less expensive copper and aluminum wiring has been attempted with no great market success. The circuit is completed by a thin layer of aluminum that is deposited on the back of the cell.
The Maxeon design starts with the same basic silicon cell, but changes the electrical connections. The silver wiring on the front is eliminated and replaced by a transparent electrode material, similar to the materials used in LCD televisions and similar devices. These electrodes have poorer electrical characteristics than silver, but by covering the entire face of the cell they improve overall performance, while eliminating light blockage. The back of the cell replaces the thin aluminum layer with a thicker copper one, which both improves electrical performance as well as offering a much more physically robust platform while eliminating corrosion that occurs in the aluminum over time.[10] On June 23, 2010, The company announced that it has produced a full-scale solar cell with a sunlight to electricity conversion efficiency of 24.2 percent, a world record confirmed by the U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL).[11]
After the cells are constructed, conventional assembly system uses a robot to place the cells into a grid of 6 columns of 10 cells - other arrangements are used, but rare outside commercial settings. As they are placed, wiring consisting of a strip of silver is woven between the cells and soldered to the connectors on the front and back. A small amount of space is required between the cells to allow the strips to pass over and under the cells. The layout takes place on top of a plastic sheet known as the backsheet, and the cells and wiring are glued to the sheet as the assembly advances. When the glue dries, the resulting laminate is ready for assembly into a panel, which consists of gluing the cell side of the laminate to a glass sheet, adding a junction box for electrical connections, and adding an aluminum frame around the outside for mechanical robustness. Different assembly systems may use different steps, but the end result is a glass sheet on top, cells and wiring in the middle, and the backsheet on the back.
The company's panels are similar in concept and layout, but include a number of additional changes to further improve the system. Instead of using silver strips to connect the cells together, which is no longer needed due to the lack of silver on the cells, its panels use a robust edge-connector that includes a built-in strain relief to reduce mechanical stress. According to the company, these changes eliminate 85% of the failures in conventional designs, which is due primarily to corrosion and electrical breaks. Only 14% of failures are due to cell or component failures.[10]
The downside to these design changes is cost, both the materials and construction methods are more expensive and drive up the price of the panels. However, the price of the panel is not the only input to a solar power system's total cost, and in recent years it accounts for much less than half of the total. In this case, using a more expensive panel can actually produce a lower overall system cost if savings can be found in installation time or there are artificial limits on system size. These are both true in the case of residential installs, where the roof defines the total size of the system that can be installed, and the cost of labor is the largest single cost of the system. Simply replacing conventional panels with SunPower panels will increase the total power of the system as much as 25% without having any effect on install times, in which case the total install cost in terms of price per watt can improve in spite of higher prices on the panels.
Development in stock exchange[edit]
The company's shares have been listed on the Photovoltaik Global 30 Index since the beginning of this stock index in 2009.

History[edit]
SunPower was started when Richard Swanson, a professor of electrical engineering at Stanford University, was awarded grants to support his solar power explorations. With the help of these funds – as well as financial support from two venture capital firms – SunPower was officially incorporated in April 24, 1985. The original plan was to develop and market solar concentrator systems.
In 1990 the company received a research and development contract from EPRI and the US Dept. of Energy. Two years later, SunPower began shipping concentrator cells to customers. In 1995 SunPower's all-back contact solar cells powered Honda's solar car to victory in the annual Darwin to Adelaide race across Australia beating the second place winner by one full day. In 1997, the company's solar cells were used in the NASA Pathfinder high altitude aircraft.[2]
in 2002, Cypress Semiconductor invested $8 million in SunPower. The following year Tom Werner joined as CEO. In 2004, SunPower opened manufacturing facilities in the Philippines and Bavaria. The company held an IPO in 2005.
In January 2007, SunPower acquired PowerLight Corporation, a large-scale solar power systems company.[2][3] In February 2010, it acquired Europe's SunRay Renewable Energy for $277 million.[4]
In April 2011, Total S.A. agreed to buy 60% of SunPower for US$1.38 billion.[5] In December 2011, the company announced an agreement to acquire Tenesol SA.[6] In 2013 SunPower acquired Greenbotics, Inc., maker of robotic solar panel cleaning products and services for large-scale solar power plants.[7]
Cells[edit]
The company's main product is a high-efficiency solar cell, trademarked "Maxeon", the same size and shape as conventional 6-inch/160 mm single-crystal silicon cells, packaged into conventional 60-cell solar panels. The cells have a conversion efficiency of 21.5%, and each panel produces up to 345 W; typical conventional panels produce up to 250 to 270 W.[8][9]
Silicon solar cells typically consist of a thin layer of silicon chemically treated to produce an electrically active layer near the front that produces electricity when the sun shines on it. Collecting that energy is normally handled via a series of very fine wires embedded on the front. There is an inherent paradox in the wiring design; larger wires lower electrical resistance and improve energy collection but reflect light that would otherwise reach the cell and improve energy creation. The wires are normally made of silver for a variety of reasons, although less expensive copper and aluminum wiring has been attempted with no great market success. The circuit is completed by a thin layer of aluminum that is deposited on the back of the cell.
The Maxeon design starts with the same basic silicon cell, but changes the electrical connections. The silver wiring on the front is eliminated and replaced by a transparent electrode material, similar to the materials used in LCD televisions and similar devices. These electrodes have poorer electrical characteristics than silver, but by covering the entire face of the cell they improve overall performance, while eliminating light blockage. The back of the cell replaces the thin aluminum layer with a thicker copper one, which both improves electrical performance as well as offering a much more physically robust platform while eliminating corrosion that occurs in the aluminum over time.[10] On June 23, 2010, The company announced that it has produced a full-scale solar cell with a sunlight to electricity conversion efficiency of 24.2 percent, a world record confirmed by the U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL).[11]
After the cells are constructed, conventional assembly system uses a robot to place the cells into a grid of 6 columns of 10 cells - other arrangements are used, but rare outside commercial settings. As they are placed, wiring consisting of a strip of silver is woven between the cells and soldered to the connectors on the front and back. A small amount of space is required between the cells to allow the strips to pass over and under the cells. The layout takes place on top of a plastic sheet known as the backsheet, and the cells and wiring are glued to the sheet as the assembly advances. When the glue dries, the resulting laminate is ready for assembly into a panel, which consists of gluing the cell side of the laminate to a glass sheet, adding a junction box for electrical connections, and adding an aluminum frame around the outside for mechanical robustness. Different assembly systems may use different steps, but the end result is a glass sheet on top, cells and wiring in the middle, and the backsheet on the back.
The company's panels are similar in concept and layout, but include a number of additional changes to further improve the system. Instead of using silver strips to connect the cells together, which is no longer needed due to the lack of silver on the cells, its panels use a robust edge-connector that includes a built-in strain relief to reduce mechanical stress. According to the company, these changes eliminate 85% of the failures in conventional designs, which is due primarily to corrosion and electrical breaks. Only 14% of failures are due to cell or component failures.[10]
The downside to these design changes is cost, both the materials and construction methods are more expensive and drive up the price of the panels. However, the price of the panel is not the only input to a solar power system's total cost, and in recent years it accounts for much less than half of the total. In this case, using a more expensive panel can actually produce a lower overall system cost if savings can be found in installation time or there are artificial limits on system size. These are both true in the case of residential installs, where the roof defines the total size of the system that can be installed, and the cost of labor is the largest single cost of the system. Simply replacing conventional panels with SunPower panels will increase the total power of the system as much as 25% without having any effect on install times, in which case the total install cost in terms of price per watt can improve in spite of higher prices on the panels.
Development in stock exchange[edit]
The company's shares have been listed on the Photovoltaik Global 30 Index since the beginning of this stock index in 2009.

Here's how we estimate your solar savings potential




LocationWe look at the cost of electricity from your local utility based on your zip code.



Electric billThe more electricity you use today, the greater your potential savings with solar will be tomorrow.



ShadingThe less shade you have on your roof, the more solar energy you can produce. 

 






1 The potential solar savings above are not guaranteed and may not represent your actual experience. Savings vary depending upon a number of factors including (but not limited to) the following: location, equipment used, system size, system orientation and shading, insolation available, applicable utility rates and rate structure, as well as your eligibility for rebates, incentives, and net-metering or similar programs (the availability of which may differ for each customer and are subject to change).
2,3 How we calculate your potential savings
Lease or Purchase
Your area – We look at the cost of electricity from your local utility provider based on your zip code.
Electricity Rate/Degradation - We calculate an electricity increase rate of 2% along with an approximate degradation rate over 25-years. Actual utility bill escalation will vary from year to year based on future utility tier structure and rates.
Your electric bill – The more electricity you use today, the greater your potential savings with solar will be tomorrow.
Electricity Rate/Degradation - We calculate an electricity increase rate of 2% per year along with an approximate degradation rate over 25-years. Actual utility bill escalation will vary from year to year based on future utility tier structure and rates.
Shading – The less shading on have on your roof, the more solar energy you can produce.
Taxes and Fees – Estimated savings do not include taxes or service fees.
Purchase
For purchase only - In addition to all of the items above, potential saving are calculated with an estimate of the cost of your solar purchase and with the assumption that you will qualify for the 30% Federal Investment Tax Credit.

SunPower Equinox™ system
A revolution in home solar













 













 


Home solar systems never looked so good
Gone are the days of clunky, piecemeal solar systems. Every part of the SunPower Equinox™ is designed and engineered by one company to work better together—delivering more power, reliability and style than a conventional home solar system.
 














 


Built to last
At the heart of every system is the Maxeon®​ solar cell, designed with a solid copper foundation to stand up to harsh conditions and deliver decades of productivity.
Learn about Maxeon® CellsConventional solar cells can crack easily or lose power over time. SunPower's patented Maxeon® solar cells are uniquely designed to turn more sunlight into energy with their copper-backed design reinforces cell strength, resists corrosion and produces more electricity over time.

 













 



Unrivaled performance
The SunPower Equinox system features the most efficient solar panels on the market.1 Because more power means more savings and fewer panels on your roof.
Learn more about SunPower® solar panelsSunPower's elegant panels achieve a world-record setting 22% efficiency rate, the highest efficiency solar panels you can buy for your roof.3 In fact, a SunPower solar panel produces the same total energy in its first 17 years as a conventional panel running for 25 years.4

1. Based on search of data sheet values from websites of top 10 manufacturers per IHS, as of January 2017.
3. Based on search of datasheet values from websites of top 10 manufacturers per IHS, as of January 2017
4. SunPower 360W compared to a Conventional Panel on same sized arrays (300W, 17.9% efficient, approx. 1.6 m2), 5% more energy per watt (based on 3pty module characterization and PVSim), 0.75%/yr slower degradation (Campeau, Z. et al. "SunPower Module Degradation Rate," SunPower white paper, 2013).
 





















 


Minimalist design
Our proprietary InvisiMount® frame is designed to be completely hidden, producing a sleek look that complements any architectural style.
Tell me more about Invisimount® frameConventional solar frames can be visible from the ground, but with the SunPower EquinoxTM  system, the frame is hidden, so beautiful solar is the only thing you see. 

 













 



Concealed Genius
Our solar panels for your home have built-in microinverters hidden behind each panel optimize power conversion at the source—minimizing disruptions and eliminating the need for ugly external inverters.
Tell me more about the built-in micro-invertersThe SunPower Equinox system maximizes energy production and converts more sunlight into usable power immediately right at the panel. With SunPower's micro-inverter technology, a bulky inverter on the outside of your house is a thing of the past.

 













 



See your solar savings
Want to make the most of your system? The EnergyLink® ecosystem makes it easy to monitor your solar energy production, use and savings.
Tell me more about the EnergyLink appEnergyLink shows you how much solar energy you are producing, how much energy you are using from your solar system versus the grid and tracks your lifetime electric bill savings. While most energy monitoring systems rely on WiFi for their connection, EnergyLink is the only solar monitoring technology built with 4 auto backup communication options, so you always have access to your system and never lose track of your savings.*

*. Availability of features may vary and may require additional installation steps and cost, please contact your local authorized SunPower dealer for more details
 





















 


One integrated system, one simple warranty
We engineered the SunPower Equinox system from start to finish, so we stand behind the entire experience from beginning to end. No other warranty even comes close.
Tell me more about the Complete Confidence WarrantyConventional solar involves complicated pass-through warranties from multiple manufacturers (inverter, racking, and panels). When you chose SunPower Equinox, you get a home solar system designed and built completely by SunPower, so one single warranty covers everything. If you happen to experience any issues, SunPower will repair or replace the defective part for free.

"THEY LOOK AMAZING."

I was a little afraid to put panels on the front of my home looking at some of the ugly solar panels in my neighborhood, but I found it was time to do something because my utility bill was killing me. I decided to go with SunPower and I got their x21 335 black on black panels. I have to say they look absolutely incredible. I had a few of my neighbors even come over to my house and tell me how ugly they're panels look compared to mine. If you're putting the panels in the front of your home you can't go wrong with SunPower. Read Less

Sunpower doesn't have manufacturing facilities in the USA. I got the information from 10-k filing report on February 17, 2017, and the link is here:http://investors.sunpower.com/sec.cfm"Our headquarters and research and development operations are located in California, and our manufacturing facilities are located in the Philippines, Malaysia, France, and Mexico."The reason for 4 stars is because of some dealer and some website says those panels as they are manufactured in the USA. Don't get me wrong are good solar panels, but are not made in USA and be ready to pay a premium price for their quality. Read Less

"Great panels but expen$ive"

I think it's clear Sunpower makes the best solar panels, but you pay a price for them. My prediction is that the technology will keep getting better, and in 10-15 years you may want to upgrade your system anyway, so why would you pay a lot for premium panels with a very long lifetime? In 15+ years, the low cost panels are likely to be more efficient, and you'll want to replace your (golden) Sunpower panels, anyway.  But, if you must have the best - and cost is no object, this is the best. Read Less

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
