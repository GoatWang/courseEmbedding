	Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities





	 


	Avalon GloboCare Corp. (the “Company”)
	entered into and closed a Subscription Agreement with an accredited investor (the "March 2017 Accredited Investor") pursuant
	to which the March 2017 Accredited Investor purchased 3,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock (“March 2017 Shares”)
	for a purchase price of $3,000,000 (the “Purchase Price”). The closing occurred on March 3, 2017.


	 



	The
	offer, sale and issuance of the above securities was made to an accredited investor and the Company relied upon the exemptions
	contained in Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and/or Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated there under with regard to the sale.
	No advertising or general solicitation was employed in offering the securities. The offer and sale was made to an accredited investor
	and transfer of the common stock issued was restricted by the Company in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act
	of 1933, as amended.




	 




	The
	Company,

	Avalon (Shanghai) Healthcare Technology Co., Ltd. (“Avalon Shanghai”), Beijing DOING Biomedical Technology
	Co., Ltd. (“DOING”) and the March 2017 Accredited Investor entered into a Share Subscription Agreement whereby the
	parties acknowledged, among other things, that DOING agreed to transfer the Purchase Price to Avalon Shanghai on behalf of the
	March 2017 Investor and the March 2017 Accredited Investor agreed to transfer the March 2017 Shares to DOING upon DOING completing
	the registration of the acquisition of the March 2017 Shares with the Beijing Commerce Commission (“BCC”) and obtaining
	an Enterprise Overseas Investment Certificate (the “Investment Certificate”) from BCC. If DOING fails to complete the
	registration and acquire the Investment Certificate within one year of the closing then Avalon Shanghai shall transfer $3,000,000
	with interest of 20% to DOING upon the request of DOING (the “BCC Repayment Obligation”).

	As
	of the date hereof, the Company is obligated to DOING in the principal amount of $3,000,000. The BCC Repayment Obligation
	is a debt obligation arising other than in the ordinary course of business, which constitutes a direct financial obligation
	of the Company. Further,

	Lu Wenzhao, a director and shareholder of the Company, and DOING entered into a Warranty Agreement.
	Pursuant to the Warranty Agreement, Mr. Wenzhao agreed to (i) cause the Company to be liable to DOING in the event the March 2017
	Accredited Investor defaults in its obligations to DOING, (ii) cause the March 2017 Accredited Investor to transfer the March 2017
	Shares to DOING upon DOING’s receipt of the Investment Certificate from BCC, (iii) within three years from the date of the
	Warranty Agreement, DOING may require Mr. Wenzhao to acquire the March 2017 Shares at $1.20 per share upon three months notice,
	and (iv) in the event Mr. Wenzhao does not acquire the March 2017 Shares within the three month period, interest of 15% per annum
	will be added to the purchase price.


	 


	The foregoing information is a summary
	of the agreement involved in the transactions described above, is not complete, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to
	the full text of the agreement, which is attached an exhibit to this Current Report on Form 8-K.  Readers should review
	the agreement for a complete understanding of the terms and conditions associated with this transaction.

	SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT



	 


	SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT
	(this “Agreement”) made as of the last date set forth on the signature page hereof by and among Avalon GloboCare Corp.,
	a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), the undersigned (the “Subscriber”), Wenzhao Lu, David Jin and
	Meng Li (collectively the “Controlling Shareholders”).


	 


	WITNESSETH:


	 


	WHEREAS, the Controlling
	Shareholders own approximately 83.6% of the outstanding common stock of the Company as of the last date set forth on the signature
	page hereof;


	 


	WHEREAS, the Company
	is conducting a private offering (the “Offering”) consisting of up to 3,000,000 shares (the “Shares”)
	of common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (“Common Stock”), pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933,
	as amended (the “Securities Act”) and/or Rule 506 promulgated thereunder; and


	 


	WHEREAS, the Subscriber
	desires to purchase that number of Shares set forth on the signature page hereof on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.


	 


	NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration
	of the premises and the mutual representations and covenants hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto do hereby agree as follows:


	 


	I.           

	SUBSCRIPTION
	FOR SHARES AND REPRESENTATIONS AND COVENANTS BY SUBSCRIBER



	 


	1.1           Subject
	to the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, the Subscriber hereby irrevocably subscribes for and agrees to purchase from
	the Company such number of Shares, and the Company agrees to sell to the Subscriber as is set forth on the signature page hereof,
	at a per share price equal to $1.00 per Share. The purchase price is payable by check or by wire transfer of immediately available
	funds pursuant to the Company's wire instructions provided upon request. The date of the payment for the Shares by check or by
	wire transfer (the “Closing”) shall be referred to as the Closing Date.         


	 


	1.2           The
	Subscriber recognizes that the purchase of the Shares involves a high degree of risk including, but not limited to, the following:
	(a) the Company has limited operating history and requires substantial funds in addition to the proceeds of the Offering; (b)
	an investment in the Company is highly speculative, and only investors who can afford the loss of their entire investment should
	consider investing in the Company and the Shares; (c) the Subscriber may not be able to liquidate its investment; (d) transferability
	of the Shares is extremely limited; (e) in the event of a disposition, the Subscriber could sustain the loss of its entire investment;
	(f) the Company has not paid any dividends since its inception and does not anticipate paying any dividends; (g) the Company may
	issue additional securities in the future which have rights and preferences that are senior to those of the Common Stock and (h)
	the additional risk factors set forth on

	Exhibit A

	, which is attached hereto. Without limiting the generality of the representations
	set forth in Section 1.5 below, the Subscriber represents that the Subscriber has carefully reviewed the risk factors described
	in the Company's filings made under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

	1.3           The
	Subscriber has carefully read the Form 8-K Current Report as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”)
	on October 19, 2016 (the "October 2016 8K"), Form 10-Q Quarterly Report for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 as
	filed with the SEC on November 7, 2016 (the "10Q") and the three Form 8-K Current Reports as filed with the SEC on December
	2, 2016, December 21, 2016, December 23, 2016 and January 11, 2017 (collectively, the "December 2016 8K's" and together
	with the October 2016 8K and the 10Q, the “Reports”), which are attached hereto as

	Exhibit B

	, as well as all
	other filings made by the Company with the SEC, and the related risk factors (the “Risk Factors”), which are contained
	in the Reports. The Subscriber has been given the opportunity to ask questions of, and receive answers from, the Company concerning
	the terms and conditions of this Offering, the Reports and the Risk Factors and to obtain such additional information, to the
	extent the Company possesses such information or can acquire it without unreasonable effort or expense, necessary to verify the
	accuracy of same as the Subscriber reasonably desires in order to evaluate the investment. The Subscriber understands the Reports
	and the associated Risk Factors, and the Subscriber has had the opportunity to discuss any questions regarding any of the disclosure
	in the Reports and the associated Risk Factors with his counsel or other advisor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the only information
	upon which the Subscriber has relied is that set forth in the Reports and the associated Risk Factors. The Subscriber has received
	no representations or warranties from the Company, its employees, agents or attorneys, in making this investment decision other
	than as set forth in the Reports and the associated Risk Factors.


	 


	1.4           The
	Subscriber represents that the Subscriber is an “accredited investor” as such term is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation
	D (“Regulation D”) promulgated under the Securities Act, as indicated by the Subscriber’s responses to the questions
	contained in Accredited Investor Questionnaire attached hereto as

	Exhibit C

	, and that the Subscriber is able to bear the
	economic risk of an investment in the Shares.


	 


	1.5           The
	Subscriber hereby acknowledges and represents that (a) the Subscriber has knowledge and experience in business and financial matters,
	prior investment experience, including investment in securities that are non-listed, unregistered and/or not traded on a national
	securities exchange nor on the NASDAQ, or the Subscriber has employed the services of a “purchaser representative”
	(as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D), attorney and/or accountant to read all of the documents furnished or made available
	by the Company both to the Subscriber and to all other prospective investors in the Shares to evaluate the merits and risks of
	such an investment on the Subscriber’s behalf; (b) the Subscriber recognizes the highly speculative nature of this investment;
	and (c) the Subscriber is able to bear the economic risk that the Subscriber hereby assumes.


	 


	1.6           The
	Subscriber hereby acknowledges receipt and careful review of this Agreement, including all exhibits thereto, and any documents
	which may have been made available upon request as reflected therein (collectively referred to as the “Offering Materials”)
	and hereby represents that the Subscriber has been furnished by the Company during the course of the Offering with all information
	regarding the Company, the terms and conditions of the Offering and any additional information that the Subscriber has requested
	or desired to know, and has been afforded the opportunity to ask questions of and receive answers from duly authorized officers
	or other representatives of the Company concerning the Company and the terms and conditions of the Offering.

	1.7         (a)          In
	making the decision to invest in the Shares the Subscriber has relied solely upon the information provided by the Company in the
	Offering Materials. To the extent necessary, the Subscriber has retained, at its own expense, and relied upon appropriate professional
	advice regarding the investment, tax and legal merits and consequences of this Agreement and the purchase of the Shares hereunder.
	The Subscriber disclaims reliance on any statements made or information provided by any person or entity in the course of Subscriber’s
	consideration of an investment in the Shares other than the Offering Materials.


	 


	(b)          The
	Subscriber represents that (i) the Subscriber was contacted regarding the sale of the Shares by the Company (or an authorized
	agent or representative thereof) with whom the Subscriber had a prior substantial pre-existing relationship and (ii) no Shares
	were offered or sold to it by means of any form of general solicitation or general advertising, and in connection therewith, the
	Subscriber did not (A) receive or review any advertisement, article, notice or other communication published in a newspaper or
	magazine or similar media or broadcast over television or radio, whether closed circuit, or generally available; or (B) attend
	any seminar meeting or industry investor conference whose attendees were invited by any general solicitation or general advertising.


	 


	1.8           The
	Subscriber hereby represents that the Subscriber, either by reason of the Subscriber’s business or financial experience
	or the business or financial experience of the Subscriber’s professional advisors (who are unaffiliated with and not compensated
	by the Company or any affiliate or selling agent of the Company, directly or indirectly), has the capacity to protect the Subscriber’s
	own interests in connection with the transaction contemplated hereby.


	 


	1.9           The
	Subscriber hereby acknowledges that the Offering has not been reviewed by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission
	(the “SEC”) nor any state regulatory authority since the Offering is intended to be exempt from the registration requirements
	of Section 5 of the Securities Act, pursuant to Regulation D. The Subscriber understands that the Shares have not been registered
	under the Securities Act or under any state securities or “blue sky” laws and agrees not to sell, pledge, assign or
	otherwise transfer or dispose of the Shares unless they are registered under the Securities Act and under any applicable state
	securities or “blue sky” laws or unless an exemption from such registration is available.


	 


	1.10         The
	Subscriber understands that the Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act by reason of a claimed exemption under
	the provisions of the Securities Act that depends, in part, upon the Subscriber’s investment intention. In this connection,
	the Subscriber hereby represents that the Subscriber is purchasing the Shares for the Subscriber’s own account for investment
	and not with a view toward the resale or distribution to others. The Subscriber, if an entity, further represents that it was
	not formed for the purpose of purchasing the Shares.

	1.11         The
	Subscriber understands that the common stock issuable upon conversion of the Common Stock is quoted on the OTC Markets and that
	there is a limited market for the Common Stock. The Subscriber understands that even if a public market develops for the Common
	Stock, Rule 144 (“Rule 144”) promulgated under the Securities Act requires for non-affiliates, among other conditions,
	a holding period prior to the resale (in limited amounts) of securities acquired in a non-public offering without having to satisfy
	the registration requirements under the Securities Act. The Subscriber understands and hereby acknowledges that the Company is
	under no obligation to register any of the Shares under the Securities Act or any state securities or “blue sky” laws.
	The Subscriber understands that the Company must be current under the 1934 Act for the Subscriber to take advantage of Rule 144.
	The Subscriber understands that Rule 144 is not available until October 19, 2017 or the one year anniversary of the filing of
	the Super 8-K Current Report with the SEC.

	the sale of, assign or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any of the Shares held by the Subscriber for a period of
	one year from the Closing Date, unless transfer to an entity

	qualified to invest in the Company as otherwise consented
	to in writing by the Company and such qualified entity agrees to the same lock-up restrictions contained herein

	.
	If requested by an underwriter of Common Stock, Subscriber will reaffirm the agreement set forth in this Section 1.13 in a separate
	writing in a form satisfactory to such underwriter. The Company may impose stop-transfer instructions with respect to the Shares
	subject to any restriction set forth in this Agreement. The Subscriber may sell its shares in a private transaction only in the
	event that such purchaser agrees to be bound by the terms of this Agreement including this Section 1.13.



	 



	1.14         The
	Subscriber consents to the placement of a legend on any certificate or other document evidencing the Shares and any shares of
	common stock issuable upon conversion of the Common Stock that such securities have not been registered under the Securities Act
	or any state securities or “blue sky” laws and setting forth or referring to the restrictions on transferability and
	sale thereof contained in this Agreement. The Subscriber is aware that the Company will make a notation in its appropriate records
	with respect to the restrictions on the transferability of such Shares. The legend to be placed on each certificate shall be in
	form

	substantially similar to the following:


	 



	“THE
	SHARES REPRESENTED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE UNITED STATES SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “ACT”)

	NOT REQUIRED.

	at its sole discretion, reserves the unrestricted right, without further documentation or agreement on the part of the Subscriber,

	enforceable against the Subscriber in accordance with its terms.

	on behalf of such entity has been duly authorized by such entity to do so.

	Subscriber agrees not to issue any public statement with respect to the Subscriber’s investment or proposed investment in
	the Company or the terms of any agreement or covenant between them and the Company without the Company’s prior written consent,
	except such disclosures as may be required under applicable law or under any applicable order, rule or regulation.


	 


	1.22         The
	Subscriber agrees to hold the Company and its directors, officers, employees, affiliates, controlling persons and agents and their

	with this transaction.

	Exhibit A - Risk Factors




	 





	Risks Related to our Business






	 





	Our limited operating
	history makes it difficult for us to evaluate our future business prospects and make decisions based on those estimates of our
	future performance

	.


	 


	We did not begin operations
	of our business through Avalon Healthcare System, Inc. (“AHS”), our wholly-owned subsidiary, until May 2015.  We
	have a limited operating history and have not generated revenue.  As a consequence, it is difficult, if not impossible,
	to forecast our future results based upon our historical data.  Reliance on the historical results may not be representative
	of the results we will achieve, particularly in our combined form.  Because of the uncertainties related to our lack of historical
	operations, we may be hindered in our ability to anticipate and timely adapt to increases or decreases in revenues or expenses. 
	If we make poor budgetary decisions as a result of unreliable historical data, we could be less profitable or incur losses, which
	may result in a decline in our stock price.


	 



	AHS’s results
	of operations have not resulted in profitability and we may not be able to achieve profitability going forward.



	 


	AHS incurred a net
	loss amounting to $26,544 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.   If we incur additional significant operating
	losses, our stock price, may decline, perhaps significantly. Our management is developing plans to alleviate the negative trends
	and conditions described above.  Our business plan is speculative and unproven. There is no assurance that we will be
	successful in executing our business plan or that even if we successfully implement our business plan, that we will be able to
	curtail our losses now or in the future. Further, as we are a new enterprise, we expect that net losses will continue and our
	working capital deficiency will exacerbate.


	 



	We depend upon
	key personnel and need additional personnel.



	 


	Our success depends
	on the continuing services of Wenzhao Lu, David Jin and Meng Li, our executive officers and directors.  The loss of
	Mr. Lu, Dr. Jin or Ms. Li could have a material and adverse effect on our business operations. Additionally, the success of the
	Company’s operations will largely depend upon its ability to successfully attract and maintain competent and qualified key
	management personnel. As with any company with limited resources, there can be no guaranty that the Company will be able to attract
	such individuals or that the presence of such individuals will necessarily translate into profitability for the Company.  Our
	inability to attract and retain key personnel may materially and adversely affect our business operations.


	 



	We have entered
	into three consulting agreements with related parties

	. The loss of

	such customers could adversely impact our financial
	condition and results of operations

	.



	 



	As of June 30, 2016,
	AHS received an aggregate of $452,500 of prepayments from customers for services that had not yet been provided. Wenzhao Lu, our
	Chairman and significant shareholder, is the Chairman of each of the three clients that provided the prepayments. We maintain
	close working relationships with our three customers. The loss of any one major customer would have a material adverse effect
	on our financial condition or results of operation, the loss of more than one such major customer, or our failure to replace such
	customer with other customers, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our results of operations.


	 






	 



	15



	 







	 




	 



	Our auditors have
	issued a “going concern” audit opinion.





	 




	Our independent auditors
	have indicated, in their report on our December 31, 2015 financial statements, that there is substantial doubt about our ability
	to continue as a going concern. A “going concern” opinion indicates that the financial statements have been prepared
	assuming we will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the
	recoverability and classification of assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result if we do not continue
	as a going concern. Therefore, you should not rely on our balance sheet as an indication of the amount of proceeds that would
	be available to satisfy claims of creditors, and potentially be available for distribution to shareholders, in the event of liquidation.


	 



	We must effectively
	manage the growth of our operations, or our company will suffer.



	 


	To manage our growth,
	we believe we must continue to implement and improve our services. We may not have adequately evaluated the costs and risks associated
	with our planned expansion, and our systems, procedures, and controls may not be adequate to support our operations. In addition,
	our management may not be able to achieve the rapid execution necessary to successfully offer our products and services and implement
	our business plan on a profitable basis. The success of our future operating activities will also depend upon our ability to expand
	our support system to meet the demands of our growing business. Any failure by our management to effectively anticipate, implement,
	and manage changes required to sustain our growth would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and
	results of operations.


	 



	Our business requires
	substantial capital, and if we are unable to maintain adequate financing sources our profitability and financial condition will
	suffer and jeopardize our ability to continue operations.



	 


	In connection with
	the strategic development portion of our business, we will need significant capital in order to implement acquisitions of real
	estate or technologies. In addition, we will need a significant amount of capital in order to fully implement our advisory business
	in order to fully grow our technology base and employee base. If we are unable to maintain adequate financing or other sources
	of capital are not available, we could be forced to suspend, curtail or reduce our operations, which could harm our revenues,
	profitability, financial condition and business prospects.


	 






	 



	16



	 







	 






	 





	Our revenue and
	results of operations may suffer if we are unable to attract new clients, continue to engage existing client, or sell additional
	products and services.



	 


	We presently derive
	our revenue from annual consulting fees. Our growth therefore depends on our ability to attract new clients, maintain existing
	clients and sell additional products and services to existing clients. This depends on our ability to understand and anticipate
	market and pricing trends and our clients’ needs and our ability to deliver consistent, reliable, high-quality services.
	If we fail to engage new clients, continue to re-engage with our existing clients or to cross-sell additional services our results
	could be materially and adversely affect our operating results.




	 





	If we are unable
	to maintain our reputation and expand our name recognition, we may have difficulty attracting new business and retaining current
	members.



	 


	Our professional reputation
	is an important factor in attracting and retaining our members and in building relationships with the progressive health care
	and education organizations that supply many of the best practices we feature in our research. We believe that establishing and
	maintaining a good reputation and name recognition are critical for attracting and retaining members. Promotion and enhancement
	of our reputation will depend largely on our success in continuing to provide effective solutions. Our brand name and reputation
	will suffer, and our ability to attract new members or retain existing members could be adversely affected, if members do not
	perceive our solutions to be effective or of high quality or if there are inaccuracies or defects in our solutions.


	 



	If we are not able
	to offer new and valuable products and services, our business may suffer.



	 


	Our success depends
	on our ability to identify and develop new products and services that serve specific constituencies, to anticipate changing market
	trends, and to adapt our research and analysis to meet the changing needs of our clients. We may not be able to provide helpful
	and timely research and analysis of developments and trends in a manner that meets market needs. Any such failure could cause
	some of our existing products and services to become obsolete. This environment of rapid and continuous change presents significant
	challenges to our ability to provide our clients with timely consulting and management services for issues and topics of importance.
	As a result, we must continue to invest resources in development of new services in order to enhance our existing products and
	services and introduce new high-quality products and services that will appeal to members and potential members. If we are not
	able to offer new and valuable products and services, our business may suffer.




	 





	Our prospects will
	suffer if we are not able to hire, train, motivate, manage, and retain a significant number of highly skilled employees.



	 


	We only recently commenced
	business and we presently only have three clients. Wenzhao Lu, our Chairman and significant shareholder, is the Chairman of each
	of the three clients that provided the prepayments. Our future success depends upon our ability to hire, train, motivate, manage,
	and retain a significant number of highly skilled employees, particularly research analysts, technical experts, and sales and
	marketing staff. We will experience, competition for professional personnel from management consulting firms and other healthcare
	firms. Hiring, training, motivating, managing, and retaining employees with the skills we need is time consuming and expensive.
	Any failure by us to address our staffing needs in an effective manner could hinder our ability to continue to provide high-quality
	products and services and to grow our business.


	 






	 



	17



	 







	 





	 




	We may experience
	significant delays in generating, or an inability to generate, revenue if potential clients take a long time to evaluate our products
	and services.



	 


	Our sales strategy
	is to market our products and services directly to health care organizations. If we are unable to sell additional products and
	services to our existing clients or engage new clients, our ability to increase our revenue could be materially adversely affected.
	Generally speaking, the sales cycle is extensive for our clients. We do not control many of the factors that will influence the
	decisions of these organizations regarding the purchase of our products and services. The evaluation process sometimes can be
	lengthy and involve significant technical evaluation and commitment of personnel by these organizations. The use of our products
	and services also may be delayed due to reluctance to change or modify existing procedures.


	 



	Potential liability
	claims may adversely affect our business.



	 


	Our services, which
	may include recommendations and advice to organizations regarding complex business and operational processes, regulatory and compliance
	issues, and labor practices, may give rise to liability claims by our clients or by third parties who bring claims against our
	clients. Healthcare organizations often are the subject of regulatory scrutiny and litigation, and we also may become the subject
	of such litigation based on our advice and services. Any such litigation, whether or not resulting in a judgment against us, may
	adversely affect our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
	We may not have adequate insurance coverage for claims against us.


	 



	In accordance with
	our strategic development policy, we may invest in companies for strategic reasons and may not realize a return on our investments.



	 


	From time to time,
	we may make investments in companies. These investments may be for strategic objectives to support our key business initiatives
	but may also be stand alone investments or acquisitions. Such investments or acquisitions could include equity or debt instruments
	in private companies, many of which may be not be marketable at the time of our initial investment. These companies may range
	from early-stage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue
	streams and business models. The success of these companies may depend on product development, market acceptance, operational
	efficiency, and other key business factors. The companies in which we invest may fail because they may not be able to secure additional
	funding, obtain favorable investment terms for future financings, or take advantage of liquidity events such as public offerings,
	mergers, and private sales. If any of these private companies fails, we could lose all or part of our investment in that company.
	If we determine that impairment indicators exist and that there are other-than-temporary declines in the fair value of the investments,
	we may be required to write down the investments to their fair value and recognize the related write-down as an investment loss.

	Our growing operations
	in the PRC could expose us to risks that could have an adverse effect on our costs of operations.



	 


	Our client base is
	presently located in the PRC. We intend to grow this client base in the PRC as well as the United States. As a result, we expect
	to continue to add personnel in the PRC. With a significant focus of our operations in the PRC, our reliance on a workforce in
	the PRC exposes us to disruptions in the business, political, and economic environment in that region. Maintenance of a stable
	political environment between the PRC and the United States is important to our operations, and any disruption in this relationship
	may directly negatively affect our operations. Our operations in the PRC require us to comply with complex local laws and regulatory
	requirements and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our operations may also be subject to reduced or inadequate
	protection of our intellectual property rights, and security breaches. Further, it may be difficult to transfer funds from our
	Chinese operations to our US parent company. Negative developments in any of these areas could increase our costs of operations
	or otherwise harm our business.



	 




	We face intense
	competition which could cause us to lose market share.



	 


	In the healthcare markets in the United
	States and the Peoples Republic of China, we will compete with large healthcare providers who have more significant financial
	resources, established market positions, long-standing relationships, and who have more significant name recognition, technical,
	marketing, sales, distribution, financial and other resources than we do. The resources available to our competitors to develop
	new services and products and introduce them into the marketplace exceed the resources currently available to us. This intense
	competitive environment may require us to make changes in our services, products, pricing, licensing, services, distribution,
	or marketing to develop a market position.



	 




	Our success is
	heavily dependent on protecting our intellectual property rights.



	 


	We rely on trade secret
	protections to protect our proprietary technology. Our success will, in part, depend on our ability to obtain trademarks and patents.
	We presently do not hold patents registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office or the PRC State Intellectual Property
	Office. Although we have entered into confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants, we cannot be certain that
	others will not gain access to these trade secrets. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information
	and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets.


	 






	 



	19



	 







	 




	 



	We may be exposed
	to liabilities under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and any determination that we violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
	or Chinese anti-corruption law could have a material adverse effect on our business.



	 


	We are subject to
	the Foreign Corrupt Practice Act, or FCPA, and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments
	and their officials and political parties by U.S. persons and issuers as defined by the statute for the purpose of obtaining or
	retaining business. Chinese anti-corruption law also strictly prohibits bribery of government officials. We have operations, agreements
	with third parties and make sales in China, where corruption may occur. Our activities in China create the risk of unauthorized
	payments or offers of payments by one of the employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors of our company, even though
	these parties are not always subject to our control. It is our policy to implement safeguards to prevent these practices by our
	employees. However, our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective, and the employees,
	consultants, sales agents or distributors of our company may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible.


	 


	Violations of the
	FCPA or other anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities,
	which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, the United States government
	may seek to hold our company liable for successor liability FCPA violations committed by companies in which we invest or that
	we acquire.




	 





	Our status as an
	emerging growth company may result in reduced disclosure obligations.



	 


	We are an “emerging
	growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, which we refer to as the “JOBS Act,”
	and we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting and financial disclosure requirements that
	are applicable to other public companies, that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, (1) not being
	required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley
	Act”), (2) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements,
	and (3) exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval
	of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We intend to take advantage of these exemptions. Because of the reduced
	disclosure and because our business is conducted in the PRC, investors may find investing in our common shares less attractive
	as a result, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price.


	 


	In addition, Section
	107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided
	in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. As a
	result, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise
	apply to private companies. We elected to opt out of such extended transition period and acknowledge such election is irrevocable
	pursuant to Section 107 of the JOBS Act.


	 


	We could remain an
	emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (1) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our
	annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (2) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule
	12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds
	$700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter and we have been publicly reporting
	for at least 12 months, or (3) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding
	three-year period.

	Risks Related to Doing Business
	in China





	 




	If we become directly
	subject to the recent scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity involving certain U.S.-listed Chinese companies, we may have
	to expend significant resources to investigate and resolve the matter which could harm our business operations, stock price and
	reputation and could result in a loss of your investment in our stock, especially if such matter cannot be addressed and resolved
	quickly.



	 


	Recently, U.S. public
	companies that have substantially all of their operations in China, particularly companies like us which have completed so-called
	reverse merger transactions, have been the subject of intense scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity by investors, short sellers,
	financial commentators and regulatory agencies, such as the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Much of the scrutiny,
	criticism and negative publicity has centered around financial and accounting irregularities and mistakes, a lack of effective
	internal controls over financial accounting, inadequate corporate governance policies or a lack of adherence thereto and, in many
	cases, allegations of fraud. As a result of the scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity, the publicly traded stock of many
	U.S. listed Chinese companies has sharply decreased in value and, in some cases, has become virtually worthless. Many of these
	companies are now subject to shareholder lawsuits, SEC enforcement actions and are conducting internal and external investigations
	into the allegations. It is not clear what affect this sector-wide scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity will have on our
	company, our business and our stock price. If we become the subject of any unfavorable allegations, whether such allegations are
	proven to be true or untrue, we will have to expend significant resources to investigate such allegations and/or defend our company.
	This situation could be costly and time consuming and distract our management from growing our company. If such allegations are
	not proven to be groundless, our company and business operations will be severely impacted and your investment in our stock could
	be rendered worthless.



	 




	Adverse changes in political and economic
	policies of the PRC government could impede the overall economic growth of China, which could reduce the demand for our products
	and damage our business.



	 


	Presently, we generate
	our revenue in China although we intend to pursue various opportunities in the United States and our headquarters is based in
	the United States. Accordingly, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects are affected significantly
	by economic, political and legal developments in China. The PRC economy differs from the economies of most developed countries
	in many respects, including:


	 







	·



	the
	higher level of government involvement;









	·



	the
	early stage of development of the market-oriented sector of the economy;









	·



	the
	rapid growth rate;









	·



	the
	higher level of control over foreign exchange; and









	·



	the
	allocation of resources.




	 






	 



	21



	 







	 




	 


	As the PRC economy
	has been transitioning from a planned economy to a more market-oriented economy, the PRC government has implemented various measures
	to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. While these measures may benefit the overall PRC economy,
	they may also have a negative effect on us or the healthcare industry in general.


	 


	Although the PRC government
	has in recent years implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform, the PRC government
	continues to exercise significant control over economic growth in China through the allocation of resources, controlling payment
	of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy and imposing policies that impact particular industries or
	companies in different ways.


	 


	Any adverse change
	in the economic conditions or government policies in China could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth
	and the level of new healthcare investments and expenditures in China, which in turn could lead to a reduction in demand for our
	services and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.


	 



	Uncertainties with
	respect to the PRC legal system could limit the legal protections available to you and us.



	 


	We conduct substantially
	all of our business through our operating subsidiary in the PRC. Our operating subsidiary is generally subject to laws and regulations
	applicable to foreign investments in China and, in particular, laws applicable to foreign-invested enterprises. The PRC legal
	system is based on written statutes, and prior court decisions may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value.
	Since 1979, a series of new PRC laws and regulations have significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of
	foreign investments in China. However, since the PRC legal system continues to rapidly evolve, the interpretations of many laws,
	regulations and rules are not always uniform and enforcement of these laws, regulations and rules involve uncertainties, which
	may limit legal protections available to you and us. In addition, any litigation in China may be protracted and result in substantial
	costs and diversion of resources and management attention. In addition, all of our executive officers and almost all of our directors
	are residents of China and not of the United States, and substantially all the assets of these persons are located outside the
	United States. As a result, it could be difficult for investors to affect service of process in the United States or to enforce
	a judgment obtained in the United States against our Chinese operations and subsidiary.


	 



	The PRC government
	exerts substantial influence over the manner in which we must conduct our business activities.



	 


	The PRC government
	has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over virtually every sector of the Chinese economy through regulation
	and state ownership. Our ability to operate in China may be harmed by changes in its laws and regulations. We believe that our
	operations in China are in material compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. However, the central or
	local governments of the jurisdictions in which we operate may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing
	regulations that would require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations
	or interpretations.


	 






	 



	22



	 







	 




	 


	Accordingly, government
	actions in the future, including any decision not to continue to support recent economic reforms and to return to a more centrally
	planned economy or regional or local variations in the implementation of economic policies, could have a significant effect on
	economic conditions in China or particular regions thereof.


	 



	We may be unable
	to complete a business combination transaction efficiently or on favorable terms due to complicated merger and acquisition regulations
	implemented on September 8, 2006.



	 


	The recent PRC Regulation
	on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Companies by Foreign Investors also governs the approval process by which a PRC company
	may participate in an acquisition of its assets or its equity interests. Depending on the structure of the transaction, the new
	regulation will require the Chinese parties to make a series of applications and supplemental applications to the government agencies.
	In some instances, the application process may require the presentation of economic data concerning a transaction, including appraisals
	of the target business and evaluations of the acquirer, which are designed to allow the government to assess the transaction.
	Government approvals will have expiration dates by which a transaction must be completed and reported to the government agencies.
	Compliance with the new regulations is likely to be more time consuming and expensive than in the past and the government can
	now exert more control over the combination of two businesses. Accordingly, due to the new regulation, our ability to engage in
	business combination transactions is extremely complicated, time consuming and expensive, and we may not be able to negotiate
	a transaction that is acceptable to our stockholders or sufficiently protect their interests in a transaction.


	 


	The new regulation
	allows PRC government agencies to assess the economic terms of a business combination transaction. Parties to a business combination
	transaction may have to submit to MOFCOM and the other government agencies an appraisal report, an evaluation report and the acquisition
	agreement, all of which form part of the application for approval, depending on the structure of the transaction. The regulations
	also prohibit a transaction at an acquisition price obviously lower than the appraised value of the Chinese business or assets
	and in certain transaction structures, require that consideration must be paid within defined periods, generally not in excess
	of a year. The regulation also limits our ability to negotiate various terms of the acquisition, including aspects of the initial
	consideration, contingent consideration, holdback provisions, indemnification provisions and provisions relating to the assumption
	and allocation of assets and liabilities. Transaction structures involving trusts, nominees and similar entities are prohibited.
	Therefore, such regulation may impede our ability to negotiate and complete a business combination transaction on financial terms
	that satisfy our investors and protect our stockholders’ economic interests.


	 






	 



	23



	 







	 




	 



	Under the Current
	Enterprise Income Tax, or EIT, Law, we may be classified as a "resident enterprise" of China. Such classification will
	likely result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-PRC stockholders.



	 


	We are a holding company
	incorporated under the laws of Delaware. We conduct substantially all of our business through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and
	we derive all of our income from these entities. Prior to January 1, 2008, dividends derived by foreign enterprises from business
	operations in China were not subject to the Chinese enterprise income tax. However, such tax exemption ceased as of January 1,
	2008 and thereafter with the effectiveness of the new Enterprise Income Tax Law, or EIT Law.


	 


	Under the EIT Law,
	if we are not deemed to be a “resident enterprise” for Chinese tax purposes, a withholding tax at the rate of 10%
	would be applicable to any dividends paid by our Chinese subsidiaries to us. However, if we are deemed to be a “resident
	enterprise” established outside of China whose “place of effective management” is located in China, we would
	be classified as a resident enterprise for Chinese tax purposes and thus would be subject to an enterprise income tax rate of
	25% on all of our income, including interest income on the proceeds from this offering on a worldwide basis.


	 


	The regulations promulgated
	pursuant to the EIT Law define the term “place of effective management” as “establishments that carry out substantial
	and overall management and control over the manufacturing and business operations, personnel, accounting, properties, etc. of
	an enterprise.” The State Administration of Taxation issued a SAT Circular 82 on April 22, 2009, which provides that the
	“place of effective management” of a Chinese-controlled overseas-incorporated enterprise is located in China if the
	following requirements are satisfied: (i) the senior management and core management departments in charge of its daily operations
	function are mainly located in the PRC; (ii) its financial and human resources decisions are subject to determination or approval
	by persons or bodies located in the PRC; (iii) its major assets, accounting books, company seals, and minutes and files of its
	board and shareholders’ meetings are located or kept in the PRC; and (iv) no less than half of the enterprise’s directors
	or senior management with voting rights reside in the PRC. SAT Circular 82 applies only to overseas registered enterprises controlled
	by PRC enterprises, not to those controlled by PRC individuals. If the Company’s non-PRC incorporated entities are deemed
	PRC tax residents, such entities would be subject to PRC tax under the EIT Law. The Company has analyzed the applicability of
	the EIT Law and related regulations, and for each of the applicable periods presented, the Company has not accrued for PRC tax
	on such basis.. In addition, although under the EIT Law and the related regulations dividends paid to us by our PRC subsidiaries
	would qualify as “tax-exempted income,” we cannot assure you that such dividends will not be subject to a 10% withholding
	tax, as the PRC foreign exchange control authorities, which enforce the withholding tax, have not yet issued guidance with respect
	to the processing of outbound remittances to entities that are treated as resident enterprises for PRC enterprise income tax purposes.
	As a result of such changes, our historical operating results will not be indicative of our operating results for future periods
	and the value of our shares of common stock may be adversely affected. We are actively monitoring the possibility of “resident
	enterprise” treatment and are evaluating appropriate organizational changes to avoid this treatment, to the extent possible.

	We may be subject
	to fines and legal sanctions if we or our Chinese employees fail to comply with PRC regulations relating to employee stock options
	granted by overseas listed companies to PRC citizens.



	 


	On December 25, 2006,
	the People’s Bank of China issued the Administration Measures on Individual Foreign Exchange Control, and its Implementation
	Rules were issued by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (“SAFE”) on January 5, 2007. Both took effect on
	February 1, 2007. Under these regulations, all foreign exchange matters involved in an employee stock holding plan, stock option
	plan or similar plan in which PRC citizens’ participation requires approval from the SAFE or its authorized branch. On March
	28, 2007, the SAFE issued the Application Procedure for Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating
	in Employee Stock Holding Plans or Stock Option Plans of Overseas Listed Companies, or Notice 78. Under Notice 78, PRC individuals
	who participate in an employee stock option holding plan or a stock option plan of an overseas listed company are required, through
	a PRC domestic agent or PRC subsidiary of the overseas listed company, to register with the SAFE and complete certain other procedures.
	We and our Chinese employees who have been granted shares or stock options pursuant to our share incentive plan are subject to
	Notice 78. However, in practice, there are significant uncertainties with regard to the interpretation and implementation of Notice
	78. We are committed to complying with the requirements of Notice 78. However, we cannot provide any assurance that we or our
	Chinese employees will be able to qualify for or obtain any registration required by Notice 78. In particular, if we and/or our
	Chinese employees fail to comply with the provisions of Notice 78, we and/or our Chinese employees may be subject to fines and
	legal sanctions imposed by the SAFE or other PRC government authorities, as a result of which our business operations and employee
	option plans could be materially and adversely affected.


	 



	The new M&A
	Rules establish more complex procedures for some acquisitions of Chinese companies by foreign investor which could make it more
	difficult for us to pursue growth through acquisitions in China.



	 


	The New M&A Rules
	that became effective on September 8, 2006 established additional procedures and requirements that could make merger and acquisition
	activities by foreign investors more time-consuming and complex, including requirements in some instances that the Ministry of
	Commerce be notified in advance of any change-of-control transaction in which a foreign investor takes control of a PRC domestic
	enterprise. Complying with the requirements of the M&A Rules to complete such transactions could be time-consuming, and any
	required approval processes, including obtaining approval from the Ministry of Commerce, may delay or inhibit our ability to complete
	such transactions, which could materially adversely affect our ability to grow our business through acquisitions in China.



	 





	Risks Relating to our Securities





	 




	We may not be able
	to attract the attention of brokerage firms because we became a public company by means of a reverse acquisition.



	 


	Because we became
	public through a “reverse acquisition,” securities analysts of brokerage firms may not provide coverage of us since
	there is little incentive to brokerage firms to recommend the purchase of our common stock. No assurance can be given that brokerage
	firms will want to conduct any secondary offerings on behalf of the Company in the future.




	 








	 



	25



	 







	 






	 





	There are restrictions
	on the transferability of our shares of Common Stock.




	 



	Existing shareholders
	and investors that participate in this Offering cannot offer, sell, pledge or otherwise transfer the Shares unless subsequently
	registered pursuant to, or exempt from registration under, the Securities Act and any other applicable federal or state securities
	laws or regulations. You may rely on the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144 of the Securities Act (“Rule 144”),
	subject to certain restrictions, starting one year after (i) the completion of a business combination with a private company in
	a reverse merger or reverse takeover transaction after which the company would cease to be a “shell company” (as defined
	in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) and (ii) the disclosure of certain information on a Current Report on Form 8-K within four
	business days thereafter and (iii) the Company has been current in all of its periodic SEC filings for the 12 months preceding
	the contemplated sale of stock. We acquired AHS through a "reverse merger" and were considered a shell corporation prior
	to such acquisition. We filed the Super 8-K disclosing the acquisition of AHS on October 19, 2016.


	 


	Compliance with the
	criteria for securing exemptions under federal securities laws and the securities laws of the various states is extremely complex,
	especially in respect of those exemptions affording flexibility and the elimination of trading restrictions in respect of securities
	received in exempt transactions and subsequently disposed of without registration under the Securities Act or state securities
	laws. There can be no assurance that we will fulfill any reporting requirements in the future under the Exchange Act or disseminate
	to the public any current financial or other information concerning us, as is required by Rule 144 as part of the conditions of
	our availability.



	 




	We presently trade on the OTCQB. If we fail to remain current
	on our reporting requirements, we could be removed from the OTCQB which would limit the ability of Broker-Dealers to sell our
	securities and the ability of stockholders to sell their securities in the secondary market.



	 


	Companies trading
	on the OTCQB, such as us, must be reporting issuers under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and must
	be current in their reports under Section 13, in order to maintain price quotation privileges on the OTCQB. If we fail to remain
	current on our reporting requirements, we could be removed from the OTCQB. As a result, the market liquidity for our securities
	could be severely adversely affected by limiting the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and the ability of stockholders
	to sell their securities in the secondary market. In addition, we may be unable to get re-listed on the OTCQB, which may have
	an adverse material effect on our Company.



	 




	Applicable regulatory
	requirements, including those contained in and issued under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, may make it difficult for the Company
	to retain or attract qualified officers and directors, which could adversely affect the management of its business and its ability
	to obtain or retain listing of its common stock.



	 


	The Company may be
	unable to attract and retain those qualified officers, directors and members of board committees required to provide for effective
	management because of the rules and regulations that govern publicly held companies, including, but not limited to, certifications
	by principal executive officers. The enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act has resulted in the issuance of a series of related rules
	and regulations and the strengthening of existing rules and regulations by the SEC, as well as the adoption of new and more stringent
	rules by the stock exchanges. The perceived increased personal risk associated with these changes may deter qualified individuals
	from accepting roles as directors and executive officers.


	 






	 



	26



	 







	 




	 


	Further, some of these
	changes heighten the requirements for board or committee membership, particularly with respect to an individual’s independence
	from the corporation and level of experience in finance and accounting matters. The Company may have difficulty attracting and
	retaining directors with the requisite qualifications. If the Company is unable to attract and retain qualified officers and directors,
	the management of its business and its ability to obtain or retain listing of our shares of common stock on any stock exchange
	(assuming the Company elects to seek and are successful in obtaining such listing) could be adversely affected.


	 



	If the Company
	fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls, it may not be able to accurately report its financial results or detect
	fraud. Consequently, investors could lose confidence in the Company’s financial reporting and this may decrease the trading
	price of its stock.



	 


	The Company must maintain
	effective internal controls to provide reliable financial reports and detect fraud. The Company has been assessing its internal
	controls to identify areas that need improvement. It is in the process of implementing changes to internal controls, but has not
	yet completed implementing these changes. Failure to implement these changes to the Company’s internal controls or any others
	that it identifies as necessary to maintain an effective system of internal controls could harm its operating results and cause
	investors to lose confidence in the Company’s reported financial information. Any such loss of confidence would have a negative
	effect on the trading price of the Company’s stock.



	 




	Voting power of
	our shareholders is highly concentrated by insiders.



	 


	Our officers and directors
	and affiliates own approximately 83.6% of our outstanding common shares. Such concentrated control of the Company may adversely
	affect the value of our common shares. If you acquire our common shares, you may have no effective voice in our management. Sales
	by our insiders or affiliates, along with any other market transactions, could affect the value of our common shares.



	 




	Our certificate
	of incorporation allow for our board to create new series of preferred stock without further approval by our stockholders, which
	could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our Common Stock.



	 


	Our Board of Directors
	has the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock. Our Board of Directors have the
	authority to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of our preferred stock terms of which may be determined by the Board without further
	stockholder approval. As a result, our Board of Directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would
	grant to holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation, the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are
	distributed to the holders of common stock and the right to the redemption of the shares, together with a premium, prior to the
	redemption of our common stock. In addition, our Board of Directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock
	that has greater voting power than our common stock or that is convertible into our common stock, which could decrease the relative
	voting power of our common stock or result in dilution to our existing stockholders. Although we have no present intention to
	issue any additional shares of preferred stock or to create any additional series of preferred stock, we may issue such shares
	in the future.



	 







	 



	27



	 







	 





	 




	You may experience
	dilution of your ownership interests because of the future issuance of additional common shares.



	 


	In the future, we
	may issue additional authorized but previously unissued equity securities, resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests
	of our shareholders. We may also issue additional shares of our securities that are convertible into or exercisable for ordinary
	shares, as the case may be, in connection with hiring or retaining employees, future acquisitions, future sales of its securities
	for capital raising purposes, or for other business purposes. The future issuance of any such additional shares may create downward
	pressure on the value of our securities. There can be no assurance that we will not be required to issue additional shares, warrants
	or other convertible securities in the future in conjunction with any capital raising efforts, including at a price (or exercise
	prices) below the price at which our shares may be valued or are trading in a public market.


	 



	We have not paid
	dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends in the future.  Any return on investment may be limited to
	the value of our common stock



	 


	We have never paid
	cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends
	on our common stock will depend on earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting it at such
	time as the board of directors may consider relevant. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because
	a return on your investment will only occur if its stock price appreciates.



	 




	Our stock price
	and trading volume may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses for our stockholders.



	 


	The equity trading
	markets may experience periods of volatility, which could result in highly variable and unpredictable pricing of equity securities.
	The market price of our common stock could change in ways that may or may not be related to our business, our industry or our
	operating performance and financial condition. In addition, the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant
	price variations to occur. We have experienced significant volatility in the price of our stock over the past few years. We cannot
	assure you that the market price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. In addition, the
	stock markets in general can experience considerable price and volume fluctuations.


	 






	 



	28



	 







	 




	 



	We have not voluntary
	implemented various corporate governance measures, in the absence of which, shareholders may have more limited protections against
	interested director transactions, conflict of interest and similar matters.



	 


	Recent Federal legislation,
	including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, has resulted in the adoption of various corporate governance measures designed to promote
	the integrity of the corporate management and the securities markets. Some of these measures have been adopted in response to
	legal requirements. Others have been adopted by companies in response to the requirements of national securities exchanges, such
	as the NYSE or the NASDAQ Stock Market, on which their securities are listed. Among the corporate governance measures that are
	required under the rules of national securities exchanges are those that address board of directors' independence, audit committee
	oversight, and the adoption of a code of ethics. While we intend to adopt certain corporate governance measures such as a code
	of ethics and established an audit committee, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, and Compensation Committee of our
	board of directors, we presently do not have any independent directors. We intend to expand our board membership in future periods
	to include independent directors. It is possible that if we were to have independent directors on our board, stockholders would
	benefit from somewhat greater assurances that internal corporate decisions were being made by disinterested directors and that
	policies had been implemented to define responsible conduct. For example, in the absence of audit, nominating and compensation
	committees comprised of at least a majority of independent directors, decisions concerning matters such as compensation packages
	to our senior officers and recommendations for director nominees may be made by directors who have an interest in the outcome
	of the matters being decided. Prospective investors should bear in mind our current lack of both corporate governance measures
	and independent directors in formulating their investment decisions.


	 



	If a public market
	for our common stock develops, trading will be limited under the SEC’s penny stock regulations, which will adversely affect
	the liquidity of our common stock.



	 


	The trading price
	of our common stock is less than $5.00 per share and, as a result, our common stock is considered a "penny stock," and
	trading in our common stock would be subject to the requirements of Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act. Under this rule, broker/dealers
	who recommend low-priced securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors must satisfy special
	sales practice requirements. Generally, the broker/dealer must make an individualized written suitability determination for the
	purchaser and receive the purchaser's written consent prior to the transaction.


	 


	SEC regulations also
	require additional disclosure in connection with any trades involving a "penny stock," including the delivery, prior
	to any penny stock transaction, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and its associated risks. These requirements
	severely limit the liquidity of securities in the secondary market because few broker or dealers are likely to undertake these
	compliance activities. In addition to the applicability of the penny stock rules, other risks associated with trading in penny
	stocks could also be price fluctuations and the lack of a liquid market. An active and liquid market in our common stock may never
	develop due to these factors.

	Risks Related to this Offering




	 



	The offering price
	for the Common Stock has been determined by the Company.



	 


	The price at which
	the Common Stock is being offered has been determined by us based on current sales, sales forecasts and standard corporate valuation
	estimation methods. There is no direct relationship between the offering price and our assets, book value, net worth, or any other
	economic or recognized criteria of value.



	 




	An investment in
	the Shares is speculative and there can be no assurance of any return on any such investment.



	 


	An investment in the
	Shares is speculative and there is no assurance that investors will obtain any return on their investment. Investors will be subject
	to substantial risks involved in an investment in the Company, including the risk of losing their entire investment.



	 




	We have significant
	discretion over certain of the net proceeds.



	 


	The maximum gross
	proceeds to us from the sale of the Shares will be $3,000,000. The net proceeds of this Offering will be applied to general corporate
	purposes, including, but not limited to, purchase of real estate in the United States or abroad, employee/consultant salaries
	and fees, professional fees, and working capital. The use of proceeds may change as management deems fit. The proceeds shall be
	used to carry out our business plan, and satisfy all our expenses, foreseeable and unforeseeable. As is the case with any business,
	particularly one without a proven business model, it should be expected that certain expenses unforeseeable to management at this
	juncture will arise in the future. There can be no assurance that management’s use of proceeds generated through this Offering
	will prove optimal or translate into revenue or profitability for the Company. Investors are urged to consult with their attorneys,
	accountants and personal investment advisors prior to making any decision to invest in the Company.


	 



	The Maximum Offering
	will be offered by on a “Best Efforts” basis, and we may not raise the Maximum offering.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

	person or by teleconference) of the Board of the Company, of which we expect to hold approximately four per annum as well as sign
	all written consents if you deem appropriate. In addition, you will be expected to perform such other duties as are reasonably
	contemplated by your holding office as a director of the Company or which may reasonably be assigned to you by the Board from
	time to time.




	 






	b)


	As a director you will:




	 






	i)

	2



	 







	 










	b)


	The terms of your appointment do not restrict you
	from accepting appointment as a director of any other company outside of the Company’s industry, providing consulting services
	or any other business or other activity whatsoever. The Company acknowledges and accepts your current roles as a director.	
	You recognize that the services to be performed by you under the Agreement are special, unique and extraordinary. The parties
	confirm that it is reasonably necessary for the protection of the Company's goodwill that you agree, and accordingly, you do hereby
	agree and covenant, that during your term as director, you will not, directly or indirectly, except for the benefit of the Company:




	 






	i.


	become an officer, director, more than 2% stockholder, partner, associate, employee, owner, proprietor,
	agent, creditor, independent contractor, co-venturer or otherwise, or be interested in or associated with any other corporation,
	firm or business engaged in the same or any similar business competitive with that of the Company (including the Company's present
	and future subsidiaries and affiliates) (the "Business"); or




	 






	ii.


	solicit, cause or authorize, directly or indirectly, to be solicited for or on behalf of himself
	or third parties from parties who were customers of the Company (including its present and future subsidiaries and affiliates)
	at any time during your term, any business similar to the business transacted by the Company with such customer; or




	 






	iii.


	accept or cause or authorize, directly or indirectly, to be accepted for or on behalf of your or
	third parties, business from any such customers of the Company (including its present and future subsidiaries and affiliates);
	or




	 






	iv.


	solicit, or cause or authorize, directly or indirectly, to be solicited for employment for or on
	behalf of you or third parties, any persons who were at any time during your term hereunder, employees of the Company (including
	its present and future subsidiaries and affiliates); or




	 






	v.


	employ or cause or authorize, directly or indirectly, to be employed for or on behalf of yourself
	or third parties, any such employees of the Company (including its present and future subsidiaries and affiliates); or




	 






	vi.


	use the tradenames, trademarks, or trade dress of any of the products of the Company (including
	its present and future subsidiaries and affiliates); or any substantially similar tradename, trademark or trade dress likely to
	cause, or having the effect of causing, confusion in the minds of manufacturers, customers, suppliers and retail outlets and the
	public generally.




	 


	You acknowledge the intention that
	the Company shall have the broadest possible protection of the value of its business consistent with public policy, and it will
	not violate the intent of the parties if any court should determine that, consistent with established precedent of the forum state,
	the public policy of such state requires a more limited restriction in geographical area or duration of the aforesaid covenant
	not to compete, contained in an appropriate decree.


	 







	c)




	Except as permitted in this Agreement or as approved by the Company,
	you will not (i) use any Confidential Information (as defined below) or (ii) disseminate or in any way disclose the Confidential
	Information to any person, firm, business or governmental agency or department. You may use the Confidential Information to perform
	your Duties for the benefit of Company. You shall treat all Confidential Information with the same degree of care as you accord
	to your own confidential information, but in no case shall you use less than reasonable care. You shall immediately give notice
	to Company of any unauthorized use or disclosure of the Confidential Information. You shall assist Company in remedying any the
	unauthorized use or disclosure of the Confidential Information. You agree not to communicate any information to Company in violation
	of the proprietary rights of any third party.

	b)

	you will not, directly or indirectly, except for the benefit of the Company:




	 






	i.


	become an officer, director, more than 2% stockholder, partner, associate, employee, owner, proprietor,
	agent, creditor, independent contractor, co-venturer or otherwise, or be interested in or associated with any other corporation,

	iii.

	third parties, business from any such customers of the Company (including its present and future subsidiaries and affiliates);
	or




	 






	iv.


	solicit, or cause or authorize, directly or indirectly, to be solicited for employment for or on
	behalf of you or third parties, any persons who were at any time during your term hereunder, employees of the Company (including

	public generally.




	 


	You acknowledge the intention that
	the Company shall have the broadest possible protection of the value of its business consistent with public policy, and it will
	not violate the intent of the parties if any court should determine that, consistent with established precedent of the forum state,
	the public policy of such state requires a more limited restriction in geographical area or duration of the aforesaid covenant
	not to compete, contained in an appropriate decree.


	 







	c)




	Except as permitted in this Agreement or as approved by the Company,
	you will not (i) use any Confidential Information (as defined below) or (ii) disseminate or in any way disclose the Confidential
	Information to any person, firm, business or governmental agency or department. You may use the Confidential Information to perform
	your Duties for the benefit of Company. You shall treat all Confidential Information with the same degree of care as you accord
	to your own confidential information, but in no case shall you use less than reasonable care. You shall immediately give notice
	to Company of any unauthorized use or disclosure of the Confidential Information. You shall assist Company in remedying any the
	unauthorized use or disclosure of the Confidential Information. You agree not to communicate any information to Company in violation
	of the proprietary rights of any third party.
