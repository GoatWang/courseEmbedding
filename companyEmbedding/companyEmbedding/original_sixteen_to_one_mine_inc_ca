The EPA limits arsenic in tap water to 10 parts per billion. But levels of this metal may be up to 100 times higher in well water in some areas of the country. Even so, an arsenic level as high as 1,000 parts per billion may not be something to get upset about. Arsenic has actually been approved in high dilution as a safe homeopathic remedy in the U.S. for decades with no ill effects.
 But if testing shows your well water contains dangerous levels of arsenic, you should take measures to decontaminate it via aeration or reverse osmosis.

Just wondered if anyone was following the horrible mistake that the EPA performed in Colorado when trying to clean up an old mine.  Instead of blaming the EPA (who admitted fault), the L.A. Times had a headline that had something to do with "the problem of hard rock gold mines".  

 Props to the crew of the 16 to 1 over the years in dealing with this type of negative portrayal, which is pretty much nonstop in California.

Electric power was lost Friday in our area due to high wind more than rain.  Alleghany was last to get it back, sometime early this morning. I opened my email and read the two following letters. Though it is news worthy.

 From the California district Attorney�s office: Hi Klaus.  The Board approved the settlement in closed session today, and the Executive Officer signed the Stipulated Judgment.  I�ve attached a fully executed copy, and I�ll send the original to the Court.

 From Klaus, Company attorney: Hi Mike: The settlement is done � see below.  You�ve dodged a potentially fatal bullet for the Mine, but now have the headache of finding the money for monthly payments until you find that big pocket of gold to finally pay everyone off!

 Sierra County superior Court scheduled a court appearance dater on February 27, 2015 at 8:30 am for a hearing on the settlement.  Other people are happier about this settlement than I.  Perhaps additional revelations will better inform the regulators in California that there are reasons why California was rated as the lowest state in the union for its regulation enforcement against business.  On the positive side of these matters, the Chicken Little advocates and doomsday criers have bent their pic.  Our governments with elected, appointed and advocates must stand back and look at the positive environmental results that have occurred.  Remember the Cayuga River in Cleveland on fire?  I do and was there on a visit.  We�ve come a long way.  I just think some people need to bitch!

Remember discussing the water permitting process and the public meeting to be held?  It will take place Thursday February 5, 2015 at 10:30am.  The staff proposed a permit with significant reductions in testing, which relates to less costly a process. Water is a hot topic in California.  Last January was the driest January recorded.  San Francisco had zero rain. Sacramento had .01 of an inch.  Alleghany did better but not by much.

 California and all states must meet federal water standards. States may write more restrictive regulations up to a point.  California is one of those states.  You may remember that after a national review, five states rated a �F� for hostilities towards business via regulations.  Only one state got an �F� minus.  Yes, it was my home state, California.  This is not something our governments should be proud of or gloat about.  I believe that changes are occurring. The pendulum swung beyond reason and may be moving towards a healthier environment for our state.  Working with the staff over the past two years is better than working with staff in 1998, 2003 and 2008, when the permits were reviewed.  I remain argumentative about two areas that seem to be in conflict.  We have fifteen minutes to make our Sixteen to One points to the Board.

 Below is my response to a new mandatory requirement called an Infeasibility Analysis.  It will be discussed on Thursday.




                                                February 2, 2015
 Gayleen Perreira
 Senior Water Resources Control Engineer
 NPDES Permitting
 Sacramento Office

 An infeasibility Analysis for Original Sixteen to One Mine, Inc. (Company) for underground water leaving an old adit named the 21 tunnel is speculative to evaluate as to complying with the revised limits for drinking water by the federal government.  The Company spent much time and money with various suggested methods for public water districts, private water systems and home owner drinking water to reduce arsenic in drinking water.  The results caused discoloration and the release of iron into the water.  Site conditions contributed to these results.  The discharge is remote, difficult to access in winter and inches above the intermittent Kanaka Creek during normal seasons.

 With the assistance of the California Water Boards, the Company will continue to explore and test methods to reduce the level of natural arsenic to or below the federal level for drinking water.  Here are four ways:  (a) introduction of additional water for dilution; (b) pump water for irrigation; (c) identify abnormal isolated influx of arsenic and treat underground; (d) locate natural runoff underground at higher elevations and eliminated flow into Kanaka Creek.

 It is believed that the water sources are directly the result of storm water seeping into fractures very close to the old tertiary gravel contact with bedrock.  This area has been inaccessible for over eighty years.  An exploratory expedition through old workings will be considered as a possibility to catch the water before it enters the 35 miles of underground levels.  Perhaps an area of highly mineralized arsenopyrite will be found and can be isolated from surface water runoff, thereby eliminating native arsenic entering surface water.

 The Company estimates that two years are required to explore the actual property in order to establish the best management practice for a reduction of arsenic.  The Company will continue to explore the scientific or technological industries for a better solution than those known today.  Considering the various paths to follow, it is reasonable to expect a significant process that will permanently bring the Company�s property in compliance within drinking water standards, if required, will occur before or in 2020.

 Michael Meister Miller,
 President

Please take note to read the entries under this topic back to 10/20/14 at 3:41PM.

 Reply to Fred:  Anyone can comment.  The only questionable over limit element is arsenic.  Your question about sorely needed water makes sense, common sense.  Unfortunately California�s regulatory situation in 2014 is illogical, outdated.  Years ago when the environment was under attack from growth, drastic changes were necessary.  The California legislature and executive agency leaders are too preoccupied to bring necessary environmental revisions.  The levels of arsenic threaten no animal life.  The loss of an important industry (gold extraction) threatens Americans.

 I just finished a phone conference with Central Water Quality staff regarding the tentative permit.  They were very helpful.  Now it is the American public�s turn to help.  What happens in Alleghany pushes an unpopular agenda.  Every shareholder has will be affected by these over-reaching state or federal requirements.  I encourage your notification to others and taking the opportunity and time to move our country in a positive direction.  It is our choice.

 Here is what I learned about �designated parties�.  Letters will be reviewed by an executive committee with a lawyer. The request must explain the basis for status as a designated party and in particular how the person is directly affected by the discharge.  If you read this website and are not a shareholder, you can still qualify.  There are always letters from environmental individuals and groups lobbying the water board to thrash productive people (ranchers, farmers, loggers, miners, manufacturers).  I know of some who are pathetic souls.  Objection in favor of the environment pumps a low ego.  Facts and evidence don�t matter.  It is not necessary for you to attend the meeting.  Letters from all designated parties will go to board members in advance of the meeting.  I hope there are hundreds.  The water staff has a direct email address for designated party requests, which I will post as soon as I receive it.  

 I will present evidence to the Board that the presumed adverse effects of the ground water are overstated.  It is important to point out that the property owner does not treat or impact the quality of the water flowing through its land.  This is an unavoidable situation.  We could be pear farmers growing in Alleghany.  Would the pear farmer be required to obtain a water permit and conduct numerous water analyses?  A logical response to water regulators is to ask, why doesn�t every parking lot land owner test the water runoff and pay a permit fee?  Perhaps it is our business, mining.  The existence of the Sixteen to One mine causes zero nuisance or harm to all beneficial users of water.  The law regulating waters in America were passed to protect water, a vital element for life.  I support responsible enforcement of governmental regulations.  Anything you can do helps overcome ignorance from otherwise smart and informed people.

Michael,

 I have a couple of questions about this.

 First of all, if we do not live in California, how can we help?  I would want to do what I can anyways.

 The second question I have is what kind of contaminants, if any, are in the water in the deepest part of the mine?

 I keep hearing and reading about this devastating drought and water shortages  in the state.  Then something occurred to me.  With water in short supply, wouldn�t this be a good time to �dewater� the mine down to the 3,200-foot level?  Maybe that water could be sorely needed downstream as long as there are no contaminants in it.  Unfortunately, I am not a hydrologist so maybe I�m way off base here.

 What do you think?

 Regards,
 Fred M. Cain

It sounds like the water regulators have a desk, but not enough useful work to justify their pay.  Accordingly they unwittingly overreach and make trouble.  To other bureaucrats this looks like they are actually working.  This is a widespread problem in all levels of government.

HELP  HELP  HELP  HELP �If you can find the time.

 The Notice of Public Hearing below has significant meaning for the Sixteen to One mine and all the gold mines in the Western United States.  Before any gold mining occurred, the earth  formed mineral rich deposits.  An associate element to gold is arsenic. Arsenic is broadly distributed and has positive effects on life.  It is also a killer in heavy concentrations. Few of these are in inorganic mineral-rich lands. While I have done a great deal of research and held numerous discussions with California�s water staff about the regulations impacting our important industry, their adjustment in attitudes remains marginal, when it comes to a permit for operating.  YOU CAN HELP!  


 Read the notice below and take special interest in the paragraph below �The designated parties for this hearing are as follows:�.   Please apply to become a designated party.  Many businesses are closing or driven from California.  The world knows California has the most egregious unfriendly arbitrary, unnecessary, unreasonable and at times unlawful regulations in the United States.  


 The major work of preparing a permit falls on the shoulders of the water staff.  The heavy players in perpetuating the injustices that have occurred to the sixteen to One mine and many others both in the mining business and non-mining businesses is well documented.  The heavy hand of what�Fear? Cowards? Bully? Greed? Stupidity? Jealousy? Ignorance? Disinterest? Laziness? Rests with the politicians and their appointed Boards.  The decision regarding the classification of ground water passing through our property will be given to the California Regional Water Quality Control Board Central Valley Region in February.  The PUBLIC must send notice of participation by November 3, 2014 no later than 5pm in writing.

 Instruction are in the Public Notice following this entry.  I offer suggestions  but recommend you read this topic for background of the issues.  People unfamiliar with the Sixteen to One should have an interest in just what is taking place in California.  It might be taking place in your state as well.  I�m not saying that the regulators are evil, bad or any of the fear, greed etc. cited above.  Maybe it is apathy or a lack of motivation to change and correct misguided behavior.  You can contact me as well.  I will be writing more this week on ideas.  MMM

 Excellent presentation, I couldn't agree with you more. 

 The world's best learning and projecting computer run by Martin Armstrong stated on April of this year, 2013, the backs of the entrenched politicians has been broken. The transition to, hopefully, much better ones will be back dropped with much screaming and yelling from them as they reach out and attack the people during this period of their demise.

 During the period the excessive amount of  government employees will significantly be sized down and my guess is the revenue collecting ones will go last which could be
 the regulators. Government has imploded itself at its own hands as they regularly do. These guys don't have hardly anything under control, mostly everything is out-of-control and they won't tell you but know it if they are smart. Some of them actually believe their own BS which makes them dangerous to us.

 Get ready because "Squeeze The People" will be their mantra until they get kicked out of office.

Mike has a good point.  Regulators are gonna regulate, it could be as simple as that.

 Sacramento has become a bloated, fat, and out of control myriad of too many agencies, boards, commissions, working groups, departments, bureaus, and their ilk.  There are a lot of middle manager types that have to strive to come up with new rules and regulations in order to justify their own department and/or job security. If they do not constantly come up with new nonsensical preposterous ideas they might get downsized or merged into another entity.  

 Why do they do this?  BECAUSE THEY CAN.  The only real power they have is their ability to say NO, and they use it as much as possible.

 How to solve the issue?  I have no idea - but it may help to find someone who is very familiar with the upper-level State procedures and process.  This individual would understand the inner workings of State bureaucracy and how to work with it, and not necessarily against it.

Michael,

 I still tend to think that there might indeed be some pro-business editors at the Wall Street Journal who might be interested in your story.  I have subscribed to the WSJ for years and have often seen things like this published.

 Just recently they had an article on the California water crisis.  The farmers aren't getting enough irrigation water because some kind of turbines in the dams are threatening some kind of small fish on the endangered species list.

 I really and truly believe you have a great story that illustrates how our system has run amok.

Yes, there are paths to take to rid not only the Sixteen from unwarranted duress but enlighten our much needed public agencies to view the surroundings they regulate in a 21st century manner.  Unfortunately, I cannot identify the most effective path to dispose of the problem. 

 My answer to your question is for all those aware of the issues is:THINK HARD INSIDE  AND OUTSIDE THE BOX.

Your theories have merit.   Many informed or casually curious people are confused about the nature of the legal problem we face.  Who is driving this corrupt legal claim for $2 million in damages to Californians?  What groups maintain, advocate and see social progress by shutting down our resource industries?  

 The issue is not arsenic pollution and degradation to the environment of Kanaka Creek.  Kanaka Creek is as healthy as most high Sierra Nevada Mountain water courses.  Those polluted are due to human waste from too much poop or industrial toxic waste unnatural to the surroundings.  So what are the issues driving our Sacramento government employees to sue Original Sixteen to One Mine, Inc. for $2,000,000?  

 I believe it was driven by angry or jealous or guilty or ignorant or malicious or arrogant individuals both working at the water agencies or not.  Their actions are in the past and date back to 1993.  But this is 2013, and the claims of legal misbehavior were filed in Sierra County Superior Court May of 2009.  

 My theory has merit.  There is a serious problem in California�s execution of the law.  I am sure that some individuals now employed in Sacramento realize that pursuing this claim for $2 million is not right, not good behavior or even beneficial to Californians.  But they may suffer job relate economic consequences if expressing this view. 

 They should be saying, �Wow, something is wrong here.  Yes, thirteen monthly reports were not filed, but this defendant should not have been required to perform those 1,400 tests per year.  The reason for the initial requirement was due to the milling of ore, which produced a waste product.  Once the mill ceased operation in 1998, the testing requirements should have been reduced to meet the actual circumstances at the mine site.  Not only did my fellow water bureaucrats fail to adjust the testing in 1998, but they failed to adjust the requirement in the following two permit renewals (2003 and 2008).  They fucked up and now I am asked to protect their errors.�

 So the problem is:  how can a poorly reasoned lawsuit be set aside if you work as a governmental public servant.  For this result, I visited Governor Jerry Brown and met with one of his chief advisers.  I also made myself available to the Chairman of the Water Board and staff.  I do not suggest that all public servants realize the mistake and want to settle this aggression.  I feel that those I spoke with sensed the inequity of the law, its definition and more, but nothing has changed!

 Those angry or jealous or guilty or ignorant or malicious or arrogant individuals smell the blood of a wounded wolf.  So I am asking you to find the mechanism to stop these predators and aid those who know this lawsuit is wrong.  Will the wolf survive? Ask Los Lobos.  Let's address the causes and call them out.  Let�s expose this inane behavior and allow them to say, �Well, a mistake was made.  I for one want to correct it.  Set aside this lawsuit right now.�

OVERVIEW

On November 6, 2000, Mark Raymond Fussell, miner, age 36, was fatally injured when his head struck the lip of a protruding ore chute while he was operating a locomotive.

The root cause of the accident was the failure of the mine operator to install warning devices ahead of and at the chute to conspicuously mark the restricted clearance.  Failure to properly maintain the locomotive's speed controlling system was a contributing factor.
			
Fussell had 18 years of underground mining experience.  He was rehired by this company in August 2000 and had worked at the mine a total of one year and eight months.  He had received training in accordance with 30 CFR Part 48.

GENERAL INFORMATION

The Sixteen to One Mine, a multi-level underground gold mine, owned and operated by Original Sixteen to One Mine, Inc., was located one mile south of Alleghany, Sierra County, California.  Principal operating officials were Michael Miller, President; Charles Brown, Secretary; Scott K. Robertson, Treasurer; and Jonathan Farrell, Mine Manager.  The mine operated one, eight hour shift, five days a week.  Total employment was twenty two persons; eleven of which worked underground.   

Gold-bearing ore was drilled and blasted in stopes.  Broken ore was mucked into ore chutes.  The ore was loaded into rail cars, trammed by battery-operated locomotives to a rail-mounted skip at the level station, and hoisted to a storage pocket above the 800 level.  It was transported out of the mine by trains through an adit to a surface dump site.  The ore was separated by hand and a percentage was sold as specimen gold to various customers.  The remainder was processed in the mill and poured into ingots. 

The last regular inspection of this mine was conducted on August 15, 2000.  Another inspection was conducted following the accident investigation.

DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCIDENT

On the day of the accident, Mark Fussell (victim) telephoned Jonathan Farrell, mine manager, and informed him that he would be late reporting to work.  Fussell arrived at the mine between 7:30 a.m. and 8:00 a.m., and went to his assigned work area at the bottom of the 1777 Boll� raise located on the 1700 level.  Farrell met Fussell at the raise a short time later and told him that Vincent Kautz, miner, would be his partner for the day.  Farrell left the area and Fussell began securing a slusher at the top of the raise. 

At approximately 12:00 p.m., Kautz arrived and met Fussell at the bottom of the raise.  Fussell entered the raise and took measurements for timbers which were to be installed to secure the slusher.  After he finished measuring, he came down the raise and boarded the locomotive parked approximately three to six feet in front of the ore chute.    
Fussell planned on tramming the locomotive in reverse to a wood stockpile area for a distance of approximately 50 yards to obtain the needed timbers.  He asked Kautz if he wanted to ride to the timber stockpile on the rail car which was coupled to the rear of the locomotive.  Kautz declined and began to walk towards the stockpile.  Fussell then engaged the locomotive's controller and, as he backed the locomotive, his head struck the bottom corner of the chute.  Kautz heard a noise, looked back, and saw Fussell pinned between the locomotive's battery compartment and the chute lip.  Kautz ran to a nearby telephone, called for assistance, then returned to the accident site.  He pushed the locomotive out from under the chute and freed the unconscious victim.  Steve Sheppert, hoistman, arrived and began cardio-pulmonary resuscitation.  The victim was transported to the shaft station, hoisted to the 800 level, and transported out of the mine where local emergency response personnel attended to him.  Fussell was pronounced dead at the scene.  Death was attributed to blunt trauma to the head.

INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT

MSHA was notified of the accident on November 6, 2000, at 3:15 p.m., by a telephone call from Michael Miller, company president, to Lee Ratliff, district manager.  An investigation was started on the same day.  An order was issued pursuant to Section 103(k) of the Mine Act to ensure the safety of the miners.  An MSHA accident investigation team traveled to the mine, conducted an inspection of the accident site, interviewed miners, and reviewed appropriate training and work procedure documents.  The miners did not request, nor have, representation during the investigation.

DISCUSSION

�	The accident occurred on the 1700 level in the haulage drift below the 1777 Boll� raise.  The drift measured approximately 6� feet wide and 8 feet high.  One set of narrow gauge railroad tracks ran the length of the drift and they were in good condition.  The accident site was dry and level.  This area had been inactive for a period of time; however, work had commenced on this level the month preceding the accident when it was decided to mine the stope above the 1777 Boll� raise.   

�	The locomotive involved in this accident was a Mancha, Type B, Little Trammer.  It weighed approximately 3000 pounds with the batteries installed.  It was 48 inches high, 32 inches wide, and approximately five feet long.  When facing the operator's controls, the seat was to the right side.  A flatbed rail car was coupled to the locomotive at the time of the accident.  

�	The locomotive was positioned on the tracks so that the operator's seat was on the same side of the drift as the ore chutes.  The locomotive could be turned around to face the opposite direction which would have reduced the risk of an operator striking his head on a chute.  

�	The locomotive was powered by a series wound, direct current (DC) drive with three tramming speed contacts in both forward and reverse.  The contacts were initiated by a hand lever (drum controller) located to the right front of the operator when he was seated sideways on the machine.  When the lever was in the middle position, none of the contacts were engaged.  When the lever was rotated counter-clockwise, the three contacts for the reverse direction were engaged, one at a time, beginning with the lowest to the highest speed.  Rotating the lever in the clockwise direction engaged the contacts for forward travel.  

�	Contacts for first speed in the drum controller engaged but would not move the machine in either forward or reverse when tested by MSHA.  The contacts for second and third speed engaged properly.  The machine could only be moved by engaging second or third speed, which resulted in quicker acceleration and a jerking motion.  The locomotive accelerated faster in reverse than in forward.  The locomotive was in reverse at the time of the accident.  Dirt and carbon buildup was observed on the contacts, but did not play a role in the nonfunctional first speed.  After further investigation, it was concluded that a resistor bank between the controller and motor was defective or "open" thus rendering first speed inoperable.  It appeared to the investigators that this defective condition had existed for a period of time and that the locomotive's impact with the chute did not cause the resistor bank to fail.  No other safety defects were found on the machine.

�	The locomotive was equipped with a band brake attached to the end of the motor shaft.  The brake was in good condition and was controlled by a hand-operated lever located to the right of the operator's seat.  The lever was connected via linkage to the brake assembly.  The brake was tested by MSHA during the investigation.  When stationary, the locomotive would not move when the brake was set and engine power applied.  The brake also stopped the machine when it was applied while the machine was moving.  The brake had not been applied by the victim prior to the accident.

�	The bottom of the wooden ore chute involved in the accident was 50 inches above the rail and extended eight inches inside the west rail, almost to the center of the track.  This measurement meant that there was two inches of clearance between the top of the locomotive and the chute lip.  To safely clear this chute, an operator would have to completely duck inside the operator's compartment of the locomotive when the locomotive passed under it.  All other chutes on the 1700 level inspected by MSHA during the accident investigation had similar restricted clearances but did not extend as far out into the rails as the one involved in the accident.  Heights of these chutes above the rail were the same as the one involved in the accident. 

�	None of the chutes on the 1700 level had markings on them to warn miners on mobile equipment of the restricted clearance hazard.  Also, there were no warning signs in advance of any of these chutes to warn of upcoming restricted clearance hazards. 

�	It was evident to the investigators that the inoperative first speed and defective resistor bank had existed for a period of time.
 
CONCLUSION

The root cause of the accident was the failure of the mine operator to install warning devices in advance of and at the ore chute to conspicuously mark the restricted clearance.  The operator's failure to promptly correct the defective speed controlling system contributed to the accident.   

ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS

Original Sixteen to One Mine, Inc.

Order No. 7996015 was issued on November 6, 2000, under the provisions of Section 103(k) of the Mine Act:

A fatal accident occurred at this operation on November 6, 2000.  A miner was operating a battery motor when his head struck an ore chute.  This order is issued to assure the safety of persons at this operation until the affected area can be returned to normal operations as determined by an authorized representative of the Secretary.  The mine operator shall obtain approval from an authorized representative for all actions to recover equipment and/or return affected areas of the mine to normal.
Order No. 7996015 was terminated on November 28, 2000.  Conditions that contributed to the accident no longer exist and normal mining operations can resume. 

Citation No. 7995404 was issued on January 12, 2001, under the provisions of Section 104(a) of the Mine Act for a violation of 30 CFR 57.9306:

A miner was fatally injured at this mine on November 6, 2000, while operating a Mancha locomotive on the 1700 level, when his head struck a protruding ore chute causing it to become wedged between the battery compartment of the locomotive and the chute.  The chute extended into the drift to the midpoint of the train rails at approximately the same height as the locomotives operator's head.  Warning devices had not been installed in advance of the ore chute to indicate restricted clearance nor had the chute been conspicuously marked, nor marked at all, to warn and remind miners of the restricted clearance.

The citation was terminated when colored tape was placed to warn equipment operators of chute locations.  Additionally, the chute was modified so that locomotive operators can not contact it when operating a train.  

Citation No. 7995405 was issued on January 12, 2001, under the provisions of Section 104(a) of the Mine Act for a violation of 30 CFR 57.14100:

A miner was fatally injured at this mine on November 6, 2000, when he struck his head on an ore chute protruding into the drift at approximately head level, after he engaged the speed controller of the Mancha locomotive he was operating.  The locomotive had a clearly evident defect which had not been corrected in a timely manner to prevent a hazard to the miner.  Alternatively, the locomotive was not taken out of service and placed in a designated area posted for that purpose, nor was the vehicle tagged or other effective method of marking the defective items used to prohibit further use of the vehicle until the noticeable defect was corrected.

This defect was easily detectable during a pre-operational or other similar inspection.  It made continued operation hazardous to persons by causing the locomotive to be difficult to control at slow speeds or when starting from a stopped position.  The machine's speed controller first point of power (slow speed) to the drive motor was not functioning as designed; thus, the locomotive would not move until the second point of power was contacted, when it would then jump or lurch forward.
