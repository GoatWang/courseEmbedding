Orion Futures Fund
L.P.





Ladies and
Gentlemen:


          Orion
Futures Fund L.P. (formerly known as Citigroup Orion Futures Fund
L.P.) (the “Partnership”) is organized as a limited
partnership under the New York Revised Uniform Limited Partnership
Act, as amended (the “Partnership Act”), for the
purpose of speculative trading, either directly or indirectly, in
commodity interests including, but not limited to, futures
contracts, swaps, options, spot, and forward contracts. Citigroup
Global Markets Inc.’s predecessor entity, Salomon Smith
Barney Inc., the Partnership and Ceres Managed Futures LLC
(formerly known as Citigroup Managed Futures LLC), a Delaware
limited liability company (the “General Partner”), have
been parties to an amended and restated agency agreement dated
April 1, 2001 (the “Prior Agreement”). This Second
Amended and Restated Agency Agreement (the “Agreement”)
supersedes the Prior Agreement in all respects.


          The
General Partner desires to raise additional capital for the
Partnership by the continued sale of units of limited partnership
interest therein (the “Units”) to certain qualified
investors pursuant to Rule 506 of Regulation D
(“Reg. D”) under section 4(2) of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The General
Partner, the Partnership, the business of the Partnership and the
Units are described in a Private Placement Offering Memorandum and
Disclosure Document dated August 1, 2009, prepared by the
General Partner. As used in this Agreement,
“Memorandum” refers to that Private Placement Offering
Memorandum and Disclosure Document, including the appendices
thereto, unless such memorandum or appendices have been
supplemented or amended, in which case the term shall refer, from
and after the time the supplement or amendment is delivered to each
of you, to the memorandum and appendices as so amended and
supplemented. The commodity trading advisors to the Partnership are
currently AAA Capital Management Advisors, Ltd.,

 



 


Willowbridge
Associates Inc. and Winton Capital Management Limited. The General
Partner may engage different commodity trading advisors from time
to time on behalf of the Partnership.


          The
subscribers for Units will be required to execute the Subscription
Agreement, a copy of which is attached as an appendix to the
Memorandum, and to tender or cause to be tendered for each Unit
subscribed cash in the amount of the net asset value per Unit on
the date of purchase. Subscribers for Units whose Subscription
Agreements are accepted by the General Partner will become limited
partners of the Partnership (the “Limited Partners”)
upon the execution by the General Partner as attorney-in-fact for
each such subscriber of a Limited Partnership Agreement, as may be
amended and restated from time to time, a copy of which is attached
as an appendix to the Memorandum (the “Partnership
Agreement”), and at the time such subscribers’ names
are entered in the books and records of the Partnership.


          Section 1.
Appointment of Agent .


          On
the basis of the representations, warranties and covenants
contained in this Agreement, but subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in it, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC are hereby appointed non-exclusive
agents of the Partnership during the offering period specified in
this Section, for the purpose of finding subscribers for the Units
for the account and risk of the Partnership through a private
offering. The offering period will continue until the General
Partner terminates it (with reasonable advance notice) or until up
to 400,000 Units, or such additional duly authorized amount, have
been subscribed (the “Continuous Offering”). Units or
partial Units sold during the Continuous Offering will be sold at
net asset value per Unit as of the last day of each month, provided
that the General Partner may determine to not accept any offers to
purchase Units in a particular month. Subject to the performance by
the General Partner of all of its obligations to be performed under
this Agreement and to the completeness and accuracy of all material
representations and warranties of the General Partner contained in
this Agreement, you each hereby accept such agency and agree on the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement to use reasonable
efforts during the Continuous Offering to find subscribers for the
Units subject to market demand. Such offering of Units shall be
subject to prior approval in accordance with your internal
policies. Each of you agree that your agency under this Agreement,
which is coupled with an interest and, therefore, is not terminable
by the General Partner without your permission, will continue until
the termination of the Continuous Offering or until such time as
all Units sold by you have been redeemed, whichever is
later.





 


 


Section 2. Representations
and Warranties of the Partnership and the General Partner
.





          The
Partnership and the General Partner jointly and severally represent
and warrant to each of you, individually, for your benefit, and for
the benefit of the purchasers of the Units sold by you
that:


          (a) They
will deliver to you such number of copies of the Memorandum as you
may reasonably request, regardless of whether the Units are offered
solely to “accredited investors” as defined in Rule
501(a) of Reg. D. They will not make any amendment or

-2-



 


supplement to
the Memorandum until they have given you a copy thereof and
reasonable notice of the same, and no such amendment or supplement,
if material, will be made if you reasonably object
thereto.


          (b) The
Memorandum complies with Rule 502(b)(2) of Reg. D and the
information to be made available or furnished to each purchaser of
a Unit pursuant to Section 5(f) hereof or otherwise will be
sufficient to comply with Rule 502(b)(2)(iv) and 502(b)(2)(v)
of Reg. D.


          (c) The
Memorandum will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading.


          (d) All
action required under the Partnership Agreement or otherwise to be
taken by the General Partner before the subscription for and sale
of the Units to subscribers therefor has been taken or before the
Monthly Closing dates, as defined in Section 4 hereof, will
have been taken, and upon (i) payment of the consideration
therefor specified in the Subscription Agreement, (ii) acceptance
by the General Partner of each subscriber acceptable to the General
Partner, and (iii) the payment of any required filing fee, the
subscribers will become Limited Partners of the Partnership
entitled to all the rights of Limited Partners under the
Partnership Agreement and the Partnership Act. The Units, when sold
and paid for as contemplated by the Memorandum, will represent
validly authorized and duly issued limited partnership interests in
the Partnership and will conform to all statements relating thereto
contained in the Memorandum, including the Partnership Agreement.
The General Partner shall maintain records required of a registered
commodity pool operator pursuant to the rules of each of the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and the
National Futures Association.


          (e) The
Partnership is a limited partnership duly and validly organized
pursuant to the Partnership Agreement and the laws of New York, and
is validly existing under, and subject to, the laws of New York
with full power and authority to conduct the business in which it
proposes to engage as described in the Memorandum. A Limited
Partner will have no liability in excess of his capital
contribution and his share of Partnership assets and undistributed
profits except as set forth in Section 7(f)(2) of the
Partnership Agreement and in the Partnership Act.


          (f) There
is no action, suit, litigation or proceeding before or by any court
or governmental agency, federal, state or local, pending or
threatened against or affecting or involving the property or
business of the General Partner, or the business of the
Partnership, that would materially and adversely affect the
condition (financial or otherwise), business or prospects of the
General Partner or the Partnership.


          (g) Other
than as previously disclosed to you that Credit Suisse Securities
(USA) LLC is a selling agent for the Partnership, neither the
Partnership, the General Partner, nor any person directly or
indirectly affiliated with either of them has, either directly or
through an agent, sold or offered for sale or solicited offers to
subscribe for or buy, or approached potential investors for or
otherwise negotiated in respect of, the Units except for the
activities of the General Partner in approaching potential
investors undertaken in cooperation with Citigroup

Global Markets
Inc. and Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC after advance consultation
with either Citigroup Global Markets Inc. or Morgan Stanley Smith
Barney LLC, as applicable; and neither the Partnership, the General
Partner nor any person directly or indirectly affiliated with any
of them has, either directly or through an agent, participated in
the organization or management of any partnership or other entity,
or has engaged in any other activity, in a manner or under
circumstances that would jeopardize the status of the offering of
the Units as an exempted transaction under the Securities Act or
under the laws of any state in which it is represented by the
General Partner that the offering may be made.


          (h) This
Agreement and the Partnership Agreement have been duly and validly
authorized, executed and delivered by and on behalf of the General
Partner and constitute valid and binding agreements of the General
Partner enforceable in accordance with their terms. This Agreement
and the Subscription Agreements have been or will be duly and
validly authorized, executed and delivered by and on behalf of the
Partnership and constitute or will constitute valid and binding
agreements of the Partnership enforceable in accordance with their
terms.


          (i) The
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Subscription
Agreements and the Partnership Agreement, and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated in this Agreement and in the
Memorandum, do not conflict with and will not constitute a breach
of, or default under, the certificate of formation or limited
liability company agreement of the General Partner or any agreement
or instrument by which the General Partner is bound by any order,
rule or regulation applicable to it of any court or any
governmental body or administrative agency having jurisdiction over
it.


          (j) A
separate escrow account has been opened at Citibank N.A., New York,
New York (the “Escrow Agent”) and will be maintained
for all funds received from subscribers for Units. All payments
received from persons desiring to purchase Units will be deposited
in such account and held in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement entered into with the Escrow Agent. During the Continuous
Offering, the General Partner may elect to hold subscription
proceeds at a different bank. If the General Partner elects to hold
subscription proceeds at a different bank, it will notify you
promptly and provide you with details of the new
account.


          Section 3.
Representations and Warranties of Citigroup Global Markets Inc.
and Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC .


          Each
of you represent and warrant, individually, to and for the benefit
of the Partnership and the General Partner that:


          (a) You
will not offer or sell the Units by any form of general
solicitation or general advertising within the meaning of Rule
502(c) of Reg. D.


          (b) Where
required by applicable state law or regulation, you will initiate
contact with a prospective offeree only after determining that the
suitability and sophistication standards described in the
Memorandum are likely to be satisfied with respect to such
prospective offeree

and, where
applicable, only after having obtained an executed Purchaser
Representative Questionnaire.


          (c) You
will make offers to sell Units to, or solicit offers to subscribe
for Units from, persons in only those states or other jurisdictions
where the General Partner has either qualified or registered the
offering for sale or where the General Partner has determined that
an exemption from such qualification or registration is available
under the applicable securities or “blue sky” statutes
of such states or oth

If an individual or company (''agent'') agrees to act upon behalf of another organization or person (''the principal''), then an agency agreement is typically used. This document gives the agent the authority to act in the principal's interests. It also covers the nature of the relationship between the two parties, including information on when the agency agreement is terminated and responsibilities of the agent, plus compensation for the action.

Additional information that may be present in the document can include territory the agent may represent, trademark information, insurance protection and indemnification. If the agent were to incur expenses while acting as an agent, the agreement typically includes how they should be handled and other terms. Other topics one may include in the document are terms concerning records, taxes, warranties and state of governing law.

An agency agreement is a document that clearly states and defines the relationship between the parties, and protects both of their interests. Without drawing up the agreement, the agent may not be aware of the scope of their abilities. It is often used in the medical field, such as between a drug representative and the medication manufacturer.

GM is considering producing more trucks and SUVs while killing off six slow-selling models produced at underused car plants such as Hamtramck in Michigan and Lordstown in Ohio. It's unclear if the plants will start producing newer, more popular models. GM has cut shifts at several of its U.S. plants as inventories of small and midsized cars grow. If GM stopped producing the six models under consideration, it wouldn't happen until 2020.

Seeing as employee hourly wages and benefit costs are on the rise, as are costs to open new locations, a stubborn downtrend in sales is very unwelcome.
