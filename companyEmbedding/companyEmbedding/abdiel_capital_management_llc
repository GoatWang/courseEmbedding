A smart product management hub for retailthat streamlines digital content and data sharing






 





















Our mission
 
We have made it our mission to provide brands and retailers simple and affordable tools that tackle many challenges in digital product management and distribution by:













Solving the practical challenge of organizing, sourcing, and sharing product content.









Giving brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed ecommerce data and analytics
















Take control of your products with Plytix
 









Our Story
 
The idea for Plytix evolved from our time at Google, when we were working with some of the biggest companies in the e-commerce space. At the time, technology allowed tracking user behaviour on individual websites, but we wanted to give brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed data, bringing them a better understanding of their products through 3rd party product analytics. 
 
Since then Plytix has evolved into an end-to-end product management eco-system where brands and retailers can organize, analyze, and share product content and performance in a user-friendly and efficient way without breaking the bank. 
 




























Our Team
 
We're a diverse, international team passionate about creating extraordinary client experiences and serious about revolutionizing e-commerce. We are growing rapidly and we're always on the look out for smart, driven people to join our team. 
 
Get a closer look on  LinkedIn and Instagram.

 What Abdiel does
Abdiel generally invests in publicly traded companies that are likely to gain market share over long time periods. We prefer businesses that have recurring revenue and that are managed by people with a large share of their net worth in the stock. Our ten largest investments frequently comprise more than 75% of invested capital. We started in 2006.
 



What we want for our investors
Returns that are good on an absolute basis and that outperform the market, measured over 3-5 years.
How we value companies
We estimate the return a company’s cash flows would deliver to someone who bought the entire business at the available stock price and held it permanently.
What we look for “under the hood” of companies
The same thing we look for in our own. Leaders who care viscerally about the quality of the products they sell. A corporate culture in which people thrive. Coincidence or not, in our experience we make more money with companies we admire than with those we don’t.

What we want for the people who work at Abdiel
We look for unusually smart people for whom research is fun. We want to alter their trajectories, so that they live bigger lives than if they had gone to work somewhere else.
What we want Abdiel to add to the world
Work done well and with pleasure. The craftsman is a better person for his efforts, and so is anyone who notices. Moreover, good investment analysis helps companies raise the world’s standard of living. Enterprises work best when they have access to capital priced to reflect the value they can create. Index funds, by the way, do not price capital; they only mimic the actions of those who do.

A smart product management hub for retailthat streamlines digital content and data sharing






 





















Our mission
 
We have made it our mission to provide brands and retailers simple and affordable tools that tackle many challenges in digital product management and distribution by:













Solving the practical challenge of organizing, sourcing, and sharing product content.









Giving brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed ecommerce data and analytics
















Take control of your products with Plytix
 









Our Story
 
The idea for Plytix evolved from our time at Google, when we were working with some of the biggest companies in the e-commerce space. At the time, technology allowed tracking user behaviour on individual websites, but we wanted to give brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed data, bringing them a better understanding of their products through 3rd party product analytics. 
 
Since then Plytix has evolved into an end-to-end product management eco-system where brands and retailers can organize, analyze, and share product content and performance in a user-friendly and efficient way without breaking the bank. 
 




























Our Team
 
We're a diverse, international team passionate about creating extraordinary client experiences and serious about revolutionizing e-commerce. We are growing rapidly and we're always on the look out for smart, driven people to join our team. 
 
Get a closer look on  LinkedIn and Instagram.
