Risks of Investment
Please note that alternative investments can involve significant risk.  An investment that the Investment Manager makes on behalf of any SMA may be speculative and entails substantial risks, including the fact that such an investment could be illiquid and be subject to significant restrictions on transferability.  Past performance does not guarantee future results or profitability. 
Financial instruments and investment opportunities that the Investment Manager may enter into on behalf of SMAs discussed or referenced herein may not be suitable for all persons, and potential investors must make an independent assessment of the appropriateness of any agreement in light of their own objectives and circumstances, including the possible risk and benefits of entering into such an agreement.
An investor in an SMA could lose all or a substantial amount of his or her investment.  Returns generated from an investment in an SMA may not adequately compensate investors for the business and financial risks assumed.  While each SMA is subject to market risks common to other types of investments, including market volatility, Millennium may employ certain trading techniques, such as the use of leverage and other speculative investment practices that may increase the risk of investment loss.  The products and strategies in which the Investment Manager expects to cause the SMAs to invest may involve above-average risk.

Risks of Investment
Please note that alternative investments can involve significant risk.  An investment that the Investment Manager makes on behalf of any SMA may be speculative and entails substantial risks, including the fact that such an investment could be illiquid and be subject to significant restrictions on transferability.  Past performance does not guarantee future results or profitability. 
Financial instruments and investment opportunities that the Investment Manager may enter into on behalf of SMAs discussed or referenced herein may not be suitable for all persons, and potential investors must make an independent assessment of the appropriateness of any agreement in light of their own objectives and circumstances, including the possible risk and benefits of entering into such an agreement.
An investor in an SMA could lose all or a substantial amount of his or her investment.  Returns generated from an investment in an SMA may not adequately compensate investors for the business and financial risks assumed.  While each SMA is subject to market risks common to other types of investments, including market volatility, Millennium may employ certain trading techniques, such as the use of leverage and other speculative investment practices that may increase the risk of investment loss.  The products and strategies in which the Investment Manager expects to cause the SMAs to invest may involve above-average risk.

The 2015 Hedge Fund Rising Stars: Brian Kelly

							At Millennium Management, Smith Barney alumnus Kelly leads the $30.1 billion hedge fund firm’s marketing push into wealth management.
						







In 2007, at age 30, Brian Kelly was co-managing a sales and
    marketing team for Smith Barney, the private banking arm of
    Citigroup; this unit of more than 20 focused on selling
    alternative investments to the Smith Barney network and client
    base. As a kid in Queens, the son of a New York City fireman
    and an administrative assistant had always been drawn to the
    world of finance and business. While attending Long
    Islands Hofstra University, where he majored in finance
    with a minor in economics, he interned on Wall Street during
    his junior year and took a full-time role at Smith Barney in
    his senior year, finishing college at night. When Kelly joined
    the firm in 1999, he started in alternative investing as a
    point person between hedge funds, venture capital, private
    equity and other alternative-investment funds and the
    firms individual wealth advisers. As the hedge fund
    industry grew and became more important to banks, his place at
    Smith Barney changed. By 2008, Kelly was working under Citi
    Alternative Investments, selling internal and external funds.
    When Citi and Morgan Stanley merged their brokerage divisions
    in 2009, with Morgan Stanley taking the controlling stake, he
    moved over with the business. In 2010, however, after little
    more than a year at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, he decided to
    join New Yorkbased hedge fund firm Millennium Management.
    Kelly had come to know John Novogratz, $30.1 billion
    Millenniums global head of marketing and investor
    relations, who hired him, and Kelly knew the firm well. Since
    2008, Millennium, founded and run by 
    Israel (Izzy) Englander, had been seeking to build up and
    diversify its client base. Kelly, 37, heads the wealth
    management effort in addition to working with some family
    offices and 
    registered investment advisers.
