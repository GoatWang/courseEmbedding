The editors and international collection of             authors explore the trends in organic meats and how the meat             industry is impacted. Commencing with chapters on the             economics, market and regulatory aspects of organic meats,             coverage then extends to management issues for organically             raised and processed meat animals. Processing, sensory and             human health aspects are covered in detail, as are the             incidences of foodborne pathogens in organic beef, swine,             poultry and other organic meat species. The book concludes by             describing pre-harvest control measures for assuring the             safety of organic meats.          Organic Meat Production and Processing serves as a             unique resource for fully understanding the current and             potential issues associated with organic meats.
