History[edit]




Crowding customers in 1947


Nathan's began as a nickel hot dog stand in Coney Island in 1916 and bears the name of co-founder Nathan Handwerker (June 14, 1892 – March 24, 1974),[3][4] who started the business with his wife, Ida Handwerker, née Ida Greenwald.[4][5][6] Ida created the hot dog recipe they used, and Ida's grandmother created the secret spice recipe.[5]
Jewish immigrant Handwerker arrived in New York City in 1912[4] and soon found work at the Coney Island, Brooklyn, restaurant Feltman's German Gardens.[7] By one account, he was encouraged by singing waiters Eddie Cantor and Jimmy Durante to go into business in competition with Feltman's; as United Press International noted in 1974, "There are many stories about Nathan and how the business began, but this is the way he told it..."[7] The company's official history does not mention the future stars' encouragement.[5] Nathan and Ida spent their life savings of $300 to begin the business.[4]
Handwerker undercut Feltman's by charging five cents for a hot dog when his former employer was charging 10 cents.[7] At a time when food regulation was in its infancy and the pedigree of the hot dog particularly suspect, Handwerker ensured that men wearing surgeon's smocks were seen eating at his stand to reassure potential customers.[8] The business proved immensely popular.[9]
The expansion of the chain was overseen by Nathan Handwerker's son, Murray Handwerker.[6][10] A second branch on Long Beach Road in Oceanside, New York, opened in 1959, and another debuted in Yonkers, New York, in 1965. Murray Handwerker was named the president of Nathan's Famous in 1968,[10] the year the company went public.[6]
All locations were sold by the Handwerker family to a group of private investors in 1987,[10] at which point Nathan's was franchised and a great number of establishments were opened around New York City and beyond. In the 1990s, the company acquired Kenny Rogers Roasters and Miami Subs Grill, both of which were later divested.




Nathan's original Coney Island location


As of September 2001[update], the company consisted of 24 company-owned units, 380 franchised or licensed units and more than 1,400 stores in 50 states, Guam, the District of Columbia and 17 foreign countries, including Kandahar Airfield, Afghanistan. One unit was lost due to the collapse of Two World Trade Center in the 9/11 attacks.
International master franchise agreements were signed (circa 2006) with Egypt and Israel.[11] The company also owns the exclusive co-branding rights to the Arthur Treacher's Fish and Chips chain.[12]
On March 28, 2017, it was announced that Nathan's Famous had reached a sponsorship deal with Major League Baseball, allowing the company to market itself as the official hot dog brand of the league. While Nathan's is already the official hot dog brand of the New York Mets, New York Yankees, Miami Marlins, and St. Louis Cardinals (the sponsorship does not restrict teams from making similar deals with competitors), the deal marked the first time that Major League Baseball had named an official hot dog sponsor.[13]
Original location[edit]
The original Nathan's hot dog stand still exists, as of 2016, on its original 1916 site.[14] Having been open for business every day, 365 days a year, the stand was forced to close on October 29, 2012, due to Hurricane Sandy. The shop re-opened six months later, on May 21,[15] [16] despite a small fire on May 4, 2013.[17] Service is provided year-round inside, and during the summer additional walk-up windows are opened to serve the larger seasonal crowds.
Hot-dog eating contest[edit]




Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest countdown clock


The Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest has been held at the original location on Coney Island since the early 1970s.[18] Contestants try to consume as many hot dogs as possible in 10 minutes. Winners include Takeru Kobayashi (2001–2006)[19] and Joey Chestnut (2008–2014) in July 2008, Chestnut tied Kobayashi after eating 59 HDB in 10 minutes. The tie resulted in a five hot-dog eat-off, which Chestnut won by consuming all five before Kobayashi.[19] Chestnut was beaten by Matt Stonie in 2015, but regained the title in 2016.[19] Chestnut also won the 2017 contest.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Introduction  We are engaged primarily in the marketing of the "Nathan's Famous" brand and the sale of products bearing the "Nathan's Famous" trademarks through several different channels of distribution. Historically, our business has been the operation and franchising of quick-service restaurants featuring Nathan's World Famous Beef Hot Dogs, crinkle-cut French-fried potatoes, and a variety of other menu offerings. Our Company-owned and franchised units operate under the name "Nathan's Famous," the name first used at our original Coney Island restaurant opened in 1916. Nathan's product licensing program began in 1978 by selling packaged hot dogs and other meat products to retail customers through supermarkets or grocery-type retailers for off-site consumption. During fiscal 1998, we introduced our Branded Product Program, which currently enables foodservice retailers and others to sell some of Nathan's proprietary products outside of the realm of a traditional franchise relationship. In conjunction with this program, purchasers of Nathan's products are granted a limited use of the Nathan's Famous trademark with respect to the sale of the purchased products, including Nathan's World Famous Beef Hot Dogs, certain other proprietary food items and paper goods. Our Branded Menu Program is a limited franchise program, under which foodservice operators may sell a greater variety of Nathan's Famous menu items than under the Branded Product Program.  Our revenues are generated primarily from selling products under Nathan's Branded Product Program, Restaurant operations consisting of Company-owned restaurants and franchising the Nathan's restaurant concept (including under the Branded Menu Program) and Product licensing agreements for the sale of Nathan's products within supermarkets and club stores, the manufacture of certain proprietary spices and the sale of Nathan's products directly to other foodservice operators. For further information please see Note K - Segment Information in the accompanying financial statements.  The following summary reflects the franchise openings and closings of the Nathan's franchise system for the fiscal years ended March 26, 2017, March 27, 2016, March 29, 2015, March 30, 2014 and March 31, 2013.   March 26, March 27, March 29, March 30, March 31, 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 Franchised restaurants operating at the beginning of the period 259 296 324 303 299 Franchised restaurants opened during the period 53 56 36 56 40 Franchised restaurants closed during the period (33 ) (93 ) (64 ) (35 ) (36 ) Franchised restaurants operating at the end of the period 279 259 296 324 303  At March 26, 2017, our franchise system consisted of 279 Nathan's franchised units located in 19 states, and 12 foreign countries. We also operate five Company-owned Nathan's units, including one seasonal location, within the New York metropolitan area.  As described in Risk Factors and other sections in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 26, 2017, our future results could be impacted by many developments. In March 2014, John Morrell & Co., a subsidiary of Smithfield Foods, Inc. became Nathan's exclusive licensee to manufacture and sell hot dogs, sausage and corned beef at retail. Our future operating results are substantially depended on our agreement with John Morrell & Co. There are also certain risks associated with engaging John Morrell & Co. as exclusive licensee including whether (i) we can maintain or improve the quality and consistency of our products that is expected by our customers, and (ii) John Morrell & Co. will have a sufficient supply of products available for our customers on a timely basis, as well as the risks described under "Risk Factors - - Our licensing revenue is substantially depended on our agreement with John Morrell & Co. and the loss or a significant reduction of this revenue would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations."  Our future operating results could be impacted by supply constraints on beef prices and/or increases in beef prices.  On March 10, 2015, we consummated a $135 million offering of Notes and subsequently paid a dividend of $25.00 per share (or approximately $116 million in the aggregate). As we consummated the Notes offering on March 10, 2015, we were only required to accrue interest expense for 20 days during fiscal 2015. In contrast, the full year impact of interest expense on net income has been reflected in our year end results for the periods ended March 27, 2016 and March 26, 2017. Our future results could also be impacted by our interest obligations under the Notes. As a result of the issuance of the Notes, Nathan's expects to incur interest expense of $13.5 million per annum and annual amortization of debt issuance costs of approximately $1,200,000. The Indenture governing the Notes imposes operating and other restrictions on us.  During the fiscal year ending March 26, 2017, we paid interest of $6,750,000 on each September 15, 2016 and March 15, 2017.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  Our consolidated financial statements and the notes to our consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to management's discussion and analysis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe the following critical accounting policies involve additional management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods, assumptions and estimates necessary in determining the related asset and liability amounts.  Revenue Recognition  Sales by Company-owned restaurants, which are typically paid in cash by the customer, are recognized at the point of sale. Sales are presented net of sales tax.  In connection with its franchising operations, Nathan's receives initial franchise fees, area development fees, royalties, and in certain cases, revenue from sub-leasing restaurant properties to franchisees.  Franchise and area development fees, which are typically received prior to completion of the revenue recognition process, are recorded as deferred revenue. Initial franchise fees, which are non-refundable, are recognized as income when substantially all services to be performed by Nathan's and conditions relating to the sale of the franchise have been performed or satisfied, which generally occurs when the franchised restaurant commences operations. The following services are typically provided by Nathan's prior to the opening of a franchised restaurant:  ? Approval of all site selections to be developed.  Development fees are nonrefundable and the related agreements require the franchisee to open a specified number of restaurants in the development area within a specified time period or the agreements may be canceled by the Company. Revenue from development agreements is deferred and shall be recognized, with an appropriate provision for estimated uncollectible amounts, when all material services or conditions to the sale have been substantially performed by the franchisor. If substantial obligations under the development agreement are not dependent on the number of individual franchise locations to be opened, substantial performance shall be determined using the same criteria applicable to an individual franchise, which is generally the opening of the first location pursuant to the development agreement. If substantial performance is dependent on the number of locations, then the development fee is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the agreement, as restaurants in the development area commence operations on a pro rata basis to the minimum number of restaurants required to be open, or at the time the development agreement is effectively canceled.  Nathan's recognizes franchise royalties on a monthly basis which are generally based upon a percentage of sales made by Nathan's franchisees, when they are earned and deemed collectible. Franchise fees and royalties that are not deemed to be collectible are not recognized as revenue until paid by the franchisee, or until collectability is deemed to be reasonably assured.  Nathan's recognizes revenue from its Branded Menu Program either upon its sale of hot dogs or royalty income when it has been determined that other qualifying products have been sold by the manufacturer to Nathan's Branded Menu Program franchisees.  Nathan's recognizes revenue from the Branded Product Program upon delivery to Nathan's customers via third party common carrier to Nathan's customers. Rebates to customers are recorded as a reduction to sales.  Revenue from sub-leasing properties is recognized as income as the revenue is earned and becomes receivable and deemed collectible. Sub-lease rental income is presented net of associated lease costs in the consolidated statements of earnings.  Nathan's recognizes revenue from royalties on the licensing of the use of its intellectual property in connection with certain products produced and sold by outside vendors. The use of the Nathan's intellectual property must be approved by Nathan's prior to each specific application to ensure proper quality and project a consistent image. Revenue from license royalties is recognized on a monthly basis when it is earned and deemed collectible.  In the normal course of business, we extend credit to franchisees and licensees for the payment of ongoing royalties and to trade customers of our Branded Product Program. Accounts and other receivables, net, as shown on our consolidated balance sheets are net of allowances for doubtful accounts. An allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements, assessment of collectability based upon historical trends and an evaluation of the impact of current and projected economic conditions. In the event that the collectability of a receivable at the date of the transaction is doubtful, the associated revenue is not recorded until the facts and circumstances change in accordance with the applicable accounting standards. The Company writes off accounts receivable when they are deemed uncollectible.  Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  Goodwill and intangible assets are deemed to have indefinite lives, and accordingly, are not amortized, but are evaluated annually (or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable) for impairment. The most significant assumptions, which are used in this test, are estimates of future cash flows. We typically use the same assumptions for this test as we use in the development of our business plans. If these assumptions differ significantly from actual results, impairment charges may be required in the future. We conducted our annual impairment tests and no goodwill or other intangible assets were determined to be impaired during the fiscal years ended March 26, 2017, March 27, 2016 and March 29, 2015.  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Impairment is measured by comparing the carrying value of the long-lived assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from use of the assets and their ultimate disposition. In instances where impairment is determined to exist, the Company writes down the asset to its fair value based on the present value of estimated future cash flows.  Impairment losses are recorded on long-lived assets on a restaurant-by-restaurant basis whenever impairment factors are determined to be present. The Company considers a history of restaurant operating losses to be its primary indicator of potential impairment for individual restaurant locations. No impairment charges on long-lived assets were recorded during the fiscal years ended March 26, 2017, March 27, 2016 and March 29, 2015.  Impairment of Long-Term Investment  We make judgments regarding the future realizability of this investment based upon the financial information provided to us by the investment's management. We typically rely on management's assumptions, of future revenues and cash flows based upon the annual business plans presented. If these assumptions differ significantly from actual results, we consider whether indicators of impairment exist. If an impairment indicator exists, management evaluates the fair value of its investment to determine if an, other than temporary impairment in value has occurred. We have annually performed our evaluation of whether indicators of impairment existed, and determined that an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred and recorded impairment charges of $100,000 and $400,000 on this investment during the fifty-two week periods ended March 27, 2016 and March 30, 2014, respectively. We have not recognized any further impairment on our long-term investments during the fifty-two week period ended March 26, 2017.  Stock-Based Compensation  As discussed in Note L of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we have one active share-based compensation plan that provides stock options and restricted stock awards for certain employees and non-employee directors to acquire shares of our common stock. We consider the following factors in determining the value of stock-based compensation:  (a) expected option term based upon expected termination behavior;  Income Taxes  The Company's current provision for income taxes is based upon its estimated taxable income in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates, after considering the impact on taxable income of temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and any operating loss or tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in those periods in which temporary differences become deductible. Should management determine that it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets would be established in the period such determination was made.  Uncertain Tax Positions  Financial Accounting Standards establish guidance for the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. The Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Financial Accounting Standards also provide guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements. (See Note J of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)  Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements  In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB"), issued new guidance which addresses how companies account for certain aspects of its share-based payments to employees. The update simplifies the accounting for the tax consequences. It also amends how excess tax benefits and a company's payments to cover the tax bills for the shares' recipients should be classified on the statement of cash flows related to share-based payments to employees. The amendments allow companies to estimate the number of stock awards they expect to vest, and the amendments revised the withholding requirements for classifying stock awards as equity. Previously, tax withholding was permitted only at the minimum statutory tax rates, which is being amended to permit higher income tax withholding as long as it does not exceed the maximum statutory tax rate for an employee in the applicable jurisdictions. This new standard is effective for public companies with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 which will be Nathan's first quarter ending (June 2017) of our fiscal year ending on March 25, 2018. However, early adoption is permitted.  The Company elected to early adopt this standard in the quarter ended June 26, 2016. The impact of the early adoption resulted in the Company recording a tax benefit of $659,000 within income tax expense for the fifty-two weeks ended March 26, 2017, related to the excess tax benefit on stock incentive awards that settled during these periods. The Company did not record any tax benefit during the fourth fiscal quarter ended March 26, 2017. Prior to adoption of this guidance, these amounts would have increased additional paid-in capital. These items shall not be factored into the projected annual income tax rate, but will be treated as discrete items when they occur. Accordingly, this new treatment will add additional volatility in the Company's effective tax rate.  The excess tax benefits for the years ended March 27, 2016 and March 29, 2015 were $228,000 and $4,572,000 respectively which increased additional paid-in-capital.  The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur. Under the new guidance, excess tax benefits related to employee share-based payments of $659,000 are classified as operating activities in the statement of cash flows for the fifty-two weeks ended March 26, 2017. The Company applied the effect of the guidance to the presentation of excess tax benefits in the statement of cash flows prospectively and no prior periods have been adjusted. The Company did not record any cumulative-effect adjustment to accumulated deficit or net assets as a result of adopting this new accounting standard. The Company also modified its diluted earnings per share calculation by excluding the excess tax benefits from the assumed proceeds available to repurchase shares in the computation of our diluted earnings per share for the thirteen and fifty-two weeks ended March 26, 2017.  In August 2014, the FASB issued new guidance that requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. If such conditions exist, management is required to include disclosures enabling users to understand those conditions and management's plans to alleviate or mitigate those conditions. This new standard is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 16, 2016. This guidance was effective for the Company beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or financial position.  New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted  In May 2014, the FASB issued a new accounting standard that attempts to establish a uniform basis for recording income to virtually all industries financial statements, under U.S. GAAP as further amended during 2016. The FASB issued certain updates to the standard, including clarifying reporting revenue between Principle versus Agent and clarification in determining performance obligations and licenses guidance. The revenue standard's core principle is built on the contract between a vendor and a customer for the provision of goods and services. It attempts to depict the exchange of rights and obligations between the parties in the pattern of revenue recognition based on the consideration to which the vendor is entitled. In order to accomplish this objective, companies must evaluate the following five basic steps: (i) identify the contract with the customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.  There are two basic transition methods that are available - full retrospective, or modified retrospective transition methods. Early adoption is prohibited. Public companies were originally expected to apply the new standard for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods therein, which for Nathan's would have been its first quarter of fiscal 2018, beginning on March 27, 2017. On July 9, 2015, the FASB agreed to delay the standard's effective date to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 which will now be our first quarter (June 2018) of our fiscal year ending March 31, 2019.  The Company does not believe that the standard will impact its recognition of revenue for its Branded Product Program, Company-operated restaurants or its recognition of royalties from its franchised restaurants or retail licenses, which are based on a percentage of sales. Currently, franchise and international development fees are recognized when the Company has performed substantially all initial services required by the agreements, which is generally when the franchisee begins operations. Under the new guidance, these fees may be recognized over the term of the agreements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of ASU 2014-09 on its consolidated financial statements and has not yet selected a transition method. The Company anticipates assigning internal resources to assist with the evaluation and implementation of the new standard, and will continue to provide updates during fiscal year 2018.  In July 2015, the FASB updated U.S. accounting guidance to simplify the ways businesses measure inventory. Companies that use the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method or the average cost method will measure inventory at the lower of its cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the normal course of business, minus the cost of completion, disposal, and transportation. Companies will no longer consider replacement cost or net realizable value less a normal profit margin when measuring inventory. This new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 which will be our first quarter (June 2017) of our fiscal year ending March 25, 2018. Nathan's does not expect the adoption of this new guidance to have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position.  In February 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard on leases. The new standard, among other changes, will require lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases. The lease liability will be measured at the present value of the lease payments over the lease term. The right-of-use asset will be measured at the lease liability amount, adjusted for lease prepayments, lease incentives received and the lessee's initial direct costs (e.g. commissions). The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. This standard is required to take effect in Nathan's first quarter ending (June 2019) of our fiscal year ending March 29, 2020. The adoption will require a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest period presented. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new accounting standard on its consolidated financial position and results of operations.  In January 2017, the FASB issued a new accounting standard that narrows the definition of a business. The concept is fundamental in determining whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The ASU revised the definition of a business to consist of the following key concepts:  ? A business is an integrated set of activities and assets that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return in the form of dividends, lower costs, or other economic benefits directly to investors or other owners, members, or participants.  The amendments are effective prospectively for public business entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. This standard is required to take effect in Nathan's first quarter ending (June 2018) of our fiscal year ending March 31, 2019. The Company does not expect this new accounting standard will have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Early adoption is permitted when certain criteria are met.  The Company does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting standards, when adopted, will have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements.  Results of Operations  Fiscal year ended March 26, 2017 compared to fiscal year ended March 27, 2016  Revenues  Total sales were $71,216,000 for the fifty-two weeks ended March 26, 2017 ("fiscal 2017 period") as compared to $76,031,000 for the fifty-two weeks ended March 27, 2016 ("fiscal 2016 period"). Foodservice sales from the Branded Product Program were $55,960,000 for the fiscal 2017 period as compared to sales of $58,545,000 in the fiscal 2016 period. During the fiscal 2017 period, the volume of business increased by approximately 4.6%. However, as a result of our pricing strategy, which is more closely correlated to the cost of beef which declined by approximately 13.9%, our average selling prices were lowered by approximately 8.2% during the fiscal 2017 period as compared to the fiscal 2016 period. Total Company-owned restaurant sales were $15,042,000 during the fiscal 2017 period compared to $16,664,000 during the fiscal 2016 period due primarily . . .

History[edit]




Crowding customers in 1947


Nathan's began as a nickel hot dog stand in Coney Island in 1916 and bears the name of co-founder Nathan Handwerker (June 14, 1892 – March 24, 1974),[3][4] who started the business with his wife, Ida Handwerker, née Ida Greenwald.[4][5][6] Ida created the hot dog recipe they used, and Ida's grandmother created the secret spice recipe.[5]
Jewish immigrant Handwerker arrived in New York City in 1912[4] and soon found work at the Coney Island, Brooklyn, restaurant Feltman's German Gardens.[7] By one account, he was encouraged by singing waiters Eddie Cantor and Jimmy Durante to go into business in competition with Feltman's; as United Press International noted in 1974, "There are many stories about Nathan and how the business began, but this is the way he told it..."[7] The company's official history does not mention the future stars' encouragement.[5] Nathan and Ida spent their life savings of $300 to begin the business.[4]
Handwerker undercut Feltman's by charging five cents for a hot dog when his former employer was charging 10 cents.[7] At a time when food regulation was in its infancy and the pedigree of the hot dog particularly suspect, Handwerker ensured that men wearing surgeon's smocks were seen eating at his stand to reassure potential customers.[8] The business proved immensely popular.[9]
The expansion of the chain was overseen by Nathan Handwerker's son, Murray Handwerker.[6][10] A second branch on Long Beach Road in Oceanside, New York, opened in 1959, and another debuted in Yonkers, New York, in 1965. Murray Handwerker was named the president of Nathan's Famous in 1968,[10] the year the company went public.[6]
All locations were sold by the Handwerker family to a group of private investors in 1987,[10] at which point Nathan's was franchised and a great number of establishments were opened around New York City and beyond. In the 1990s, the company acquired Kenny Rogers Roasters and Miami Subs Grill, both of which were later divested.

As of September 2001[update], the company consisted of 24 company-owned units, 380 franchised or licensed units and more than 1,400 stores in 50 states, Guam, the District of Columbia and 17 foreign countries, including Kandahar Airfield, Afghanistan. One unit was lost due to the collapse of Two World Trade Center in the 9/11 attacks.
International master franchise agreements were signed (circa 2006) with Egypt and Israel.[11] The company also owns the exclusive co-branding rights to the Arthur Treacher's Fish and Chips chain.[12]
On March 28, 2017, it was announced that Nathan's Famous had reached a sponsorship deal with Major League Baseball, allowing the company to market itself as the official hot dog brand of the league. While Nathan's is already the official hot dog brand of the New York Mets, New York Yankees, Miami Marlins, and St. Louis Cardinals (the sponsorship does not restrict teams from making similar deals with competitors), the deal marked the first time that Major League Baseball had named an official hot dog sponsor.[13]
Original location[edit]
The original Nathan's hot dog stand still exists, as of 2016, on its original 1916 site.[14] Having been open for business every day, 365 days a year, the stand was forced to close on October 29, 2012, due to Hurricane Sandy. The shop re-opened six months later, on May 21,[15] [16] despite a small fire on May 4, 2013.[17] Service is provided year-round inside, and during the summer additional walk-up windows are opened to serve the larger seasonal crowds.
Hot-dog eating contest[edit]




Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest countdown clock


The Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest has been held at the original location on Coney Island since the early 1970s.[18] Contestants try to consume as many hot dogs as possible in 10 minutes. Winners include Takeru Kobayashi (2001–2006)[19] and Joey Chestnut (2008–2014) in July 2008, Chestnut tied Kobayashi after eating 59 HDB in 10 minutes. The tie resulted in a five hot-dog eat-off, which Chestnut won by consuming all five before Kobayashi.[19] Chestnut was beaten by Matt Stonie in 2015, but regained the title in 2016.[19] Chestnut also won the 2017 contest.

History[edit]




Crowding customers in 1947


Nathan's began as a nickel hot dog stand in Coney Island in 1916 and bears the name of co-founder Nathan Handwerker (June 14, 1892 – March 24, 1974),[3][4] who started the business with his wife, Ida Handwerker, née Ida Greenwald.[4][5][6] Ida created the hot dog recipe they used, and Ida's grandmother created the secret spice recipe.[5]
Jewish immigrant Handwerker arrived in New York City in 1912[4] and soon found work at the Coney Island, Brooklyn, restaurant Feltman's German Gardens.[7] By one account, he was encouraged by singing waiters Eddie Cantor and Jimmy Durante to go into business in competition with Feltman's; as United Press International noted in 1974, "There are many stories about Nathan and how the business began, but this is the way he told it..."[7] The company's official history does not mention the future stars' encouragement.[5] Nathan and Ida spent their life savings of $300 to begin the business.[4]
Handwerker undercut Feltman's by charging five cents for a hot dog when his former employer was charging 10 cents.[7] At a time when food regulation was in its infancy and the pedigree of the hot dog particularly suspect, Handwerker ensured that men wearing surgeon's smocks were seen eating at his stand to reassure potential customers.[8] The business proved immensely popular.[9]
The expansion of the chain was overseen by Nathan Handwerker's son, Murray Handwerker.[6][10] A second branch on Long Beach Road in Oceanside, New York, opened in 1959, and another debuted in Yonkers, New York, in 1965. Murray Handwerker was named the president of Nathan's Famous in 1968,[10] the year the company went public.[6]
All locations were sold by the Handwerker family to a group of private investors in 1987,[10] at which point Nathan's was franchised and a great number of establishments were opened around New York City and beyond. In the 1990s, the company acquired Kenny Rogers Roasters and Miami Subs Grill, both of which were later divested.




Nathan's original Coney Island location


As of September 2001[update], the company consisted of 24 company-owned units, 380 franchised or licensed units and more than 1,400 stores in 50 states, Guam, the District of Columbia and 17 foreign countries, including Kandahar Airfield, Afghanistan. One unit was lost due to the collapse of Two World Trade Center in the 9/11 attacks.
International master franchise agreements were signed (circa 2006) with Egypt and Israel.[11] The company also owns the exclusive co-branding rights to the Arthur Treacher's Fish and Chips chain.[12]
On March 28, 2017, it was announced that Nathan's Famous had reached a sponsorship deal with Major League Baseball, allowing the company to market itself as the official hot dog brand of the league. While Nathan's is already the official hot dog brand of the New York Mets, New York Yankees, Miami Marlins, and St. Louis Cardinals (the sponsorship does not restrict teams from making similar deals with competitors), the deal marked the first time that Major League Baseball had named an official hot dog sponsor.[13]
Original location[edit]
The original Nathan's hot dog stand still exists, as of 2016, on its original 1916 site.[14] Having been open for business every day, 365 days a year, the stand was forced to close on October 29, 2012, due to Hurricane Sandy. The shop re-opened six months later, on May 21,[15] [16] despite a small fire on May 4, 2013.[17] Service is provided year-round inside, and during the summer additional walk-up windows are opened to serve the larger seasonal crowds.

The Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest has been held at the original location on Coney Island since the early 1970s.[18] Contestants try to consume as many hot dogs as possible in 10 minutes.

The tie resulted in a five hot-dog eat-off, which Chestnut won by consuming all five before Kobayashi.[19] Chestnut was beaten by Matt Stonie in 2015, but regained the title in 2016.[19] Chestnut also won the 2017 contest.

History[edit]




Crowding customers in 1947


Nathan's began as a nickel hot dog stand in Coney Island in 1916 and bears the name of co-founder Nathan Handwerker (June 14, 1892 – March 24, 1974),[3][4] who started the business with his wife, Ida Handwerker, née Ida Greenwald.[4][5][6] Ida created the hot dog recipe they used, and Ida's grandmother created the secret spice recipe.[5]
Jewish immigrant Handwerker arrived in New York City in 1912[4] and soon found work at the Coney Island, Brooklyn, restaurant Feltman's German Gardens.[7] By one account, he was encouraged by singing waiters Eddie Cantor and Jimmy Durante to go into business in competition with Feltman's; as United Press International noted in 1974, "There are many stories about Nathan and how the business began, but this is the way he told it..."[7] The company's official history does not mention the future stars' encouragement.[5] Nathan and Ida spent their life savings of $300 to begin the business.[4]
Handwerker undercut Feltman's by charging five cents for a hot dog when his former employer was charging 10 cents.[7] At a time when food regulation was in its infancy and the pedigree of the hot dog particularly suspect, Handwerker ensured that men wearing surgeon's smocks were seen eating at his stand to reassure potential customers.[8] The business proved immensely popular.[9]
The expansion of the chain was overseen by Nathan Handwerker's son, Murray Handwerker.[6][10] A second branch on Long Beach Road in Oceanside, New York, opened in 1959, and another debuted in Yonkers, New York, in 1965. Murray Handwerker was named the president of Nathan's Famous in 1968,[10] the year the company went public.[6]
All locations were sold by the Handwerker family to a group of private investors in 1987,[10] at which point Nathan's was franchised and a great number of establishments were opened around New York City and beyond. In the 1990s, the company acquired Kenny Rogers Roasters and Miami Subs Grill, both of which were later divested.




Nathan's original Coney Island location


As of September 2001[update], the company consisted of 24 company-owned units, 380 franchised or licensed units and more than 1,400 stores in 50 states, Guam, the District of Columbia and 17 foreign countries, including Kandahar Airfield, Afghanistan. One unit was lost due to the collapse of Two World Trade Center in the 9/11 attacks.
International master franchise agreements were signed (circa 2006) with Egypt and Israel.[11] The company also owns the exclusive co-branding rights to the Arthur Treacher's Fish and Chips chain.[12]
On March 28, 2017, it was announced that Nathan's Famous had reached a sponsorship deal with Major League Baseball, allowing the company to market itself as the official hot dog brand of the league. While Nathan's is already the official hot dog brand of the New York Mets, New York Yankees, Miami Marlins, and St. Louis Cardinals (the sponsorship does not restrict teams from making similar deals with competitors), the deal marked the first time that Major League Baseball had named an official hot dog sponsor.[13]
Original location[edit]
The original Nathan's hot dog stand still exists, as of 2016, on its original 1916 site.[14] Having been open for business every day, 365 days a year, the stand was forced to close on October 29, 2012, due to Hurricane Sandy. The shop re-opened six months later, on May 21,[15] [16] despite a small fire on May 4, 2013.[17] Service is provided year-round inside, and during the summer additional walk-up windows are opened to serve the larger seasonal crowds.
Hot-dog eating contest[edit]




Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest countdown clock


The Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest has been held at the original location on Coney Island since the early 1970s.[18] Contestants try to consume as many hot dogs as possible in 10 minutes. Winners include Takeru Kobayashi (2001–2006)[19] and Joey Chestnut (2008–2014) in July 2008, Chestnut tied Kobayashi after eating 59 HDB in 10 minutes. The tie resulted in a five hot-dog eat-off, which Chestnut won by consuming all five before Kobayashi.[19] Chestnut was beaten by Matt Stonie in 2015, but regained the title in 2016.[19] Chestnut also won the 2017 contest.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
