You may not have heard a lot about us. And that’s by design.

From the start, we’ve spent most of our time and efforts behind the scenes, putting the companies who work with us - and their goals - first. We’ve remained in the background, offering them the guidance, innovative thinking, and operational support they need to succeed. Whether expanding business, increasing profitability, bringing existing financial products to new audiences or creating entirely new financial products and services –take a close look behind some of the world’s most successful companies: that’s where you’ll find The Bancorp.
Today we’ve grown far from our roots as a branchless commercial bank to become a true financial services leader, offering private-label banking and technology solutions to non-bank companies ranging from entrepreneurial start-ups to those on the Fortune 500. Over the years, our strategic focus on a handful of high-growth financial service sectors such as Payments, Health Benefit Banking, Institutional Banking, and Specialized Lending has resulted in tremendous organizational growth and widespread recognition. We now comprise a diverse team that includes bankers, business strategists, fintech experts, software developers, program managers, regulatory advisors, information security specialists and category thought leaders, all eager to provide their wide-ranging expertise in new and innovative ways. No other organization does what we do. And no other organization delivers what we can deliver.

 Merchant Services
            









A leading payments processor licensed by Visa®, MasterCard®, Discover®, Star®, NYCE®, PULSE®, Maestro®, Accell®, AFFM® and UnionPay®, we make it possible for growing mid-market companies to take advantage of today’s most advanced, seamless payment processes without incurring the expense or demands of chartering their own bank. As a voting member of NACHA and the Electronics Transactions Association, we are an important part of the decision-making process that affects industry policy. Our working relationships are long-term and almost exclusively with third party agents, who value us for our expertise in providing large and small businesses with extraordinarily stable and efficient payment alternatives. The standards we set are high – we are extremely selective in determining for which merchants we will provide processing services. Because of this strict selection process, we can more readily deliver the greater efficiencies which lead to greater profitability for our partners.

 ACH Processing
            









Innovative, flexible payment solutions that offer an ease of use, security and accuracy – that’s what we provide every day. Our outstanding technical infrastructure, coupled with our proven sophistication in financial services, enables us to achieve an uncommonly high level of service delivery. Our superiority has been achieved through the mastering of ACH processing technologies and administration for two markets in particular: payroll transaction processing and electronic bill payment processing between businesses and their clients and customers. The reliability and speed of our platforms (99.999+% uptime), coupled with highly malleable processing submission options, always-available expert support and best-of-class loss prevention have earned us the recognition as the ideal payments acceptance resource.

 Emerging Payments

Our outstanding technical infrastructure, coupled with our proven sophistication in financial services, enables us to achieve an uncommonly high level of service delivery. Look closely and you will see us working alongside some of the leading game changers such as Google Wallet, PayPal and ApplePay.

Shares of Flagstar Bancorp Inc. (FBC) broke into a new 52-week high yesterday, hitting a peak of $32.88. 
Shares closed at $32.43 after opening at $32.30 for a move of 1.31%. The company now has a market cap of $1.85 billion.

Investors and traders can learn a lot about a stock’s momentum when it sets a new 52-week high. As an example, bullish investors view a company hitting its highest price in a year as a sign of 
momentum and may interpret it as a signal to buy. On the other hand, bearish investors could view a new 52-week high as a signal of the end of a strong run, with the stock possibly peaking out 
before an impending period of decline.


For Flagstar Bancorp Inc., the new 52-week high came on volume of 345,016. The stock has a float of 57.06 million shares and average daily volume of $189,514. It has a 
50-day SMA of $30.15 and a 200-day SMA of $28.29. Flagstar Bancorp Inc. now has a P/E ratio of 12.4.

2016 Annual Report










Stock QuoteNYSENYCBMarket Value ($M)6,244.83Change ($)(0.55)Change (%)(4.13)Volume7,636,868Stock Quote ($)12.77As of July 26, 2017 - Minimum 20 minute delay.New York Community Bancorp, Inc. (NYSE: NYCB) is one of the 25 largest bank holding 
companies in the nation, with assets of $48.3 billion and a market cap of $6.4 
billion at June 30, 2017. With deposits of $28.9 billion and 255 branches in Metro New York, 
New Jersey, Florida, Arizona, and Ohio, we also rank among the largest depositories 
in the United States. 

We operate our branches through two banks with eight local divisions, reflecting 
our growth through seven traditional mergers and two FDIC-assisted transactions 
between the years 2000 and 2010. Established in 1859, New York Community Bank is 
a New York State-chartered savings bank with 225 branches throughout our five-state 
franchise; established in 2005 and also New York State-chartered, New York Commercial 
Bank has 30 branches--all in Metro New York. 

In addition to fueling the growth of our deposit franchise, acquisitions have fueled 
the growth of our interest-earning assets and, in particular, our multi-family loans. 
We are a leading producer of multi-family loans for portfolio in New York City, 
with an emphasis on rent-regulated buildings that feature below-market rents. At 
the end of June, our portfolio totaled $26.9 billion, representing 72.1% of total 
held-for-investment loans. 

In addition to our expertise in multi-family lending, we are known for our record of superior asset quality. Over the course of our public life, few of our non-performing assets resulted in actual losses, with net charge-offs representing a modest 0.04% of average loans during that time.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
