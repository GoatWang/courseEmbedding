Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: PCRX) is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the clinical and commercial development of new products that meet the needs of acute care practitioners and their patients.
A Focus on Pain Management
Our primary focus lies in the development of non-opioid products for postsurgical pain control. We believe we have the technology to improve products' efficacy and safety and make a critical difference to patients in terms of dosing frequency and administration.

EXPAREL® (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension) is a non-opioid local analgesic indicated for administration into the surgical site to produce postsurgical analgesia. EXPAREL combines bupivacaine with the DepoFoam® drug delivery platform to provide postsurgical pain control with a single intraoperative infiltration.




Our proven product delivery technology, DepoFoam, is a multivesicular liposome technology that encapsulates drugs without altering their molecular structure and then releases them over a desired time period (from 1 to 30 days); it has been used to reduce the dosing frequency and extend the duration of action of DepoCyt(e)® for over a decade.

EXPAREL®
DepoCyt(e)® 
Clinical Trials 

 

EXPAREL®
EXPAREL is a local analgesic that utilizes bupivacaine in combination with the proven product delivery platform, DepoFoam®. 
A non-opioid analgesic should be considered in populations where the use of opioids is most problematic, including:

Elderly patients*
Obese patients
Sleep apneic patients1

The safety of EXPAREL has been evaluated in 21 clinical trials which include over 1300 subjects in the safety database. EXPAREL administered locally into the surgical site was evaluated in 10 randomized, double-blind clinical studies involving 823 patients undergoing various surgical procedures. Patients were administered a dose ranging from 66 mg to 532 mg of EXPAREL.2
EXPAREL is indicated for administration into the surgical site to produce postsurgical analgesia.2
Important Safety Information

EXPAREL is contraindicated in obstetrical paracervical block anesthesia
In clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥10%) following EXPAREL administration were nausea, constipation, and vomiting
EXPAREL is not recommended to be used in the following patient population: patients <18 years old and/or pregnant patients
Because amide-type local anesthetics, such as bupivacaine, are metabolized by the liver, EXPAREL should be used cautiously in patients with hepatic disease. Patients with severe hepatic disease, because of their inability to metabolize local anesthetics normally, are at a greater risk of developing toxic plasma concentrations

Warnings and Precautions Specific to EXPAREL

EXPAREL is not recommended for the following types or routes of administration:  epidural, intrathecal, regional nerve blocks, or intravascular or intra-articular use
Non-bupivacaine-based local anesthetics, including lidocaine, may cause an immediate release of bupivacaine from EXPAREL if administered together locally. The administration of EXPAREL may follow the administration of lidocaine after a delay of 20 minutes or more. Formulations of  bupivacaine other than EXPAREL should not be administered within 96 hours following administration of EXPAREL

Warnings and Precautions for Bupivacaine-Containing Products

Central Nervous System (CNS) Reactions: There have been reports of adverse neurologic reactions with the use of local anesthetics.  These include persistent anesthesia and paresthesias.  CNS reactions are characterized by excitation and/or depression
Cardiovascular System Reactions: Toxic blood concentrations depress cardiac conductivity and excitability which may lead to dysrhythmias sometimes leading to death
Allergic Reactions: Allergic-type reactions (eg, anaphylaxis and angioedema) are rare and may occur as a result of hypersensitivity to the local anesthetic or to other formulation ingredients
Chondrolysis: There have been reports of chondrolysis (mostly in the shoulder joint) following intra-articular infusion of local anesthetics, which is an unapproved use

For more information regarding EXPAREL, please visit the Pacira press release archives or www.EXPAREL.com.
To report an adverse event, e-mail drugsafety@pacira.com, dial 1-855-RX-EXPAREL (1-855-793-9727), or fax 1-858-408-3588 or 1-973-201-0649.
For medical inquiries related to EXPAREL, contact Medical Information at medinfo@pacira.com or 1-855-RX-EXPAREL (1-855-793-9727).


*Clinical experience with EXPAREL has not identified differences in efficacy or safety between elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

Pacira Pharmaceuticals Inc (PCRX) and EXACT Sciences Corporation (EXAS) Are Shaking Up the Market
 
 Julie Lamb, Editor-July 26, 2017, 2:34 PM EDT

SHARE ON:





 


 


Pacira’s Exparel “Hit Where It Needed to Most”
Pacira Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:PCRX) shares were falling 12% yesterday after the drug maker’s pain medicine failed to meet a primary efficacy endpoint in one of its two Phase 3 femoral nerve block trial. Yet, consider the grand scheme, argues H.C. Wainwright Corey Davis, who believes this is one stumbling block in a multi-layer race to the “finals.”
As far as Davis sees it, Pacira is still “moving on to the finals,” having just the right data to deliver a response to the FDA’s Complete Response Letter (CRL) from back in March 2015. In other words, the drug maker will soon be re-filing its sNDA in the indication of nerve block. The miss of reduction in AUC cumulative pain scores throughout 72 hours will not detract from Pacira’s overall promising prospects.
In fact, the analyst believes what counted more was the primary endpoint of reduction in AUC cumulative pain scores over 48 hours as well as secondary endpoints of reduction in total postsurgical opioid consumption through 48 hours, total number of opioid-free patients through 48 hours, and reduction in time to first opioid rescue use through 48 hours. Here, Pacira came through, and Davis finds this will tackle every deficiency listed in the FDA’s CRL from two years prior. Besides, “femoral nerve blocks are a quickly fading market anyway,” comments Davis.
With this in mind, the analyst reiterates a Buy rating on shares of PCRX with a $59 price target, which represents a 12.5% increase from where the stock is currently trading. (To watch Davis’ track record, click here.)
Davis explains, “As a result of the FDA requests, Pacira had initiated two new nerve block studies: 1) a replica of the original successful femoral nerve block study; and 2) a ‘brachial plexus’ nerve block study. The former is what missed its primary endpoint but this was due to a protocol violation at a single center; when patients from this center were excluded, the trial did indeed achieve statistical significance (p<0.03). Specifically, the violation was certain surgeons failing to inject patients into the posterior capsule (not from failing to perform the actual nerve block properly). We find it odd that this violation caused the study to fail since both active drug and placebo patients would have failed to receive the posterior injection. The brachial plexus study was also announced this morning and was an overwhelming success. Therefore the company has everything it now needs to respond to the CRL and we expect the refiling to occur later in Q3 with an approval and launch in early 2018.”
TipRanks analytics indicate PCRX as a Strong Buy. Out of 9 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 7 are bullish on Pacira stock while 2 remain sidelined. With a return potential of nearly 45%, the stock’s consensus target price stands at $61.71.

Exact Sciences Hands in Another “Wow” Quarter
EXACT Sciences Corporation (NASDAQ:EXAS) shares are surging 8% today thanks to yesterday’s impressive quarterly print that not only outperformed expectations, especially on strength of gross margin. Not only did the biotech firm raise expectations for its long-term goals on gross margins up to 75%+, but Canaccord analyst Mark Massaro has every confidence Exact can transcend even a margin of 80%.
In reaction, the analyst reiterates a Buy rating on EXAS while lifting the price target from $42 to $45, which represents a 12.5% increase from current levels. (To watch Massaro’s track record, click here.)
“EXAS delivered another terrific quarter and is executing on all cylinders, reporting a major beat-and-raise above the ‘blowout’ case we previewed. Given the major beat particularly on the GM line, we are getting a much faster and clearer glimpse of the operating leverage this business has. We are introducing our 2021 EPS of $1.60/ share, which assumes $901M in revenue, GM of 77%, and tests completed of 2M. What’s more, our model still does not include (1) an acceleration in doc ordering or doc utilization now that UNH and AET are in contract; (2) contribution from 100 new salespeople by Q3/17; (3) Cologuard reordering, or (4) any additional test launches beyond Cologuard,” comments the analyst.
Massaro surmises by pointing ahead to four key catalysts for Exact investors to anticipate: “1) More commercial payor wins; 2) additional data on liquid biopsies (lung, liver, pancreatic, etc.); 3) Q3 results; 4) partnership optionality. We’re pleased to host EXAS at the Canaccord Genuity Growth Conference Wed Aug. 9 in Boston.”
For the second quarter, Exact delivered a 171% year-over-year rise in revenues to $57.6 million, which handily “toppled” the analyst’s projections calling for $51.6 million as well as the Street’s of $49.7 million. Additionally, the biotech firm yielded volumes of 135,000 that marked a strong 172% year-over-year rise, which “crushed” Massaro’s forecast of 117,000. Operating expenses of $71.1 million aligned with the analyst’s estimate $70.5ME. Exact closed the quarter with $483 million in cash with its noninvasive colon cancer screening test Cologuard covered by 235 million lives.
TipRanks analytics show EXAS as a Strong Buy. Based on 9 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 8 rate a Buy on Exact stock while 1 maintains a Hold. The 12-month average price target stands at $40.78, marking a 9% upside from where the stock is currently trading.

					Full Description



Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc., incorporated on December 22, 2006, is a holding company. The Company is a pharmaceutical company focused on the development, manufacture and commercialization of pharmaceutical products, based on its DepoFoam extended release drug delivery technology, for use primarily in hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers. Its lead product candidate is EXPAREL (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension), which consists of bupivacaine, an amide-type local anesthetic, encapsulated in DepoFoam and is indicated for single-dose infiltration into the surgical site to produce postsurgical analgesia. In addition to EXPAREL, DepoFoam is also the basis for its other Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved commercial product, DepoCyt(e), which it manufactures for its commercial partners, as well as its product candidates. The Company's other product candidates include DepoMeloxicam (DepoMLX) and DepoTranexamic Acid (DepoTXA).EXPAREL provides postsurgical analgesia and reduces the consumption of opioid medications. EXPAREL is designed to provide extended pain management using a single injection. It is advancing a Phase IV multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial of EXPAREL for postsurgical pain management in patients undergoing open lumbar spinal fusion surgery. It is also evaluating EXPAREL for nerve block. It has enrolled patients in both of its EXPAREL Phase III trials for upper and lower extremity nerve blocks, specifically a femoral nerve block for patients undergoing Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA), and a brachial plexus nerve block for patients undergoing either total shoulder arthroplasty or rotator cuff repair procedures.DepoCyt(e) is a sustained-release liposomal formulation of the chemotherapeutic agent cytarabine utilizing its DepoFoam technology. DepoCyt(e) is indicated for the intrathecal treatment of lymphomatous meningitis. DepoTXA is used off-label as a systemic injection or as a topical application, and is used to treat or prevent excessive blood loss during surgery by preventing the breakdown of a clot. DepoTXA is in Phase II clinical development. DepoMLX is a long-acting non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), which is designed to treat moderate to severe acute postsurgical pain as part of a non-opioid multimodal regimen.The Company competes with Halyard Health, Inc.

Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Announces Publication of Phase 4 Study of EXPAREL in Patients Undergoing Total Knee Replacement in the Journal of Arthroplasty
Jul 26 17
Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced the publication of its Phase 4 PILLAR study of EXPAREL (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension) in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The results, which demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in opioid requirements and pain scores for EXPAREL admixed with bupivacaine HCl versus bupivacaine HCl alone. The study’s co-primary efficacy endpoints compared the magnitude and duration of postsurgical analgesia and associated impact on opioid consumption for 139 TKA patients randomized into two groups at 16 centers across the United States. Seventy patients received surgical site infiltration with EXPAREL admixed with bupivacaine HCl; 69 patients received infiltration with bupivacaine HCl alone. Patients in both groups received an identical oral, cost-effective multimodal pain management protocol before and after surgery and had access to rescue opioids as needed. Patients in the EXPAREL arm demonstrated a statistically significant: Decrease in total opioid consumption by 78% (18.7 mg versus 84.9 mg in the bupivacaine group; P=0.0048) expressed as morphine equivalents from zero to 48 hours after surgery. Reduction in pain scores (180.8 versus 209.3 in the bupivacaine group; P=0.0381), measured using the area under the curve of the pain intensity scores measured on a visual analog scale from 12 to 48 hours after surgery. Importantly, EXPAREL also achieved statistical significance for the study’s key secondary endpoints related to opioid reduction. Patients in the EXPAREL arm required 77.6% fewer opioids through 72 hours than those in the bupivacaine arm (20.9 mg versus 93.6 mg, respectively; P=0.0108), with 10% remaining opioid-free through 48 and 72 hours (compared to zero patients in the bupivacaine arm; The Postsurgical Infiltration With EXPAREL For Long-Lasting Analgesia In Total Knee ARthroplasty (PILLAR) study was a Phase 4 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled parallel-group study conducted between April 25, 2016 and January 19, 2017.


Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - Special Call

To consider Topline Phase 3 Results for EXPAREL


Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Announces Topline Phase 3 Results for Exparel® as Single-Dose Nerve Block
Jul 25 17
Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced the completion of two Phase 3 placebo-controlled studies evaluating the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of EXPARELÂ® (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension) as a single-dose nerve block for prolonged regional analgesia. The first study evaluated EXPAREL administered as a brachial plexus block for patients undergoing one of two upper extremity surgeries (total shoulder arthroplasty or rotator cuff repair), and the second study evaluated EXPAREL administered as a femoral nerve block for patients undergoing a lower extremity surgical procedure (total knee arthroplasty, or TKA). EXPAREL demonstrated statistical significance for the primary endpoint of cumulative pain scores over 48 hours as measured by the area under the curve (p<0.0001). EXPAREL also achieved statistical significance versus placebo for the study’s key secondary endpoints as follows: total postsurgical opioid consumption through 48 hours (p<0.0001); opioid-free subjects through 48 hours (p<0.01); and time to first opioid rescue through 48 hours (p<0.0001). The study randomized 156 patients across 17 sites in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single dose of either EXPAREL 133 mg in 10 mL expanded in volume with 10 mL of normal saline for a total volume of 20 mL or placebo 20 mL. EXPAREL was administered as a single-dose brachial plexus block under ultrasound guidance at least one hour prior to surgery. All patients were eligible to receive postsurgical rescue opioids upon request for pain control. The study captured pharmacokinetic data through 120 hours to determine the median time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) for EXPAREL. EXPAREL did not demonstrate statistical significance in the femoral nerve block study (p>0.05) due to a significant deviation from protocol identified at a single center. When these patients were excluded from the analyses, patients receiving 266 mg EXPAREL achieved statistical significance versus placebo for the study’s primary endpoint of cumulative pain scores over 72 hours as measured by the area under the curve (p<0.03). The study randomized 232 patients across 14 sites in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a single dose of either EXPAREL 133 mg in 10 mL expanded in volume with 10 mL of normal saline for a total volume of 20 mL; EXPAREL 266 mg in 20 mL; or placebo 20 mL. Study drug was administered as a single-dose femoral nerve block under ultrasound guidance at least one hour prior to surgery. In addition to study drug, prior to placement of the prosthesis, 8 mL of bupivacaine HCl (0.5%) diluted with 8 mL of normal saline was administered as a periarticular infiltration to the posterior capsule of the knee. All patients were eligible to receive postsurgical rescue opioids upon request for pain control. The study captured pharmacokinetic data through 120 hours to determine the median time to Tmax for EXPAREL.

	PARSIPPANY, N.J., May 4, 2017


	-


	Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc.




	(NASDAQ: PCRX) today provided updates on EXPAREL® (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension) for postsurgical pain in the United States and announced consolidated financial results for the


	first quarter


	 ended


	March 31, 2017


	.









	“We’re pleased with our strong first quarter highlighted by important strategic advances and solid revenue growth,” said Dave Stack, chairman and chief executive officer of Pacira. “Our newly launched partnerships with DePuy Synthes and Trinity Health center on our shared commitment to providing patients and healthcare providers with an opioid-sparing solution. We are also advancing a robust clinical program with important value-drivers on the near-term horizon, including mid-year data readouts for our two Phase 3 nerve block studies and the publication of our successful Phase 4 study in total knee arthroplasty. Finally, we significantly strengthened our balance sheet during the first quarter. We believe the foundation is in place to drive EXPAREL sales growth for the rest of 2017 and beyond.”













	Recent Highlights


















	•






	Positive results from Phase 4 study of EXPAREL in total knee arthroplasty (TKA).


	 EXPAREL (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension) achieved statistical significance for its co-primary endpoints of opioid reduction (p=0.0048) and postsurgical pain control (p=0.0381). EXPAREL also achieved statistical significance for key secondary endpoints, including time to first opioid and the percentage of patients who did not require any opioids to treat their postsurgical pain. The trial compared EXPAREL-based local analgesia infiltration to standard bupivacaine-based local analgesia infiltration, each as part of a standard multi-modal analgesic protocol.
















	•






	EXPAREL focus of educational programs at American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons Annual Meeting.


	 At the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons Annual Meeting, Pacira and its partner DePuy Synthes, a Johnson & Johnson company, supported multiple educational programs around the impact of opioids and postsurgical pain management. The companies also hosted innovative virtual reality experiences to demonstrate EXPAREL best practice infiltration technique in total knee arthroplasty.



























	Pacira and DePuy Synthes entered into an agreement in January 2017 to support the promotion, education and training for EXPAREL in orthopedic procedures.













	•






	Collaboration with Trinity Health to decrease opioid use.


	 In March 2017, Pacira and Trinity Health launched a collaboration focusing on developing standardized procedure-specific enhanced recovery and pain protocols that will include using opioid alternatives when appropriate. The two organizations will also develop educational materials and generate data to track progress.
















	•






	Gross proceeds of $345 million from private offering of convertible notes.


	 In March 2017, Pacira completed a private offering of 2.375% convertible senior notes due 2022. The Company incurred approximately $11 million in financing costs and retired approximately $118 million in principal value of its existing 3.25% convertible senior notes due 2019.
















	•






	New EXPAREL patent extends exclusivity to December 2021.


	 In March 2017, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued U.S. Patent 9,585,838. The claims of the patent relate to the production of multivesicular liposomes. This is the third EXPAREL patent listed in the Food and Drug Administration Orange Book.

	A replay of the call will be available approximately two hours after the completion of the call and can be accessed by dialing 1-855-859-2056 (domestic) or 1-404-537-3406 (international) and providing the Conference ID 4977296. The replay of the call will be available for two weeks from the date of the live call.









	The live, listen-only webcast of the conference call can also be accessed by visiting the “Investors & Media” section of the company’s website at


	investor.pacira.com


	. A replay of the webcast will be archived on the Pacira website for two weeks following the call.













	Non-GAAP Financial Information









	This press release contains financial measures that do not comply with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), such as non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP cost of goods sold, non-GAAP gross margins, non-GAAP research and development (R&D) and non-GAAP selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, because such measures exclude stock-based compensation, amortization of debt discount and loss on early extinguishment of debt. These measures supplement our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Pacira management uses these measures to better analyze its financial results, estimate its future cost of goods sold, gross margins, R&D and SG&A outlook for 2017 and to help make managerial decisions. In management’s opinion, these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and other users of our financial statements by providing greater transparency into the operating performance at Pacira and the company’s future outlook. Such measures should not be deemed to be an alternative to GAAP requirements or a measure of liquidity for Pacira. Non-GAAP












	measures are also unlikely to be comparable with non-GAAP disclosures released by other companies. See the tables below for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP 2017 financial guidance for gross margins, R&D and SG&A.













	About Pacira









	Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: PCRX) is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the clinical and commercial development of new products that meet the needs of acute care practitioners and their patients. The company’s flagship product, EXPAREL® (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension), indicated for single-dose infiltration into the surgical site to produce postsurgical analgesia, was commercially launched in the United States in April 2012. EXPAREL and two other products have successfully utilized DepoFoam®, a unique and proprietary product delivery technology that encapsulates drugs without altering their molecular structure, and releases them over a desired period of time. Additional information about Pacira is available at


	www.pacira.com


	.













	About EXPAREL®









	EXPAREL (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension) is currently indicated for single-dose infiltration into the surgical site to produce postsurgical analgesia. The product combines bupivacaine with DepoFoam®, a proven product delivery technology that delivers medication over a desired time period. EXPAREL represents the first and only multivesicular liposome local anesthetic that can be utilized in the peri- or postsurgical setting. By utilizing the DepoFoam platform, a single dose of EXPAREL delivers bupivacaine over time, providing significant reductions in cumulative pain score with up to a 45 percent decrease in opioid consumption; the clinical benefit of the opioid reduction was not demonstrated. Additional information is available at


	www.EXPAREL.com


	.













	Important Safety Information









	EXPAREL is contraindicated in obstetrical paracervical block anesthesia. EXPAREL has not been studied for use in patients younger than 18 years of age. Non-bupivacaine-based local anesthetics, including lidocaine, may cause an immediate release of bupivacaine from EXPAREL if administered together locally. The administration of EXPAREL may follow the administration of lidocaine after a delay of 20 minutes or more. Other formulations of bupivacaine should not be administered within 96 hours following administration of EXPAREL. Monitoring of cardiovascular and neurological status, as well as vital signs should be performed during and after injection of EXPAREL as with other local anesthetic products. Because amide-type local anesthetics, such as bupivacaine, are metabolized by the liver, EXPAREL should be used cautiously in patients with hepatic disease. Patients with severe hepatic disease, because of their inability to metabolize local anesthetics normally, are at a greater risk of developing toxic plasma concentrations. In clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions (incidence greater-than or equal to 10%) following EXPAREL administration were nausea, constipation, and vomiting.

Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including risks relating to: the success of our sales and manufacturing efforts in support of the commercialization of EXPAREL; the rate and degree of market acceptance of EXPAREL and our other products; the size and growth of the potential markets for EXPAREL and our ability to serve those markets; our plans to expand the use of EXPAREL to additional indications and opportunities, and the timing and success of any related clinical trials; the related timing and success of United States Food and Drug Administration supplemental New Drug Applications; the outcome of the U.S. Department of Justice inquiry; our plans to evaluate, develop and pursue additional DepoFoam-based product candidates; clinical trials in support of an existing or potential DepoFoam-based product; our plans to continue to manufacture and provide support services for our commercial partners who have licensed DepoCyt(e); our commercialization and marketing capabilities; our and Patheon UK Limited’s ability to successfully and timely construct dedicated EXPAREL manufacturing suites; and other factors discussed in the “Risk Factors” of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and in other filings that we periodically make with the SEC. In addition, the forward-looking statements included in this press release represent our views as of the date of this press release.

 PACIRA PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. (NASDAQ:PCRX) Files An 8-K Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal ActivitiesItem 2.05. Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal ActivitiesOn June 29, 2017, Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the “Company”) determined to discontinue all future production of DepoCyt®>(U.S. and Canada) and DepoCyte®>(European Union) due to persistent technical issues specific to the DepoCyt(e) manufacturing process. This decision does not affect any product that has already been distributed to customers or administered to patients. In the second quarter of 2017, the Company expects to record a charge of approximately $5.0 million related to the discontinuation of its DepoCyt(e) manufacturing activities, of which approximately $2.5 million relates to the write-off of certain assets, $2.0 million relates to the remaining lease costs less an estimate of potential sub-lease income for the facility where DepoCyt(e) is manufactured, and $0.5 million relates to employee severance and other exit costs. The Company expects that $3.3 million of the total charge will be paid in cash. DepoCyt(e) accounted for approximately 2.5% of the Company’s total revenues in 2016.Item 2.06. Material ImpairmentsThe information set forth in Item 2.05 above is incorporated herein by reference. About PACIRA PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We cannot take progress for granted

















We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
