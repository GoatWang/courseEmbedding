About Our Products
Wells Fargo Funds is built for investment  excellence and on a legacy of service that's hard to duplicate. We invite you to learn more about these qualifications—and others—that make us ideally suited  to meet your investment needs.
Mutual fund lineup
Wells Fargo Funds offers mutual funds in every key  category. Each fund is guided by a premier investment team chosen for its  focused attention to a particular investment style. There's a fund to meet the  investment goals and risk tolerance of almost any investment portfolio. Review  our fund lineup.
Closed-end funds
Wells Fargo closed-end funds (CEFs) are publicly traded mutual funds that have similarities with their open-end counterparts but also significant differences. Like an open-end fund, CEFs offer the benefits of diversification and professional management, but with a fixed number of shares for sale. After the IPO, shares are bought and sold in the secondary marketplace and the market price of the shares is determined by supply and demand, not by net asset value. Diversification does not assure or guarantee better performance and cannot eliminate the risk of investment losses. Review our fund lineup.
Managed accounts
Wells Fargo Managed Account Services  offers a program of professionally managed portfolios made up of individual  securities and geared to meet the investment needs of sophisticated investors  and institutions. The comprehensive lineup of separately managed strategies  takes advantage of the expertise of the same investment teams who manage some  of the most popular Wells Fargo  Funds. The managers apply the same time-tested philosophies, strategies,  and processes to the managed accounts. Learn more.
Variable trust funds
The Wells Fargo Variable Trust (VT) Funds are  offered as an option in the variable annuity platforms of many leading  insurers. Our VT fund lineup includes a variety of asset classes and investment  styles, providing ample opportunity to meet the diversification needs of any  variable annuity portfolio. The funds are managed by some of the same  investment teams who manage the Wells Fargo Funds open-end mutual funds. The  managers apply the same time-tested philosophies, strategies, and processes to  the VT funds. Access VT regulatory documents. 
A  program of regular investment cannot ensure a profit or protect against a loss  in a declining market. 

Any tax or legal information in this website is merely a summary of our  understanding and interpretations of some of the current income tax regulations  and is not exhaustive. Investors should consult their tax advisor or legal  counsel for advice and information concerning their particular situation. Wells  Fargo Funds Management, LLC; Wells Fargo Funds Distributor, LLC; or any of  their representatives may not give legal or tax advice. 

The Variable Trust Funds are generally available only through insurance  company variable contracts.

The Envision® Process.

Offered exclusively at Wells Fargo Advisors, the Envision process was created to give our Financial Advisors a competitive advantage — one that helps you deepen relationships with existing clients while differentiating yourself to new prospects.

Combining goals-based guidance with sophisticated statistical modeling, the Envision process is an effective, easy-to-understand method for helping your clients target and achieve their most important goals.
You will be able to develop hypothetical scenarios to help your clients visualize their financial dreams, so they understand what it will take to realize them. The Envision planning process allows you and your clients to continually monitor and test their progress to address that key question: “How am I doing?”
This process is designed to help clients live the one life they have to live the way they want to live it without undue financial sacrifice or overexposure to risk.
IMPORTANT: The projections or other information generated by Envision regarding the likelihood of various investment outcomes are hypothetical in nature, do not reflect actual investment results and are not guarantees of future results. Results may vary with each use and over time. Envision is a registered service mark of Wells Fargo & Company and used under license.

More than half of fund families saw outflows so far this year

In the world of asset management, it increasingly seems like there’s Vanguard, and then there’s everyone else. The investment management giant has taken in more than $177.3 billion in inflows across its products thus far in 2017, according to Morningstar data. That’s about as much as its 10 closest competitors—combined. The losers amid Vanguard’s victory include such Wall Street titans as J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. 

                            
                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                  
                                    JPM, -0.34%

                                         all of which have seen notable outflows this year. Vanguard’s dominance is a byproduct of investors moving en masse to passive products, which simply track an index like the S&P 500 

                            
                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                  
                                    SPX, -0.04%

                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                         as opposed to actively managed products, which aim to outperform such indexes through portfolio managers selecting the securities held. Data have repeatedly shown that passive funds perform better than active ones, particularly over the long term. Just as importantly, passive funds typically have much lower fees than their active counterparts. Vanguard funds, which are among the cheapest in the industry, can be had for as little as 4 basis points, or $4 for every $10,000 invested. While Vanguard does offer actively managed funds—as well as “smart beta” funds, which use rules to deliver such strategies as “growth,” “value,” or “low volatility”—the overwhelming trend has been to passive. Last year, active funds as an overall category saw outflows of $285.2 billion while passive funds attracted inflows of $428.7 billion. This rotation has been occurring for at least 10 years. According to Morningstar data, the flows into Vanguard products—which lifted its total assets to $3.826 trillion—were nearly double that of the second-place finisher, iShares, another giant in passive strategies, where inflows were about $94 billion.  Morningstar’s flow data, which is through the end of May, looks at both mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, an investment structure that has become increasingly popular. Not only are ETFs dominated by passive strategies, but they are both cheaper and more tax efficient than equivalent mutual funds.   Read:  An industry icon explains how Enron’s fall sparked the ETF explosion  According to FactSet, the 10 equity ETFs with the largest year-to-date inflows are all iShares or Vanguard products, with five funds from each sponsor seeing the greatest adoption. Of the top 20 stock funds, 17 come from either one or the other. (Of the remaining three, one comes from Charles Schwab, while another is sponsored by SPDR State Street Global Advisors and the third is from PowerShares.) A similar trend is seen in fixed-income ETFs, where all the top 12 funds are either iShares or Vanguard products. The iShares suite is owned by BlackRock

                                         which—separate from iShares—had inflows of $4.54 billion thus far this year.  Morningstar looked at products from 852 fund families, and of those, only five had inflows of more than $10 billion over the time period considered. (In addition to Vanguard and iShares, they were Dimensional Fund Advisors, Pimco, and Schwab ETFs.) More than half the fund families—439, amounting to 51.5%—had outflows. Among the families with the biggest redemptions, Franklin Templeton Investments led the way with $11.24 billion in outflows. The firm couldn’t immediately be reached for comment. Wells Fargo funds had outflows of $5.25 billion thus far this year, the fifth-highest of any firm. The redemptions lowered the assets held by Wells funds to $88.3 billion. Other major names have also seen outflows in 2017. J.P. Morgan funds have seen a combined $3.79 billion in outflows this year, lowering its assets to $285.75 billion, while $332.9 million has been pulled from Goldman Sachs funds. According to a report by the Financial Times, Goldman Sachs Asset Management was the worst-selling fund manager globally thus far in 2017. The asset manager had outflows of $26.7 billion, per the FT, almost twice the rate of Federated Investors, the second-worst selling house. “By their nature, money market fund flows in any short period are a misleading measure of our business or longer term performance for clients,” a Goldman spokesperson told the FT. While Goldman funds overall saw outflows, the firm did see increased adoption of its ETF lineup. One fund, the Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Large Cap Equity ETF

                                         had inflows of $733.4 million thus far this year, according to FactSet. Two other ETFs also had year-to-date inflows above $150 million. SPDR State Street Global Advisors, the third major player in the passive arena, bucked the trend of Vanguard and iShares, showing outflows of about $504 million in 2017. This is almost entirely due to SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust

The SPY, the largest and most actively traded ETF on the market, is frequently used as a short-term holding or a vehicle for hedging by investors. Its flows fluctuate wildly on a day-to-day basis.

In the world of asset management, it increasingly seems like there’s Vanguard, and then there’s everyone else. The investment management giant has taken in more than $177.3 billion in inflows across its products thus far in 2017, according to Morningstar data. That’s about as much as its 10 closest competitors—combined. The losers amid Vanguard’s victory include such Wall Street titans as J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.

                                         all of which have seen notable outflows this year. Vanguard’s dominance is a byproduct of investors moving en masse to passive products, which simply track an index like the S&P 500

                                         as opposed to actively managed products, which aim to outperform such indexes through portfolio managers selecting the securities held. Data have repeatedly shown that passive funds perform better than active ones, particularly over the long term. Just as importantly, passive funds typically have much lower fees than their active counterparts. Vanguard funds, which are among the cheapest in the industry, can be had for as little as 4 basis points, or $4 for every $10,000 invested. While Vanguard does offer actively managed funds—as well as “smart beta” funds, which use rules to deliver such strategies as “growth,” “value,” or “low volatility”—the overwhelming trend has been to passive. Last year, active funds as an overall category saw outflows of $285.2 billion while passive funds attracted inflows of $428.7 billion. This rotation has been occurring for at least 10 years. According to Morningstar data, the flows into Vanguard products—which lifted its total assets to $3.826 trillion—were nearly double that of the second-place finisher, iShares, another giant in passive strategies, where inflows were about $94 billion.  Morningstar’s flow data, which is through the end of May, looks at both mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, an investment structure that has become increasingly popular. Not only are ETFs dominated by passive strategies, but they are both cheaper and more tax efficient than equivalent mutual funds.   Read:  An industry icon explains how Enron’s fall sparked the ETF explosion  According to FactSet, the 10 equity ETFs with the largest year-to-date inflows are all iShares or Vanguard products, with five funds from each sponsor seeing the greatest adoption. Of the top 20 stock funds, 17 come from either one or the other. (Of the remaining three, one comes from Charles Schwab, while another is sponsored by SPDR State Street Global Advisors and the third is from PowerShares.) A similar trend is seen in fixed-income ETFs, where all the top 12 funds are either iShares or Vanguard products. The iShares suite is owned by BlackRock

Wells Fargo funds had outflows of $5.25 billion thus far this year, the fifth-highest of any firm. The redemptions lowered the assets held by Wells funds to $88.3 billion.

Morgan funds have seen a combined $3.79 billion in outflows this year, lowering its assets to $285.75 billion, while $332.9 million has been pulled from Goldman Sachs funds. According to a report by the Financial Times, Goldman Sachs Asset Management was the worst-selling fund manager globally thus far in 2017. The asset manager had outflows of $26.7 billion, per the FT, almost twice the rate of Federated Investors, the second-worst selling house. “By their nature, money market fund flows in any short period are a misleading measure of our business or longer term performance for clients,” a Goldman spokesperson told the FT. While Goldman funds overall saw outflows, the firm did see increased adoption of its ETF lineup. One fund, the Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Large Cap Equity ETF

SPDR State Street Global Advisors, the third major player in the passive arena, bucked the trend of Vanguard and iShares, showing outflows of about $504 million in 2017. This is almost entirely due to SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust

Fitch warns mortgage bond investors: Wells Fargo could keep more money for legal fees
$2.2 billion in RMBS classes now at risk of downgrade

July 12, 2017
Ben Lane




KEYWORDS Fitch Fitch Ratings Mortgage bond performance Mortgage Bond Trustees mortgage bonds Residential mortgage-backed security RMBS RMBS ratings Wells Fargo


Earlier this month, Wells Fargo unexpectedly kept $90 million away from residential mortgage-backed securities investors, stating that the bank needed the money to cover legal expenses.
Now, Fitch Ratings is warning RMBS investors that Wells Fargo’s move may not be an isolated incident. In fact, it may be a harbinger of similar moves to come in the future.
Of the $90 million that Wells Fargo held back, approximately $79 million came from 17 Fitch-rated RMBS transactions.
According to Fitch’s report, the redirection of trust funds by Wells Fargo resulted in insufficient remaining funds to pay off 55 Fitch-rated classes, including six classes with investment-grade ratings, which were included in the 17 RMBS deals.
Fitch reviewed similar RMBS deals and found a significant number that had similar characteristics to the 17 deals in question. Those deals, therefore, are at risk for Wells Fargo taking similar actions, Fitch writes.
As a result of that review, Fitch placed 299 RMBS classes from 98 RMBS transactions on "Rating Watch Negative," due to the potential for Wells Fargo to reserve against future expenses the bank may incur to defend itself against litigation.
According to Fitch’s report, the outstanding balance on those 299 RMBS classes is $2.2 billion.
In total, Fitch said the 299 classes are at an "increased risk for payment disruption" in the future, which basically means that Wells Fargo could do it again, so each of those classes are under review for rating downgrade.
"Wells Fargo has indicated that the withheld reserves are intended to cover future expenses related to lawsuits initiated in 2014 by institutional investors who claim they were damaged when Wells Fargo did not fulfill its obligation as trustee to protect them from defective mortgages," Fitch writes in its report. "Wells Fargo's action is notable due to its preemptive nature and due to the magnitude of the amounts withheld."
Fitch also notes that similar legal actions have been taken against all U.S. RMBS trustees – Bank of New York Mellon, Citibank, Deutsche Bank, U.S. Bank, HSBC Bank – which could mean that those banks could withhold money as well if the conditions deemed it necessary.
In its report, Fitch explains why all of this is significant:

U.S. RMBS transaction documents indemnify trustees against legal expenses incurred except those by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence as determined by a court. To date, trustees have typically only withheld funds to cover expenses actually incurred or reserves in amounts not large enough to affect credit ratings.

That all changed when Wells Fargo elected to withhold that $90 million, with the potential for more that could be coming.
Fitch explains:

The amount withheld from the 17 called transactions reflects an assumption by Wells Fargo of future legal expenses of $3,000 per loan originally in the trust, plus $130,000 for each transaction. 
Fitch assumes Wells Fargo will continue to pre-emptively redirect trust funds to reserve against future expenses in scenarios where they may not be able to reimburse themselves from the trust in the future, such as when a transaction is called or when the remaining pool balance is relatively small.

And if those conditions are present, Wells Fargo (and potentially other RMBS trustees) could withhold funds.
Fitch said that it contacted the other five trustees named in similar lawsuits and all five trustees were “unwilling or unable” to provide guidance on whether they intend to employ a strategy similar to Wells Fargo.
"J.P. Morgan's research team has identified four transactions where three trustees other than Wells Fargo (U.S. Bank, Bank of New York Mellon and HSBC) withheld funds on called transactions," Fitch notes. "The amounts were not large enough to affect Fitch-rated classes and the trustees would not disclose what portion, if any, was pre-emptively held for future expenses."
Fitch did note that the legality of Wells Fargo’s action is expected to be challenged in court, so this entire exercise could end up being a moot point.
But, for now, RMBS investors are on alert.

Fannie Mae: from legacy to startup


        You'd be forgiven for thinking that a quasi-federal agency founded in the 1930s is the last place you’d describe using words like innovative or agile. But you’d be wrong. Defying all stereotypes, Fannie Mae’s recent actions read a lot more like a startup than a $2.8 billion company with more than 7,000 employees. In the last two years, the company has implemented a user experience strategy, adopted design thinking and accelerated time to market for an innovative array of products.

Prime status: an update on luxury residential real estate


Deborah Huso


Real Estate


        In the years leading up to the housing bubble of 2007, it seemed like everyone was getting a piece of the American Dream of homeownership (or maybe even second homeownership). Ten years after the Great Recession, how is luxury residential real estate faring? Was the recent market slowdown just a temporary blip on the radar and will the sector continue to draw the aspirational interest of buyers as it did in the early to mid-2000s?

        Most mortgage professionals know that the client feels a sense of loyalty to the first person they speak with. When they establish themselves as the first contact, loan officers gain a critical sales advantage. In fact, speed-to-call is the single largest driver of conversion for new customer leads. 
Studies show that returning a call from a new customer within the first 30 minutes produces an average of a 62% increase in conversion rates.

Wells Fargo Launches Fund Services Product Line






November 04, 2010 08:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



COLUMBIA, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Wells Fargo Bank announced today the launch of a new Fund Services 
      product line within its Corporate Trust Services to address customers’ 
      fund administration needs. Wells Fargo Fund Services provides fund 
      administration services including a full suite of back-, middle-, and 
      front-office products and services to private equity firms, exchange 
      traded commodities (ETC), commodity funds, hedge funds, fund of funds 
      and the structured finance marketplace.
    


      Jorge Villalba, a 12-year industry veteran recently joined Wells Fargo 
      to lead the Fund Services Group. Tom Gandolfo is head of Sales. The team 
      is based in Columbia, MD; Houston, TX; and New York City and leverages 
      expertise across Wells Fargo, including seasoned trust and compliance 
      professionals. Additional hiring is anticipated by year-end.
    

      “We're pleased to offer our hedge fund customers another option for 
      their specific financial services needs,” said Brian Bartlett, head of 
      Wells Fargo’s Corporate Trust Services. “Our deep experience 
      administering fixed income and bank debt products combined with our 
      investment in first-rate technology and talent has produced a unique and 
      compelling suite of Fund Services that adds tremendous value to our 
      customers.”
    

      Fund administrators can select a custom suite of services based on their 
      needs. Services include reconciling the fund with third parties such as 
      prime brokers, processing portfolio transactions, calculation and 
      reporting on net asset valuations (NAV), monthly financial statement 
      preparation and distribution, and full investor services including 
      maintaining the share register and investor registration details. Wells 
      Fargo Fund Services gathers data from numerous third-party sources, 
      consolidates the data and presents it to the fund manager in a daily, 
      weekly or monthly report based on their needs.
    

      Customers can obtain more information about Fund Services by visiting wellsfargo.com/fundservices 
      or contacting Tom Gandolfo at Thomas.Gandolfo@wellsfargo.com

Request a Consultation  What is a mutual fund? A mutual fund pools investors’ money to purchase stocks, bonds, other securities and cash. An investor can buy shares of a mutual fund, which is professionally managed according to investment objectives stated in the fund’s prospectus. Unlike traditional mutual funds, asset allocation and target date funds primarily invest in other mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to gain exposure to a wide variety of asset classes. These funds are well-diversified and, under normal market conditions, follow a target asset allocation based upon the fund’s investment objectives.  Typically, target date funds are sold by date, such as a 2025 fund. The farther away the date is, the greater the risks the fund usually takes.
 There is no assurance a mutual fund, including target date and asset allocation funds, or ETFs, will meet their investment objectives, or that an investor will have sufficient money in retirement investing in a target date fund.  The principal value of an investment in a mutual fund or ETF is not guaranteed at any time, including, for a target date fund, at its target date.   Options involve risk and are not suitable for all investors.  Before opening an option position, a person must receive a copy of “Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options.”  This is available from the Options Clearing Corporation or any listed options exchange.  You should read it carefully before investing.   Brokerage products and services are offered through Wells Fargo Advisors. Wells Fargo Advisors is a trade name used by Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC and Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network, LLC, Members SIPC, separate registered broker-dealers and non-bank affiliates of Wells Fargo & Company and is intended only for United States residents. WellsTrade® brokerage accounts are offered through WFCS.   Investment and Insurance Products:  Are Not insured by the FDIC or any other federal government agency Are Not deposits of or guaranteed by a Bank May Lose Value   1115-02268
