See The Benefits of Pods



How fresh is the coffee from a pod?Each pod is individually wrapped, resulting in a sanitary and fresh product. The ground coffee is inserted into pods in an environment than is below 1% oxygen, preserving the coffee's freshness. On top of that, the high quality packaging keeps pods fresh. With each pod you get fresh coffee smell and real coffee taste!Coffee taste and quality are important. How does a coffee pod rate over other leading single serve cups?Pod's heavier weights lead to better extraction and a stronger cup of coffee. On top of that, each pod contains three times the flat surface area of a leading single serve cup, providing maximum extraction and taste! Pods fit adjustable brewers that allow for customizing serving size and robustness. Plus, since the Pod brewing system is not available for public purchasing, you don't have to worry about your products leaving the office. How environmentally friendly are pods?Cool Beans® pods are wrapped entirely in paper, making them 100% compostable and environmentally friendly. Since there is no plastic involved, no toxins are present during brewing and only coffee is used for the brewing process. Unlike other single serve options like K-Cups, there is less waste generated and more coffee produced: 8 oz. of coffee per pod vs. 7.25 oz for a K-Cup.Since all of our Cool Beans® pods are roasted and packaged locally in Hartford, CT we're using less fuel and producing less greenhouse gases while transporting these delicious coffees to you. Additionally, all Cool Beans® pods are certified Kosher.
