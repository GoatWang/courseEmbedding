Special Situations Australian and Hong Kong Equities. Australian Warrants (AUT only). Most exposures are now booked via portfolio total return swaps and CFDs between the Funds and the Prime Broker, this improves operational efficiency and facilitates cost saving. References above refer to the underlying exposure of the portfolio total return swaps and CFDs. Summary Please accept our apologies in the late delivery of this monthly report. We have worked on producing a single document that will keep investors and potential investors informed of our monthly performance, the source of this performance and any market views we have for both: the long standing KIS Asia Long Short Fund (the A$ denominated Australian domiciled Unit Trust [AUT]) the new KIS Asia Long Short Cayman Fund (the Cayman domiciled multi currency feeder company [the Cayman Fund]). The launch of the Cayman Fund has produced benefits for both fund holders. Where possible we have used our increased bargaining power to achieve better pricing for both funds, for example, we have managed to lower the commission costs with our most significant broker by 21%. When writing a monthly report and giving any indication of predictive views it is imperative to avoid assuming that your current set of beliefs is the same as you held at the start of the month. If you are writing a report based to the end of July in the third week of August it is very easy to appear to have been very accurate about the first three weeks of the month! As a result, these predictive comments to will be kept to a minimum this month We continue to have a bearish view of the world. Economic data is not positive, showing a general slowdown across many countries and economic sectors. For the early part of July we positioned the total portfolio with a short bias. Over the month we observed that at a micro level, stocks rallied hard which had a large short interest, and announced results that were better than a small miss. We feel the equity markets are being squeezed higher due to shorts being covered or under allocations to equity weightings being taken to full allocation. KIS CAPITAL PARTNERS - 34 Long Short The portfolio contributed 21bp of performance to the AUT and 16bp of performance to the Cayman fund. Positions taken in Hong Kong were the largest contributor to the portfolio this month producing 90% of the gains. There was no single significant underlying within HK that produced the majority of the gain. Position taking in Australia, Singapore and the use of US Index Futures as a hedge produced little return. In Australia, our success ratio was limited with only 30% of trade ideas being winners. With such a poor success ratio it is quite unusual to be able to talk of a positive contribution, even if it is small at 6bp. We were successful at the fast and effective stopping out of ineffective positions and the maximization of winning ideas. On the long side we made profits on Beach Energy Ltd contributing 21bp to the portfolio; we see Beach as a possible takeover target and plan to continue to retain a long exposure. On the short side we suffered losses on Energy World Corp, losing 9bp. We had two significant winners on short positions in Navitas Limited and Lynas Corp Ltd. Lynas contributed 13bp of profit as the price tumbles of the rare earth minerals it hopes to process in Malaysia. Navitas contributed 17bp of profit to the portfolio. With a strong A$ and less accommodating government policy, we think it is difficult to compete with the education opportunities being offered in the US, Canada and Europe. This was borne out on the 24th July when Navitas announced a slowing growth of international student enrolments. Portfolio Hedge and Equity Arbitrage Neither portfolio made a significant contribution to results this month. Special Situations This portfolio contributed 10bp to the AUT and 4bp to the Cayman Fund. The difference in contribution was a result of receiving warrants on Aleator Energy subscribed for in April (prior to the inception of the Cayman Fund). These warrants were the sole property of the AUT. Currency Class FX Hedge - KIS Only Investments are received in US$ and spot exchanged to A$. This FX spot trade is then one month forward FX hedged back to US$. The cost of this FX hedge is a function of the differential of interest rates between US$ and A$. Please note that the monies attract interest in A$ for the month. The cost of this hedge for July was 0.33%.

Investments - KIS CAPITAL





















































 












 

 We believe financial markets will tend towards equilibrium over the long term; however over the short to medium term, inefficiencies will create mispricing.
 

 
 


Investment Products
We seek to identify, react quickly and take advantage of these situations when we identify catalysts to support the closing of this mispricing. We believe Equities as an asset class provides the opportunity to generate alpha on the back of inefficiencies that exist due to the diversity of market participants pursuing differing agendas. In our opinion investors approach their investment decisions with a bias based upon fundamentally incorrect analysis.
