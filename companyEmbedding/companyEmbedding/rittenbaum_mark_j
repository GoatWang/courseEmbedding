Mark Rittenbaum

The Greenbrier Companies




Mark J. Rittenbaum, Executive Vice President, Commercial & Leasing at The Greenbrier Companies, Inc. is transitioning to President of Greenbrier Leasing Corp. (GLC), in anticipation of James T. Sharp’s retirement Dec. 31, 2016.





Sharp will continue in an advisory role through 2016 and beyond, assisting with transition and special projects. “The organizational changes will further integrate Greenbrier’s Leasing and Management Services businesses with its Commercial activities, building on the substantial growth and success of the integrated leasing business developed during Sharp’s 20-year tenure at Greenbrier,” the company said. “Greenbrier continues to serve global markets for its products and services, while maintaining the high-quality experience expected by Greenbrier’s customers.”
Rittenbaum will have oversight responsibilities for all Commercial & Leasing activities in North America and Latin America, with particular emphasis on new railcar sales, leasing and enhancement of customer service design. Jim Cowan, President of Greenbrier International, will oversee Commercial activities in all railcar markets outside the Americas, while continuing as CEO of GBW Railcar Services LLC, Greenbrier’s railcar repair and refurbishment joint venture with Watco Cos. LLC. Alejandro Centurion continues as President of Greenbrier’s Global Manufacturing Operations (GMO). Centurion is credited with implementing Greenbrier’s global manufacturing and engineering system for new railcar manufacturing. Currently, GMO’s global output accounts for approximately 75% of Greenbrier’s annual worldwide revenue.
GLC will continue to align its leasing and management services businesses to emphasize three primary areas of business activity: Lease Underwriting, Lease Syndication and Asset Management Services (GMS). These areas will be led by three Greenbrier veterans who currently report to Rittenbaum: Larry Stanley, Senior Vice President, GLC Finance, will lead Lease Underwriting; Brian Conn, Managing Director, Structured Financial Products, will lead Lease Syndication; and Dan Weiler will serve as Senior Vice President Asset Management, leading GMS.
Greenbrier’s Commercial organization includes Greenbrier’s field sales operations and commercial administration headed by Brian Comstock, Senior Vice President, General Manager Commercial, Americas Region and Tom Jackson, Vice President, Marketing.
“Greenbrier is becoming more global, leveraging our scale, and moving closer to our customers,” said William A. Furman, Chairman and CEO. “We have a focused ‘go-to-market strategy’ that serves our integrated business model and reflects our expanded worldwide activities. Thanks to the talents and vision of Jim Sharp, we have grown a small railcar leasing company into a very successful asset-light leasing and asset management business that manages more than 268,000 railcars and originates almost $1 billion of railcar leases annually. Most of this product is syndicated and sold to institutional partners with underlying assets managed by Greenbrier over the life of the equipment. I greatly appreciate Jim’s 20 years of service to Greenbrier.”
“We have a deep pool of talented people and highly capable teams in place within our Leasing, Management Services and Commercial organizations,” Rittenbaum said. “I know that the current high levels of integration and coordinated effort will only grow as we continue to collaborate within this new organizational structure. My goal is to build on the platforms created by Jim and the GLC team, along with our Commercial organization.”

Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.
