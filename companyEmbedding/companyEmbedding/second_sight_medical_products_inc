(NASDAQ:EYES) Second Sight Medical Products, Inc. is engaged in developing, manufacturing and marketing prosthetic devices that restore vision to blind individuals. The Company’s product, the Argus II System, treats outer retinal degenerations, such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP). The Argus II System provides an artificial form of vision that differs from the vision of people with normal sight. It does not restore normal vision and it does not slow or reverse the progression of the disease. The Company’s Argus II System employs electrical stimulation to bypass degenerated photoreceptor cells and to stimulate remaining viable retinal cells thereby inducing visual perception in blind individuals. The Argus II System works by converting video images captured by a miniature camera housed in a patient’s glasses into a series of small electrical pulses that are transmitted wirelessly to an array of electrodes that are implanted on the surface of the retina.

About the Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System


      Second Sight's Argus II System provides electrical stimulation that 
      bypasses the defunct retinal cells and stimulates remaining viable cells 
      inducing visual perception in individuals with severe to profound 
      Retinitis Pigmentosa. The Argus II works by converting images captured 
      by a miniature video camera mounted on the patient's glasses into a 
      series of small electrical pulses, which are transmitted wirelessly to 
      an array of electrodes implanted on the surface of the retina. These 
      pulses stimulate the retina's remaining cells, intending to result in 
      the perception of patterns of light in the brain. The patient must learn 
      to interpret these visual patterns, having the potential to regain some 
      visual function. The Argus II was the first artificial retina to receive 
      widespread approval, and is offered at approved centers in Canada, 
      France, Germany, Italy, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, 
      Turkey, United Kingdom, and the U.S.
    

About Second Sight

      implantable visual prosthetics to enable blind individuals to achieve

      conducting a trial to test the safety and utility of the Argus II in

	Item
	8.01 Other Events



	On July 13,
	2017, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) posted the proposed rule and related proposed rates for the calendar
	year (CY) 2018, Medicare Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) and the CY 2018 Ambulatory Surgical Center (ASC)
	payment system. In these postings, CMS proposes a Medicare hospital outpatient rate for CY 2018 of approximately $122,000 for Argus
	II and the associated surgical implantation procedure, and a proposed ASC rate of approximately $118,381 for the Argus II and related
	implantation procedure. After reviewing the 2016 hospital claims data, CMS has proposed reassigning Current Procedural Terminology
	(CPT) code 0100T (Placement of subconjunctival retinal prosthesis receiver and pulse generator, and implantation of intra-ocular
	retinal electrode array, with vitrectomy) from Ambulatory Payment Classification (APC) 1906, with a 2017 Medicare payment rate
	of approximately $150,000, to APC 1904, with a proposed CY2018 payment rate of approximately $122,000. The proposed hospital outpatient
	and ASC rates would include both the Argus II, reported with HCPCS code C1841 (Retinal prosthesis, includes all internal and external
	components), and the surgical implantation procedure, reported with CPT code 0100T.


	In the coming
	months, Second Sight Medical Products, Inc. (the “Company”) will provide comments on these rules to CMS. The Company
	expects other stakeholders to provide comments as well. Based on all the public comments and any new 2016 data CMS may receive,
	the final rule will be released around November 2017.


	In addition,
	the CMS postings address CY 2018 payments for the recently created codes for the initial programming and the reprogramming services
	related to Argus II – CPT codes 0472T (Device evaluation, interrogation, and initial programming of intra-ocular retinal
	electrode array (eg, retinal prosthesis), in person, with iterative adjustment of the implantable device to test functionality,
	select optimal permanent programmed values with analysis, including visual training, with review and report by a qualified health
	care professional) and 0473T (Device evaluation and interrogation of intra-ocular retinal electrode array (eg, retinal prosthesis),
	in person, including reprogramming and visual training, when performed, with review and report by a qualified health care professional).
	The proposed CY 2018 hospital outpatient payment rates for the initial programming (CPT code 0472T) and for the reprogramming (0473T)
	are $253.85 and $111.72, respectively.


	This proposed
	rule and related files affect Medicare payment to the hospital outpatient departments that are paid under OPPS and ASCs. They do
	not directly alter payment from Medicare Advantage, private U.S. health insurance and non-U.S. business. This is a proposed rule
	published for public comment. No assurance can be made that the final rule will not differ substantially from the proposed rule.

Second Sight Medical Products Inc. Submits an Application for an Investigational Device Exemption with the United States Food and Drug Administration for Approval to Conduct an Early Feasibility Study of its Orion Cortical Visual Prosthesis System in A Clinical Trial of Up to Five Patients
Jul 18 17
Second Sight Medical Products, Inc. submitted an application for an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approval to conduct an early feasibility study of its Orion Cortical Visual Prosthesis System in a clinical trial of up to five patients. It is typical for an IDE application to involve several rounds of question and answer interactions with the FDA. Timing of the review and FDA approval process is unpredictable and no assurance can
be given as to when the Company will receive an IDE for the planned Orion feasibility study.


Second Sight Medical Products, Inc. Introduces Retinal Prosthesis System in South Korea
Jul 5 17
Second Sight Medical Products, Inc. has announced market entry into South Korea, implanting two patients with the company's Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System (Argus II) in Seoul. The implants were facilitated by the country's distribution partner, Kisantech Co. Ltd. A second patient in Taiwan also received the company's Argus II. This surgical procedure was facilitated by Orient Europharma Co. Ltd., Second Sight's  distribution partner for Taiwan. The two implants in South Korea were performed by Young Hee Yoon, MD, Professor, Department of Ophthalmology, Asan Medical Center, in May 2017 and June 2017 at the Asan Medical Center in Seoul in 54- and 56-year old patients with Retinitis Pigmentosa. The second implant in Taiwan was performed in April 2017 by Dr. Shi-Jen Chen at Taipei Veterans General Hospital in a 55-year old patient with retinal degeneration. As previously announced, the first Argus II in Taiwan was implanted by Dr. Yih-Shiou Hwang at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in a 40-year old patient with retinal degeneration. Second Sight's Argus II System provides electrical stimulation that bypasses the defunct retinal cells and stimulates remaining viable cells inducing visual perception in individuals with severe to profound Retinitis Pigmentosa. The Argus II works by converting images captured by a miniature video camera mounted on the patient's glasses into a series of small electrical pulses, which are transmitted wirelessly to an array of electrodes implanted on the surface of the retina. These pulses stimulate the retina's remaining cells, intending to result in the perception of patterns of light in the brain. The patient must learn to interpret these visual patterns, having the potential to regain some visual function. The Argus II was the first artificial retina to receive widespread approval, and is offered at approved centers in Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, Turkey, UK, and the US.

Company Description (as filed with the SEC)
Second Sight was founded in 1998 with a mission to develop, manufacture, and
market prosthetic devices that restore useful vision to blind individuals. Our
principal offices are located in Sylmar, California, approximately 25 miles
northwest of downtown Los Angeles. We also have an office in Lausanne,
Switzerland, that manages our commercial and clinical operations in Europe, the
Middle East, Latin America and Asia-Pacific.

 

Our current product, the Argus ® II System, treats outer retinal degenerations,
such as retinitis pigmentosa, also referred to as RP. RP is a hereditary
disease, affecting an estimated 1.5 million people worldwide including about
100,000 people in the United States, that causes a progressive degeneration of
the light-sensitive cells of the retina, leading to significant visual
impairment and ultimately blindness.  ... More ...
