RALEIGH, N.C., Jan. 4, 2012 /PRNewswire/ --Â Hatteras Funds, a boutique alternative investment specialist providing unique alternative investment solutions for financial advisors and their clients, announced today that the Hatteras Multi-Strategy Fund has been renamed the Hatteras Core Alternatives Fund. The Fund's strategies, objectives and management will not change.
Renaming the fund further distinguishes and better articulates the Hatteras Core Alternatives Fund from other multi-strategy funds of funds. Managed in partnership with Morgan Creek Capital Management, the core alternative investment solution allocates to both hedged strategies and private investments in a single investment vehicle, making it unique in the industry.
"As the alternative investing landscape evolves, renaming the Hatteras Multi-Strategy Fund the Hatteras Core Alternatives Fund provides greater clarity for investment advisors and their clients about the Fund's investment strategies, allocations and the role the Fund plays in a portfolio," said David B. Perkins, Hatteras Funds Founder and Chairman. "Thousands of funds currently fall under the multi-strategy umbrella, but the Hatteras Core Alternatives Fund is the only all alternatives, multi-strategy fund of funds combining hedged strategies with a mature, seasoned private investments portfolio. With 75 percent of our Fund's assets allocated to hedged strategies and 25 percent allocated to private investments, ours is truly a core alternative investment solution for qualified clients in both name and investment strategy."
The Fund was launched in 2004 to serve as a complement to a traditional portfolio of bonds, stocks and cash and was designed after the university endowment's alternative investment portfolio. The Fund allocates to 4 hedged strategies including Opportunistic Equity, Enhanced Fixed Income, Absolute Return and Tactical Trading. Additionally, the Fund allocates to private investment strategies diversified across 7 vintage years. By providing institutional-quality portfolios in a registered fund, investors gain access to strategies and managers that would normally be inaccessible due to high investment minimums and/or capacity constraints.
"The renaming to Hatteras Core Alternatives Fund does not alter our unwavering commitment to advisors whose clients are looking for sophisticated alternative investment solutions," said Mr. Perkins. "This is simply a better representation of the role this Fund could play in an Advisor's portfolio allocation."

Important Disclosures and Risk Factors: This is not an offering to subscribe for units in any fund and is intended for informational purposes only. An offering can only be made by delivery of the Prospectus to "qualified clients" within the meaning of U.S. securities laws. Please carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses of the Funds before investing. Please read the Prospectus carefully before investing as it contains important information on the investment objectives, composition, fees, charges and expenses, risks, suitability, and tax obligations of investing in the Funds. Copies of the Prospectus and performance data current to the most recent month-end may be obtained online at hatterasfunds.com or by contacting Hatteras Funds at 866.388.6292. Past performance does not guarantee future results. 
The Hatteras Core Alternatives Fund, L.P.; the Hatteras Core Alternatives TEI Fund, L.P; the Hatteras Core Alternatives Institutional Fund, L.P.; and the Hatteras Core Alternatives TEI Institutional Fund, L.P. (collectively referred to herein as the "Hatteras Core Alternatives Fund" or the "Fund") are Delaware limited partnerships that are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"), as amended, as non-diversified, closed-end management investment companies whose units are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Hatteras Core Alternatives Fund is a fund of alternative investments. As such, the Fund invests in private hedge funds and private equity investments. Hedge funds are speculative investments and are not suitable for all investors, nor do they represent a complete investment program. A hedge fund can be described generally as a private and unregistered investment pool that accepts investors' money and employs hedging and arbitrage techniques using long and short positions, leverage and derivatives, and investments in many markets. 
Key Risk Factors: The Fund, through an investment in the Master Fund, will invest substantially all of its assets in underlying funds that are generally not registered as investment companies under the 1940 Act and, therefore, the Fund will not have the benefit of various protections provided under the 1940 Act with respect to an investment in those underlying funds. The Fund can be highly volatile, carry substantial fees, and involve complex tax structures. Investments in the Fund involve a high degree of risk, including loss of entire capital. The underlying funds may engage in speculative investment strategies and practices, such as the use of leverage, short sales, and derivatives transactions, which can increase the risk of investment loss. The Fund provides limited liquidity, and units in the Fund are not transferable. Liquidity will be provided only through repurchase offers made by the Fund from time to time, generally on a quarterly basis upon prior written notice. 
The success of the Fund is highly dependent on the financial and managerial expertise of its principals and key personnel of the Fund's investment managers. Although the investment managers for the Fund expect to receive detailed information from each underlying fund on a regular basis regarding its valuation, investment performance, and strategy, in most cases the investment managers have little or no means of independently verifying this information. The underlying funds are not required to provide transparency with respect to their respective investments. By investing in the underlying funds indirectly through the Fund, investors will be subject to a dual layer of fees, both at the Fund and underlying fund levels. Certain underlying funds will not provide final Schedule K-1s for any fiscal year before April 15th of the following year. Those funds, however, will endeavor to provide estimates of taxable income or losses with respect to their investments. 
Please see the Prospectus for a detailed discussion of the specific risks disclosed here and other important risks and considerations.

Investment Hatteras Core Alternatives Fund  Quarterly Review q2 2012 


    The Hatteras Core Alternatives Institutional Fund, L.P. (the âFundâ) outperformed the benchmark as well as the broader equity markets by finishing the quarter slightly down. The Fundâs benchmark, the HFRX Global Hedge Fund Index, posted a -1.9% loss for the quarter. The S&P 500 TR Index finished the quarter down -2.8% and global equities as measured by the MSCI World Index sold off even further down -5.1% with heavy volatility throughout the quarter. The Fundâs Private Investment Strategy bounced back significantly from a rather quiet first quarter to lead all of our strategies and return over 6% for the quarter.  

Josh E. Parrot, CAIA- Hatteras Funds | Aug 09, 2012



































Private Investments

	With an overall weighting of 27% and a positive 6.2% return, the strategy contributed significantly to the Fundâs overall performance. The private strategyâs returns over the first quarter were relatively flat; however, the strategy rose with vigor over the spring months reporting a positive 4.1% in May after its positive 2.0% return in April. The quarterâs positive performance illustrates the competitive edge of the private investment approach that not only incorporates higher return potential but also adds a much needed element of diversification away from the public markets.

	The uplift in returns over the quarter resulted heavily from the strong performance in the Private Energy strategy. Due to the falling prices of natural gas and overall volatility of commodity markets, many private energy funds have shifted their focus towards unconventional resource plays. These emerging plays are tied to technological improvements in the oil and gas industry and have been a growth driver in domestic oil and gas production. New and evolving technologies such as horizontal drilling, 3-D seismic, and hydraulic fracturing have permitted oil and gas companies to access reserves of previously unrecoverable oil and natural gas. The implementation of these unconventional resource projects is highly capital intensive and require management expertise to execute. Therefore, these unconventional resource plays have presented an opportunity for private energy funds to fill a need where capital market funding is not readily available. These opportunities have resulted in strong returns for our managers illustrating the agile and strategic nature of the private energy sector to opportunistically invest in areas that are not readily available in the public markets.

	The other compelling characteristic of our private strategy has been its growing maturity. In the fourth quarter of 2011 quarterly distributions from underlying funds were larger than quarterly contributions to funds. We have seen this trend continue into 2012 as year-to-date distributions represented around 105% of capital contributions1. If this trend plays out and distributions continue to outweigh contributions, cash previously used to fund capital calls can now be opportunistically deployed for liquidity needs or additional investments, thus placing less capital needs on the portfolio from a cash standpoint. The uptick in distributions is also an indicator that the investments are entering a prime period of their life cycle where valuations and exits could accelerate together.

	We believe the current environment presents vast opportunities for private equity given public markets continue their volatility and capital market funding becomes less available. With the growing maturity and ample diversification offered in the private asset portfolio, we believe the impact of this strategy will continue to provide excess risk adjusted returns not available in a typical fund of hedge funds or traditional investment portfolio.

Hedge Fund Strategies

	Our Hedge Fund Strategy was down -2.9% during the quarter and most of the losses can be attributed to our emerging market and energy themes. These themes were two of our best performing positions during the first quarter but the ramifications of a global economic slowdown clearly hurt some of these higher beta exposures. Our Tactical Trading strategy helped offset the market volatility and dislocation during the quarter and ended as our best performing hedge fund strategy with a significant positive return.

Opportunistic Equity

	Opportunistic Equity is currently a 31% weight and was down just over -5% for the quarter due to Emerging Markets, Technology and Energy exposures. During the quarter, we allocated to a new global long/short equity manager and we remain bullish on the long term potential of the emerging economies despite the recent price dislocations. In particular, we are emphasizing the emerging market consumer story and we continue to search for other hedged methods to implement this theme.

	In addition, our managers have been increasing their gross exposures in anticipation of a more fundamental stock picking environment this earnings season and we are especially bullish on long/short equity as a strategy in the near-term as we believe quality will start to matter again.

Enhanced Fixed Income

	Enhanced Fixed Income, at an 18% weight, was down -0.9% for the quarter. We continue to diversify away from Enhanced Fixed Income and more into Tactical Trading and Absolute Return as better volatility mitigators. As such, we have been reducing our distressed debt exposure but we remain bullish on

	Structured Credit and RMBS in particular. The recent rally in Treasuries during the quarter created even more opportunities as spreads widened versus RMBS securities.

Absolute Return

	Absolute Return was down -1.4% for the quarter and is currently a 14% weight. With the near term market uncertainty, we allocated to two new Absolute Return funds during the quarter within our Multi-Strategy and Relative Value sub-strategies. We also reduced our Event Driven exposure within the strategy to further mitigate volatility. Our Multi-Strategy managers continued to add positive returns for the quarter and have been the best performing funds for the strategy since last year.

Tactical Trading

	Tactical Trading, which incorporates managed futures, CTAs, global macro and tail risk strategies, has a 7% weighting and was the best performing hedge fund strategy. The strategy particularly proved its worth during the market dislocation in May and finished the quarter up nearly 1.8% despite a tumultuous June. Our discretionary CTAâs and Tail Risk sub-strategies were the dominant drivers of performance within Tactical Trading and both finished with solid mid-single digit quarterly returns to help offset the overall volatility in the markets.

Outlook

	We believe the second half of 2012 will be much more volatile than the first half and we have positioned the hedge fund portfolio accordingly. A lack of fiscal union in Europe, the pending fiscal cliff facing the U.S., and the overall global economic slowdown could all provide challenging head winds. Our blend of hedge funds and private investments stood up well during the most volatile periods of the quarter and we believe the Fund is well positioned to deliver unique benefits particularly from our private investment strategy. Whereas we are defensively positioned in the hedge fund portfolio, the private investment strategy remains poised to capitalize on a number of exposures.

	1. An average age of over 3 years for the underlying private portfolio companies is a significant milestone as exit opportunities in private investments tend to begin in earnest in years three through five. Often these control-oriented, active management style investors are starting to unlock the value theyâve created since their original purchases.

	2. Technology investments made not only in our Venture Capital funds but also through Private Energy are opening up new markets despite macro volatility.

	3. There is a gap between the public equity markets where values have doubled since March, 2009 and the significant discounts found in private equity companies. This separation will persist but is starting to narrow as M&A activity and IPOs resume like they did in Q2 2012.

	As always, we appreciate the confidence you have placed in Hatteras and your investment in the Hatteras Core Alternatives Fund. Thank you again, and if you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact us.

	Sincerely,

	The Hatteras Core Alternatives Fund Investment Team

Inception Date: Core Alternatives Fund and Core Alternatives TEI Fund 04/01/2005; Core Alternatives Institutional Fund 01/01/2007; and Core Alternatives TEI Institutional Fund 02/01/2007. Inception dates for the indices coincide with the fund inception date listed in the chart.
Performance results and calculations after the Fundsâ most recent fiscal year are unaudited. The principal value of the Funds will fluctuate so that an investorâs units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Returns are net of all expenses of the Funds, including the management fee and incentive allocations, and reflect reinvestment of all distributions, if applicable. Returns do not reflect payment of the 2% early redemption fee or upfront placement fees, which could be up to 2% for Core LP and Core TEI and 6% for Core Institutional and Core TEI Institutional, if applicable, which would reduce the returns shown above. Past performance does not guarantee future results and current performance may be lower or higher than the figures shown. To obtain performance information current to the most recent month-end, please call 866.388.6292. The net expense ratios shown below are the expenses partners will expect to incur through the Core Alternative Fundâs investment in the Master Fund, Core Alternatives Institutional Fundâs investment in the Master Fund, the Core TEI Fundâs investment in the Offshore Fund and the Master Fund, and the Core TEI Institutional Fundâs investment in the Offshore Fund and the Master Fund. The net expense ratio and total expense ratio for the Hatteras Core Alternatives Fund, L.P. is 2.44% and 6.93%, respectively. The net expense ratio and total expense ratio for the Hatteras Core Alternatives TEI Fund, L.P. is 2.63% and 7.12%, respectively. The net expense ratio and total expense ratio for the Hatteras Core Alternatives Institutional Fund, L.P. is 1.66% and 6.15%, respectively. The net expense ratio and total expense ratio for the Hatteras Core Alternatives TEI Institutional Fund, L.P. is 1.75% and 6.24%, respectively.

Tax Information







Important Disclosures
This is not an offering to subscribe for units in any fund and is intended for informational purposes only. An offering can only be made by delivery of the Prospectus to âqualified clientsâ within the meaning of U.S. securities laws. The Hatteras Core Alternatives Fund, L.P.; the Hatteras Core Alternatives TEI Fund, L.P; the Hatteras Core Alternatives Institutional Fund, L.P.; and the Hatteras Core Alternatives TEI Institutional Fund, L.P. (collectively referred to herein as the âHatteras Core Alternatives Fundâ or the âFundâ) are Delaware limited partnerships that are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the â1940 Actâ), as amended, as non-diversified, closed-end management investment companies whose units are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Hatteras Core Alternatives Fund is a fund of alternative investments. As such, the Fund invests in private hedge funds and private equity investments. Hedge funds are speculative investments and are not suitable for all investors, nor do they represent a complete investment program. A hedge fund can be described generally as a private and unregistered investment pool that accepts investorsâ money and employs hedging and arbitrage techniques using long and short positions, leverage and derivatives, and investments in many markets.
Key Risk Factors
The Fund, through an investment in the Master Fund, will invest substantially all of its assets in underlying funds that are generally not registered as investment companies under the 1940 Act and, therefore, the Fund will not have the benefit of various protections provided under the 1940 Act with respect to an investment in those underlying funds. The Fund can be highly volatile, carry substantial fees, and involve complex tax structures. Investments in the Fund involves a high degree of risk, including loss of entire capital. The underlying funds may engage in speculative investment strategies and practices, such as the use of leverage, short sales, and derivatives transactions, which can increase the risk of investment loss. The Fund provides limited liquidity, and units in the Funds are not transferable. Liquidity will be provided only through repurchase offers made by the Fund from time to time, generally on a quarterly basis upon prior written notice.
The success of the Fund is highly dependent on the financial and managerial expertise of its principals and key personnel of the Fundâs investment manager. Although the investment manager for the Fund expects to receive detailed information from each underlying fund on a regular basis regarding its valuation, investment performance, and strategy, in most cases the investment manager has little or no means of independently verifying this information. The underlying funds are not required to provide transparency with respect to their respective investments. By investing in the underlying funds indirectly through the Fund, investors will be subject to a dual layer of fees, both at the Fund and underlying fund levels. Certain underlying funds will not provide final Schedule K-1s for any fiscal year before April 15th of the following year. Those funds, however, will endeavor to provide estimates of taxable income or losses with respect to their investments. Please see the Prospectus for a detailed discussion of the specific risks disclosed here and other important risks and considerations.

	HATTERAS FUNDS



	(each a Delaware Limited Partnership)







	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS






	As of and for the six months ended September 30, 2013 (Unaudited)








	1.Â Â ORGANIZATION





	The Hatteras Funds, each a "Feeder Fund" and collectively the "Feeder Funds" are:




	Hatteras Core Alternatives Fund, L.P.




	Hatteras Core Alternatives TEI Fund, L.P.




	Hatteras Core Alternatives Institutional Fund, L.P.




	Hatteras Core Alternatives TEI Institutional Fund, L.P.




	The Hatteras Core Alternatives TEI Fund, L.P. and the Hatteras Core Alternatives TEI Institutional Fund, L.P. each invest substantially all of their assets in the Hatteras Core Alternatives Offshore Fund, LDC and Hatteras Core Alternatives Offshore Institutional Fund, LDC, (collectively the "Blocker Funds"), respectively. The Blocker Funds are Cayman Islands limited duration companies with the same investment objective as the Feeder Funds. The Blocker Funds serve solely as intermediate entities through which the Hatteras Core Alternatives TEI Fund, L.P. and the Hatteras Core Alternatives TEI Institutional Fund, L.P. invest in Hatteras Master Fund, L.P. (the "Master Fund" and together with the Feeder Funds, the "Funds"). The Blocker Funds enable tax-exempt Limited Partners (as defined below) to invest without receiving certain income in a form that would otherwise be taxable to such tax-exempt Limited Partners regardless of their tax-exempt status. The Hatteras Core Alternatives TEI Fund, L.P. owns 100% of the participating beneficial interests of the Hatteras Core Alternatives Offshore Fund, LDC and the Hatteras Core Alternatives TEI Institutional Fund, L.P. owns 100% of the participating beneficial interests of the Hatteras Core Alternatives Offshore Institutional Fund, LDC. Where these Notes to Financial Statements discuss the Feeder Funds' investment in the Master Fund, for Hatteras Core Alternatives TEI Fund, L.P. and Hatteras Core Alternatives TEI Institutional Fund, L.P., it means their investment in the Master Fund through the applicable Blocker Fund.




	The Feeder Funds are organized as Delaware limited partnerships, and are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, (the "1940 Act") as closed-end, non-diversified, management investment companies. The primary investment objective of the Feeder Funds is to provide capital appreciation consistent with the return characteristic of the alternative investment portfolios of larger endowments. The Feeder Funds' secondary objective is to provide capital appreciation with less volatility than that of the equity markets. To achieve their objectives, the Feeder Funds provide their investors with access to a broad range of investment strategies, asset categories and trading advisers ("Advisers") and by providing overall asset allocation services typically available on a collective basis to larger institutions, through an investment of substantially all of their assets into the Master Fund, which is registered under the 1940 Act. The Feeder Funds are co-managed by Hatteras Investment Partners, LLC ("HIP"), a Delaware limited liability company registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the "Advisers Act"), and Morgan Creek Capital Management, LLC ("MCCM," together with HIP, the "Investment Managers"), a North Carolina limited liability company registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. Investors who acquire units of limited partnership interest in the Feeder Funds ("Units") are the limited partners (each, a "Limited Partner" and together, the "Limited Partners") of the Feeder Funds.




	The financial statements of the Master Fund, including the schedule of investments, are included elsewhere in this report and should be read with the Feeder Funds' financial statements. The percentages of the Master Fund's beneficial limited partnership interests owned by the Feeder Funds at September 30, 2013 were:









	Hatteras Core Alternatives Fund, L.P.




	Â 


	Â 




	15.64






	%




	Â 






	Hatteras Core Alternatives TEI Fund, L.P.




	Â 


	Â 




	20.87






	%

	Hatteras Core Alternatives TEI Institutional Fund, L.P.




	Â 


	Â 




	45.05






	%




	Â 






	Hatteras Investment Management, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, serves as the General Partner of each of the Feeder Funds and the Master Fund (the "General Partner"). The General Partner is an affiliate of HIP. The General Partner has appointed a Board of Directors for each Feeder Fund (collectively the "Boards") and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, has irrevocably delegated to the Boards its rights and powers to monitor and oversee the business affairs of the Feeder Funds, including the complete and exclusive authority to oversee and establish policies regarding the management, conduct and operation of the Feeder Funds' business.





	2.Â Â SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES





	These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") and are expressed in United States dollars. The following is a summary of significant accounting and reporting policies used in preparing the financial statements.





	a.Â Â Investment Valuation





	The Feeder Funds do not make direct investments in securities or financial instruments, and invest substantially all of their assets in the Master Fund. The Feeder Funds record their investment in the Master Fund at fair value. Because the full amount of investment cannot be redeemed at least quarterly, each Feeder Fund's investment in the Master Fund would be considered level 3 under Accounting Standards Codification 820 Â Fair Value, as described in the notes to the Master Fund's financial statements included elsewhere in this report.

	As of and for the six months ended September 30, 2013 (Unaudited) (continued)








	2.Â Â SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



	(CONTINUED)





	a.Â Â Investment Valuation (continued)







	of securities held by the Master Fund, including the Master Fund's disclosure of investments under the three-tier hierarchy, is also discussed in the notes to the Master Fund's financial statements.





	b.Â Â Allocations from the Master Fund





	The Feeder Funds record their allocated portion of income, expense, realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation and depreciation from the Master Fund.





	c.Â Â Feeder Fund Level Income and Expenses





	Interest income on any cash or cash equivalents held by the Feeder Funds will be recognized on an accrual basis. Expenses that are specifically attributed to the Feeder Funds are charged to each Feeder Fund. Because the Feeder Funds bear their proportionate share of the management fee of the Master Fund, the Feeder Funds pay no direct management fee to the Investment Managers. The Feeder Funds' specific expenses are recorded on an accrual basis.





	d.Â Â Tax Basis Reporting





	Because the Master Fund invests primarily in investment funds that are treated as partnerships for U.S. Federal tax purposes, the tax character of each of the Feeder Fund's allocated earnings is established dependent upon the tax filings of the investment vehicles operated by the Advisers ("Adviser Funds"). Accordingly, the tax basis of these allocated earnings and the related balances are not available as of the reporting date.





	e.Â Â Income Taxes





	For U.S. Federal income tax purposes, the Feeder Funds are treated as partnerships, and each Limited Partner in each respective Feeder Fund is treated as the owner of its proportionate share of the net assets, income, expenses, and the realized and unrealized gains (losses) of such Feeder Fund. Accordingly, no federal, state or local income taxes have been provided on profits of the Feeder Funds since the Limited Partners are individually liable for the taxes on their share of the Feeder Funds.




	The Feeder Funds file tax returns as prescribed by the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate. In the normal course of business, the Feeder Funds are subject to examination by federal, state, local and foreign jurisdictions, where applicable. For returns filed for the years ended December 31, 2010 through December 31, 2012, the Feeder Funds remain subject to examination by the major tax jurisdictions under the statute of limitations.




	The Feeder Funds have reviewed any potential tax positions as of September 30, 2013 and have determined that they do not have a liability for any unrecognized tax benefits or expense. The Feeder Funds recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense in the Statement of Operations. During the six months ended September 30, 2013, the Feeder Funds did not incur any material interest or penalties.





	f.Â Â Cash





	Cash includes amounts held in interest bearing demand deposit accounts. Such cash, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Feeder Funds have not experienced any losses in such accounts and do not believe they are exposed to any significant credit risk on such accounts.





	g.Â Â Use of Estimates





	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of increases and decreases in Limited Partners' capital from operations during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.





	h.Â Â Consolidated Financial Statements





	The asset, liability, and equity accounts of the Hatteras Core Alternatives TEI Fund, L.P. and the Hatteras Core Alternatives TEI Institutional Fund, L.P. are consolidated with their respective Blocker Funds as presented in the Statements of Assets, Liabilities, and Partners' Capital, Statements of Operations, Statements of Changes in Partners' Capital, and Statements of Cash Flows. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS






	As of and for the six months ended September 30, 2013 (Unaudited) (continued)








	3.Â Â ALLOCATION OF LIMITED PARTNERS' CAPITAL







	Net profits or net losses of the Feeder Funds for each allocation period ("Allocation Period") will be allocated among and credited to or debited against the capital accounts of the Limited Partners. Net profits or net losses will be measured as the net change in the value of the Limited Partners' capital of the Feeder Funds, including any net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation of investments and realized income and gains or losses and expenses during an Allocation Period, adjusted to exclude any items to be allocated among the capital accounts of the Limited Partners in accordance with the Limited Partners' respective investment percentages.




	Allocation Periods generally begin on the first calendar day of each month and end at the close of business on the last day of each month.




	The Feeder Funds maintain a separate capital account ("Capital Account") on their books for each Limited Partner. Each Limited Partner's Capital Account will have an opening balance equal to the Limited Partner's initial purchase of the Feeder Fund (i.e., the amount of the investment less any applicable sales load of up to 2 percent of the purchased amount), and thereafter, will be (i) increased by the amount of any additional purchases by such Limited Partner; (ii) decreased for any payments upon repurchase or sale of such Limited Partner's interest or any distributions in respect of such Limited Partner; and (iii) increased or decreased as of the close of each Allocation Period by such Limited Partner's allocable share of the net profits or net losses of the Feeder Fund.

	4.Â Â RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER





	In consideration for fund services, Hatteras Core Alternatives Fund, L.P., Hatteras Core Alternatives TEI Fund, L.P., Hatteras Core Alternatives Institutional Fund, L.P. and Hatteras Core Alternatives TEI Institutional Fund, L.P. will pay HIP (in such capacity, the "Servicing Agent") a fund servicing fee at the annual rate of 0.85%, 0.85%, 0.10% and 0.10%, respectively, of the month-end partner's capital of the applicable Feeder Fund. The respective Feeder Fund servicing fees payable to the Servicing Agent will be borne by all Limited Partners of the respective Feeder Fund on a pro-rata basis before giving effect to any repurchase of interests in the Master Fund effective as of that date, and will decrease the net profits or increase the net losses of the Master Fund that are credited to its interest holders, including each Feeder Fund.




	The Servicing Agent may waive (to all investors on a pro-rata basis) or pay to third parties all or a portion of any such fees in its sole discretion. The Servicing Agent did not waive any of the servicing fees for the six months ended September 30, 2013.




	The performance allocation is calculated at the Master Fund level, and allocated to the Feeder Funds based on each Feeder Fund's ownership interest in the Master Fund. The General Partner is allocated a performance allocation payable annually equal to 10% of the amount by which net new profits of the limited partner interests of the Master Fund exceed the non-cumulative "hurdle amount", which is calculated as of the last day of the preceding calendar year of the Master Fund at a rate equal to the yield-to-maturity of the 90 day U.S. Treasury Bill as reported by the Wall Street Journal for the last business day of the preceding calendar year (the "Performance Allocation"). The Performance Allocation is made on a "peak to peak," or "high watermark" basis, which means that the Performance Allocation is made only with respect to new net profits. If the Master Fund has a net loss in any period followed by a net profit, no Performance Allocation will be made with respect to such subsequent appreciation until such net loss has been recovered. MCCM is a non-voting member ("Member") of HIP. HIP, MCCM and the General Partner have entered into a membership agreement (the "Member Agreement"). Pursuant to the Member Agreement, the General Partner makes distributions to MCCM equal to a percentage of the Performance Allocation the General Partner receives from the Master Fund. For the six months ended September 30, 2013, the General Partner of the Master Fund accrued a Performance Allocation which was allocated to the Hatteras Core Alternatives TEI Institutional Fund, L.P. in the amount of $1,123,385, which is disclosed in the Statement of Operations.




	Hatteras Capital Distributors LLC ("HCD"), an affiliate of HIP, serves as the Feeder Funds' distributor. HCD receives a distribution fee from HIP equal to 0.10% on an annualized basis of the net assets of the Master Fund as of the last day of the month (before giving effect to any repurchase of interests in the Master Fund).




	UMB Bank, N.A. serves as custodian of the Feeder Funds' cash balances and provides custodial services for the Feeder Funds. J.D. Clark & Company, a division of UMB Fund Services, Inc., serves as administrator and accounting agent to the Feeder Funds and provides certain

	accounting, record keeping and investor related services. The Feeder Funds pay a fee to the custodian and administrator based upon average Limited Partners' capital, subject to certain minimums.




	At September 30, 2013, Limited Partners who are affiliated with HIP, MCCM or the General Partner owned $555,282 (0.32% of Partners' Capital) of Hatteras Core Alternatives Fund, L.P., $1,849,111 (1.01% of Partners' Capital) of Hatteras Core Alternatives Institutional Fund, L.P., and $507,049 (0.10% of Partners' Capital) of Hatteras Core Alternatives TEI Institutional Fund, L.P.





	5.Â Â RISK FACTORS





	An investment in the Feeder Funds involves significant risks that should be carefully considered prior to investment and should only be considered by persons financially able to maintain their investment and who can afford a loss of a substantial part or all of such investment. The Master Fund intends to invest substantially all of its available capital in securities of private investment companies. These investments will generally be restricted securities that are subject to substantial holding periods or are not traded in public markets at all, so that the Master Fund may not be able to resell some of its Adviser Fund holdings for extended periods, which may be several years. Limited Partners should refer to the Master Fund's financial statements included in this report along with the applicable Feeder Fund's prospectus, as supplemented and corresponding statement of additional information for a more complete list of risk factors. No guarantee or representation is made that the Feeder Funds' investment objective will be met.





	6.Â Â REPURCHASE OF LIMITED PARTNERS' UNITS





	The Board may, from time to time and in its sole discretion, cause the Feeder Funds to repurchase Units from Limited Partners pursuant to written tenders by Limited Partners at such times and on such terms and conditions as established by the Board. In determining whether the Feeder Funds should offer to repurchase interests, the Board will consider, among other things, the recommendation of the Investment Managers. The Feeder Funds generally expect to offer to repurchase Units from Limited Partners on a quarterly basis as of March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year. In no event will more than 20% of the Units of a Feeder Fund be repurchased per quarter. The Feeder Funds do not intend to distribute to the Limited Partners any of the Feeder Funds' income, but generally expect to reinvest substantially all income and gains allocable to the Limited Partners. A Limited Partner may, therefore, be allocated taxable income and gains and not receive any cash distribution. Units repurchased prior to the Limited Partner's one year anniversary of its initial investment may be subject to a maximum 2% repurchase fee.





	7.Â Â INDEMNIFICATION





	In the normal course of business, the Feeder Funds enter into contracts that provide general indemnifications. The Feeder Funds' maximum exposure under these agreements is dependent on future claims that may be made against the Feeder Funds, and therefore cannot be established; however, based on experience, the risk of loss from such claims is considered remote.





	8.Â Â FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS





	The financial highlights are intended to help an investor understand the Feeder Funds' financial performance. The total returns in the table represent the rate that a Limited Partner would be expected to have earned or lost on an investment in each Feeder Fund.




	The ratios and total return amounts are calculated based on each Limited Partner group taken as a whole. The General Partner's interest is excluded from the calculations. An individual Limited Partner's ratios or returns may vary from the table below based on the timing of purchases and sales and performance allocation.




	The ratios are calculated by dividing total dollars of income or expenses as applicable by the average of total monthly Limited Partners' capital. The ratios include the Feeder Funds' proportionate share of the Master Fund's income and expenses.




	Total return amounts are calculated based on the change in unit value during each accounting period.

	The portfolio turnover rate is calculated based on the Master Fund's investment activity, as turnover occurs at the Master Fund level and the Feeder Funds are typically invested 100% in the Master Fund.

	On October 1, 2013, RCS Capital Corporation (the "Company") and Scotland Acquisition, LLC, a newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary of RCS Advisory Services, LLC, which is an operating subsidiary of the Company, entered into an asset purchase agreement with certain principals of the HIP and the General Partner (collectively the "Sellers") and David Perkins, as the Sellers' representative. The purchase will result in a change in control of HIP and, therefore, constitute an "assignment" within the meaning of the 1940 Act of i) the existing investment co-management agreement between HIP and The Master Fund, and ii) the existing investment co-management agreement among HIP, MCCM and the Master Fund. The purchase is expected to be consummated in the first quarter of 2014.

	HATTERAS MASTER FUND, L.P.




	(a Delaware Limited Partnership)







	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS






	As of and for the six months ended September 30, 2013 (Unaudited)








	1.Â Â ORGANIZATION





	Hatteras Master Fund, L.P. (the "Master Fund") was organized as a limited partnership under the laws of the State of Delaware on October 29, 2004 and commenced operations on January 1, 2005. The Master Fund is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), as a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company. The Master Fund is co-managed by Hatteras Investment Partners, LLC ("HIP"), a Delaware limited liability company registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the "Advisers Act"), and Morgan Creek Capital Management, LLC ("MCCM", together with HIP, the "Investment Managers"), a North Carolina limited liability company registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. The primary objective of the Master Fund is to provide capital appreciation consistent with the return characteristic of the alternative investment portfolios of larger endowments. The Master Fund's secondary objective is to provide capital appreciation with less volatility than that of the equity markets. To achieve its objectives, the Master Fund provides its limited partners (each, a "Limited Partner" and together, the "Limited Partners") with access to a broad range of investment strategies, asset categories, and trading Advisers ("Advisers") and by providing overall asset allocation services typically available on a collective basis to larger institutions. The Master Fund invests with each Adviser either by becoming a participant in an investment vehicle operated by the Adviser (an "Adviser Fund") which includes exchange traded funds ("ETFs"), hedge funds, and investment funds or by placing assets in an account directly managed by the Adviser.




	Hatteras Investment Management LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, serves as the General Partner of the Master Fund (the "General Partner"). The General Partner is an affiliate of HIP. The General Partner has appointed a Board of Directors (the "Board") and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, has irrevocably delegated to the Board its rights and powers to monitor and oversee the business affairs of the Master Fund, including the complete and exclusive authority to oversee and establish policies regarding the management, conduct and operation of the Master Fund's business.





	2.Â Â SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES





	The following is a summary of significant accounting and reporting policies used in preparing the financial statements.





	a.Â Â Basis of Accounting





	The Master Fund's accounting and reporting policies conform with accounting principles generally accepted within the United States of America ("GAAP").





	b.Â Â Cash





	Cash includes short-term interest bearing deposit accounts. At times, such deposits may be in excess of federally insured limits. The Master Fund has not experienced any losses in such accounts and does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk on such accounts.





	c.Â Â Valuation of Investments





	The Master Fund's valuation procedures have been approved by the Master Fund's Board. The valuation procedures are implemented by the Master Fund's Investment Managers and the third party administrator, which report to the Board. For third-party information, the Master Fund's administrator monitors and reviews the methodologies of the various pricing services employed by the Fund.




	Investments held by the Master Fund include:




	â¢Â Â 



	Investments in Adviser Funds



	Â The Master Fund will value interests in the Adviser Funds at fair value, using the net asset value ("NAV") as a practical expedient, as provided by the investment managers of such Adviser Funds. These Adviser Funds value their underlying investments in accordance with policies established by such Advisor Funds, which ordinarily will be the value determined by their respective investment managers, in accordance with the Master Fund's valuation procedures. Investments in Adviser Funds are subject to the terms of the Adviser Funds' offering documents. Valuations of the Adviser Funds may be subject to estimates and are net of management and performance incentive fees or allocations payable to the Adviser Funds' investment managers as required by the Adviser Funds' offering documents. If the Investment Managers determine that the most recent value reported by any Adviser Fund does not represent fair value or if any Adviser Fund fails to report a value to the Master Fund, a fair value determination is made under the Master Fund's valuation procedures under the general supervision of the Board. Because of the inherent uncertainty in valuation, the estimated values may differ from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed, and the differences could be material.




	Â Â The interests of some Adviser Funds, primarily investments in private equity funds, may be valued less frequently than the calculation of the Master Fund's net asset value. Therefore, the reported performance of the Adviser Fund may lag the reporting period of the Master Fund. The Investment Managers have established procedures for reviewing the effect on the Master Fund's net asset value due to this lag in reported performance of the Adviser Funds.

	HATTERAS MASTER FUND, L.P.




	(a Delaware Limited Partnership)







	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS






	As of and for the six months ended September 30, 2013 (Unaudited) (continued)








	2.Â Â SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



	(CONTINUED)





	c.Â Â Valuation of Investments (continued)







	â¢Â Â 



	Investments in Exchange Traded Funds and Mutual Funds



	Â Securities traded on one or more of the U.S. national securities exchanges or the OTC Bulletin Board will be valued at their last sales price. Securities traded on NASDAQ will be valued at the NASDAQ Official Closing Price ("NOCP"), at the close of trading on the exchanges or markets where such securities are traded for the business day as of which such value is being determined.




	â¢Â Â 



	Investments in Private Companies



	Â Investments for which observable market prices in active markets do not exist are reported at fair value, as determined in good faith by the Adviser. Fair value is based on the best information available and is determined by reference to information including, but not limited to, the following: projected sales, net earnings, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), balance sheets, public or private transactions, valuations for publicly traded comparable companies, recent round of financing in the company's stock, and/or other measures, and consideration of any other pertinent information including the types of securities held and restrictions on disposition. The amount determined to be fair value may incorporate the Adviser's own assumptions (including appropriate risk adjustments for nonperformance and lack of marketability). The methods used to estimate the fair value of private companies include: (1) the market approach (whereby fair value is derived by reference to observable valuation measures for comparable companies or assets Â e.g., multiplying a key performance metric of the investee company or asset, such as projected revenue or EBITDA, by a relevant valuation multiple observed in the range of comparable companies or transactions Â adjusted by the Adviser for differences between the investment and the referenced comparables and in some instances by reference to option pricing models or other similar methods), (2) the income approach (e.g., the discounted cash flow method), and (3) cost for a period of time after an acquisition (where such amount is determined by the Adviser to be the best indicator of fair value). These valuation methodologies involve a significant degree of judgment. Due to the absence of readily determinable fair values and the inherent uncertainty of valuations, the estimated fair values for private companies may differ significantly from values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed, and the differences could be material.




	â¢Â Â 



	Investments in Options



	Â Options contracts give the Master Fund the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying instrument for a specified price upon exercise at any time during the option period. For the six months ended September 30, 2013, the Master Fund was granted options from one of the Master Fund's Private Companies. Options are valued by the Investment Managers using an option pricing model. At September 30, 2013, the fair value and change in unrealized appreciation of options held by the Master Fund was $X.




	The Master Fund classifies its assets and liabilities that are reported at fair value into three levels based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Estimated values may differ from the values that would have been used if a ready market existed or if the investments were liquidated at the valuation date.




	The three-tier hierarchy distinguishes between (1) inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs) and (2) inputs that reflect the reporting entity's own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs) and to establish classification of fair value measurements for disclosure purposes. Various inputs are used in determining the value of the Master Fund's investments. The inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below:




	â¢Â Â Level 1 Â quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.




	â¢Â Â Level 2 Â other significant observable inputs or investments that can be fully redeemed at the net asset value in the "near term" (including quoted prices for similar investments, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk, ability to redeem in the near term, generally within the next calendar quarter, from Adviser Funds, etc.).




	â¢Â Â Level 3 Â significant unobservable inputs (including the Master Fund's own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments) or investments that cannot be fully redeemed at the net asset value in the "near term", these are investments that generally have one or more of the following characteristics: gated redemptions, suspended redemptions, or have lock-up periods greater than 90 days.

	Â Â Transfers are represented by their balance as of April 1, 2013.




	Transfers into and out of all Levels are represented by their balances as of the beginning of the reporting period. Transfers into Level 3 usually result from Adviser Funds imposing gates or suspending redemptions; transfers out of Level 3 generally occur when lock-up periods on investments in Adviser Funds are lifted. There were no transfers among Levels 1, 2 or 3 except for a transfer out of Level 3 into Level 2 that resulted from a lock-up period on an investment in an Adviser Fund being lifted, as set forth in the table above.




	The net realized gain (loss) and change in unrealized appreciation/(depreciation) in the table above are reflected in the accompanying Statement of Operations. The change in unrealized appreciation/(depreciation) from Level 3 investments held at September 30, 2013 is $20,426,890.




	Adviser Funds categorized as Level 3 assets, with a fair value totaling $, have imposed gates or suspended redemptions. Gates were imposed or redemptions were suspended for these Adviser Funds during a period ranging from October 2008 to September 2013. It is generally not known when these restrictions will be lifted.

	No adjustments were made to the NAV provided by the investment manager or administrator of the Adviser Funds. Adjustments to the NAV provided by the investment manager or administrator of the Adviser Funds would be considered if the practical expedient NAV was not as of the Master Fund's measurement date; it was probable that the Adviser Fund would be sold at a value materially different than the reported expedient NAV; or it was determined in accordance with the Master Fund's valuation procedures that the Adviser Fund is not being reported at fair value.




	The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Master Fund's Private Investment shares are based on the portfolio company's most recent round of financing and the financial results of privately held entities. If the financial condition of these companies was to deteriorate, or if market comparables were to fall, the value of the stock in these private companies held by the Master Fund would be lower.

In addition, most Adviser Funds have the flexibility, as provided for in their constituent documents, to modify and waive such terms.




	Â Â The Master Fund's investments reflect their estimated fair value, which for marketable securities would generally be the last sales price on the primary exchange for such security and for Adviser Funds, would generally be the net asset value as provided by the Adviser Fund or its administrator. For each of the categories below, the fair value of the Adviser Funds has been estimated using the net asset value of the Adviser Funds.

	2.Â Â SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



	(CONTINUED)





	c.Â Â Valuation of Investments (continued)








	a

	Â Â This category includes Adviser Funds that predominantly invest in all global markets, including the U.S. domestic markets, and predominantly invest in equity securities. While the Opportunistic Equity investment strategy consists of Adviser Funds that trade predominantly in equity securities, certain of the Advisers chosen may additionally invest all or a portion of the Advisers Fund in debt or other instruments.





	b

	Â Â This category includes Adviser Funds that invest primarily in high yield debt, distressed securities, structured credit, and opportunistic credit (including, among other things, in emerging markets).





	c

	Â Â This category is defined as having a relatively low or negative correlation to the equity markets. In addition, certain strategies within the Absolute Return investment strategy may have less volatility through the use of arbitrage based strategies and hedging tools (e.g., "market" puts and calls, etc.). The Absolute Return investment strategy includes Adviser Funds that invest using Event Driven Arbitrage, Convertible Arbitrage, Merger Arbitrage, Fixed Income Arbitrage, Volatility Arbitrage and Statistical Arbitrage.





	d

	Â Â This category includes Adviser Funds who engage in directional trading strategies. Some of the Tactical Trading strategies incorporate equity assets as well as currencies, commodities and debt instruments. Commodity Trading Advisors (CTAs) are included in the Tactical Trading investment strategy. Historically, the Tactical Trading investment strategy has a relatively low correlation to the equity markets. Global Macro/Managed Futures strategies are generally categorized as either discretionary or systematic in nature and may assume aggressive investment postures with respect to position concentrations, use of leverage, portfolio turnover, and the various investment instruments used.





	e

	Â Â This category invests in three sub-strategies (Private Equity, Private Real Estate and Private Energy and Natural Resources). Private Equity investing seeks to generate capital appreciation through investments in private companies in need of capital. Private Equity seeks to profit from, among other things, the inefficiencies inherent in these markets though valuation and due diligence analysis of available business opportunities. Private Real Estate strategy consists generally of investing in Adviser Funds that are private partnerships that make direct investments in (i) existing or newly constructed income-producing properties, including office, industrial, retail, and multi-family residential properties, (ii) raw land, which may be held for development or for the purpose of appreciation, and/or (iii) timber (whether directly or through a REIT or other Adviser Fund). The Private Energy and Natural Resources strategy consists generally of investing in Adviser Funds that are private partnerships that make direct investments in private or (sometimes) publicly traded energy companies.





	d.Â Â Investment Income





	Interest income is recorded when earned. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date, except that certain dividends from private equity investments are recorded as soon as the information is available to the Master Fund. Investments in short-term investments, mutual funds, private companies and exchange traded funds are recorded on a trade date basis. Investments in Adviser Funds are recorded on a subscription effective date basis, which is generally the first day of the calendar month in which the investment is effective. Realized gains and losses on Adviser Fund and security redemptions are determined on identified cost basis. Return of capital or security distributions received from Adviser Funds and securities are accounted for as a reduction to cost.





	e.Â Â Foreign Currency





	Investment securities and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollar amounts at the date of valuation. Purchases and sales of investment securities and income and expense items denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollar amounts on the respective dates of such transactions. The company does not isolate that portion of the results of operations resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates on investments from the fluctuations arising from changes in market prices of securities held. Such fluctuations are included with the net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments. Reported net realized foreign exchange gains or losses arise from sales of foreign currencies, currency gains or losses realized between the trade and settlement dates on securities transactions, and the difference between the amounts of dividends, interest, and foreign withholding taxes recorded on the company's books and the U.S. dollar equivalent of the amounts actually received or paid. Net unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses arise from changes in the fair values of assets and liabilities, other than investments in securities at fiscal period end, resulting from changes in exchange rates.





	f.Â Â Master Fund Expenses





	The Master Fund will bear all expenses incurred, on an accrual basis, in the business of the Master Fund, including, but not limited to, the following: all costs and expenses related to portfolio transactions and positions for the Master Fund's account; legal fees; accounting, auditing, and tax preparation fees; custodial fees; fees for data and software providers; costs of insurance; registration expenses; directors' fees; interest expenses and commitment fees on credit facilities; and expenses of meetings of the Board.





	g.Â Â Income Taxes





	The Master Fund is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and therefore is not subject to U.S. federal income tax. For income tax purposes, the individual partners will be taxed upon their distributive share of each item of the Master Fund's profit and loss.




	The Master Fund files tax returns as prescribed by the tax laws of the jurisdiction in which it operates. In the normal course of business, the Master Fund is subject to examination by federal, state, local and foreign jurisdictions, where applicable. For the years ended December 31, 2010 through December 31, 2012 the Master Fund is open to examination by major tax jurisdictions under the statute of limitations.




	The Master Fund has reviewed any potential tax positions as of September 30, 2013 and has determined that it does not have a liability for any unrecognized tax benefits or expense. The Master Fund recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits

	2.Â Â SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



	(CONTINUED)





	g.Â Â Income Taxes (continued)







	as income tax expense in the Statement of Operations. During the period, the Master Fund did not incur any material interest or penalties. Due to the timing of tax information received from the Adviser Funds, tax basis reporting is not available as of the balance sheet date.





	h.Â Â Use of Estimates





	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Master Fund to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of increases and decreases in Partner's Capital from operations during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.





	i.Â Â Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities





	In January 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Updated ("ASU") No. 2013-01, "



	Clarifying the Scope of Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities.



	" This update gives additional clarification to the FASB ASU No. 2011-11, "



	Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities.



	" The amendments in this ASU require an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position. The guidance requires retrospective application for all comparative periods presented. Management has evaluated the impact on the financial statement disclosures and determined that there is no effect.





	j.Â Â Recent Accounting Pronouncements





	In June 2013, FASB issued ASU No. 2013-08,



	"Financial Services Â Investment Companies (Topic 946): Amendments to the Scope, Measurements and Disclosure Requirements"



	("ASU 2013-08"). ASU 2013-08 creates a two-tiered approach to assess whether an entity is an investment company. The guidance will also require an investment company to measure noncontrolling ownership interests in other investment companies at fair value and will require additional disclosures relating to investment company status, any changes thereto and information about financial support provided or contractually required to be provided to any of the investment company's investees. The guidance is effective for financial statements with fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2013 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Management is evaluating the impact of this guidance on the Master Fund's financial statement disclosures.





	3.Â Â ALLOCATION OF PARTNERS' CAPITAL





	Net profits or net losses of the Master Fund for each Allocation Period (as defined below) will be allocated among and credited to or debited against the capital accounts of the Limited Partners. Allocation Periods begin on the day after the last day of the preceding Allocation Period and end at the close of business on (1) the last day of each month; (2) the last day of each taxable year; (3) the day preceding each day on which interests are purchased; (4) the day on which interests are repurchased; (5) the day preceding the day on which a substituted Limited Partner is admitted to the Master Fund; or (6) the day on which any amount is credited to or debited from the capital account of any Limited Partner other than an amount to be credited to or debited from the capital accounts of all Limited Partners in accordance with their respective investment percentages.





	4.Â Â REPURCHASE OF LIMITED PARTNERS' INTERESTS





	The Board may, from time to time and in its sole discretion, cause the Master Fund to repurchase interests from Limited Partners pursuant to written tenders by Limited Partners at such times and on such terms and conditions as established by the Board. In determining whether the Master Fund should offer to repurchase interests, the Board will consider, among other things, the recommendation of the Investment Managers. The Investment Managers generally recommend to the Board that the Master Fund offer to repurchase interests from Limited Partners on a quarterly basis as of the valuation date at the end of each calendar quarter. The Master Fund will not offer repurchases of interests of more than 20% its net asset value in any quarter. The Master Fund does not intend to distribute to the Limited Partners any of the Master Fund's income, but generally expects to reinvest substantially all income and gains allocable to the Limited Partners.





	5.Â Â MANAGEMENT FEES, PERFORMANCE ALLOCATION, AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS





	Effective March 28, 2013, upon the approval of the Limited Partners, MCCM became the investment co-manager to the Master Fund along with HIP, the existing investment manager to the Master Fund. The Investment Managers are responsible for providing day-to-day investment management services to the Master Fund, subject to the ultimate supervision of and any policies established by the Board, pursuant to the terms of the investment co-management agreement among the Master Fund, HIP and MCCM (the "MCCM Agreement") and the investment co-management agreement between the Master Fund and HIP (the "HIP Agreement"). Under the MCCM Agreement and HIP Agreement (together, the "Investment Management Agreements"), the Investment Managers are responsible for developing, implementing and supervising the Master Fund's investment program. In consideration for the advisory and other services provided by

	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS






	As of and for the six months ended September 30, 2013 (Unaudited) (continued)








	5.Â Â MANAGEMENT FEES, PERFORMANCE ALLOCATION, AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS



	(CONTINUED)






	HIP, the Master Fund pays HIP a management fee (the "Management Fee") equal to 1.00% on an annualized basis of the aggregate value of its partners' capital determined as of the last day of the month (before giving effect to any repurchase of interests in the Master Fund). The Master Fund does not pay MCCM an investment management fee directly. Under the MCCM Agreement, MCCM is entitled to distributions from HIP under the Member Agreement (defined below). MCCM is a non-voting member ("Member") of HIP. HIP, MCCM and the General Partner have entered into a membership agreement (the "Member Agreement"), pursuant to which HIP makes distributions to MCCM equal to a percentage of the Management Fee HIP receives from the Master Fund.




	The General Partner is allocated a performance allocation payable annually equal to 10% of the amount by which net new profits of the limited partner interests of the Master Fund exceed the non-cumulative "hurdle amount," which is calculated as of the last day of the preceding calendar year of the Master Fund at a rate equal to the yield-to-maturity of the 90-day U.S. Treasury Bill as reported by the Wall Street Journal for the last business day of the last calendar year ("the Performance Allocation"). The Performance Allocation is made on a "peak to peak", or "high watermark" basis, which means that no Performance Allocation will be made with respect to such subsequent appreciation until such net loss has been recovered. Pursuant to the Member Agreement, the General Partner makes distributions to MCCM equal to a percentage of the Performance Allocation the General Partner receives from the Master Fund. For the six months ended September 30, 2013, the General Partner accrued a Performance Allocation in the amount of $1,123,385.




	Hatteras Capital Distributors LLC ("HCD"), an affiliate of HIP, serves as the Master Fund's private placement agent. HCD receives a distribution fee from HIP equal to 0.10% on an annualized basis of the partner's capital of the Master Fund as of the last day of the month (before giving effect to any repurchase of interests in the Master Fund).




	Each member of the Board who is not an "interested person" of the Master Fund ("Independent Director"), as defined by the 1940 Act, receives an annual retainer of $30,000. All Board members are reimbursed by the Master Fund for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in performing their duties.





	6.Â Â ACCOUNTING, ADMINISTRATION, AND CUSTODIAL AGREEMENT





	In consideration for accounting, administrative, and recordkeeping services, the Master Fund pays J.D. Clark & Company, a division of UMB Fund Services, Inc. (the "Administrator") an administration fee based on the month-end partners' capital of the Master Fund. The Administrator also provides regulatory administrative services, transfer agency functions, and shareholder services at an additional cost. For the six months ended September 30, 2013, the total accounting and administration fees were $440,371.




	UMB Bank, N.A. serves as custodian of the Master Fund's assets and provides custodial services for the Master Fund, except for collateral held for the Master Fund's credit facility, as described below in Note 8.





	7.Â Â INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS





	Total purchases of Adviser Funds and securities for the six months ended September 30, 2013 amounted to $122,728,781. Total proceeds from redemptions of Adviser Funds for the six months ended September 30, 2013 amounted to $197,829,070. The cost of investments in Adviser Funds for U.S. federal income tax purposes is adjusted for items of taxable income allocated to the Master Fund from the Adviser Funds. The Master Fund relies upon actual and estimated tax information provided by the Adviser Funds as to the amounts of taxable income allocated to the Master Fund as of September 30, 2013.




	The Master Fund invests substantially all of its available capital in securities of private investment companies. These investments will generally be restricted securities that are subject to substantial holding periods or are not traded in public markets at all, so that the Master Fund may not be able to resell some of its securities holdings for extended periods.





	8.Â Â CREDIT FACILITY





	The Master Fund maintains a credit facility (the "Facility") with a maximum borrowing amount of $120,000,000 which is secured by certain interests in Adviser Funds. A fee of 80 basis points per annum is payable monthly in arrears on the unused portion of the facility, while the interest rate charged on borrowings is the 1-month London Interbank Offer Rate plus a spread of 190 basis points. Collateral for the new facility is held by U.S. Bank N.A. as custodian. Interest and fees incurred for the six months ended September 30, 2013 are disclosed in the accompanying Statement of Operations. At September 30, 2013, the Master Fund had $39,667 payable on the unused portion of the Facility and did not hold an interest payable balance on the borrowings. The average interest rate, the average daily balance, and the maximum balance outstanding for borrowings under the facility for the six months ended September 30, 2013 was 2.18%, $431,343, and $15,000,000, respectively.

	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS






	As of and for the six months ended September 30, 2013 (Unaudited) (continued)








	9.Â Â INDEMNIFICATION







	In the normal course of business, the Master Fund enters into contracts that provide general indemnifications. The Master Fund's maximum exposure under these agreements is dependent on future claims that may be made against the Master Fund, and therefore cannot be established; however, based on experience, the risk of loss from such claims is considered remote.





	10.Â Â COMMITMENTS





	As of September 30, 2013, the Master Fund had outstanding investment commitments to Adviser Funds totaling approximately $131,748,989. Five Adviser Funds in the Private Investment Strategy have commitments denominated in Euros, two Adviser Funds have commitments denominated in Pound Sterling, and one Adviser Fund has commitments denominated in Japanese Yen. At September 30, 2013, the unfunded commitments for these Adviser Funds totaled â¬3,249,470 EUR, Â£3,293,139 GBP and Â¥99,826,564 JPY, respectively. At September 30, 2013, the exchange rate used for the conversion was 1.3522 USD/EUR, 1.6185 USD/GBP and 98.2318 JPY/USD. The U.S. Dollar equivalent of these commitments is included in the Master Fund's total unfunded commitment amount.





	11.Â Â RISK FACTORS





	An investment in the Master Fund involves significant risks, including leverage risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and economic conditions risk, that should be carefully considered prior to investing and should only be considered by persons financially able to maintain their investment and who can afford a loss of a substantial part or all of such investment. The Master Fund generally does not employ leverage. However, certain Adviser Funds may employ leverage, either synthetically or through borrowed funds, which can enhance returns or increase losses on smaller changes in the value of an underlying investment. Adviser Funds that invest in fixed income securities may be subject to interest rate risk, where changes in interest rates affect the value of the underlying fixed income investment. The Master Fund intends to invest substantially all of its available capital in securities of private investment companies. These investments will generally be restricted securities that are subject to substantial holding periods or are not traded in public markets at all, so that the Master Fund may not be able to resell some of its securities holdings for extended periods, which may be several years. Investments in the Adviser Funds may be restricted from early redemptions or subject to fees for early redemptions as part of contractual obligations agreed to by the Investment Managers on behalf of the Master Fund. Adviser Funds may have initial lock-up periods, the ability to suspend redemptions, or employ the use of side pockets, all of which may affect the Master Fund's liquidity in the respective Adviser Fund.




	Adviser Funds generally require the Master Fund to provide advanced notice of its intent to redeem the Master Fund's total or partial interest and may delay or deny a redemption request depending on the Adviser Funds' governing agreements. Interests in the Master Fund provide limited liquidity since Limited Partners will not be able to redeem interests on a daily basis because the Master Fund is a closed-end fund. Therefore, investment in the Master Fund is suitable only for investors who can bear the risks associated with the limited liquidity of interests and should be viewed as a long-term investment. No guarantee or representation is made that the investment objective will be met.





	12.Â Â FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS





	The financial highlights are intended to help an investor understand the Master Fund's financial performance. The total returns in the table represent the rate that a typical Limited Partner would be expected to have earned or lost on an investment in the Master Fund.




	The ratios and total return amounts are calculated based on the Limited Partner group taken as a whole. An individual Limited Partner's results may vary from those shown below due to the timing of capital transactions and performance allocation.




	The ratios are calculated by dividing total dollars of net investment income or expenses, as applicable, by the average of total monthly Limited Partners' capital.

	SUBSEQUENT EVENTS





	Management has evaluated the events and transactions through the date the financial statements were issued and determined there were no other subsequent events that required adjustment to our disclosure in the financial statements except for the following:




	HIP recommended to the Board that a tender offer in an amount of up to approximately 5.00% of the partners' capital of the Master Fund be made for the quarter ending December 31, 2013 to those partners who elect to tender their interests prior to the expiration of the tender offer period. The Board approved such recommendation and partners in the Master Fund were notified of the tender offer's expiration date of October 31, 2013, and submitted tender requests totaling approximately $61,527,520.




	On October 1, 2013, RCS Capital Corporation (the "Company") and Scotland Acquisition, LLC, a newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary of RCS Advisory Services, LLC, which is an operating subsidiary of the Company, entered into an asset purchase agreement with certain principals of the HIP and the General Partner (collectively the "Sellers") and David Perkins, as the Sellers' representative. The purchase will result in a change in control of HIP and, therefore, constitute an "assignment" within the meaning of the 1940 Act of i) the existing HIP Agreement between HIP and the Master Fund, and ii) the existing MCCM Agreement among HIP, MCCM and the Master Fund. The purchase is expected to be consummated in the first quarter of 2014.
