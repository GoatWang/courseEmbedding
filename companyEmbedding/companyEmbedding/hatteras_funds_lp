Hatteras Funds Enhances Managed Futures Strategies Fund
May 2 16
Hatteras Funds announced that it has restructured its Managed Futures Strategies Fund (HMFIX) in order to provide greater transparency and reduce overall fund expenses for investors. Hatteras has cut fees by 20% bringing the total overall expense ratio to 1.99% for the I shares. The Hatteras Managed Futures Strategies Fund (HMFIX) is a multi-manager solution that offers Financial Advisors and their clients a portfolio diversification tool with the benefits of low correlation to traditional stocks and bonds. The Fund provides access to two experienced investment managers, ROW Asset Management (an experienced multi-strategy program) and Revolution Capital Management (a short to intermediate term Commodity Trading Advisor), each with a long track record and expertise in specialized managed futures strategies across markets, models and time frames. When combined, these managers provide the potential for enhanced risk-adjusted returns. Over the 1-year period, the Fund ranks in the top 10% of all Funds in the Morningstar Managed Futures category.
