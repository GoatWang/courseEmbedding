“Donuts!”


Reviewed 1 week ago




A quick place to pick up a Dunkin Donut and drink. The place is pretty tight on space and shoved in a corner of the Fremont. Pretty pricey for a donut compared to a grocery store but the only place to get one on the Fremont. Oh, well!

“Coffee and a Donut”


Reviewed 2 weeks ago




It serves its purpose if you are in mood or need for coffee. The hotel rooms don't have coffee makers so this is your closest best option. The donuts selection is pretty good. Prices might be slightly higher for convenience purposes but I'm not sure because I don't frequent DD at home.

See MoreSee LessPhotoView on Facebook·ShareDonut Bar 12 hours ago Repost from @sandiegopd Today we remember the life of fallen #SDPD Officer Jonathan “JD” De Guzman EOW: 07/28/2016Officer De Guzman was shot and killed as he and his partner conducted a subject stop near the intersection of Acacia Grove Way and 38th Street at approximately 11:00 pm.Officer De Guzman and his partner observed two men walking in the area, but the men split up when they observed the patrol car. Officer De Guzman's partner exited the patrol car and approached one of the males. As he asked the man if he lived in the neighborhood the subject suddenly pulled out a handgun and opened fire without saying anything.The subject shot Officer De Guzman's partner Wade Irwin once in the neck before shooting Officer De Guzman multiple times before he was even able to exit the police car. Officer Irwin was able to return fire and wounded the subject as he fled on foot. The man was found hiding in a nearby ravine a short time later and taken into custody. He was charged with murder, attempted murder, and being a felon in possession of a firearm.Officer De Guzman had served with the San Diego Police Department for 16 years. He was a member of the SWAT team and assigned to the Gang Suppression Unit.Please take a moment to honor him and the ultimate sacrifice he made protecting the community he so proudly served.

Brian hooked my coffee up LORT! Donuts on point also will definitely have to come back!










Love this place, i stop by every thursday for an iced coffee. Love all the flavors they have and the donuts are nice and moist. I will continue to return. Great customer service as well!










This place is awesome. Lots of really good donuts to select from and the owner is very friendly. The good and the bad thing about this place is that we leave real close & I would have to workout everyday.










Great variety still available at 11am on a weekday and reasonably priced!

Friendly, smiley, helpful service. 80s music. Coffees & espresso available. Monkey shall return.










Best doughnuts spot hands down ! I love this mom and pop place ! The girls are super sweet the doughnuts are always fresh ! Definitely the place to pick up and go specially while marketing ! The iced coffee is delicious also ! Crowd pleaser and definitely a place to try if your in the mood for a good doughnut










Fantastic donuts! This is the only donut spot that I consistently return to. 
The cake donuts are great, the glazed donuts are great, the cinnamon rolls are great. Everything is delicious. The donuts here are the perfect balance of not being too sugary. 
Service is always friendly, quick, and efficient. It can be quite busy in the mornings, so it's best to come early so you can have a great selection to choose from. The prices are also very fair as well.










I like to try different donut shops around town to bring donuts for the crew I work with on Sundays. This place was closed to work and home right off of Charleston across from UMC. What I loved most about them was the selection of different kinds of old-fashioned doughnuts. They had chocolate-covered Maple covered and regular glazed old-fashioned plus a variety of other ones. The donuts were fluffy and delicious my whole crew love them I will definitely be back.










No frills, small business. Great donuts! The have a wonderful variety... always down for the free donut with check in!










Amazing doughnuts so delicious thank you Fox 5 news Las Vegas for sharing real doughnuts story on Facebook.










Yesterday, I visited RealDonust because they just offered kind of discount for a check in. To behonest and to admit - I was in temptation to grab that offer. 
But after the first jussy bite, I started questioning myself why they need that when they are making such tasty and fresh donuts. They just outstand! A guy from the staff explained to me they are using mainly organic ingredients and ingredients from verified farms. Well, that explained that unforgettable taste. The service is on average level - not too fast or too clumsy. The employees are busy but they can always answer your questions. If any because a mouth full of tasty donuts, will not allow you to speak so much but to eat in silence and in pleasure.










My favorite dounuts in Vegas hands down I've tried all the others and chains but they blow them away never had a bad dounut here they were jus in the weekly as a good cheap eats but they said the service was spotty I always go at 5am when I get off work you can smell delcious goodness blocks away defintly a nice treat










If a doughnut's tastiness is directly proportional to its size (which I think there is a solid argument that it is), then these are frickin' scrumptious times 10. The glazed doughnut here is easily three times the size of your Krispy Kreme variety, but they also carry a heftier price tag. 
I only sampled the glazed, but every one of the little darlings in the case looked top notch. I was tempted by the pink frosting with sprinkles or the little buttermilk buns. There was also a ginormous doughnut the size of an old 45 record. 
The establishment is small and in addition to doughnuts carries Thrifty ice cream, coffee, iced coffee, and smoothies. The girl working there was blasting The Cure, and if she were the doughnut maker, Real Donuts would earn an extra star for being indie rock. However, she said she did not make the doughnuts. They are made fresh there, but not by her. Still, I like the soundtrack.
On Sundays you can get a dozen for $6, and during the weekdays if you buy 5 dozen you get 1 dozen free. I have no idea what you are going to do with 6 dozen doughnuts. Maybe you can freeze them or host one heck of an office party.










Real Donuts? They should have called it, "Real Awesome Donuts." 
I stopped in to try the 45 sized donut mentioned in the previous review. How disappointing to find that they don't manufacture these donuts until 7:30-8:00 am. Guess I was a few hours too early. So instead I opted for the whopping box of day old donuts for $4.50. I wouldn't normally buy a day old donut, let alone six pounds (no joke, this box weighed at least 6 lbs!!) of donuts but my cheap bastardness got the best of me. 
I proceeded back to the office where I cut several of them in half and enjoyed at least 5 variates. At this point in my life I would almost consider myself to be a connoisseur of the Apple Fritter. Although this was not the best fritter I've ever had, I would say that it ranks in my top 3. It had many more apples than your standard fritter and that is a plus in my book. The bear claws come in varying sizes which I liked, however, the filling was more of a spread than a pie filling...not too impressed here, thus the one star deduction. The other donuts I ate were very good, although It is rare that I come across a bad donut. 
Real Donuts is open 4am - 5pm (HECK YES!), so get on in and get your Donut On!










Real Donuts are the real deal. One of the best in the valley. The basic glaze donut is spectacular. Everything else I have tried has been quite good as well. They have mastered the art of not having dry donuts in the desert. With the apple fritters and the cake donuts the exterior has a nice light crunch with a slightly moist, yet fluffy interior. Staff behind the counter is always cool too. Why settle for grocery store nuts of the dough when you can indulge in these tasty fried delights?










This place is near my school so it's always a good option to swing in to get some breakfast. I usually go for the stuffed one- chocolate stuffed with bavarian cream. YUM! after eating one of those, I can die happy! :) (on a side note- they sell day old dozens for like $5, what a deal!)










Now this is a doughnut shop! So many to choose from that I could have ordered 100 of them. After a disappointing trip to Dunkin' Donuts the other day, got a box of mixed varieties (jelly filled, frosted with sprinkles, orange glazed, boston creme and more...) for $7.50. The person running the place was very friendly. Even though it's in downtown, I'd rather drive the 15 or so miles from Centennial Hills than the 2 minutes to Dunkin' "Donuts".










Popped in since we were in the area and I was in the mood for a snacky snack...By this time of the day, they already sold out of all their cream filled goodies, so I settled for a small apple fritter and a twist glazed donut. Both were pretty solid and tons better then your "chain" establishments. Most definitely be back if I'm in the area...ALOHA!!!

The last stop on my "Vegas Donut Hunt."
Very good donuts and wide selection at 4am (when they open). I tried the old fashioned, buttermilk, and chocolate raised and they were all great (I didn't care too much for the chocolate glaze, but the donut itself was good).
I can safely say, out of all the places I've tried this is one of the best, along with Donut Hut, Master Donuts and Friendly Donut Shop. Try either one of these places and you're guaranteed something good. (I'd recommend coming EXACTLY when they open though, if possible.)










Two words: giant donut.
Order one and you won't regret it. That's all I have to say.










This place rocks!! Great selection, great prices and the employee was playing some good music too :-) perfect way to start a Sunday










Best donuts in town & the Solares family and crew are awesome. Worth standing in line for!










I love, love , love donuts!! Just call me Homer! 
Cake donut with chocolate frosting is my favorite! As I walked into the store there is the best smell ever, that fresh baked donut smell! The place was very clean and the donuts were displayed nice. I had a chat with the guy behind the counter asking him questions for a catering company I do some work for. He answered every question I had about his donuts. Then the moment of truth, select a donut, well of course I went for my favorite. he bagged it and out to the car I went. This donut was so fresh and soft, the recipe for the cake portion was just the way i like it, made with vanilla, not lemon or spice, vanilla just the way it was intended to be. I am thinking this place gets my vote for the best donut in Vegas! If you in that area of town stop by!










My favorite donut shops in Las Vegas. Cant go wrong with Real Donuts. They have the best ice cream!










Best Doughnut Shop in town! Great Customer Service! The Maple Doughnut is BOMBLICIOUS! This place is where REAL DOUGHNUTS are made!










This place is fantastic. An amazing selection of donuts made fresh every morning by a family of great people. Tanya and Brian are always helpful and smiling and in the back dad is pouring alot of love onto these beauties. Don't Miss- blueberry cake donut, the chocolate butterfly and the delicious crumb donuts(both raised and cake!)
Why would anyone ever go to those faceless corporate spots when they're blown away by this little oasis??










I should have wrote this review 5 years ago when I discovered it. I LOVE this place. My hubby and I were looking for a place to stop on our way out of town, and so glad we stumbled upon this place. 
My favorite is the cinnamon crumb donuts--YUM!
The family that owns this is always so nice and helpful when we come in. It is hands down the best donut place in Las Vegas, and everyone I introduce this place to also falls in love. 
Great service, great prices, and the greatest donuts ever. :)










i don't know how to judge donuts.
they were good. 
didn't taste old.
there was a sweet old lady sitting there who hangs out there since "everyday."
added to the cute character to the place.
very happy with my donuts.










One of my guilty pleasures in life has always been donuts. I have been to many donut shops across the country. If available I will always get a chocolate old fashioned. Then I might also get a cinnamon roll, maple bar or something else that looks good. I have tried many donut shops across Las Vegas in search of a really great donut. The best I have found so far has been Real Donuts on Charleston Blvd. The donuts always seem to be fairly fresh and the taste of the frosting's are always good. One thing they make that I really enjoy is their Butterfly. Weather topped with regular icing or maple it is always good.










Took Nelson Q.'s advice and got a apple fritter. I was forced to get the full size because they were out of the half size. Om nom nom, nice pieces of apple in the dough. Not too much glaze like other places making it the perfect amount of sweetness. I also ordered a jelly filled, pretty good as well. The dough they use here is awesome because its the in between of the lightness of Krispy Kreme and the thick doughyness of standard donut shops. This might be my new favorite spot for dontus, too bad I live far but on the plus side I will start my intern at UMC next month. So they should be seeing me on a regular basis. Good for my taste buds, but bad for my waist line. Ekks!










There are a number of donut shops to choose from in town but if you want one worth buying, don't bother with any of the rest. Yes, you heard me...drive here from wherever in Clark County you are. I promise it will be worth it. Yes donuts are bad for you, but if you ARE going to eat them, why not eat the best?
The girl behind the counter was very friendly and happily explained prices and quality of the donuts. We picked up some day olds (which are a bargain, at 2 dozen for $5) and brought them to work. They were gone within 2 hours and no one ever suspected they were old.
My evaluation is based on the fresh donuts we tried. It was incredibly early in the morning and I was pleased to see that they were open and ready for business. I tried their large maple twist and had some of my girlfriends chocolate pecan roll and a bearclaw that we split. 
I was blown away by the juiciness of each bite and the consistency of the dough. That's not to mention the sheer novelty of their large specialty donuts-- the Texas and The Alaska. You'll never return to Winchell's, Dunkin, or Krispy Kreme after you've become privy to this place. I can't wait to return and try their monster donuts out.










Sitting at my desk, I overheard one co-worker trying to convince another to eat some of the donuts. Knowing that customers, vendors and co-workers drop off dozens of donuts from the huge chain, manufactured donut companies often, I was anxious for some sugar spiking in my blood.
Walking to their desks I was shaken to my core (which happened to be a ravenously angry and empty stomach) - when he was merely offering up mini donuts from the vending machine.
This simply would not do. Do you hear me? It. Would. Not. Do.
I explained my desire for fresh donuts, not that packaged trash. They asked if I wanted to make a donut run. I said yes! They started asking for me to go to one of the chain places, I said Nay! If I was making a donut run, I was getting Real Donuts. 
Of course, they started naming off a different chain every time I would say, "No, real Donuts." Finally, I had to explain that was the name of the place that was going to satisfy my sugar craving.
Finding their location, I walked in to a pretty busy donut shop. Good sign! 
When it got to my turn, the helpful girl behind the counter started grabbing everything I needed. When i got to the ham & cheese croissant part of the order, she gave me the option of hot or cold. Figure if we're going to go for it, go the whole 9 and went hot. 
Returning to work, I handed out everybody their treat and sat down at my desk to dive into mine.
The raised cake donut was about 2x the thickness of one of those "other" places' donuts. I took a bite and my taste buds nearly fainted at the flavor. It was an instant throw back to jr. high and getting donuts after school at a local bakery, only better! I finished the donut and tackled the holes I picked up. 
Bite sized doses of glazed sugary goodness were devoured in mere seconds.
This is definitely a place I will be returning to, as often as my pancreas can handle.










The love they put into their donuts shines through. I have had the best Apple Fritter ever here. They don't skimp on size or flavor. The Jelly Donuts are oozing with Jelly from the top of the donut. We get them for our office bi-weekly making my tastebuds happy but killing my diet. This is what donuts are meant to be. Keep up the great work!










i normally wouldn't waste my time reviewing a donut shop but real donut has the best donuts in vegas by a long, long way. well worth a drive across town.










The good folks in my department love their donuts. It is by law that all employees, at some point during their stay, *must* bring in donuts, and I guess it was my turn to bring in several boxes; although, I have yet to see that "law" in writing.
I haven't been to Real Donuts before, but the reviews on Yelp and its short distance from my office were what brought me there at 6:45 a.m. in the morning. I ordered three dozen donuts for $27.00 ($9.00 for a dozen). 
Everyone in my department seemed to enjoy the donuts. The boxes don't have a logo or any writing indicating where the donuts came from, but a co-worker was able to identify its origins:
Co-Worker: "Are these from Real Donuts?"
Me: *wtf look* "Yes, How did you know?"
Co-Worker: "Educated guess. Real Donuts are popular in these parts. I know how they taste."
I stole one before the hoards came. Not sure what it's called, but it was sweet and a little crunchy. Though it was good, it was too dense for my taste. I'll have to try the apple fritter next time, or one of those donuts that's almost the same size as a toilet seat. 
Real Donuts has proven to be a hit among my department and the upper management. I live to see another work day.










I am not a donut person. At all. I can go months and years without having one or even desiring one. Perhaps after years of only being exposed to Dunkin' Donut and Krispy Kreme many could understand why. The only donut place I have ever liked before was Voodoo Donuts in my hometown of Portland. I'm not sure what made me stop into Real Donuts but I am glad I did. Nice chewy donuts with just the right amount of sweetness. I would definitely stop in again.










Clean and simple, close to UMC. A friendly place to get good donuts. Other donut shops their donuts are super super sweet. You get tired after two bites. But this place " Perfect" love at first bite. I only got half a dozen because I was afraid that my family wouldn't be able to finish them all. I was surprised to come home to find them all gobbled up . To sum it up, this will be the place for me to get fresh donuts.










Delicious donuts for a reasonable price!
These are your standard cookie cutter donuts, but cammann we all know they're good! Bought a half dozen for $4.75 and a coffee. The guy at the counter was super friendly and energetic...good energy for this type of shop. For the last donut, we were trying to decide between the blueberry cake or the cinnamon crunch. I chose the cinnamon crunch and they guy threw in the blueberry cake donut, for what I thought was free, because he said we should try it because his friends like it. 
I signed the receipt for $6.18 (half dozen and coffee) and when I checked my credit account online later, saw that I was charged $7.xx. What the heck kind of trickery is this? I'm going to let it slide this time because your donuts were bomb and you were nice.










Best donuts ever. Delicious, fresh, good selection. Very friendly welcoming staff. A dozen donuts and 2 milks was just $10.50. I will be back for sure.










I love going here on Saturday morning... great donuts and super friendly staff!










Oh, dear lord, the maple bars! A coworker used to bring a dozen assorted from Real Donuts to the office every Thursday morning. Fresh, soft, delicious. Best maple bar to ever cross my lips, though I have tried other flavors that were excellent too. I've ventured over there later in the day and the donuts aren't quite as magical, but are still heaven in a box (or bag).










This is a family owned & operated donut shop....the dad makes all of the donuts which are simply delish. They have a great variety and have always been fresh on every visit. 
Brian the son.... Works the counter and has a fun personality always clowning around, (you can really tell he loves his customers) and just having fun. 
Can't go wrong here!










After reading the reviews on YELP! I decided to try this little place out. I'm new to LV and always looking for places to replace my home town loves. 
I am 100% happy I chose this bakery. It was clean, the guy at the counter, Brian, was super friendly and the prices were terrific! It is a little out if my way from where I live and work but it is totally worth it. I will be a customer for life! :) 
P.S. Thank you for listening to my story about the Bakersfield, CA bakeries and for the super duper delicious blueberry donut you gave me!










donut - noun
 a small cake of sweetened dough, often ring-shaped or spherical with a jam or cream filling, cooked in hot fat 
inverted cinnamon roll - noun
 a cinnamon roll with swirls of devil's food cake, found at Real Donuts on W. Charleston and Shadow Lane, across the street from UMC Hospital. One bite and you're in love.
* I stopped by this family-owned business and Pat Gallagher assisted me in picking out two dozen tasty delights for my office. 
* Two dozen mixed donuts came to $18
* If available, you can buy a box of day-old donuts for $5. Each box contains 18-24 donuts.
* The drive to Henderson was a little torturous with the smells emanating from the boxes in the back seat.
* You had me at the inverted cinnamon roll.
* I'll definitely be back for more spheres and shapes cooked in hot fat.










Fresh, soft, flavorful, giant and delicious...what more could you want from doughnuts? Look no further, if you work anywhere in the downtown area this is the doughnut shop for you.
This family owed little store tucked into a strip-mall across from UMC was probably the last place I expected to find my favorite doughnuts but ever since a co-worker introduced me 3 years ago I have never wanted doughnuts from anywhere else, even (dare I say) Krispy Kreme! 
The variety is endless, although I like the cake and regular (glazed? it doesn't actually have glaze, just the doughnut) with chocolate topping. The plain glaze and the old-fashioned are also delicious. 
The doughnuts are baked fresh every day and the staff at this family owed shop will remember you and become friends after just a few visits. They also have milk to go with your doughnuts and coffee (if you drink it). A couple of small table allow the morning regulars to sit down and enjoy but they offer quick service for those of us running to work.
This may be a downtown secret but once you're in the know, you'll see from the Friday morning crowd many others are too :)










I've been going to this place with my friends before school and we absolutely love it! It's a small, family owned business that's a little far away from my school, but the donuts are high quality and for good prices. My friends always get the donut holes, which are really cheap. I also really like their giant donuts and their croissants!










Items selected: Bavarian, Blueberry Cake, Blueberry Fritter, Sourcream, Buttermilk Bar, Raised Glazed, Reverse Cinnamon Roll, Chocolate Cake, Crumb Cake, Apple Fritter
Having arranged various "foodcrawls" in the past it was with admitted enthusiasm that I entered Real Donuts to gather provisions for Las Vegas' first (known) donut crawl and with several glistening varieties fresh from the fryer only two challenges arose, the first limiting my order to a dozen and the second delivering the fried dough to the party without sneaking a bite. A small, clean shop with excellent service and a dozen donuts only $10 after tax and a tip it was up against three other doughnutteries that Real would find itself matched and although the occasional contender from Sunrise Too, Master Donuts, or Donut Hut shined it was Real Donuts that proved most consistent across the board. Featuring crispy fritters rife with fruit and low in oil, a textbook old-fashioned sourcream that literally melts on the tongue, and both yeasted and cake options on par with the city's best it would truly be hard to name a bad one in the bunch - a task I'll simply discard and suggest futile as I think back on the Blueberry Fritter, a 95 cent daily special I'd suggest worthy of 'destination' status.










We have been on a quest to find the best donut shop in town. I believe that this one won in my book! We got a half dozen donuts and they were all delicious with lots of flavor and didn't seem too sweet or heavy. My favorite was one that looked like an old fashioned donut but had barvarian cream in the middle. I can't remember what they called it but it was delicious and I can't wait to have another one! Everything we tried was really good. The shop is clean and the staff is friendly and helpful in making selections.










Working across the street from this jewel of a donut shop is a plus. Whenever I get the craving for a tasty chocolate cake donut, I know Real Donuts will always deliver. I have tried other donut shops, including the more commercial shops but I find myself always comparing their donuts to the ones I get at this little shop. No one beats them! Friendly staff, great service and good prices. Once you try them once, you will become a repeat customer guaranteed!










Thank god this is close to my home. They do have the best donuts in town.










The donuts were crispy on the outside and moist and delicious on the inside. What made this place great was the service. Extremely friendly! Overall an outstanding experience.










Let's get the obvious out of the way - the donuts are incredible. Literally, not a bad one on the menu. From basic glazed to specialty ones (like the fruit burritos - my god, get a fruit burrito), everything is delicious. And the way you are treated when you are in there is how you would be treated if your family owned the business. They are so kind and conversational. They're funny and helpful. Love the entire team!
They are also extremely accommodating! I last minute put in an order for 36 donuts for my birthday party, and they were able to get me pink donuts in a few hours! 
Love this place!










My go to place for donuts.  Great donuts. Good selection. Don't forget to check in for a free donut. Mmmm...donuts.










this place is the best. the cake donuts can't be beat, and their mini donuts are perfect to take to an event. I've gone in here around numerous holidays and they have festive options. the staff is friendly, and I've never waited more than a few minutes. I also appreciate their early start in the mornings. support this great bakery!










I have a pronouncement to make: Real Donuts has the best buttermilk bar in Las Vegas!
When I was growing up nearby, this place was a mediocre at best donut shop that also sold egg rolls. I'm glad to see things have changed a lot since then!
Value seekers: They sell a big box of assorted day old donuts for just $5.










Best. Damn. Donuts. In . Las Vegas. Period.










So delicious and fresh. So many to choose from but my faves are the Boston creme, crunch to the edges yet soft, and with lots of filling. Second favorite is their bear claws with the "claw" part tasting like a glazed donut and the center being pure yuminess...yeah that's a word.
If you get there early mornings (7:30 is when I usually get there) a mixed box of their day old donuts with about 10+ of 'em is available for $5.










Excelled customer service and great prices. They also have parking which is a plus. Highly recommended!










Krispy Kreams has some competition! They bear claws are to die for. Very nice and patience customer service. Will recommend going for a great doughnuts great service.










These are probably the best donuts in town! If you haven't tried them you must. They are so friendly and have such great food. I have to try keep my self away from this place. It's addicting!










Donuts and croissants are yummy










You can really taste quality work put into these donuts. I'm really happy stopped by to get some donuts










This place is small but I promise you will be extraordinarily happy after you leave here. 100% real donuts is what you get here. They are not to sweet they are just right. Plus they keep milk on hand. This shop is always clean. The employees are always friendly. I will return again & again. Because it's so worth it!










Have to step foot in here each time I have to make a trip into Everything Medical.... Can't resist. These donuts are unmatched & you gotta get the cream puffs before they're gone!!!










Best apple fritter I've ever had and the rest were pretty good. Not the most creative doughnuts in the world but very good.










Excellent doughnuts! I just left and sad I only purchased 3. :( Blueberry fritter was amazing, never had a doughnut like it. Must try! 
Only tip for the owner, the shop smelled like cleaning chemicals. Love a clean shop but a little off putting when you walk into a bakery.










These donuts are so tasty! It's right across UMC and they are definitely not overpriced. This is the shop you want to go to if you just want some yummy donuts - not those over the top ones you see all over Instagram. Simple, tasty, and affordable. Maybe I'll give their classic coffee a try soon.










Their donuts are SO GOOD!! I love it. Now that it is a Christmas time, they have cute items there. They are very inexpensive and fresh!!










One word...WOW! Was looking for a donut shop near the SLS before leaving back to California, and saw this place on Yelp. First let me start by saying the line was out the door. Always a good sign! We were greeted with a huge good Morning by both team members. When it was our turn to order, the selection of donuts was AWESOME! Ended up getting a half dozen to eat on the drive back. Well, I'm writing this as I'm eating my donut, and OMG...YUMMY! Definitely check out this place for AMAZING donuts!!










This place has got to have the best doughnuts hands down! The atmosphere is super friendly and I am so happy to have discovered this place. Do yourself a big favor and GO!!! :)










Go here. Best donuts I recall eating. Caramel coffee was amazing. Staff were great.










The most delicious donuts!! Staff is super friendly and helpful. Try the raised donut!










Awesome fresh donuts made right in the store. Best selection in Vegas. No place better and I'm a donut lover!!!










Best donuts in town. Best donut price in town.










Only place I've found to have blueberry fritters. Just found out Fridays they have pineapple ones.










GREAT!










Topnotch service and excellent doughnuts at an affordable price. I have been a fan of this store for quite some time and continue to patronize them.










Nothing gourmet. Nothing extravagant. Just plain ol' delicious donuts.










Great lattes, real homemade donuts and super friendly service.










Their donuts are delicious!  The people that work there are very nice.  If you're looking for a fun alternative to a birthday cake, try one of the Alaskan donuts.










This the best donut ive had! A grat assortment made daily. Assorted dozens ready to go. Awesome fritters! My favorite!
They even make monster donuts! A 5 lb fritter a family can feed on!










Didn't have high expectations for this place but decided to stop by on a whim. Not even a huge fan of doughnuts, but these were awesome. Coffee good too!










Absolutely THE best donuts in town!!!! I love donuts and coming from southern Cali where the best donuts are made, I consider myself a donut snob. Moist and delicious every single time!!!! You need to try it!










I'm upset I don't have a picture to show you but trust me, these donuts are amazing! When you walk up to the display case you're going to have a difficult time choosing which ones to take home. They all look delightful and tempting! Honey buns, glazed donuts, cake donuts with and without icing, bear claws, and more.
I don't eat donuts often, but when I do, this is the place I go. They live up to their name - "Real Donuts". They aren't puffed up with air, and they aren't a mouth full of nothing. They taste like the donuts I had when I was a little girl; made with good ingredients, baked to perfection and melt in my mouth. Don't forget to pick up some donut holes to munch on as you drive. It'll keep you satisfied until you can sit down and dig into the treasures you decided to buy.










PERFECT start to the morning! The donuts were super fresh and delicious. I chose 2 raised donuts with frosting and sprinkles (how does one pass up sprinkles?), and a classic old fashioned. All of them were AWESOME! The woman running the shop was super friendly and greeted every person who walked in- highly recommend!










Great donuts! 
It's worth the jog from SLS hotel.
I enjoyed every one of the donuts I got this morning. Half a dozen + 1 . My favorite is the cinnamon crumbs donut, not too sweet and great taste of cinnamon.










In Vegas on vacation last week. Being a donut lover I turned to yelp to find a place here. Yelpers came thru because this place has an amazing selection and my favorite is the blueberry fritter. My husband and I liked them so much we stopped in again before heading home.










Great coffe, great donuts, and great customer service. I love this place.










I can't believe it took me this long to get around to writing this review when I was most active as their customers several years ago. I used to work on Commerce and Charleston, and I would need to be at my office by 530 AM and made very frequent stops for an unhealthy breakfast at Real Donuts because it was on the way. I was there all the time!! No regrets !! I wish I could do that now. You can tell they are a down-to-earth small business which has gained their acclaim through word of mouth from making fantastic doughy goodness. The ham and cheese croissants are everything I ever wanted in my life and look no further for a delicious maple bar. I went again recently and its just as good as I remembered. I need to eat more donuts so I have more excuses to stop by.










Sweet Real donuts!










Had I purchased my donuts early morning they would have tasted fresher but I ended up buying a dozen stale donuts because I went there late in the afternoon. Overall,the cashier was very nice and approachable I'll probably give them another try (morning time of course),before writing them off permanently. I wish them continued success in business










I visit this donut spot atleast once a week! They always have fresh donuts and often have $5 box specials. I'm in love with the inverted chocolate cinnamon roll. Reminds me of when I was a job growing up in Cali. Just a great fresh tasty donut without all the extra sometimes unnecessary bells and whistles! Get back to the basics!










The second best donuts I've ever had. The first was in the early 70's in Missoula, Montana at a store that had a donut machine where you could eat the hot, greasy donuts as they rolled out. 
This place is fantastic. The blueberry cake donut was tender with a delicate crust on the outside, just perfect. My husband's blueberry fritter had that nice crunchiness on the outside, and the inverted cinnamon roll with devils food cake was amazing. 
I've had donuts from L.A. to Kuwait, and these are exceptional. The only thing I might change is they are heavily glazed and frosted (not as bad as Krispy Kreme), and I prefer mine light...just a personal preference. 
The drip coffee was so-so, but they have an expresso machine. Prices are great, it's a hole in the wall, but plenty of parking, and the woman at the counter was cheerful. Open early, too. While we were there, a steady trickle of customers came in. Everybody likes this place. 
Recommended.










This place is so cool. It has a real nice quaint vibe, with interesting art and great music. The lady who helped us was extremely friendly and made the whole process even better. It's clean and who doesn't love the smell of fresh made donuts!










The Blueberry Fritters, Crullers, Bavarian Cream donuts and Buttermilk donuts are my favorites. I now have turned my employes into fans and have to bring a requested list when I come here from the people from work to get their favorites.










They have very delicious donuts. Fresh, not overly sweet, just right. Good prices and friendly worker. Large assortment.










I come for the coffee, and service is great. I'm in love with their coffee.










Got a 16 inch diameter donut... Totally worth it. Amazing price you won't get a deal like that anywhere else. Had it custom made for my girlfriend's birthdays which is on national donut day!










My first time at Real Donuts was on National Donut Day. I just had to stop in on my way to work. 
It is a hole in the wall in an older shopping center that has seen better days. But, the store was crowded, so I knew I was in the right spot. 
Service was quick, and everyone was super nice. 
I got a Boston Creme donut to go, and when I got to work and tasted it, I knew I had made the right decision. 
I know I'll be back!










Perfect for the post night in Vegas breakfast. Crispy, buttery, flakey goodness.










The best blueberry fritter I have ever eaten!! All of their donuts are amazing - so much better than Krispy Kreme or Dunkin donuts! Now that I found this place I'll keep coming back for life :-)










Went on Friday 6-3-16 to grab some donuts and it just happened to be National Donut Day and boy, was it crowded!! 
They have a check in offer right now of 1 free donut which I had no trouble redeeming. I was able to snag a dozen donuts for $10 which is pretty great. 
This place is kind of a hole in the wall but don't let their building fool you...it's in an older shopping center and it's not the nicest but it's clean in a "no frills" kinda way. The workers are tatted up and sometimes they play rap music which I love. 
After eating their donuts for a few months I can say with confidence they are the second-best donuts I've ever had. The crullers are out of this world! All the donuts are fresh and flavorful and will melt in your mouth. 
Unfortunately they were out of crullers today :( And it was about 90 degrees inside the store...I felt really bad for the workers. I was sweatin' my balls off in there.










I know people always say some place is the best, but Real Donuts is honestly the best donuts I've ever had. Every time I come to Vegas I have to stop by and get some. The people who work there are incredible, the prices are amazing and the donuts are the greatest!! The only thing that has ever made me mad is when I didn't have anymore money to tip after she gave me an extra donut.










OMG! Must try the iced mocha coconut coffee. So freaking good! We got maple twist & buttermilk chocolate donut & holy cow it's so damn good!










Excellent donuts. Not much else to say. Oh and at 1$ each for a gourmet donut --- that's a steal.










I had a most excellent experience! The donuts were so fresh, moist and flavorful! Tanya was so friendly and helpful! We will definitely be back!










The best donut in Vegas










I was being hospitalized at UMC hospital and my husband decided to surprise me with real donuts it was my first time having them and now I want them every day! Hands down BEST donuts in Vegas!!










I am a lover of the donut and this little shop delivers. If you find yourself in need of that special place which can provide you with melt in your mouth perfection, look no further. I must also mention that $5 for a half dozen is a great deal.










I've never been a donut person.
But Real Donuts could change all that.
Good selection, incredible texture, delicate flavor, and very well-priced. 
Goodbye costly, conceited croissants. 
Hello delicious, decadent donuts!










I think they have the best donuts to me.. my boss at work always brings them so I asked one day and told me.. I decided to go up there one morning nice and early and got me a nice and fresh donut with some milk it really hit the spot can't complain and deff recommend coming here










I went for the first time at 1pm, and the donut I got was devils food cake and donut twisted together then glazed (don't know what it's called). It was great! I want to go in the morning so they have a wider variety to choose from (and really fresh).










I've been off the donut kick for a while, but a visit this morning brought the yummy memories all back.
I wanted to grab some donuts for coworkers today, and Real Donuts was really convenient. It's also one of my favorite places in town. And it's still cheap, starting at $1 for standard donuts and with discounts such as $5 for half a dozen, and even one free with Yelp check-in.
The counter has been streamlined, with everything including the cash register along one wall instead of the former L-shaped counter. That doesn't mean that they've lowered their variety. The selection this particular morning was the most massive that I've seen in my (sadly) few visits, and I was almost late because of trying to decide between all of the options. Maybe I should've gone for that full dozen.
I started with a blueberry jelly-filled donut (this one being a free-with-check-in donut), then picked up an apple-filled donut. I was more partial to the blueberry, but both were delicious glazed donuts with plenty of fruity jelly. Note that these donuts qualify for the free donut and for 1 of the 6 you can get in a half-dozen (max. 2 in a dozen).
The blueberry fritter was as stunningly crunchy, moist, and flavorful as the first time I fell in love with the shop. I ate the second one at home for dinner. I would have loved to save it for the next morning, but it was that irresistible.
The cake donuts were great, with the honey wheat spiced making me regret not double-ordering and the blueberry almost making me forget about Donut Hut. I actually get a little bit more blueberry flavor out of this version, but its texture is ever so slightly less palatable.
The buttermilk donut with raspberry jelly was also really good, with its own unique flavor and crunch. It was the last one with jelly available, and it brought back the memory of the splendid raspberry-filled donut that I forewent today for variety's sake.
New players have arrived since my last written look at Real Donuts, but I still strongly recommend this shop. It's one of the best in town, and it just so happens to be located centrally in the Las Vegas valley and just off the highway. I'll have to stop by more often if I need a sweet treat in the daytime.










Decent, fresh donuts--perhaps just not aligned with my taste. The 4-star review is not for the donuts (although they bring it up to 4 from, say, a 2) rather it is missing a five-star review because of the service and employee attitude. I'm willing to give any business the benefit of the doubt in order to allow for the occasional bad day, like all humans are apt to have now and then. But in the name of an honest review i must say i was treated as if i was a nuisance and like they couldn't get me out of the store fast enough. I barely spoke and only ordered a common order of a coffee and 2 donuts. Hopefully, my next visit will allow for a 5th star!










Easily the best donut I've ever had and I am not a fan of donuts at all. Service was great, the lady behind the counter made me feel at home as I'd never been there before.  Will definitely go back and recommend to others.










It's located on a major thoroughfare between Chinatown & Downtown but you have to really pay attention & drive slowly or you'll miss it & pass right by. It is in a mini shopping inlet; not quite a strip mall. You park right in front, easy access. Whenever I try a new donut shop I order the same 2 items to compare with other donut shops: glazed raised and buttermilk bar. Real's were "really great". They had a cinnamon crumb donut which was noteworthy, think crumb cake in a donut form. Impressive selection, even midday. Nothing fancy or modern about Real but tasty & great value, plus they accept cash or credit card for convenience.










Best anywhere.. I consider myself a donut expert..no I'm not a cop, but the chocolate raised are second to none anywhere










Very good service, warm ppl, donuts are delicious, big selection like chocolate, vanilla, apple and donuts with bavarian cream. The cream made very well doesnt taste cheap like other places.










Not often get my Donut fix in. I happen to be in the area and had Donuts on my mind so went to trusty Yelp search. Bam. Real Donuts. It was my first time. Talk about never judge book by its cover. I would put Real Donuts in that category. It not often in that area but remember before getting health card renewal near UMC. Everything in that area screams YIKES! Not exactly greatest part of town and all the small shopping malls along the area look shady at best. The minute pulled into Real Donuts little shopping area nothing changed for me the store fronts are basic/outdated. It all changed once you walk up to the front door and see Yelp sticker!! I think that worthy of one star. LOL!!! The minute walked in the smell was awesome. Any kind of bakery always been fan of fresh baked goodies. Talk about assortment of donuts. Thankfully went in the early afternoon so had full stock and made the display of donuts pretty awesome. The lady that working was super friendly, warm welcome soon walked in, since first time she like take your time no rush, and no doubt five star service. 
It tough just pick couple. The only one I do remember the name was the Cinnamon Crumb Glazed Donut. It reminded me kind of like coffee cake donut. It was the first one tasted. The other two believe one was cinnamon roll. Ok. The custard filled donut. I could just have bowl of custard filling and be in custard bliss. The outside was ok but the filling was key for me. 
The interior nothing really modern more outdated. I kind of liked it went with the personality of the place besides the checkerboard flooring throwback style. The chalkboard sign menus. Cool. Texas vs Alaskan. Talk about not joke. They had one Alaskan style donut in the display and talk about donut for two or three. Only one might have more in the back. But if looking for one ridiculous oversize donut they have it at Real Donuts. 
If am in the area and get the Donut urge Real Donuts!!!! Yay!!










This donut shop has got to be the best donut shop in Vegas if not the USA.  You got to taste one to believe that you are in donut Heaven! Trust me!










Great donuts---exceptional customer service!










Wow...well worth a trip a little off the strip. Great donuts. Good Coffee. Four in the afternoon and still a great variety.










This place has the best donuts! Tried Krispy Kreme, Dunkin Donuts and others but this place has them beat! The selection is great and they even have mega huge donuts! Regardless of what day or time you come in this small shop you will get fresh product. Wait times are brief especially since it's small. This location is right across from UMC Hospital.










Love this place. I was so happy to find a place with vegan donuts to indulge in! There cinnamon roll donuts my favorite too. Glad I have somewhere to go for a harm free sweet tooth from time to time










They deserve the 5 star rating here I have been coming here for 15 years. I would not go anywhere else in the whole city.










Real Donut's claim to fame are their Texas and Alaskan donuts. The Texas is a yeast donut with chocolate icing and sprinkles and is approximately 3/4 the size of a grown man's head. Your average guy can probably devour half the donut without feeling overwhelmed. This same donut can also feed 4-5 women. Go figure! The Alaskan donuts come by special order only, so don't think you can just stroll in and grab one. The Alaskan is nearly the double the size of the Texas.
The apple and blueberry fritters are another popular option. In my humble opinion, Real Donuts are the best traditional donuts in all of Southern Nevada.










This place exceeded all my expectations. I called at a little after 7 Friday morning and asked if they could get 12 dozen donuts together in about 10 minutes. I arrived shortly after I called and donuts were ready to go. Not only was the service amazing but the donuts were delicious! I will make sure whenever our staff is getting donuts, it's from here!










I'm on a mission. A mission to eat all the donuts. Of the 5 places I've tried in Las Vegas in the past 3 weeks, Real is my absolute favorite. The maple buttermilk bar and old fashioned hit the nail on the head in so many ways. Tender inside and crispy on the outside with the right amount of sweetness in the glaze. While the inside out cinnamon roll wasn't my jam, the glazed raised was. Yeasty and light with a glaze that melted with each bite into your tongue. These are the donuts that will haunt my dreams.










I love this place. Super delicious donuts and Danish, great selection at an awesome price with friendly staff.










What a great way to start the new year! What diet?! I love mom and pop donut shops because I like simplicity. I have been disappointed with more popular joints that serve "gourmet" donuts, which usually have too much going on. Real donuts was recommended to me by Ramil B., so of course I had to check them out! For my first time here, I chose the 1/2 dozen for $5. With Yelp check-in, I got a free donut! Seven donuts total, not bad! 
Blueberry fritter
Inverted chocolate donut
Buttermilk glazed donut
Maple donut
Cinnamon crunch
Glazed donut
Overall, the donuts were fresh! After sampling a couple of them, I had to stop. Guilt set in, but the sugary-ness got to me. Definitely, enjoy donuts in moderation! My favorites from the bunch were: blueberry fritter, inverted chocolate donut, and cinnamon crunch. 
They are have huge "Texas" donuts, teas, and coffees. Service was good! The lady at the counter was helpful in suggesting flavors.

The apple fritters is absolutely delicious!!!!! I just love this place, support local businesses. Mom and Pop donut shops are the best!!










Stopped in here at about 2pm. The donuts were not the freshest but I can't expect much at that time in the afternoon. They were still good though. You can not beat the price. $5 for a half dozen! Girl working was very nice. The free donut for checking in is def what got me to stop in

I come to this donut shop all the time. Amazing donuts!!! Different from other donut shops in town. I won't eat donuts unless it's from them. Great staff too. Prices are great. Go early because they sell fast.










Honestly the best donuts in town!! Soooo soft and never stale! Must come see for your self!










I've been here a few times and always had a good experience. Donuts are delicious. Its a great old fashioned donut shop that reminds me of the places from back home. If you're debating I say go. Really cant do much better than them.










I really like the donut shop because I have really great deal time to time and this is my first time reviewing on it because I think today was a really special because I had a coupon and it was so amazing I got to use it today cuz I was short on time. But even so they did a really amazing time job quickly service










Best doughnuts that I have had in a long time!! They bet the doughnuts I grew up getting at the local doughnut shop by a long shot. The old fashioned glazed and blueberry doughnuts are to die for!! The staff is also super friendly. I am willing drive from henderson to this doughnut shop. Must try!!










Best donuts we've had anywhere, bar none! (Those creme filled ones with a touch of chocolate icing are to DIE for. )










Good donuts and you can use the check in offer every time! Friendly and I happened to be waiting for a friend so it was close. I would definitely come back.










Real Donuts is really good ! They have donuts and buns which are really fresh. They had a dozen for $7.00 special which is a real bargain considering the quality and size of the donuts. I would suggest arriving early, I was there around 1 pm and the inventory was starting to thin out. However I did purchase some filled donuts, chocolate with frosting, apple crumb (which was amazing ) and a few more equally tasty treats.
They have coffee and lattes advertised I will have to try next time.The store is small but feels welcoming and the customer service was outstanding. I will deliver be back the next time I'm in the area.










-I like olykoeks.
-June 7th is Nation Olykoek Day.
-Real Olykoeks sells olykoeks.
You won't find bacon-encrusted olykoeks filled with maple-M&M-peanut-butter-fruit-loop-jalapeno-blueberry-chai-creme here.
Just straight-up, old-school olykoeks. Glazed. Chocolate custard. Sprinkles. 
The olykoek I ate has already congealed and is now settling nicely as a thrombus in the anterior interventricular branch of my left coronary artery. Widows will be made tonight.
And when it comes down to it, isn't that the ultimate test of a quality olykoek shop?

The Donuts in town.










My partner and I stopped in to grab some donuts for my family at UMC. We noticed the good reviews and the location, so we had to stop in at check it out. Once we stepped in, we knew why the reviews where great. We were greeted w/ a smile and kind words. THEN she asked why me and my and my partner weren't in school; a compliment that we look young. What personality!! We had a blast picking our donuts and so should you.










Came here to pick up some doughnuts before heading back to San Diego. This was the last stop before going home. 
I know I shouldn't be having doughnuts for breakfast but I had to have one. You check in on Yelp and you get a free doughnut. How cool is that? 
They take credit card which is a must for me. I hardly carry cash. 
As we entered this doughnut shop, you see an array of doughnuts in the display case. I didn't get a chance to take a photo because we were in a rush to leave. When it was my turn to order, I showed her my Yelp check in. I got glazed for my free doughnut. I had to give them my business, so I also got a dozen glazed doughnut holes along with a bottle of water and an apple juice for my daughter. Total was $4.07. That's awesome. The lady ringing up my order was super nice and friendly. I didn't catch her name but she had a great personality. 
The doughnuts are fresh and delicious. Highly recommend coming here for your doughnut fix!










Best donuts in Vegas,, hands down!!











I stopped by to pick up donuts for a staff meeting. I was surprised to pay $9.50 per dozen. The quality of donuts surpassed other donut shops. I highly recommend you give them a try.










Amazing !! Ten times better than any other doughnut chain out there ! The Old Fashioned and The Blueberry Fritter are my absolute favorite. Worth the drive across town and always very friendly .










Seriously the best donuts in Vegas... I cannot enjoy a donut from anywhere else because I always compare it to this place and no other donut measures up! Seriously try it and you will never go back. 










The Best Cinnamon Roll in the world! Great donuts and fritters. Also have mexican breads pan dulce. Eat everything but the coffee is not that good My rating is really based on the Cinnamon Roll Forget about … more The Best Cinnamon Roll in the world! Great donuts and fritters.

Best staff. Donuts. Coffee. In town never. Have. To wait in line always taken. Care of. Always










This is a small donut shop with a few sitting places. You can have a big selection of real homemade donuts. If you love sweets, especially donuts, you'll feel like in heaven)))
The blueberry flitters and apple flitters are very yummy. I also love the raspberry filled with powdered sugar.The prices are reasonable and the workers are always friendly and helpful. 
They have a YELP check in offer for a free donut and that is really good. Love this place...










Amazing service, so friendly and personable! I am always impressed by their donut selection, SO many choices. I will never go anywhere else!!!










Let me first start off by saying, Sage, the girl working the counter was so so sweet and knowledgable about all the donuts and Vegas in general. She is the reason for 5 stars. You just don't find nice people anymore. Everyone is so rude.  
On to the review:
Great, cheap eats in Vegas. We had 4 donuts, 2 were free with our yelp check-ins. Score! 
Apple fritter - nice texture, apple cinnamon flavor but the icing on top made it to sweet for me. (I don't add sugar to anything so it may be my taste)
Cinnamon crumb cake - pillow soft texture, not overly sweet. Good choice.
Chocolate sprinkle- I think the kid in all of us just craves it. BF liked it.
Raspberry filled - by far my favorite. The raspberry flavor was so potent and yummy. They definitely don't skimp on the filling. It was bursting out!
Iced chai tea was so good. Perfectly made. 
Once again, thanks to Sage for all of the local tips and places to eat! Our bellies will thank you.










THE BEST customer service!! Brian is so friendly and helpful! Donuts are good. Not to die for. Brian took the time to look up names of local eateries for us. He was rockin' to Billy Idol. Nice guy!










Stumbled upon this donut shop while my friend and I showed up an hour early for class on an empty stomach. There is plenty of accessible parking out in front. The shop was clean and there was a great selection of fresh donuts. I ordered the chocolate bar and chocolate circle donut. My friend ordered the chocolate crueller. The donuts tasted fresh. Costed $1 each,  reasonably priced. Check in on yelp for a free regular or filled donut. 
They also have a gigantic donut for sale in the glass window. It looked like the size of 4 donuts combined. Would probably come again to try out the big donut,  mainly for photos though. 
The service was top notch here. I usually don't expect much from donut shops since they don't make much and it's early in the morning, but this one was different.  The kind lady behind the counter was very sweet and smiled often. She definitely help make my day a little brighter!










The cashier over there is fine as hell










Delicious donuts, decent coffee, and incredibly friendly service. What more need be said?
Well: they have some of the best donut holes I've eaten, and the crullers are to die for.










real donuts
are real! They taste sooooo goood!










Real Donuts is like punk rock in pastry form. They're not generic suburban Krispy Kreme, nor are they some fru-fru fancy urban joint. These donuts are angry and out to kick ass. From donut holes to Texas donuts, the size offerings vary. Plus they're TASTY, moist (yet not greasy), and totally satisfying. The only thing keeping me from giving them five stars is the lack of variety that other donut shops have. Don't get me wrong...there's still a good selection. But I suppose I can sacrifice a cronut or donut sandwich if it means I get to make gastronomical love to RD!










I tried a Sugared and a Glazed,  both were fresh and delicious. 
They have limited seating,  3 tables. 
Offers many types of donuts,  including an Alaska for 9.99. Incase at 1130am I saw 7 types of donuts,  3 fritters,  and croissants. 
Quirky employees who work hard.










Stopping by Real Donuts is a real treat. This last visit I stopped by in the early afternoon and they still had a good variety of donuts available. Inside is small, but it was packed with customers. I like that they keep fresh stuff coming out throughout the day. The workers are always nice and upbeat. There is a check-in offer on yelp for a free regular or filled donut and they are good about honoring it. A half dozen donuts only set me back $5 which is a good price and the donuts tasted great. They have coffee and other pastries available also including a couple of donuts that are larger than normal in size and usually require some notice to ensure being able to grab one, so call ahead. This is a hole in the wall donut shop that's been here for a long time and for good reason. It's not the decor bringing customers back it's the friendly employees, fair prices and most of all delicious donuts in my opinion. 
Inverted Cinnamon Roll - This one has swirls of devils food cake in it. Easily one of my favorite donuts here. The donut is just nice and soft and has great flavor. I'd recommend getting at least two.
Inverted Chocolate Iced - Not swirled with devils food cake or cinnamon like the previously mentioned, but still sporting princess Leia buns covered in chocolate. I wish I had saved this one for the following day with my coffee, it would have paired better. I enjoyed the donut however it was a bit heavier than the nice and soft inverted cinnamon roll and could have handled being dipped in coffee or tea just fine.
Blueberry Fritter - Very good! When I heard they had apple and blueberry, I decided to try the blueberry and my hubby went with the apple which I sadly didn't taste. I loved the texture of the blueberry fritter and I tasted blueberries in each bite. 
Twisted Chocolate Iced - I picked this one out because it was covered in chocolate and looked good. When I got home and took it out of the box it resembled a wiener and balls to me. Oh well it was tasty and I swallowed the whole thing.
Filled Bear Claw - Very good. This donut was a good size and nice and soft with a good amount of apple filling inside. They also have smaller bear claws that are not filled if that's your thing..
Raspberry Filled - The outside of the donut was glazed nicely and inside there was a fair amount of raspberry filling and it tasted great.










The shopgirl recommened  "inverted cinnamon rolls". I bought Glazed and Sourcream and Chocolate and Chocolate on Coconuts and inverted cinnamon rolls. Anyway, I bought 6 Donuts and price is just $5! What a reasonable price! I love this shop! The atmosphere was a traditional shop. Very Simple and tasty and inexpensive!!










Wow this is a legit hole in the wall donut joint. The donuts are so fresh and the price is definitely right. There is a yelp check in offer for a free donut and when I asked the girl behind the counter if she wanted to mark the offer used she said "no way sugar we want you to use it every time you come back" and that's a nice touch. She was friendly and nice about explaining the different donuts to me. The wife and I picked out a half dozen plus our free donut each for yelp check in and it was only $5 which is awesome. The bigger bear claws are filled unlike the smaller ones and both are equally delicious. I'm a fan of cinnamon rolls and really enjoyed the inverted cinnamon roll that ribbons of devils food cake running through it. No fancy donuts here just classic old fashion donuts of goodness.










!!!
Donuts taste so goood!










Get the Inverted Cinnamon Roll and Blueberry Fritter and thank me later!










Great donuts, friendly service, reasonable prices. What more can you ask for? I definitely will be going back. I've yet to find a better place is the city for donuts. Be sure to try the fritters. They have apple, pineapple, and my favorite, blueberry! The place I've ever seen them.










Just happened to notice this little donut shop driving by so I stopped in. I highly recommend it! The donuts are fresh, the younger staff is friendly & knowledgable & tons of choices. If you like crispy on the outside fritters & soft on the inside, they have some of the best!!! The blueberry 1 is awesome! If you like donuts, give them a try!!










We ordered 11 dozen doughnuts for favors at our wedding on May 18. They were delicious and we received great reviews from our guests.  Thanks so much!










I just ate the best doughnut I've had in a long time. Thanks to all at Real Donuts.










A small family owned donut shop. Amazing service and even better donuts! There is something special about there glaze twist donuts! There prices are reasonable for a dozen. This place is a must go.










The twenty minute drive is worth it. I passed a dozen other donut shops for these.










Donuts taste so goood!
Donuts taste so goood!










OMG! So delicious! It's the only place I will ever go to from this point on! I 'm not much of a donut person, (I know.) but this place is just AMAZING!! The donuts taste super fresh and they're really soft, too. The people are just great and very friendly. Love it!










I came in right at opening time on Saturday morning. The donuts looked fresh and so beautifully unreal. I had a maple old fashioned and it was PERFECT. Some O/F donuts are too dry, or too moist almost tasting uncooked. Real Donuts gets it JUST RIGHT! I bought 3dozen assorted for my co-workers and will turn. These donuts are delicious and priced well.










Real Donuts is REAL GREAT!!  Only had the double chocolate and blueberry cake, but both were outstanding.  Friendly service and clean shop.  Exact change/cash only.  I will be back for more!!










The donuts were fresh and delicious. The apple fritter was perfectly cooked. The cake donuts were a magical blend of crispy and moist. My kids approved of the chocolate frosting.










Great doughnuts & very nice people get there early place gets busy! Blueberry cake doughnut is a favorite.










I finally gave into my craving for an old fashioned warm, sweet donut.  Walked in a few minutes after closing time and was still able to purchase some yummy, fresh donuts.  Owner's son was super sweet and full of personality.  Will definitely be back.










We moved here form Los Angeles and have several great old school donut famous donut spots to choose from, it was hard to find a "REAl" donut  n Vegas. Until now... Real Donuts is the REAL DEAL.. Best spot in town for great donuts.. No fu fu  stuff.. Just good ole down to earth donuts that you simply can't stop eating...  We drive 25 min one way to get them...










I think of myself as kind of a donut expert. And with all of my experience I can honestly say that this is the BEST donut place in Las Vegas! Though I live 30 minutes away from this little piece of heaven, I can't help but make the trip weekly. Fresh, delicious, REAL!










Sometimes its the little mom and pop local stores that really shine.  Krispy Kreme and Dunkin can keep their donuts.  For me, Real Donuts is where its at.  Their shop may be old and small.  It may be in a rough and sketchy looking area.  But damn are their donuts good.  They are bigger than those which come from a large chain store.  They are also fresh and delicious with a more nostalgic  reminding me of the old shops back home I used to go to as a kid.  On top of that they offer a gigantic donut that is as big as my face.  Thats just cool.  Last time I was in there I could hear some good hard rock coming from the back.  I found myself headbanging by the time I left.  Ah, good times.  I feel fortunate that Real Donuts is close to work for me.  A simple jaunt across the street from UMC and you have arrived.










We came into town for the weekend and decided to go get some donuts!! I would call myself a connoisseur of apple fritters......their apple fritter was AMAZING!! The woman behind the counter was very friendly and helpful! We purchased a dozen and each donut was fresh and delicious!  I higjl










You've never really had a donut until you've had a Real Donut. You can taste the freshness and Brian is always a bubbly joy to see. Just go here and get donuts for everyone you know. They will love you forever. My favorite: Crunchie Raised, Apple Fritter, or Cinnamon Butterfly.










I love these donuts. Reminds of a place I used to go back home in Texas. The staff is very friendly.










Oh lawd. Oh no child. This is so good, it's bad. My hips are going to be so mad at me for ever coming to this place. I have eaten 2 1/2 donuts since we got our box which was only 30 minutes ago.
I will definitely be coming back to this place. So close to work and VERY good quality donuts! My boyfriend and I were thinking about going to a different donut place on lunch but we didn't like how greasy they normally are. We were driving around work, seeing what other places we could check out. We decided to drive down Charleston and passed by a place called "Real Donuts". We were thinking, "Real donuts? As opposed to fake donuts?"
We stopped in and there was a super friendly person in front. I saw a ton of cake and crumb donuts, my two favorites. Heaven. Already. After looking around, we were asking a ton of questions wondering what we should get. We planned on only getting a few, maybe one for him and one for me. Well, that went out the window real quick.
We started with a blueberry cake with white icing.. then moved to a bavarian creme filled chocolate glazed donut. After that, it was all bad. We found out that they had a blueberry fritter, my boyfriend's favorite thing in the world. We got two of those. We got an orange glazed cake donut, a crumb cake donut, a crumb covered apple cinnamon filled one... We decided to just go with the dozen at that point and decided to get everyone on our team donuts. We got a cinnamon roll, a cinnamon roll mixed with devil's food cake, some swirly one that I forgot what it was, a chocolate cake donut with chocolate icing, a regular cake donut with chocolate icing. I honestly don't remember all of the donuts that we got but the guy in front ended up throwing another one in for free. Then... we asked about one last donut and he ended up throwing that in for free too! So awesome!
I was weary of the orange-glazed donut but it was so amazing. It tasted like a creamsicle. The blueberry cake donut was SO flavorful, I couldn't believe it. I really am stuffed and my whole team was raving about how good the donuts were. I didn't want to end up eating all of the leftovers, for sake of my hips, so I walked around my office and started handing them out. Everyone was talking about how good they were!
I will definitely be coming back. The service was great. The quality of the donuts was AMAZING and the flavor was perfect. I can't wait to come back and try all of the other donuts we didn't get this time.










This place is pretty awesome. They make a lot of donuts so much that the next day they offer  20 of them for five bucks. If you are looking for dependably decent donuts and you are in the area; if recommend it. Just be aware it's no Ronalds donuts... This is a good second though..tied with Masters donuts.










This place brings back memories of my childhood when my mom would take me to the little donut shop on Saturday mornings. I love the little hole in the wall, family owned joints. So much better than chain places. This spot has been on my radar since I saw pics from Terri's donut crawl. I got the maple bar and a regular glazed donut. Both were soft, sugary treats which I inhaled in less than 2 minutes. I don't eat too many donuts for obvious health reasons, but these were probably at the top of my list for donut spots in Vegas. Don't forget your Yelp check in for a free donut. Will for sure be back on my cheat days.










I'm a little stunned that I haven't been to Real Donuts before because I've spent a lot of time nearby. It took until I had enjoyed one of their creations through a reseller (The Goodwich) that I really experienced the magic.
Regular donuts are $1 each, but nobody is really going to buy just one. More likely options are a dozen regular donuts for $9.50 (max. 2 jelly-filled donuts) and half a dozen donuts for $5 (1 jelly-filled). They have higher prices for fancies ($1.50/$8/$15). I was actually looking for the day-old donuts but missed the boat on it. I guess they must sell out of those close to their opening hour of 4am (your time to shine, early risers).
So yeah, that blueberry fritter. It was my magical introduction to Real Donuts. It's not apple (which is also good). It's better. Sweet, moist, crunchy, blueberry-y, Not sure what more you can ask for... except a second. I also tried the raspberry jelly-filled donut and the maple cruller on day 1. There is an absurd amount of jelly in the middle of that treat, but thankfully it's not too sweet. The cruller is pretty airy and reminds me of cream puff dough. Almost feels like a healthy option... almost.
Next day, I finished the rest of the donuts off. I guess I got the day-old donuts that I wanted after all. The orange cream glazed donut was okay but didn't stand out. The cinnamon raisin bun was still very moist, and it was sweet without having a huge portion of glaze as you might see as other places. The old-fashioned chocolate donut was pretty average too (note to self: skip). Finally, blueberry fritter #2 was just as awesome as the first.
Definitely would recommend Real Donuts for people who are in the area or who are donut fans. Haven't thoroughly explored the rest of the Vegas donut scene, but I'm already pretty confident this place will end up as one of the mainstays.










Really one of the best places for donuts here in Vegas. I absolutely love the blueberry filled and the inverted cinnamon donuts. They are perfectly sweet to me, since some donut shop donuts can be super sweet. Don't forget the check-in deal for Yelpers. You won't be disappointed in these donuts.










Doughnuts. Donuts. Dog Nuts...whatever you call them for the most part, they're all tasty. Well maybe not dog nuts. 
Lets get real, this place is like a fried dough time machine and I love it. Real Donuts definitely keeps it real; from the wood paneling on the walls to the $1 doughnut, it's like walking into the "Wonder Years" TV show. 
I originally came here for the inverted cinnamon rolls, but found myself buying up pretty much everything in the display case. The maple & peanut covered cinnamon rolls, cherry frosted french crullers, bear claws, the classic Simpsons doughnut (pink frosting & sprinkles), maple bars, and nearly everything in-between. 
Not to forgot my savory side, I also bought a jalapeño croissant stuffed with turkey, swiss cheese, and chunks of my favorite spicy pepper. This was delicious; the bread was super soft and I was told it was made fresh that morning. Sure tasted like it! This treat is a must if your taste buds like to live on the spicy side. 
Before I left I asked about the two giant doughnuts that looked like they were drawn on a board behind the cash register. One is called "The Texas" which is a giant glazed doughnut, about 8 inches in diameter?. The other doughnut is called "The Alaskan", this is what looks like a 16 inch fried piece of heaven?. I'm not sure, but sadly it didn't matter, "The Texas" was sold out and "the Alaskan" is made-to-order. Next time, my doughnut loving friends!










It was a quiet little donut shop with a very friendly lady working there. She was nice and greeted all the customers by their names. It smelled so good like fresh cooked goodness. I bought a dozen and a half donuts and a dozen donut holes for the people I work with. It was a reasonable price at $15. The donuts were very fresh and warm. I had the lady working just give me a mix of everything. I had a round one with chocolate frosting and orange sprinkles for Halloween, it was very tasty. I also had a few (or half the bag) of donut holes and they were just as tasty. I would definitely go back and would recommend this place to my friends.










Donuts are consistently great!  Always fresh and never too greasy.  They always have a huge variety to choose from also.  Love this place!










The employees made me laugh the entire time I was there! I appreciate entertainment while I wait. The donuts were mouth-watering and fresh. I bought three dozen donuts to feed a class of folks and they were nearly gone within an hour. People, including me, were going back for seconds!










I have been going here for years. The BEST way to start your day. Fresh, yummy and the prices are great!










Good donuts! Really good! Super fresh. The place was crowded with locals. Staff was friendly. Would go back for sure!










Awesome place. Swooped in right before they closed and I tried an orange frosted donut!! I already love pink frosting but Orange is my new favorite!! Lady was super nice also. What a sweet place to have sweets ha!!










I couldn't believe it.  We checked in and we got 8 specialty donuts for $6.50!!!  How is that possible? ?  Owners are super friendly.  Everything was very tasty,  we especially liked the fritters (blueberry and regular) and the apple filled.










First time at Real Donuts, the costumer service was fabulous!!! Really enjoyed my time ordering donuts lol 
Our clinic went on a donut adventure, we order their top sellers and let me tell you they are all worth the calories!!!










Before JayZ and Kanye West, there was RunDMC, before Justin Timberlake and Justin Bieber, there was Michael Jackson, before Coldplay there was U2....before root beer float donuts and maple bacon bars, there were Real Donuts.  Not to say the course of donut history hasn't taken a turn for the delicious or creative, but sometimes it's good to remember the original.  A stroll through this little shop across the street from the University Medical Center, one does not need to crank their DeLorean flux capacitor to 1.21 gigawatts to go back in time to taste how donuts were made back in the day since the folks here have been making them the same way every day without infusing pop rocks into their custard or sprinkling green tea powder or ruining a perfect slice of bacon on top of their donuts.  These are the donuts that sat atop Starsky and Hutch's dashboard or within the nuclear power plant control room of Homer Simpson.  
Old school donuts done correctly and beyond reasonably priced.  Not the subtle sweet/locally sourced ingredients/brioche dough, modern donuts that are all the rage, but the sinfully sweet unabashedly artificial variety that melts in your mouth due to the embarrassingly high sugar content  made fresh every morning perfect for dunking into a cup of cheap drip coffee.   Highlights are the airy french crullers, the impossibly crispy fritters (the blueberry variety is exceptional), as well as old favorites like the sour cream donut, buttermilk bar, and the enigmatic inverted cinnamon roll which contains a stroke/streak of genius/devil's food cake.  The folks behind the counter are extremely friendly and they open at the crack of dawn so you know they take great pride in starting every local Las Vegan's day off on the right foot.  Grab a dozen for your coworkers and you will be the most beloved person in the office.  It's comforting to know some things are not meant to change, so be sure to support this local gem.










Maybe it depends on what you get.  I tried the blueberry fritter and tasted very crispy, like burnt.  So luckily I also got the inverted cinnamon roll type of donut and that was superb.   Very soft and chewy, sweet and cinnamon-y.  The donuts are priced right and the guy was super nice at the counter.  I can see people being fabulous and getting some for their coworkers.










The first thing you'll notice when you walk in are the two glass cases full of beautifully decorated old-school donuts. To be fair, that's probably all you'll pay attention to at any donut shop, but the variety here is pretty extensive.
Regular and "inverted" cinnamon rolls (they kind of resemble brains), classic and cake donuts a plenty, sprinkle- and frosting-topped versions for purists, and "fancies" like maple bars (no bacon here!), buttermilk bars (a surprise hit!), giant bear claws, and eclairs. Anything with fruit is generally really well done here, too.
I'm not even really much of a donut fan, but this place gets an extra star for not pulling that cash-only BS that other places do. Also, they're open til 6PM!










These are straight up delicious donuts. None of that fancy crap, just the good stuff. It's a hole in the wall establishment and you'd miss it if you weren't specifically looking for it. The price is good, nothing outrageous. 
The cake donuts are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I just got the blueberry muffin cake donut and it rocked my world. Seriously. 
The service is amazing every time. The guy (I don't know his name, I feel like a jerk about that) even recommended a great band (Portugal the Man).










Awesome donut joint.  It has an old school feel to it. We saw it on the way to an errand we were running and decided to double back and get a few donuts.  They have 2 employees there and they are super friendly.  If you check in here you get a free donut code.  My phone died right after I showed it to her and snapped a few photos but the lady there still gave me the free donut.  It seems that this restaurant has been here for awhile.  It has a well worn out look to it but the donuts are crazy delicious.  They have this donut called an Alaskan donut that is about as big as your head.  I opted for the much smaller donuts...An apple critter...Chocolate on Chocolate, and a Blueberry Fritter. Check it out if your on that side of town.










I.HAVE.NEVER.HAD.A.BETTER.DONUT
This place is amazing! Seriously the best donut shop in the state. You can custom order giant donuts (Texas & Alaska sizes). You will not be disappointed. My children are addicted to this place. We all are.










the donuts that you like that is your favorite just call before hand you'll love tonya's cakes she has a killer skill in making cakes of all kinds its awsome she made my daughters birthday cake and it was so beautiful ill up date with a photo of the cake later thanks. love your donuts keep up the good work!










The best donut shop in Las Vegas. The staff is very friendly and inviting. Fresh donuts every day and great size for the price.










Once you find it, worth the trip.  Love the doughnuts, coffee's wonderful too.  Picked up a dozen when I was leaving town.  Will be back next time.










Welcome to donut delight. If you are attending a brunch, office party, or you just want to surprise someone, you can pile a tray full of colored glazed and sprinkled airy donuts to serve. There are too may treats for me to list, but the rainbow array caught my attention. Thank you Michelle for attentive service.
      Thank you BLVDS Magazine, your voice was heard on Facebook and Twitter posts; we stopped in because of you. Stop in and mention Yelp! Freebie for patrons who write reviews.
      Sorry friends who are in search of gluten-free and vegan options, selections are not here.










When I heard they had blueberry fritters I had to go and drive 15-20 to get there good fritter a little small but really good and they had a large selection of other donuts. Also they sell a huge variety box of day old donuts for $5... Would stop again if I'm in the area










There are few times in life that you can walk into A donut shop and think I am glad they're here!!










Nice little shop across from UMC in Vegas. Always a stop when we are in town. Good selection and friendly people. Good coffee too!










love them
love the fresh doughnuts and the ppl there is really nice, and they have amazing huge doughnuts










Best apple fritters in Vegas! Great staff too.










Great donuts.










These guys have excellent coffee and the donuts are outstanding.










Really loved this donut place. And you can get day-olds. A whole box for $5.00! Excellent donuts too!










Great donuts, great service, and great price. Nice little slice of heaven in the mess of Vegas!










Awesome place. I like the mom and pop feel. Also they have a jalapeno and ham and cheese croissant that is my favorite.










First time and omg! Its like the donuts are made with love! Its a must have! They even have a donut as big as your face!!










All of their donuts are very fresh and taste amazing, and our favorite is the apple fritter that is the size of your head! For the past few months, however, their apple fritters have declined in quality, and contain only a few tiny pieces of apple, about the size of a fingernail. We have brought it to their attention, but no changes have been made.
