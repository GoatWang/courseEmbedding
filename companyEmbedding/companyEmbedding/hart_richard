    See all 4 reviews2.0 out of 5 starsDisappointingByChristina Paigeon April 3, 2014Format: Audio CD|Verified PurchaseThe songs themselves are worthwhile, but these recordings seem to have been transcribed with only half the frequency allotment, and some of the choices of recording stars leaves a lot to be desired: there are much better versions out there! Look for the Ella Fitzgerald Sings Rogers and Hart instead - now THAT'S a recording!0Comment|

Testimonials
Nice product.  Easy to use!
Searched on the web and decided to take a chance with getting something to do HART on my PC instead of having to lug around a HART communicator.  We are a Systems Integrator that performs field commissioning all over the world.  My main expertise is PLC programming and field commissioning.  I have to lug around cables, tools, laptops, etc. and the DevCom2000 software and HART modem work out well for me when I do checks from devices back to the PLC.  Since traveling with tools and equipment by airline is a hassle these days, this system has filled a big void without requiring additional baggage.
Your service is very good and your ability to make the customer feel like they are important goes beyond most of the vendors that I deal with.
A lot of the devices I check out are not in easily accessible areas on the skid.  That makes the HART Bluetooth modem especially appealing.  I can climb up to the device, connect it up and it enables me to keep my computer on the ground and not in awkward positions.  Since my laptop is my livelihood, keeping it safe, sound, and secure is very important.
Used every day since purchase.  Very useful!
The system has been one of the best field service aids that I have purchased.  Previously we had to share HART communicators and we only had two.  There are six people in our organization that do the majority of field work, so we were priority shipping the communicators all over the country.  The DevCom2000 software and HART modem bring the system price to the level where everyone in a field service organization can have one.  Great product, great support!
My company has several of the systems now and they become a HOT item when going out to the field.  It has saved us many hours of checkout/startup time.
I want to thank ProComSol because the factory support I have received has been outstanding.  This is one of the things that I like to tell everyone when showing the system because good factory support is becoming harder to obtain.  Keep up the good work!

Product Description▼▲
There is an increasing distance between Theology and Biblical Studies, a trend that is both troubling and methodologically problematic. Recognizing this problem, St. Andrews University began the St. Andrew's Conference on Scripture and Theology and brought together leading scholars to address the issue. For their second conference, St. Andrew's chose to focus on the Epistle to the Hebrews as an intersection of "Old Testament's cultic theology, Hellenistic ideas, and Christian thinking." The selection proved excellent, and the result was this combined effort of Biblical Scholars and Theologians to dialogue about their differences and face the major issues separating the two fields Contributors Include Richard Bauckham, Trevor Hart, Richard B. Hayes, Bruce L. McCormack, I. Howard Marshall, John Polkinghorne, Daniel J. Treier, and John Webster.

Publisher Description▼▲
The letter to the Hebrews reflects the convergence of the Old Testaments cultic theology, Hellenistic ideas, and early Christian thinking. The contributors to this volume take an unusual approach, considering this fascinating epistle in dialogue with contemporary theological reflection. The essays address a number of key issues that arise from a theological discussion of the text, including the person and nature of the Son, his high priestly work, cosmology, the epistles theology of Scripture, supersessionism, and the nature of faith.
