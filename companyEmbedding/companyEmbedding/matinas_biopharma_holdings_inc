Overview
Growing antimicrobial resistance is a global, public health threat. Health organizations around the world have sounded the alarm and are calling for action. In fact, one recent analysis of this impending epidemic has indicated that drug resistant infections, often called “superbugs” will kill an extra ten (10) million people a year worldwide – more than currently die from cancer – by 2050 unless action is taken. This same analysis projected associated costs to spiral to over 100 trillion dollars. The combination of these multidrug resistant infections, coupled with the to-date unavoidable toxicity of many available drugs, has rendered many current therapies obsolete.
Matinas BioPharma, founded in 2012, is a publicly traded, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company whose mission is to transform the way potent medicines are delivered and administered in order to provide physicians and patients with more tolerable, safer, effective and powerful therapeutic options in the battle against these superbugs. Using its proprietary, lipid-crystal, nanoparticle delivery technology, Matinas BioPharma is able to provide three critical and unique benefits: (1) oral administration and bioavailability of medicines which today are only able to be delivered intravenously, (2) multi-organ protection from otherwise highly toxic compounds in a stable, solid particle, (3) targeted delivery directly to sites of infection and/or inflammation, with the potential to achieve rapid tissue penetration, days ahead of what is available with injected drugs. Each of these benefits has been repeatedly demonstrated in a robust preclinical data package.
This disruptive, potentially game-changing technology, seals treatment drug in a soy-based lipid bilayer sheet, which rolls into a spiral structure called a “cochleate” with no internal aqueous space. The end product is a stable (can be boiled in detergent), solid nanoparticle. Once swallowed, the cochleate passes naturally through the walls of the intestinal tract. After being absorbed, scavenger immune cells that ingest foreign particles, such as macrophages, engulf the cochleate. Once engulfed by the macrophage, the cochleate enters the cytoplasm, an environment of low-calcium concentration inside the cell. The cochleates have been designed to unroll in intracellular low-calcium environments and purposefully release the drug on the inside of the macrophage, protecting the body from the toxic drug. In infected individuals, macrophages then follow a signal-molecule trail through the lymphatic vessels directly to the site of infection and deliver the drug precisely where it is needed.
The Company’s lead drug candidates are being developed in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health’s (NIH’s) National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which have been an integral part of all preclinical and clinical work conducted to date and provide independent scientific validation of the potential for this platform. MAT2203, an orally-administered, encochleated formulation of amphotericin B, is set to commence a Phase 2a study, funded and led by the NIAID, in patients with refractory mucocutaneous candidiasis in 2015, with data expected in 2016. Also in 2015, Matinas BioPharma plans to file an investigational new drug application (IND) for MAT2501, an encochleated formulation of amikacin, a broad spectrum aminoglycoside antibiotic used to treat gram negative bacterial infections.
On top of the improved clinical profile made possible by this technology, in assessing the unique opportunity of Matinas BioPharma one must also consider the associated health economic impact as a result of delivering potent medicines using cochleates. With the potential of successfully transitioning the standard of care from the IV-administration of drugs to orally available medications (something that has proved quite challenging to many anti-infective companies), on top of improved safety and efficacy, there are enormous savings to be achieved through reduced hospital stays and the reduction or elimination of the need for frequent blood tests. The improvement in the quality of life for patients, many of whom are immuno-compromised and require long term care, by providing the availability of oral drug therapy in the comfort of one’s home is another reason why Matinas BioPhama has the potential to have a transformational impact on the future of drug delivery for numerous medicines.
Beyond these lead clinical programs, promising preclinical and Phase I data, combined with the broad applicability of this delivery platform, indicates potential success in reformulating many drugs to take advantage of the oral bioavailability, improved safety and targeted delivery made possible using cochleates. Work has being conducted with anti-virals (ability to attack reservoirs), anti-inflammatories (no lesions in preclinical animal studies) and vaccines (significant improvement on traditional flu vaccines) and the Company has the potential eradication of diseases like HIV, tuberculosis and other infectious diseases in its sights. Unlike many binary biotech product plays, there seems to be no shortage of “what’s next” when considering downstream applications and products utilizing Matinas BioPharma’s proprietary cochleate technology.

Matinas BioPharma Holdings, Inc. Reports Topline Data from Phase 2 Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy Study of MAT2203 in Women with Moderate to Severe Vulvovaginal Candidiasis
Jun 26 17
Matinas BioPharma Holdings, Inc. reported topline data from its Phase 2 safety, tolerability and efficacy study of MAT2203 in women with moderate to severe vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC). The Phase 2 study achieved its primary endpoint in demonstrating MAT2203 is safe and well tolerated. However, both the clinical and mycological responses for MAT2203 did not meet the Company’s expectations and were below that of fluconazole, the guideline recommended therapy for the treatment of VVC. This completed proof-of-concept Phase 2 study of MAT2203 was a multi-center, randomized trial with the primary objective to evaluate the safety of two orally administered doses (200 mg and 400 mg) of MAT2203 compared to 150 mg of fluconazole in 137 women in the safety population. Secondary efficacy objectives were to assess the clinical cure rate and the mycological eradication rate of oral CAMB at the test of cure visit (Day 12) compared with fluconazole in 79 women with confirmed vulvovaginal candidiasis at baseline in the modified intent to treat population, and tertiary objectives were to assess pharmacokinetics (PK) of CAMB after 5 days of oral administration. There were no serious adverse events reported in the study and the majority of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were mild in severity and unrelated to study drug. Drug-related TEAEs of orally-delivered encochleated amphotericin B should be evaluated in the context of the side effects of IV-administered unencochleated amphotericin B, which is well known for its severe and potentially lethal side effects. Drug-related TEAEs occurred in only 20% of 200 mg patients and 18% of 400 mg patients. The most frequently occurring drug-related TEAEs in the MAT2203 groups were gastrointestinal and mild in nature. Drug-related TEAEs occurred in 2% of patients on fluconazole. Efficacy endpoints included evaluation of clinical and mycological response. Clinical response was evaluated using a composite scoring system that compared signs and symptoms of VVC from baseline to test of cure (Day 12). Signs and symptoms included itching, burning, irritation, erythema, edema, or excoriation. MAT2203 demonstrated a clinical cure in 52% of patients at 200 mg/day and 55% of patients at 400 mg/day, compared to 75% of patients on fluconazole. In the mycology outcome, 36% of patients in the 200 mg arm and 32% in the 400 mg arm experienced eradication, compared to 84% of patients in the fluconazole arm. In the composite clinical cure score of signs and symptoms at Day 12, MAT2203 demonstrated an 81% improvement in clinical symptoms at 200 mg/day, 80% improvement at 400 mg/day, compared to 94% improvement in clinical symptoms for the patients on fluconazole. The company will be receiving additional data from the study over the next few months and intends to continue to evaluate such data from this study as it becomes available, including data on pharmacokinetics, and will provide guidance on details and timing of additional development plans for MAT2203 during the third quarter of 2017.
