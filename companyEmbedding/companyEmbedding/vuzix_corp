Vuzix: Heavy Stock Promotion, Ongoing SEC Inquiry, Stagnant IP, Overhyped CES Awards And Ugly Financials - Vuzix Corp (NASDAQ:VUZI) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Vuzix: Heavy Stock Promotion, Ongoing SEC Inquiry, Stagnant IP, Overhyped CES Awards And Ugly FinancialsMay. 9.17 | About: Vuzix Corp (VUZI) The GeoTeam Long/short equity, growth at reasonable price, value, arbitrageGeoInvesting, LLCSummaryVuzix Corporation is a promoted stock with a history of ugly financials including negative cash flow, negative margins and a consistent reliance on equity sales to fund its business.The company admits in its 10-K that it has had an ongoing informal SEC inquiry related to its financials since May of 2016.CES awards that the company consistently touts are awarded to hundreds of conference participants and appear to have minimal requirements for qualification.Vuzix appears to have not updated its iPhone/Android apps since 2015, and the full launch of its M300 product, supposedly in "full production" in Q1, has yet to commence.Dilutive equity raises are likely needed to continue to fund operations, which will put continued short-term pressure on shares of VUZI. 

 Contributed by FG Alpha Management for GeoInvesting, LLC Introduction There is little doubt that the augmented reality and virtual reality space is going to be a fast-growing market over the next decade. However, we feel that Vuzix (NASDAQ:VUZI) investors may have their heads in the optimism clouds, as the reality of VUZI's performance and credibility of management may not match the potential of the sector. In order to survive, we think that Vuzix needs either significant proprietary technology or a vibrant user base with a robust developer ecosystem. The company appears to have neither. The company has told investors that its newest offering, its M300 glasses, has been in "full production" since Q1. The product is still only offered as a "pre-order" on the company's website, and our calls to the company about a launch date led a sales representative to tell us they had "no idea" when the launch would commence. Missed deadlines and lack of wide sales have led analysts covering VUZI like Maxim to reduce or push back their revenue estimates each time they renew coverage of the company. We predict the company will yet again miss revenue estimates when it reports this week. Additionally, several CES awards that the company has heavily promoted over the last few years actually look as though they were simply honorable mentions, a distinction widely sprayed on over 440 products at last year's CES conference. While retail investors remain hopeful about the company's future 5 or 10 years down the road, we want to call focus to an ongoing SEC inquiry that is happening right now. The "informal inquiry," as the company describes it in its 10-K, has been taking place with a focus on the company's financials since May of 2016. Could this inquiry potentially be looking into cash leaving the company to any number of consultants? Finally, the company's financials remain distressed, and there is little doubt that it will need to issue equity to survive at this rate. While the company has been able to raise funding through Chardan - not exactly Goldman Sachs - we expect the quality of future raises to get worse and their corresponding dilutive effects to also get worse for shareholders. Competition & No New Product Development The augmented reality/virtual reality market is as yet undeveloped but already faces a staggering amount of competition. A recent piece by TechCrunch called "The Reality of AR/VR Competition" shows approximately 150 competitors in the market. There's an old adage in venture capital: "What will you do when Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) enters your market?". In the case of Vuzix, what will it do now that Google, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Sony (NYSE:SNE), Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nokia (NYSE:NOK), Garmin (NASDAQ:GRMN), Fitbit (NYSE:FIT), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), BlackBerry (NASDAQ:BBRY), and about 140 others have already entered their market? In the case of Vuzix's up and coming products, its M300 model is supposed to be the next big release from the company. In March, the company gave an outlook on its conference call that indicated the product was in "full production": "The M300 is now in full production, but the end of this we should be at production run rate of 1000 to 1500 per month, we're unparallel [sic] bring up Asian manufacturing lines to lower cost and expand production capacity. The M300 is also on a continual software optimization program where software update being rolled out on a regular basis." It also blamed the poor sales of the company's M100 product on customers ostensibly waiting for the M300 release: "Since we've first introduced the M300 it's the [Indiscernible] in 2016 many customers have been waiting for it and it's been reflected in our lower sales of the M100 during the year." Finally, the company states that the M300 is "rolling off the production line." It claims it wanted to be at a run rate of 1,500 units per month by the end of the first quarter:    "For comparative purposes this same process took over six months to complete for M100. The bottom-line the M300 is now rolling [off the] production line which taken every day and have orders like every coming off the lines with growing demand as we move from VIPs and start turning migration orders. [sic] Finally, we will shortly be opening to the M300 to general customer[s] in the middle market. Production is also running and we expect a consistent run rate of approximately 1,500 units per month at the end of this quarter of only trend of early Q2. With Vuzix enterprise sales team has not sat idle during this early late stage of M300."  It's now Q2 and the M300 is still only available for pre-order on the company's website. 

 In addition, we phoned Vuzix on May 8, 2017, to try and get information as to when pre-orders for the M300 would begin shipping. The sales representative we spoke to told us that they had "no idea" and directed us to fill out an online inquiry form, which we did. We have yet to receive information on a release date for the product. Intellectual Property Stagnation The company claimed on its most recent conference call that its patent portfolio has increased by nine new patents/pending patents: "Finally, over the last year or so Vuzix's patent portfolio have increased with the total amount of nine new patent and patent spending. Let me just wrap up quickly here. 2017 is already proven to be a pivotal year for Vuzix and the entire smart glasses industry. We have B11 focus on the enterprise market as the M300 ramps into production." But when we searched for patents on our own, we reached different conclusions. Based on a search of the USPTO patent application database, it appears the company failed to even file a single patent in 2016. In fact, the most recent patent application is as of September 10, 2015, according to our search. From the latest 10-K, Vuzix's products appear to include little in the way of proprietary hardware technology: "We do not currently own or operate any manufacturing facilities for microdisplays, one of the key components in our products." Furthermore, "we do not manufacture the integrated circuit chip sets, optics, microdisplays, backlights, printed circuit boards or other electronic components which are used in our products." Given that Vuzix's glasses run on outside software as well (Android), the company faces vertical integration challenges on just about every level. We believe that the physical design of the glasses is appealing, but aside from the aesthetic appearance of the device itself, we are left questioning what Vuzix has that could be considered a durable edge. A statement made by Vuzix board member and newly appointed COO Paul Boris seems to acknowledge the lack of sustainable differentiation among device-makers. Outside of his board duties, Boris is GE Corp.'s (NYSE:GE) vice president of manufacturing industries. In an article by IT World Canada in January of this year, Boris described how GE is overseeing pilot programs to test four AR headsets including Vuzix's. As he put it, "the device on some level is a commodity, it's just a mechanism for serving the data in the right context." He further stated "we'll try all of them." Cadaverous Software Ecosystem In the absence of a clear hardware advantage, we looked to the company's software ecosystem. The company states in its recent 10-K, "We are building an eco-system of developers around these smart glasses." We find little evidence to suggest that these efforts have been successful to date. The company apps in the Android and Apple stores show very little activity. The Android store shows 10 ratings and four reviews, as displayed below. Almost comically, one positive review appears to be written by Vuzix CEO Paul Travers himself with the second positive review appearing to be written by Vuzix's manufacturing consultant, Thomas Hasselberg. 

 Among the non-employees of Vuzix, the two reviews were both negative and stated the following: Dahita (November 2016): "Unable to connect to the glasses From a galaxy a3 2016 on Android 6.0, impossible to connect to the glasses, even though the BT connection happened smoothly. Very frustrating as there are no help available." Tradewind Clipper (November 2015): "Doesn't do much Apparently no way to install/update apps or firmware on glasses. Most preinstalled apps on glasses (Skype, Instagram, etc) are unusable. App is totally different from Vuzix documentation." Despite the deficiencies outlined by the above users, the app was last updated on Android on September 22, 2015. It appears that nobody is home. The Apple Store app seems even less active as there are not enough ratings for the Vuzix App to even display the rating. The app was launched in June 2015 and was last updated November of the same year. In order to make significant inroads into AR, Vuzix will need to compete against large companies that already have thriving ecosystems. Given the above, we not only question whether Vuzix will be successful but also whether it is even earnestly attempting to compete. VUZI's Overhyped CES "Awards" One of the key points that lends apparent credence to Vuzix's technology is the validation earned through numerous awards at the CES conference. The Consumer Technology Association is the owner and operator of the CES showcase, an annual event spotlighting innovative consumer technology. Every year at CES, companies enter their products into the Innovation Award contest aiming to win industry recognition. Entries are submitted to 28 award categories and the highest rated product or technology in each category is awarded the "Best of Innovation" title. Vuzix ostensibly performs extremely well at the CES competitions, which it has repeatedly noted in press releases and its SEC filings. Examples include a November 2016 press release by the company announcing "Vuzix Awarded Four CES 2017 Innovation Awards for its Upcoming Blade 3000 Smart Sunglasses." Similarly in November 2015, the company announced "Vuzix Awarded Eight CES 2016 Innovation Awards, Including 'Best of' in Gaming and Virtual Reality for iWear® Wireless Video Headphones." Despite heavily promoting these awards, a closer look shows that for the most part rather than winning the coveted "Best of…" category, Vuzix's products are usually deemed "honorees." According to the CES website, an honoree simply denotes "a product or technology that scores above the threshold set for a specific category." The threshold doesn't seem particularly limiting. According to the contest rules, a product is qualified for entry as an honoree merely by paying entry fees and filling in all the sections of its online entry tool. In 2016 alone, there were approximately 447 total honorees. Vuzix seems to be hyping its "wins" while in most cases it is simply one of hundreds of honorees that are awarded participation trophies for paying the fee and satisfying basic minimum criteria. In one instance when Vuzix actually won the "Best of" designation, it didn't seem able to translate the victory into meaningful product adoption. In January 2016, Vuzix won the "Best of" award in gaming and virtual reality, but despite winning the accolade, the company sold only $395,052 iWear sets that year. Furthermore, per the company 10-K filed December 2016, Vuzix took an inventory write-down on its iWear product citing intense competition and pricing pressures:    "The Company wrote down to net realizable value all of its component and finished goods inventory related to its iWear Video Headphones resulting from the decision in early 2017 to reduce the suggested retail selling price to a price below the cost. The total write down provision totaled $1,124,401…" (Source: 10-K, pgs 31-40)  From the Amazon reviews of the iWear, none of the nine Verified Purchaser reviews rated the product above 2 stars. The product garnered an overall rating of 2.5 stars across its 20 ratings. By Vuzix's account, it appears the product may not have actually been ready for full production despite entering iWear into the CES competition and ultimately winning. From the same filing, we see that Vuzix took a hit on its manufacturing and overhead costs due to a need to rework the iWear manufacturing process mid-year:    "Manufacturing overhead costs rose primarily due to increased salaries and production labor costs of $198,862, with over half related to iWear rework costing." (Source: 10-K, pgs. 31-40)  Part of this award-winning flop might be explained by again examining the rules of the CES competition. The entry and judging process for the competition states that a product sample isn't even required, although judges may ask for one. We're unclear on the value of a contest that issues awards when judges aren't even required to test the very products they are judging. Given the above, we question the company's ability to translate the CES "awards" to actual shareholder value under the best of circumstances. Stock Promoters Pushing VUZI In 2016, Vuzix reported revenue of only $2,127,378, representing a -22.64% drop from the previous year. However, despite a failure to generate meaningful product sales, the company has been very successful at selling its stock via secondary offerings. In 2016, the company raised $21,112,500 through two common stock offerings (Source: 10-K, page 39). The larger of the two offerings was a November 2016 offering for $14,500,000 with Chardan Capital Markets acting as sole placement agent. Chardan happens to be one of two analysts covering Vuzix (with a buy rating in case there was any doubt). We are uninspired by the fact that Vuzix generated almost 10x more cash from stock sales than from revenue, but we also find it predictable given the apparent dedication to stock promotion efforts. Beginning in early 2015, the company appeared in several paid microcap promotional sites including The Tech Stock Report and MicrocapResearch.com. In Vuzix's company profile in The Tech Stock Report, the website acknowledges receiving $246,500 as of March 2017 from two entities (Third Coast Media, LLC and Sunrise Media, LLC). Payment was described as being for the preparation of the profile and other marketing and investor relations services. 

 Third Coast Media, LLC appears to be a Wyoming business registered to Steve Naremore, editor of penny stock website stockcommander.com, and Matthew Watabe, director at website RagingBull.com, which features an array of "millionaire traders and experts." We were unable to find more details on Sunrise Media, LLC which is believed to be a shell entity. Another promotional website, MicrocapResearch, published several articles on Vuzix and acknowledged the receipt of $20,000 from one article and $10,000 for another from an "unrelated third party." We did not perform an exhaustive search of stock promotional websites for more paid material touting Vuzix. 

 

 Beyond external stock promotion efforts, Vuzix has relentlessly promoted token corporate accomplishments via its own press releases. The company issued 80 press releases during 2016 alone, touting numerous appearances at industry trade shows, investor conferences, and sponsorships, among other items. VUZI Remains in Financial Distress For the second year in a row, Vuzix reported weaknesses in disclosure and internal financial controls. Any sign of material weakness is concerning, but we find this to be even more so given how bad Vuzix's financials look as is. Many of Vuzix's key metrics appear as if pulled from a dream sequence in Alice in Wonderland:  In 2016, the company had a gross margin of -54%. In other words, it cost VUZI 54% more to produce the goods than the goods actually sold for. Freight costs accounted for 24% of the cost of sales. Such high freight rates may make sense if shipping steel beams via helicopter but Vuzix is shipping lightweight headsets and glasses that retail for up to $1,000. The company has increased its operating loss with remarkable consistency. Operating losses have increased in each of the past five years, with a five-year CAGR of 34.53%. The company generated 62 cents in sales per every dollar invested in sales and marketing.  The company has not only consistently slowed sales over the past five years, but its products have also become less profitable. Sales have grown at a five-year CAGR of -8% while COGS has grown at a five-year CAGR of 7.05%. Beyond headline figures, the company shows several troubling irregularities: From 2015 to 2016, research & development costs increased over 93%, jumping from $3,595,437 to $6,947,878. Despite the massive surge in R&D, the company failed to even file a single patent in 2016, based on a search of the USPTO patent application database. As noted above, the most recent patent application is as of September 10, 2015, according to our search. Despite the apparent lack of patentable advancements, the justification for this massive increase is described by the company as follows: "The majority of these amounts being spent on outside contractors which assisted in the development work." (Source: VUZI 2016 10-K) We would be interested to learn more about these outside contractors that "assisted" in the R&D and accounted for the majority of the cost increases.  From 2015 to 2016, SG&A also increased over 88%, jumping from $1,798,041 to $3,394,580 (VUZI 10-K pg. 10). This cost spike occurred despite an apparent reduction in headcount. From 2015 to 2016, the company cut its full-time North American staff in "sales and marketing, distribution and customer service" from seven to six. European staff of three contractors remained the same. Vuzix's filings acknowledge that it has a "small" European office, but the address listed on their contact page is the address of their European auditor, King Loose & Co. (See King Loose & Co. contact us page available here. See Vuzix (Europe) Ltd. 2015 Full Accounts available here).  David Lock is the "Director of Operations EMEA Region for Vuzix Europe Ltd. His consulting firm, DRL Associates Ltd. ("DRL"), is located at the same address and is also audited by King Loose & Co. (See CompanyHouse Vuzix (Europe) Limited available here).  King Loose appears to be a very small shop, which may support the control issues identified by Vuzix's auditor.  SEC Conducting Inquiry as Company Sprays Money to "Consultants" The company has also been undergoing an informal inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which it disclosed in 2016. As the company states in its current risk factors disclosures: "On May 24, 2016, we received a letter from the SEC, dated May 19, 2016, notifying us that the SEC is conducting an informal inquiry relating to us, and requesting that we produce certain documents relating to our internal control over financial reporting. We have produced the requested documents and thus far have not received requests for additional information. If, in connection with this informal inquiry, the SEC determines to take action against us, our financial position could be adversely affected." While we know that the inquiry is related to the company's financial reporting, as that is what it discloses, we are left with little detail after that. Perhaps the company's aggressive use of consultants and third parties to develop its products could be at the center of an investigation like this. In the same filing, Vuzix described the "costly external contractors" in relation to its R&D spend. In a year where Vuzix doesn't appear to have filed for new U.S. patents or updated its software, we can't help but wonder where the money went. Conclusion: VUZI Still Has a Questionable Past and Unproven Future We strongly believe the AR/VR market could grow substantially over the next five years. We have already seen small successes in augmented reality like the launch of Pokémon Go. VUZI may also attempt to continue controlling the narrative despite poor financial numbers by touting future potential products and possible partnerships. While we believe these statements will ultimately prove to be meaningless unless the company can produce in its financials, investors should make themselves aware of the risks associated with companies that are pumped through paid promotions that supplement rosy-sounding narratives. But the reality of the situation should be clear: with this sector-wide inflection point for AR/VR still in the future, we believe investors need to address the harsh realities of VUZI's business as it operates today. With a heavily crowded field and the lack of a clear intellectual property advantage, we believe VUZI isn't anywhere as close to catching and riding this wave as investors think. Management has incessantly touted the potential of its products, but a history littered with manufacturing delays and murky sales guidance doesn't inspire confidence. While some could argue that financials don't matter at this stage in the game because VUZI is a development company, that doesn't change the fact that it is likely going to need more cash injections from stock sales in order to continue its business. As we already stated, these stock sales will likely become progressively more dilutive as the company's needs accelerate. Going long VUZI is a bet that the company is going to introduce something groundbreaking and cash generative against all odds before the dilutive effects of financing wear the value of shares too thin. This is a bet that we just don't think is worth it.

History[edit]
Paul Travers founded Vuzix in 1997 in Rochester, NY, under the name Interactive Imaging Systems, purchasing the assets of the Virtual Reality company Forte Technologies. The company started with products for the military and US Defense, but then developed consumer virtual reality systems and was the first company to deliver consumer virtual reality. The Company has offices in New York, Japan, and the UK and is the current market leader for video eyewear[citation needed]. Forte was a pioneer during the mid-1990s developing immersive head mounted displays[7] for Virtual Reality and video gaming applications.
In 1997, the Company was hired as a subcontractor to Raytheon, designing display electronics for a digital night vision weapon sight.
In 2000, the VFX1 Headgear was featured in a commemorative US Postal Service stamp collection celebrating the 1990s.[8] The VFX1 was replaced by a higher resolution system dubbed the VFX3D in mid 2000.[9]
In 2001, Vuzix launched its first consumer electronics product, the iCOM personal internet browser.[10]
In 2005, Vuzix provided a custom high resolution handheld display system that created the 3D imagery for Hitachi's pavilion at the 2005 World’s Fair in Aichi, Japan. The Hitachi Pavilion allowed users to interact with computer generated models and dioramas of endangered species in a Mixed Reality ride.[11]
In 2005, the company changed its name to Icuiti. Later that year, Icuiti launched its first product designed specifically for consumers, the V920 Video Eyewear.[12]
Also in 2005, Icuiti was awarded its first military R&D contract to develop a high resolution monocular display device for viewing tactical maps and video. This development would lead to the Tac-Eye product line, which began rate production in 2009 and is currently used in many major military programs including the Battlefield Air Operations kit.[13]
A re-branding in 2007 changed the Company's name from Icuiti to Vuzix.[14]
In 2010, Vuzix introduced the first production model see-through augmented reality glasses the STAR 1200.[15] It was released in August 2011 for $4999.[16]
Vuzix is currently[when?] under contract with DARPA to design and build a next generation heads up display for military ground personnel.[17] The DARPA PCAS program is large R&D program with the goal of allowing the joint tactical air controller the ability to rapidly engage multiple, moving and simultaneous targets within his area of responsibility.[18]
In January 2013, at CES, Vuzix Corporation demonstrated working models of its new M100 Smart Glasses, the official press event of CES. Rated as one of the five top gadgets expected at CES by CNBC[19] and given the CES Innovations award,[20] the Vuzix Smart Glasses M100, expected to ship in second half of 2013, will enable wearers to access data and content from an iOS or Android smart phone from the cloud and ‘hands free’. The m100 was officially released in December 2013 for $1000: double the original announced price.[21]
In January 2015, Intel invested $25 million in the company, gaining 30% ownership of the company. [22]
Innovations[edit]
Video Eyeware[edit]

Vuzix created the first video eyewear to support stereoscopic 3D for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.[23]

Augmented Reality Eyeware[edit]




Vuzix AR3000 AugmentedReality SmartGlasses - The most advanced AR tech. on 2017[citation needed]



Vuzix created the first commercially produced pass-through augmented reality headset, the Wrap 920AR. The Wrap 920AR has two VGA video displays and two cameras that work together to provide the user a view of the world which blends real world inputs and computer generated data.[24]
During the Consumer Electronic Show in 2011, Vuzix announced the Raptyr. The Raptyr is a see-through augmented reality display prototype that will be the first consumer product of its kind when it reaches the market in 2011[needs update].[25]
The STAR 1200 is the first See-Through Augmented Reality display to be mass-produced and was scheduled to be released in August 2011.[needs update][26]
The Vuzix Smart Glasses M100 are scheduled for commercial release in late 2013. SWEET![27] Vuzix describes the M100 as the world’s first, commercially available, hands free display and cloud connected communications system. The Vuzix M100 contains a virtual display with integrated camera and powerful processing engine, running the Android OS . Users will be able to connect wirelessly to their smartphone (Android-based) or other compatible devices. The M100 is also powerful enough to connect directly to the Internet, run applications and games itself. When connected to a smartphone, users will be able to engage with existing and future applications such texts, video, email, mapping, and audio. As a hands free accessory with integrated camera/display functionality, Vuzi smart glasses will let users answer the phone with a visual address book and enable applications from text messaging and email to visual navigation (via an integrated GPS and head tracker) along with more advanced features like video recording. The interactive head tracking and integrated HD camera, combined with applications on the M100 and a smartphone linked to the Cloud, empower smartphone based augmented reality applications.[28][29]

Paul Travers founded Vuzix in 1997 in Rochester, NY, under the name Interactive Imaging Systems, purchasing the assets of the Virtual Reality company Forte Technologies. The company started with products for the military and US Defense, but then developed consumer virtual reality systems and was the first company to deliver consumer virtual reality. The Company has offices in New York, Japan, and the UK and is the current market leader for video eyewear[citation needed]. Forte was a pioneer during the mid-1990s developing immersive head mounted displays[7] for Virtual Reality and video gaming applications.
In 1997, the Company was hired as a subcontractor to Raytheon, designing display electronics for a digital night vision weapon sight.
In 2000, the VFX1 Headgear was featured in a commemorative US Postal Service stamp collection celebrating the 1990s.[8] The VFX1 was replaced by a higher resolution system dubbed the VFX3D in mid 2000.[9]
In 2001, Vuzix launched its first consumer electronics product, the iCOM personal internet browser.[10]
In 2005, Vuzix provided a custom high resolution handheld display system that created the 3D imagery for Hitachi's pavilion at the 2005 World’s Fair in Aichi, Japan. The Hitachi Pavilion allowed users to interact with computer generated models and dioramas of endangered species in a Mixed Reality ride.[11]
In 2005, the company changed its name to Icuiti. Later that year, Icuiti launched its first product designed specifically for consumers, the V920 Video Eyewear.[12]
Also in 2005, Icuiti was awarded its first military R&D contract to develop a high resolution monocular display device for viewing tactical maps and video. This development would lead to the Tac-Eye product line, which began rate production in 2009 and is currently used in many major military programs including the Battlefield Air Operations kit.[13]
A re-branding in 2007 changed the Company's name from Icuiti to Vuzix.[14]
In 2010, Vuzix introduced the first production model see-through augmented reality glasses the STAR 1200.[15] It was released in August 2011 for $4999.[16]
Vuzix is currently[when?] under contract with DARPA to design and build a next generation heads up display for military ground personnel.[17] The DARPA PCAS program is large R&D program with the goal of allowing the joint tactical air controller the ability to rapidly engage multiple, moving and simultaneous targets within his area of responsibility.[18]
In January 2013, at CES, Vuzix Corporation demonstrated working models of its new M100 Smart Glasses, the official press event of CES. Rated as one of the five top gadgets expected at CES by CNBC[19] and given the CES Innovations award,[20] the Vuzix Smart Glasses M100, expected to ship in second half of 2013, will enable wearers to access data and content from an iOS or Android smart phone from the cloud and ‘hands free’. The m100 was officially released in December 2013 for $1000: double the original announced price.[21]
In January 2015, Intel invested $25 million in the company, gaining 30% ownership of the company. [22]

Vuzix created the first video eyewear to support stereoscopic 3D for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.[23]

Augmented Reality Eyeware[edit]




Vuzix AR3000 AugmentedReality SmartGlasses - The most advanced AR tech. on 2017[citation needed]



Vuzix created the first commercially produced pass-through augmented reality headset, the Wrap 920AR. The Wrap 920AR has two VGA video displays and two cameras that work together to provide the user a view of the world which blends real world inputs and computer generated data.[24]
During the Consumer Electronic Show in 2011, Vuzix announced the Raptyr. The Raptyr is a see-through augmented reality display prototype that will be the first consumer product of its kind when it reaches the market in 2011[needs update].[25]
The STAR 1200 is the first See-Through Augmented Reality display to be mass-produced and was scheduled to be released in August 2011.[needs update][26]
The Vuzix Smart Glasses M100 are scheduled for commercial release in late 2013. SWEET![27] Vuzix describes the M100 as the world’s first, commercially available, hands free display and cloud connected communications system. The Vuzix M100 contains a virtual display with integrated camera and powerful processing engine, running the Android OS . Users will be able to connect wirelessly to their smartphone (Android-based) or other compatible devices. The M100 is also powerful enough to connect directly to the Internet, run applications and games itself. When connected to a smartphone, users will be able to engage with existing and future applications such texts, video, email, mapping, and audio. As a hands free accessory with integrated camera/display functionality, Vuzi smart glasses will let users answer the phone with a visual address book and enable applications from text messaging and email to visual navigation (via an integrated GPS and head tracker) along with more advanced features like video recording. The interactive head tracking and integrated HD camera, combined with applications on the M100 and a smartphone linked to the Cloud, empower smartphone based augmented reality applications.[28][29]

History[edit]
Paul Travers founded Vuzix in 1997 in Rochester, NY, under the name Interactive Imaging Systems, purchasing the assets of the Virtual Reality company Forte Technologies. The company started with products for the military and US Defense, but then developed consumer virtual reality systems and was the first company to deliver consumer virtual reality. The Company has offices in New York, Japan, and the UK and is the current market leader for video eyewear[citation needed]. Forte was a pioneer during the mid-1990s developing immersive head mounted displays[7] for Virtual Reality and video gaming applications.
In 1997, the Company was hired as a subcontractor to Raytheon, designing display electronics for a digital night vision weapon sight.
In 2000, the VFX1 Headgear was featured in a commemorative US Postal Service stamp collection celebrating the 1990s.[8] The VFX1 was replaced by a higher resolution system dubbed the VFX3D in mid 2000.[9]
In 2001, Vuzix launched its first consumer electronics product, the iCOM personal internet browser.[10]
In 2005, Vuzix provided a custom high resolution handheld display system that created the 3D imagery for Hitachi's pavilion at the 2005 World’s Fair in Aichi, Japan. The Hitachi Pavilion allowed users to interact with computer generated models and dioramas of endangered species in a Mixed Reality ride.[11]
In 2005, the company changed its name to Icuiti. Later that year, Icuiti launched its first product designed specifically for consumers, the V920 Video Eyewear.[12]
Also in 2005, Icuiti was awarded its first military R&D contract to develop a high resolution monocular display device for viewing tactical maps and video. This development would lead to the Tac-Eye product line, which began rate production in 2009 and is currently used in many major military programs including the Battlefield Air Operations kit.[13]
A re-branding in 2007 changed the Company's name from Icuiti to Vuzix.[14]
In 2010, Vuzix introduced the first production model see-through augmented reality glasses the STAR 1200.[15] It was released in August 2011 for $4999.[16]
Vuzix is currently[when?] under contract with DARPA to design and build a next generation heads up display for military ground personnel.[17] The DARPA PCAS program is large R&D program with the goal of allowing the joint tactical air controller the ability to rapidly engage multiple, moving and simultaneous targets within his area of responsibility.[18]
In January 2013, at CES, Vuzix Corporation demonstrated working models of its new M100 Smart Glasses, the official press event of CES. Rated as one of the five top gadgets expected at CES by CNBC[19] and given the CES Innovations award,[20] the Vuzix Smart Glasses M100, expected to ship in second half of 2013, will enable wearers to access data and content from an iOS or Android smart phone from the cloud and ‘hands free’. The m100 was officially released in December 2013 for $1000: double the original announced price.[21]
In January 2015, Intel invested $25 million in the company, gaining 30% ownership of the company. [22]
Innovations[edit]
Video Eyeware[edit]

Vuzix created the first video eyewear to support stereoscopic 3D for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.[23]

Augmented Reality Eyeware[edit]




Vuzix AR3000 AugmentedReality SmartGlasses - The most advanced AR tech. on 2017[citation needed]



Vuzix created the first commercially produced pass-through augmented reality headset, the Wrap 920AR. The Wrap 920AR has two VGA video displays and two cameras that work together to provide the user a view of the world which blends real world inputs and computer generated data.[24]
During the Consumer Electronic Show in 2011, Vuzix announced the Raptyr. The Raptyr is a see-through augmented reality display prototype that will be the first consumer product of its kind when it reaches the market in 2011[needs update].[25]
The STAR 1200 is the first See-Through Augmented Reality display to be mass-produced and was scheduled to be released in August 2011.[needs update][26]
The Vuzix Smart Glasses M100 are scheduled for commercial release in late 2013. SWEET![27] Vuzix describes the M100 as the world’s first, commercially available, hands free display and cloud connected communications system. The Vuzix M100 contains a virtual display with integrated camera and powerful processing engine, running the Android OS . Users will be able to connect wirelessly to their smartphone (Android-based) or other compatible devices. The M100 is also powerful enough to connect directly to the Internet, run applications and games itself. When connected to a smartphone, users will be able to engage with existing and future applications such texts, video, email, mapping, and audio. As a hands free accessory with integrated camera/display functionality, Vuzi smart glasses will let users answer the phone with a visual address book and enable applications from text messaging and email to visual navigation (via an integrated GPS and head tracker) along with more advanced features like video recording. The interactive head tracking and integrated HD camera, combined with applications on the M100 and a smartphone linked to the Cloud, empower smartphone based augmented reality applications.[28][29]

History[edit]
Paul Travers founded Vuzix in 1997 in Rochester, NY, under the name Interactive Imaging Systems, purchasing the assets of the Virtual Reality company Forte Technologies. The company started with products for the military and US Defense, but then developed consumer virtual reality systems and was the first company to deliver consumer virtual reality. The Company has offices in New York, Japan, and the UK and is the current market leader for video eyewear[citation needed]. Forte was a pioneer during the mid-1990s developing immersive head mounted displays[7] for Virtual Reality and video gaming applications.
In 1997, the Company was hired as a subcontractor to Raytheon, designing display electronics for a digital night vision weapon sight.
In 2000, the VFX1 Headgear was featured in a commemorative US Postal Service stamp collection celebrating the 1990s.[8] The VFX1 was replaced by a higher resolution system dubbed the VFX3D in mid 2000.[9]
In 2001, Vuzix launched its first consumer electronics product, the iCOM personal internet browser.[10]
In 2005, Vuzix provided a custom high resolution handheld display system that created the 3D imagery for Hitachi's pavilion at the 2005 World’s Fair in Aichi, Japan. The Hitachi Pavilion allowed users to interact with computer generated models and dioramas of endangered species in a Mixed Reality ride.[11]
In 2005, the company changed its name to Icuiti. Later that year, Icuiti launched its first product designed specifically for consumers, the V920 Video Eyewear.[12]
Also in 2005, Icuiti was awarded its first military R&D contract to develop a high resolution monocular display device for viewing tactical maps and video. This development would lead to the Tac-Eye product line, which began rate production in 2009 and is currently used in many major military programs including the Battlefield Air Operations kit.[13]
A re-branding in 2007 changed the Company's name from Icuiti to Vuzix.[14]
In 2010, Vuzix introduced the first production model see-through augmented reality glasses the STAR 1200.[15] It was released in August 2011 for $4999.[16]
Vuzix is currently[when?] under contract with DARPA to design and build a next generation heads up display for military ground personnel.[17] The DARPA PCAS program is large R&D program with the goal of allowing the joint tactical air controller the ability to rapidly engage multiple, moving and simultaneous targets within his area of responsibility.[18]
In January 2013, at CES, Vuzix Corporation demonstrated working models of its new M100 Smart Glasses, the official press event of CES. Rated as one of the five top gadgets expected at CES by CNBC[19] and given the CES Innovations award,[20] the Vuzix Smart Glasses M100, expected to ship in second half of 2013, will enable wearers to access data and content from an iOS or Android smart phone from the cloud and ‘hands free’. The m100 was officially released in December 2013 for $1000: double the original announced price.[21]
In January 2015, Intel invested $25 million in the company, gaining 30% ownership of the company. [22]
Innovations[edit]
Video Eyeware[edit]

Vuzix created the first video eyewear to support stereoscopic 3D for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.[23]

Augmented Reality Eyeware[edit]




Vuzix AR3000 AugmentedReality SmartGlasses - The most advanced AR tech. on 2017[citation needed]



Vuzix created the first commercially produced pass-through augmented reality headset, the Wrap 920AR. The Wrap 920AR has two VGA video displays and two cameras that work together to provide the user a view of the world which blends real world inputs and computer generated data.[24]
During the Consumer Electronic Show in 2011, Vuzix announced the Raptyr. The Raptyr is a see-through augmented reality display prototype that will be the first consumer product of its kind when it reaches the market in 2011[needs update].[25]
The STAR 1200 is the first See-Through Augmented Reality display to be mass-produced and was scheduled to be released in August 2011.[needs update][26]
The Vuzix Smart Glasses M100 are scheduled for commercial release in late 2013. SWEET![27] Vuzix describes the M100 as the world’s first, commercially available, hands free display and cloud connected communications system. The Vuzix M100 contains a virtual display with integrated camera and powerful processing engine, running the Android OS . Users will be able to connect wirelessly to their smartphone (Android-based) or other compatible devices. The M100 is also powerful enough to connect directly to the Internet, run applications and games itself. When connected to a smartphone, users will be able to engage with existing and future applications such texts, video, email, mapping, and audio. As a hands free accessory with integrated camera/display functionality, Vuzi smart glasses will let users answer the phone with a visual address book and enable applications from text messaging and email to visual navigation (via an integrated GPS and head tracker) along with more advanced features like video recording. The interactive head tracking and integrated HD camera, combined with applications on the M100 and a smartphone linked to the Cloud, empower smartphone based augmented reality applications.[28][29]

Our wearable display products are known commercially as Smart Glasses, Video iWear (Eyewear), head mounted displays or HMDs. These products are capable of providing virtual, large high-resolution screens and yet they can fit in a user's pocket or purse and can be viewed practically anywhere, anytime.

Key technologies include ultra-thin waveguide optics co-developed under license with Nokia, which will form the basis for many of our future products.

The M300 software now shipping with production units incorporates new features including advanced voice control, updated sound support with speech recognition from Sensory and improved barcode scanning.  Over the air software updates are also now fully enabled along with advanced power and thermal management features not available in previous versions.  The M300 Smart Glasses, after having gone through over 6 months of in-market testing with customers and developers, is now officially in volume production at our sub-contractor's California plant. In addition to software improvements, we have made a series of mechanical and electrical improvements including tougher ruggedization performance; improved thermal management and more robust cabling for greater in field reliability. Finally, we continue to grow, the line of accessories for the M300 with available battery packs from GO-Puck, mounting options for 3rd party safety glasses and hardhat support becoming available within the current quarter.With all these advances, in this quarter we have begun ramping production of the M300 Smart Glasses towards targeted production yields and rates. We are expecting to build and ship at least 1,000 of the M300 units to customers in the current fiscal quarter. Existing paid back-orders and the fulfilment of our prior M300 migration pack sales are being shipped first along with units to our VIP partners who have been pre-allocated units for immediate deployment to their existing client base. The needs of our VIP partners are strong and they are expected to consume the majority of this quarter's initial output. With the ramping of production we will also be able to start focusing on the needs of our general Enterprise customers addressing the significant in-bound requests we have for the M300. We are also experiencing a continuing and growing demand for our M100 Smart Glasses as customers expand their deployments.  As existing customer purchase orders will consume all of our current M100 inventories, our M100 Smart Glasses are now on back-order and as a result the Company has decided to move forward with another production build of the M100 this spring.With the continued demand for the M100 and the ramping of the M300's in production, we are expecting to achieve record revenues from our Smart Glasses product lines during the current fiscal quarter. It is now clear as we rollout our M300 Smart Glasses in volume that our M100 and M300 offer distinct and differentiated features as well as pricing that will allow the two models to co-exist in the marketplace longer than originally contemplated.     "CES 2017 proved to be a great opportunity to begin 2017 for Vuzix and showcase our new industry leading wearable display technology.  We were the talk of the show with many attendees and journalists offering that our product line was the most comprehensive and clearly leading in the wearable display industry.  Our business is near a major inflection point thanks to our new products and technologies and we are focusing on execution to ride our growing wave of momentum in 2017," said Paul J. Travers, President and Chief Executive Officer of Vuzix. "Interest and demand indications for our Blade 3000 Smart Sunglasses has been near overwhelming from our existing and new customers as well as from potential OEM partners. Accordingly, Vuzix intends to re-focus some its resources to bringing a version to market as early as practical."Read MoreAbout Vuzix CorporationVuzix is a leading supplier of Smart-Glasses, Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) technologies and products for the consumer and enterprise markets.

Smart Glasses
Vuzix M100 Smart Glasses are an Android-based wearable computer, enhanced with a wearable monocular display and onboard processor, recording features and wireless connectivity capabilities designed for a wide variety of enterprise applications. Its pre-installed apps can be used to take still pictures, record and playback video, track timed events, link to your phone and more. The real strength of the M100 comes from its compatibility with thousands of existing Android apps, and easy access to developer resources which enable the creation of custom apps to suit virtually any need. Ergonomic yet rugged, the M100 is currently in large scale productive use in fields such as telemedicine, remote assistance, warehousing, utilities, manufacturing, and more.

Video Display

A 16:9 WQVGA full color display floats in or near your line of sight, providing an image visually equivalent to a 4 in. smartphone screen held at a typical 14 in. distance. Display arm adjustments, display tilt, and left or right eye mounting options enable you to position the M100 for maximum effectiveness and viewing comfort. A convenient display shield maximizes visibility in bright outdoor sunlight and the small display size minimizes the visual obstruction of the environment around you. Vuzix M100 Smart Glasses incorporate a compact White Pearl™ display module and ultra-low power driver IC, both provided by the Kopin Corporation.



Wearable Mounting

Which is your dominant eye? A variety of frame mounting options are available, including safety glasses and sleek frames; both allow for left or right eye use. The image in the M100 display rotates automatically to accommodate either mounting option.



Controls

How do you control apps and features with a wearable hands-free device? With Vuzix M100 Smart Glasses, we provide a variety of methods of control. Three control buttons on the M100 provide basic interface navigation capability, and the optional iOS and Android partner application allows for touch-based input and convenient access to settings. In addition, we support a suite of native and custom voice commands for navigation and application control, as well as gesture controls.



Camera

The integrated camera on Vuzix M100 Smart Glasses is capable of capturing 5 megapixel still images and 1080p high-definition video. Video and image captures can be stored directly on the M100’s memory (expandable up to 32GB) or streamed live over the internet. Where privacy may be a concern, a video recording indicator light on the face of the M100 will inform those around you that video is being recorded, in accordance with accepted standards for video cameras around the world.



Audio

Vuzix M100 Smart Glasses contain a single on-ear speaker, and dual microphones with noise cancellation for voice controls and recording. Included with every pair are ear cups which help channel the sound from the speaker into your ear, enhancing comfort and your ability to hear the audio in louder environments.



Runtime

Battery life, or “runtime”, is an important consideration, especially in mission critical applications. Depending on usage, battery life of Vuzix M100 Smart Glasses can range from 1-3 hours. Included with every M100 is an external battery pack, which can extend runtime up to 5-6 hours when connected to the USB micro-B power connector.

A partner application for both Android and iOS smartphones, enabling remote control of the M100 and access to its settings
All new user interface including:

Local integrated Nuance voice control (no need for being connected to the web)
Integrated gesture recognition
New standardized button controls

Support for Over-the-Air (OTA) updates for M100 applications and OS updates
Bluetooth 3.0 connectivity for additional peripheral support, including audio, external GPS antennae, etc.
Significantly improved power management for longer battery life and better thermal performance
Updated SDK for our developer community






Completely redesigned user interface:


The M100 Application Launcher is built on a carousel-style “desktop” as opposed to a conventional 2d array of applications. For standalone operation, this enhances the user experience by making it easier to navigate your installed applications and enables more natural controls using voice, gesture and button inputs.
Our SG Manager application connects to the M100 via Bluetooth and is optimized to work with the M100’s carousel Application Launcher. By mirroring the M100 carousel on the SG Manager, it is easy to control and navigate your installed applications.


 





M100 Applications
Vuzix M100 Smart Glasses ship with a number of native applications designed specifically to work well in the Smart Glasses form factor, and are capable of running most Android applications. In addition, Vuzix offers an optional mobile companion application available for download.

Smart Glasses Manager 

The Smart Glasses Manager companion application is designed to enhance the user experience of the M100 by enabling additional input methods and access to applications and settings. The application is available for both iOS and Android in smartphone and tablet versions, and connects to the M100 over Bluetooth. 



The Manager and the Carousel


The Smart Glasses Manager synchronizes its own carousel Application Launcher with the carousel on the M100, making navigation of applications easy from either device. As shown to the right [display carousel image to right of this paragraph], every application that appears on the M100 carousel menu will be mirrored on the Smart Glasses Manager carousel.







Running M100 Native Apps


When running a native application on the M100 alongside a paired smartphone or tablet running the SG Manager application, the SG Manager will display controls specific to the native application. For example, when running the Camera application, the SG Manager application will display controls to take a picture or record a video from the M100. 







Running Legacy Applications



                                                        The M100 is capable of supporting most legacy Android applications, however most Android applications have been designed with a smartphone or tablet form factor in mind. As such, they require touch input to navigate the interface and control the application. As seen to the right, when paired with a smartphone or tablet running the SG Manager application, SG Manager will provide a touchpad to control a cursor on the M100 display as well as a keyboard to make controlling these applications possible.

Selecting a contact name will open it and allow calling, email, SMS, etc. through the Partner Device using the M100 as a hands free headset. The M100 will also show the contacts on screen. 








Gallery



The Gallery application is a native M100 Application that manages the videos and pictures taken on the M100 Smart Glasses and allows them to be moved/copied to the partner device.

Scanner



The Scanner allows you to read QR Codes and Bar Code using your Smart Glasses camera. It has been integrated into certain features of the M100 to make it easy, for example, to open websites, log onto WiFi networks, shop and research products on the web, and the likes. Simply run the Scanner application and point the M100 to a QR Code. You can scan in both landscape and portrait modes, and can even scan mirrored images! 
To create your own QR or Bar codes we recommend using the QR Droid site located at www.qrdroid.com . the m100’s scanner is based on the qr droid software.
Press Scanner icon on the partner device to start the Scanner on the M100. The scanner will start up on the M100 and immediately go into scan mode. Once a bar code is scanned (either 2D or 1D) the ability to search the web to identify what was scanned for more details and or to shop is then presented. The Scanner can also be used to automatically connect to WiFi hot spots or go to websites or follow QR Codes on marketing and advertisement etc.

LogoTradeshow DIsplayPackagingMedia KitPublic RelationsAdvertisementsProduct SheetsWebsiteNextPhase rebrands and positions Icuiti as the leader in the video eyewear marketplace in North America and internationally - increasing sales by 50% and website traffic by 400%
Challenge
				Icuiti Corporation needed to change its name due to a dispute with a
 large US corporation. At the same time, it was launching new additions 
to its consumer video eyewear line in North America, Europe and Japan. 
The lead time from renaming the company to the corporate and product 
launch was only 45 days.
				
Action
				Once the new name, Vuzix Corporation, was selected, NextPhase 
created a complete marketing communications program including a 
corporate identity, stationery, updated packaging, new marketing 
brochures, presentation folder, slide deck and website. This was 
followed by a print and online advertising campaign for its newest 
product, the VR920 - a ‘virtual reality’ eyewear targeted to gamers. We 
have since been involved in supporting various events and initiatives 
throughout the year including CES, RetailVision, Fancon and the launch 
of new consumer and medical eyewear products. Essentially, NextPhase has
 become Vuzix’s external marketing department over the past three years.
 
				
Results
				Vuzix consumer sales doubled from 2007 to 2008, while overall sales 
have increased 50%. And consumer sales are projected to double again for
 2009. Website hits have quadrupled from 60,000 to 240,000. According to
 Paul Travers, Vuzix’s president, “Despite the tight timeframe, 
NextPhase managed to pull through on every deadline and orchestrated an 
amazingly successful launch. They have been an incredible resource for 
us.”
