PART
I

  

ITEM 1.
 BUSINESS

 

Business
Development

 

Bear Lake
Recreation, Inc. was organized under the laws of the State of
Nevada on October 22, 1998, with an initial authorized capital
consisting of 50,000,000 shares of $0.001 par value common voting
stock.

 

Our
initial operations consisted of renting snowmobiles and all-terrain
vehicles (ATV’s). We had also planned on organizing
snowmobile rental packages, which would have included lodging at
Ideal Beach Resort at Bear Lake, Utah. On or about October 1999, we
abandoned the snowmobile, ATV and lodging plans. Our lack of
success was attributed to entering the marketplace comprising this
endeavor during a year that was the beginning of a drought cycle,
resulting in below average snowfall and competitive growth from one
to three self-promoting developmental properties. Our operations
ceased due to depleted capital resources resulting from offering
vacation packages lacking in demand.

 

On June
27, 2000, we entered into a licensing agreement with AlCORP, an
Oregon limited liability company, to purchase the right to
manufacture, use, market and sell the “NetCaddy,” a
backpack style bag used to transport fishing gear. By the end of
the first quarter of 2002, we had also abandoned the “Net
Caddy” operations. We realized only minimal sales through our
e-commerce site and 800 number infomercial advertisements.
Additionally, due to the exhaustion of our capital resources, we
could no longer maintain the infrastructure required for sales
promotion while faced with limited consumer demand.

All
computations herein take into account a one for three and one-half
(1 for 3.5) share reverse split of our outstanding shares of common
stock that was effective on or about October 23, 2006, and which is
discussed below under this heading.

 

The
following is a summary of material business developments since our
inception:

 

·

285,734
shares of our common stock were issued to our principal founder at
inception for services valued at $1,000.

·

Completed
the offer and sale of approximately 12,868 shares of our common
stock to public investors under Rule 504 of Regulation D of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) in
March, 1999, for aggregate consideration of $45,000.

·

Completed
the offer and sale of approximately 94,066 shares of our common
stock to persons who were “accredited investors” under
Rule 506 of Regulation D in July and August, 2000, for aggregate
consideration of $41,150.

·

Issued our
three directors and executive officers a total of approximately
428,574 (approximately 142,857 shares each, to Todd L. Albiston,
Wayne Bassham and Derrick Albiston) for services valued at an
aggregate consideration of $1,500 in September, 2004.

·

Issued the
same three directors and executive officers a total of
approximately 428,574 (approximately 142,857 shares each) for
services valued at an aggregate consideration of $1,500 in
September, 2005.

·

Our common
stock was granted quotations on the OTC Bulletin Board
(“OTCBB”) on or about December 31, 2005, and we were
assigned a trading symbol of “BLKR.”

·

On March
1, 2006, we amended Section 2.11 of our Bylaws to allow for written
action to be taken without a meeting by less than all of the
stockholders.

·

Amended
and restated our Articles of Incorporation, effective in April,
2006.  The Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation were
unanimously adopted by our Board of Directors, who then also
constituted our majority stockholders, collectively beneficially
owning approximately 857,143 shares of our common stock or
approximately 68.6% of our outstanding voting securities, as Board
members and stockholders. No other votes were required or necessary
to adopt the amendments to our Articles of Incorporation, and none
were solicited.  The following is a summary of the material
changes to our Articles of Incorporation: (i) five million
(5,000,000) shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.001
per share were authorized; (ii) the minimum number of our directors
was reduced to one; (iii) our Board of Directors was authorized to
change our name in certain circumstances, without stockholder
approval; and (iv) our Board of Directors was authorized to effect
recapitalizations in the form of forward or reverse splits in
certain circumstances, without a stockholder approval.  We
filed a Definitive Information Statement with the SEC on March 20,
2006.

·

We
effected a one for three and one-half (1 for 3.5) share reverse
split of our outstanding shares of common stock that was effective
on or about October 23, 2006, and our then OTCBB trading symbol was
changed to “BLKE” on or about October 23, 2006.
 All share and per share amounts have been retroactively
adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split.

 

We have
had no material business operations since 2002, when we began the
search for the acquisition of assets, property or business that may
benefit us and our stockholders.

 

Description
of Business

 

We are
currently seeking and investigating potential assets, property or
businesses to acquire.  We have had no material business
operations for about eight years.  Our plan of operation for
the next 12 months is to: (i) consider guidelines of industries in
which we may have an interest; (ii) adopt a business plan regarding
engaging in the business of any selected industry; and (iii) to
commence such operations through funding and/or the acquisition of
a “going concern” engaged in any industry selected.
 We are unable to predict the time as to when and if we may
actually participate in any specific business endeavor, and will be
unable to do so until we determine any particular industry in which
we may engage.

 

We are
not currently engaged in any substantive business activity except
the search for potential assets, property or businesses to acquire,
and we have no current plans to engage in any other activity in the
foreseeable future unless and until we complete any such
acquisition.  In our present form, we are deemed to be a
vehicle to acquire or merge with a business or company.  We do
not intend to restrict our search for business opportunities to any
particular business or industry, and the areas in which we will
seek out business opportunities or acquisitions, reorganizations or
mergers may include all lawful businesses.  We recognize that
the number of suitable potential business ventures that may be
available to us may be extremely limited, and may be restricted as
to acquisitions, reorganizations and mergers with businesses or
entities that desire to avoid what such entities may deem to be the
adverse factors related to an initial public offering
(“IPO”) as a method of going public.  The most
prevalent of these factors include substantial time requirements,
legal and accounting costs, the inability to obtain an underwriter
who is willing to publicly offer and sell shares, the lack of or
the inability to obtain the required financial statements for such
an undertaking, state limitations on the amount of




3

 

  

dilution
to public investors in comparison to the stockholders of any such
entities, along with other conditions or requirements imposed by
various federal and state securities laws, rules and regulations
and federal and state agencies that implement such laws, rules and
regulations.

 

Amendments
to Form 8-K by the SEC regarding shell companies and transactions
with shell companies that require the filing of all information
about an acquired company that would have been required to have
been filed had any such company filed a Form 10 with the SEC, along
with required audited, interim and proforma financial statements,
within four business days of the closing of any such transaction
(Item 5.01(a)(8) of Form 8-K); and the recent amendments to Rule
144 adopted by the SEC that were effective on February 15, 2008,
limit the resale of most securities of shell companies until one
year after the filing of such information, may eliminate many of
the perceived advantages of these types of going public
transactions.  These types of transactions are customarily
referred to as “reverse” reorganizations or mergers in
which the acquired company’s shareholders become controlling
shareholders in the acquiring company and the acquiring company
becomes the successor to the business operations of the acquired
company.  Regulations governing shell companies also deny the
use of Form S-8 for the registration of securities and limit the
use of this Form to a reorganized “shell company” until
the expiration of 60 days from when any such entity is no longer
considered to be a shell company.  This prohibition could
further restrict opportunities for us to acquire companies that may
already have stock option plans in place that cover numerous
employees.  In such instances, there may be no exemption from
registration for the issuance of securities in any business
combination to these employees, thereby necessitating the filing of
a registration statement with the SEC to complete any such
reorganization, and incurring the time and expense that are
normally avoided by reverse reorganizations or mergers.
 

 

Recent
amendments to Rule 144, adopted by the SEC and effective on
February 15, 2008, codify the SEC’s prior position limiting
the tradability of certain securities of shell companies, including
those issued by us in any acquisition, reorganization or merger,
and further limit the tradability of additional securities of shell
companies; these proposals will further restrict the availability
of opportunities for us to acquire any business or enterprise that
desire to utilize us as a means of going public.  

 

Any of
these types of transactions, regardless of the particular prospect,
would require us to issue a substantial number of shares of our
common stock that could amount to as much as 95% of our outstanding
voting securities following the completion of any such transaction;
accordingly, investments in any such private enterprise, if
available, would be much more favorable than any investment in
us.

 

Management
intends to consider a number of factors prior to making any
decision as to whether to participate in any specific business
endeavor, none of which may be determinative or provide any
assurance of success.  These may include, but will not be
limited to, as applicable, an analysis of the quality of the
particular business or entity’s management and personnel; the
anticipated acceptability of any new products or marketing concepts
that any such business or company may have; the merits of any such
business’ or company’s technological changes; the
present financial condition, projected growth potential and
available technical, financial and managerial resources of any such
business or company; working capital, history of operations and
future prospects; the nature of present and expected competition;
the quality and experience of any such business’ or
company’s management services and the depth of management;
the business’ or the company’s potential for further
research, development or exploration; risk factors specifically
related to the business’ or company’s operations; the
potential for growth, expansion and profit of the business or
 company; the perceived public recognition or acceptance of
the company’s or the business’ products, services,
trademarks and name identification; and numerous other factors
which are difficult, if not impossible, to properly or accurately
quantify or analyze, let alone describe or identify, without
referring to specific objective criteria of an identified business
or company.

 

Regardless,
the results of operations of any specific entity may not
necessarily be indicative of what may occur in the future, by
reason of changing market strategies, plant or product expansion,
changes in product emphasis, future management personnel and
changes in innumerable other factors.  Further, in the case of
a new business venture or one that is in a research and development
mode, the risks will be substantial, and there will be no objective
criteria to examine the effectiveness or the abilities of its
management or its business objectives.  Also, a firm market
for its products or services may yet need to be established, and
with no past track record, the profitability of any such entity
will be unproven and cannot be predicted with any
certainty.

 

Management
will attempt to meet personally with management and key personnel
of any entity providing any potential business opportunity afforded
to us, visit and inspect material facilities, obtain independent
analysis or verification of information provided and gathered,
check references of management and key personnel and conduct other
reasonably prudent measures calculated to ensure a reasonably
thorough review of any particular business opportunity; however,
due to time constraints of management, these activities may be
limited.  

 

We are
unable to predict the time as to when and if we may actually
participate in any specific business endeavor.  We anticipate
that proposed business ventures will be made available to us
through personal contacts of directors, executive




4

 

  

officers
and principal stockholders, professional advisors, broker dealers
in securities, venture capital personnel and others who may present
unsolicited proposals.  In certain cases, we may agree to pay
a finder’s fee or to otherwise compensate the persons who
submit a potential business endeavor in which we eventually
participate. Such persons may include our directors, executive
officers and beneficial owners of our securities or their
affiliates. In this event, such fees may become a factor in
negotiations regarding any potential venture and, accordingly, may
present a conflict of interest for such individuals.
 Management does not presently intend to acquire or merge with
any business enterprise in which any member has a prior ownership
interest.

 

Our
directors and executive officers have not used any particular
consultants, advisors or finders on a regular basis.

 

Although
we currently have no plans to do so, depending on the nature and
extent of services rendered, we may compensate members of
management in the future for services that they may perform for us.
 Because we currently have extremely limited resources, and we
are unlikely to have any significant resources until we have
determined a business or enterprise to engage in or have completed
a reorganization, merger or acquisition, management expects that
any such compensation would take the form of an issuance of shares
of our common stock to these persons; this would have the effect of
further diluting the holdings of our other stockholders.
 There are presently no preliminary agreements or
understandings between us and members of our management respecting
such compensation.  Any shares issued to members of our
management would be required to be resold under an effective
registration statement filed with the SEC or 12 months after we
file the “Form 10 Information” about the acquired
company with the SEC as now required by Form 8-K. These provisions
could further inhibit our ability to complete the acquisition of
any business or complete any merger or reorganization with another
entity, where finders or others who may be subject to these resale
limitations refuse to provide us with any introductions or to close
any such transactions unless they are paid requested fees in cash
or unless we agree to file a registration statement with the SEC
that includes any shares that are to be issued to them, at no cost
to them.  These expenses could limit potential acquisition
candidates, especially those in need of cash resources, and could
affect the number of shares that our stockholders retain following
any such transaction, by reason of the increased
expense.

 

Substantial
fees are also often paid in connection with the completion of all
types of acquisitions, reorganizations or mergers, ranging from a
small amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars or more. These
fees are usually divided among promoters or founders or finders,
after deduction of legal, accounting and other related expenses,
and it is not unusual for a portion of these fees to be paid to
members of management or to principal stockholders as consideration
for their agreement to retire a portion of their shares of our
common stock that are owned by them or to provide an
indemnification for all of our prior liabilities.  Management
may actively negotiate or otherwise consent to the purchase of all
or any portion of their shares of common stock as a condition to,
or in connection with, a proposed reorganization, merger or
acquisition.  It is not anticipated that any such opportunity
will be afforded to other stockholders or that such other
stockholders will be afforded the opportunity to approve or consent
to any particular stock buy-out transaction.  In the event
that any such fees are paid or shares are purchased, these
requirements may become a factor in negotiations regarding any
potential acquisition or merger by us and, accordingly, may also
present a conflict of interest for such individuals. We have no
definitive arrangements or understandings respecting any of these
types of fees or opportunities.  Any of these types of fees
that are paid in shares of our common stock will also be subject to
the resale limitations embodied in the recent amendments to Rule
144.

 

Our
directors and executive officers are evaluating potential merger
targets, but as of the date of this report no definitive plans for
a merger are in force.

Competitive

Management
believes that there are literally thousands of shell companies
engaged in endeavors similar to those engaged in by us; many of
these companies have substantial current assets and cash reserves.
 Competitors also include thousands of other publicly-held
companies whose business operations have proven unsuccessful, and
whose only viable business

opportunity
is that of providing a publicly-held vehicle through which a
private entity may have access to the public capital markets via a
reverse reorganization or merger.  There is no reasonable way
to predict our competitive position or that of any other entity in
these endeavors; however, we, having limited assets and no cash
reserves, will no doubt be at a competitive disadvantage in
competing with entities that have significant cash resources and
have recent operating histories when compared with the complete
lack of any substantive operations by us since 2002.

Need for
any Governmental Approval of Principal Products or
Services

 

Because
we currently have no business operations and produce no products
nor provide any services, we are not presently subject to any
governmental regulation in this regard.  However, in the event
that we complete a reorganization, merger or acquisition
transaction with an entity that is engaged in business operations
or provides products or services, we will become subject to all
governmental approval requirements to which the reorganized, merged
or acquired entity is subject or may become subject.

 

Effect of
Existing or Probable Governmental Regulations on the
Business

 

Emerging
Growth Company

 

We may be
deemed to be an “emerging growth company” as defined in
the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or “JOBS
Act.”  As long as we remain an emerging growth company,
we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting
requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are
not “emerging growth companies,” including, but not
limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor
attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;
reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in
our periodic reports and proxy statements; and exemptions from the
requirements of holding an annual nonbinding advisory vote on
executive compensation and seeking nonbinding stockholder approval
of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We may
take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer
an “emerging growth company.”

 

Under the
JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or
revised accounting standards until such time as those standards
apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to
avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting
standards and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or
revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not
emerging growth companies.

 

We will
remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five
years, although we would cease to be an “emerging growth
company” prior to such time if we have more than $1 billion
in annual revenue, more than $700 million in market value of our
common stock is held by non- “affiliates” or we issue
more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year
period.

 

Smaller
Reporting Company

 

We are
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange
Act”), and we are subject to the disclosure requirements of
Regulation S-K of the SEC, as a “smaller reporting
company.”   That designation will relieve us of
some of the informational requirements of Regulation
S-K.

 

Sarbanes-Oxley
Act

 

We are
also subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  The
Sarbanes-Oxley Act created a strong and independent accounting
oversight board to oversee the conduct of auditors of public
companies and strengthens auditor independence.  It also
requires steps to enhance the direct responsibility of senior
members of management for financial reporting and for the quality
of financial disclosures made by public companies; establishes
clear statutory rules to limit, 




6

 

  

and to
expose to public view, possible conflicts of interest affecting
securities analysts; creates guidelines for audit committee
members’ appointment, compensation and oversight of the work
of public companies’ auditors; management assessment of our
internal controls; prohibits certain insider trading during pension
fund blackout periods; requires companies and auditors to evaluate
internal controls and procedures; and establishes a federal crime
of securities fraud, among other provisions. Compliance with the
requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act will substantially increase
our legal and accounting costs.

 

Exchange
Act Reporting Requirements

 

Section
14(a) of the Exchange Act requires all companies with securities
registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act to comply
with the rules and regulations of the SEC regarding proxy
solicitations, as outlined in Regulation 14A. Matters submitted to
our stockholders at a special or annual meeting thereof or pursuant
to a written consent will require us to provide our stockholders
with the information outlined in Schedules 14A or 14C of Regulation
14; preliminary copies of this information must be submitted to the
SEC at least 10 days prior to the date that definitive copies of
this information are forwarded to our stockholders.

 

We are
required to file annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports
on Form 10-Q with the Securities Exchange Commission on a regular
basis, and are required to timely disclose certain material events
(e.g., changes in corporate control; acquisitions or dispositions
of a significant amount of assets other than in the ordinary course
of business; and bankruptcy) in a Current Report on Form
8-K.

 

Research
and Development Costs During the Last Two Fiscal
Years

 

None; not
applicable.

 

Cost and
Effects of Compliance with Environmental Laws

 

We do not
believe that our current or intended business operations are
subject to any material environmental laws, rules or regulations
that would have an adverse material effect on our business
operations or financial condition or result in a material
compliance cost; however, we will become subject to all such
governmental requirements to which the reorganized, merged or
acquired entity is subject or may become subject.

 

Number of
Total Employees and Number of Full-Time Employees

 

None.

 

Additional
Information

 

You may
read and copy any materials that we file with the SEC at the
SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E.,
Washington, D.C. 20549.  You may also find all of the reports
or registration statements that we have previously filed
electronically with the SEC at its Internet site at
www.sec.gov.  Please call the SEC at 1-202-551-8090 for
further information on this or other Public Reference Rooms.
 Our SEC reports and registration statements are also
available from commercial document retrieval services, such as CCH
Washington Service Bureau, whose telephone number is
1-800-955-0219.

 


PART
II

  

ITEM 1A.
 RISK FACTORS

 

Not
required for smaller reporting companies.

 

ITEM 2:
 PROPERTIES 

 

We have
no assets, property or business; our principal executive office
address and telephone number are the business office address and
telephone number of a stockholder, Duane S. Jenson, and are
currently provided at no cost. Because we have had no business, our
activities have been limited to keeping itself in good standing in
the State of Nevada and timely voluntarily filing our reports with
the SEC. These activities have consumed an insignificant amount of
management’s time; accordingly, the costs to Mr. Jenson
of providing the use of his office and telephone have been
minimal.

ITEM 3:
 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

 

We are
not a party to any pending legal proceeding. To the knowledge of
our management, no federal, state or local governmental agency is
presently contemplating any proceeding against us. No director,
executive officer or affiliate of ours or owner of record or
beneficially of more than 5% of our common stock is a party adverse
to us or has a material interest adverse to us in any
proceeding. 

  

ITEM 4:
 MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES

 

Not
applicable.

  

ITEM 5:
 MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED
STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY
SECURITIES

 

Market
Information

 

Our
common stock was listed on the OTC Pink Sheets on December 13,
2005, under the symbol “BLKR”.  On October 23,
2006, in conjunction with the reverse split, FINRA changed our
trading symbol, “BLKR,” to “BLKE.”
 There is currently no established trading market for shares
of our common stock.  Management does not expect any viable
market to develop in our common stock unless and until we complete
an acquisition or merger. In any event, no assurance can be given
that any market for our common stock will develop or be
maintained.

 

For any
market that develops for our common stock, the sale of
“restricted securities” (common stock) pursuant to Rule
144 of the SEC by members of management or any other person to whom
any such securities may be issued in the future may have a
substantial adverse impact on any such public market.  For
information regarding the requirements of resales under Rule 144,
see the heading “Rule 144” below.

 

The
following table sets forth, for the periods indicated over the last
two years, the high and low closing bid quotations, as reported by
the OTCQB, and represents prices between dealers, does not include
retail markups, markdowns or commissions, and may not represent

Holders

 

We
currently have approximately 65 stockholders, not including an
indeterminate number who may hold shares in “street
name.”

 

Dividends

 

We have
not declared any cash dividends with respect to our common stock,
and do not intend to declare dividends in the foreseeable future.
Our future dividend policy cannot be ascertained with any
certainty, and if and until we complete any acquisition,
reorganization or merger, no such policy will be formulated. There
are no material restrictions limiting, or that are likely to limit,
our ability to pay dividends on our securities.

Shell
Companies

 

The
following is an excerpt from Rule 144(i) regarding resales of
securities of shell companies:

 

“(i)
Unavailability to securities of issuers with no or nominal
operations and no or nominal non-cash assets

.

 

(1)

This
section is not available for the resale of securities initially
issued by an issuer defined below:

 

(i)
  
An issuer,
other than a business combination related shell company, as defined
in §230.405, or an asset-backed issuer, as defined in Item
1101(b) of Regulation AB (§229.1101(b) of this chapter), that
has:

 

(A)

No or
nominal operations; and

 

(B)

Either:

 

(1)
  No or nominal assets;

(2)
  Assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents;
or

(3)
  Assets consisting of any amount of cash and cash
equivalents and nominal other assets; or

 

(ii)

An issuer
that has been at any time previously an issuer described in
paragraph (i)(1)(i).

 

(2)

Notwithstanding
paragraph (i)(1), if the issuer of the securities previously had
been an issuer described in paragraph (i)(1)(i) but has ceased to
be an issuer described in paragraph (i)(1)(i); is subject to the
reporting requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act;
has filed all reports and other materials required to be filed by
section 13 or




9

 

  

15(d) of
the Exchange Act, as applicable, during the preceding 12 months (or
for such shorter period that the issue was required to file such
reports and materials), other than Form 8-K reports (§249.308
of this chapter); and has filed current Form 10 Information with
the SEC reflecting its status as an entity that is no longer an
issuer described in paragraph (i)(1)(i), then those securities may
be sold subject to the requirements of this section after one year
has elapsed from the date that the issuer filed Form 10 Information
with the SEC.

 

(3)

The term
Form 10 Information means the information that is required by Form
10 or Form 20-F (§249.220f of this chapter), as applicable to
the issuer of the securities, to register under the Exchange Act
each class of securities being sold under this rule.  The
issuer may provide the Form 10 Information in any filing of the
issuer with the Commission. The Form 10 Information is deemed filed
when the initial filing is made with the
Commission.”

 

With the
exception that securities that were initially issued by an issuer
that was not a shell company, securities of a shell company cannot
be publicly sold under Rule 144 in the absence of compliance with
this subparagraph.

 

Section
4(a)(1) of the Securities Act

 

Since we
are a shell company as defined in subparagraph (i) of Rule 144,
other than shares that were initially issued prior to our becoming
a shell company, our shares of common stock cannot be publicly
resold under Rule 144 until we comply with the requirements
outlined above under the heading “Shell Companies.”
Until those requirements have been satisfied, any resales of our
shares of common stock must be made in compliance with the
provisions of the exemption from registration under the Securities
Act provided in Section 4(a)(1) thereof, applicable to persons
other than “an issuer, underwriter or a dealer.”
 That will require that such shares of common stock be sold in
“routine trading transactions,” which would include
compliance with substantially all of the requirements of Rule 144,
regardless of its availability; and such resales may be limited to
our non-affiliates.

 

Use of
Proceeds of Registered Securities

 

There
were no proceeds received during the fiscal year ended June 30,
2016, from the sale of registered securities.

 

Purchases
of Equity Securities by Us and Affiliated Purchasers

 

None; not
applicable.

  

ITEM 6:
 SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

 

Not
required for smaller reporting companies.

  

ITEM 7:
 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 

When used
in this Annual Report, the words “may,”
“will,” “expect,” “anticipate,”
“continue,” “estimate,”
“project,” “intend,” and similar
expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements
within the meaning of Section 27a of the Securities Act and Section
21e of the Exchange Act regarding events, conditions, and financial
trends that may affect our future plans of operations, business
strategy, operating results, and financial position.  Persons
reviewing this Annual Report are cautioned that any forward-looking
statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject
to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially
from those included within the forward-looking statements as a
result of various factors.  Such factors are discussed further
below under “Trends and Uncertainties,” and also
include general economic factors and conditions that may directly
or indirectly impact our financial condition or results of
operations.

 

Plan of
Operation

 

Our plan
of operation for the next 12 months is to: (i) consider guidelines
of industries in which we may have an interest; (ii) adopt a
business plan regarding engaging in the business of any selected
industry; and (iii) to commence such operations through funding
and/or the acquisition of a “going concern” engaged in
any industry selected.

 

During
the next 12 months, our only foreseeable cash requirements will
relate to maintaining our good standing or the payment of expenses
associated with legal fees, accounting fees and reviewing or
investigating any potential business venture, which may be advanced
by management or principal stockholders as loans to us. Because we
have not determined any business or industry in which our
operations will be commenced, and we have not identified any
prospective venture as of the date of this Annual Report, it is
impossible to predict the amount of any such loan. Any such loan
will be on terms no less favorable to us than would be available
from a commercial

PART

ITEM
1.  BUSINESS

 

Business
Development

 

Bear Lake
Recreation, Inc. was organized under the laws of the State of
Nevada on October 22, 1998, with an initial authorized capital
consisting of 50,000,000 shares of $0.001 par value common voting
stock.

 

 

 

2

  

 

 

Our
initial operations consisted of renting snowmobiles and all-terrain
vehicles (ATV’s). We had also planned on organizing
snowmobile rental packages, which would have included lodging at
Ideal Beach Resort at Bear Lake, Utah. On or about October 1999, we
abandoned the snowmobile, ATV and lodging plans. Our lack of
success was attributed to entering the marketplace comprising this
endeavor during a year that was the beginning of a drought cycle,
resulting in below average snowfall and competitive growth from one
to three self-promoting developmental properties. Our operations
ceased due to depleted capital resources resulting from offering
vacation packages lacking in demand.

 

On June
27, 2000, we entered into a licensing agreement with AlCORP, an
Oregon limited liability company, to purchase the right to
manufacture, use, market and sell the “NetCaddy,” a
backpack style bag used to transport fishing gear. By the end of
the first quarter of 2002, we had also abandoned the “Net
Caddy” operations. We realized only minimal sales through our
e-commerce site and 800 number infomercial advertisements.
Additionally, due to the exhaustion of our capital resources, we
could no longer maintain the infrastructure required for sales
promotion while faced with limited consumer demand.

 

All
computations herein take into account a one for three and one-half
(1 for 3.5) share reverse split of our outstanding shares of common
stock that was effective on or about October 23, 2006, and which is
discussed below under this heading.

 

The
following is a summary of material business developments since our
inception:

 




·  



285,714
shares of our common stock were issued to our principal founder at
inception for services valued at $1,000.





·  



Completed
the offer and sale of approximately 12,857 shares of our common
stock to public investors under Rule 504 of Regulation D of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) in
March, 1999, for aggregate consideration of $45,000.





·  



Completed
the offer and sale of approximately 94,057 shares of our common
stock to persons who were “accredited investors” under
Rule 506 of Regulation D in May, 2000, for aggregate consideration
of $41,150.





·  



Issued our
three directors and executive officers a total of approximately
428,571 (approximately 142,857 shares each, to Todd L. Albiston,
Wayne Bassham and Derrick Albiston) for services valued an
aggregate consideration of $1,500 in September, 2004.





·  



Issued the
same three directors and executive officers a total of
approximately 428,571 (approximately 142,857 shares each) for
services valued at an aggregate consideration of $1,500 in
September, 2005.





·  



Our common
stock was granted quotations on the OTC Bulletin Board
(“OTCBB”) on or about December 31, 2005, and we were
assigned a trading symbol of “BLKR.”





·  



On March
1, 2006, we amended Section 2.11 of our Bylaws to allow for written
action to be taken without a meeting by less than all of the
stockholders.





·  



Amended
and restated our Articles of Incorporation, effective in April,
2006.  The Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation
were unanimously adopted by our Board of Directors, who then also
constituted our majority stockholders, collectively beneficially
owning approximately 857,143 shares of our common stock or
approximately 68.6% of our outstanding voting securities, as Board
members and stockholders. No other votes were required or necessary
to adopt the amendments to our Articles of Incorporation, and none
were solicited.  The following is a summary of the
material changes to our Articles of Incorporation: (i) five million
(5,000,000) shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.001
per share were authorized; (ii) the minimum number of our directors
was reduced to one; (iii) our Board of Directors was authorized to
change our name in certain circumstances, without stockholder
approval; and (iv) our Board of Directors was authorized to effect
recapitalizations in the form of forward or reverse splits in
certain circumstances, without a stockholder
approval.  Our Definitive Information Statement, which
was filed with the SEC on March 20, 2006, is filed as an Exhibit to
this Annual Report.  See Part IV, Item 15.





·  



We
effected a one for three and one-half (1 for 3.5) share reverse
split of our outstanding shares of common stock that was effective
on or about October 23, 2006, and our OTCBB trading symbol was
changed to “BLKE” on or about October 23,
2006.

·  



On October
16, 2006, we announced the execution of a Letter of Intent to
acquire Vault Technologies, Inc., an Alberta technology
corporation, which was subsequently amended on November 17 and
December 19, 2006, and which expired on January 31,
2007.




 

We have
had no material business operations since 2002. We have begun the
search for the acquisition of assets, property or business that may
benefit us and our stockholders.

 

Description
of Business

 

We are
currently seeking and investigating potential assets, property or
businesses to acquire.  We have had no material business
operations for about eight years.  Our plan of operation
for the next 12 months is to: (i) consider guidelines of industries
in which we may have an interest; (ii) adopt a business plan
regarding engaging in the business of any selected industry; and
(iii) to commence such operations through funding and/or the
acquisition of a “going concern” engaged in any
industry selected.  We are unable to predict the time as
to when and if we may actually participate in any specific business
endeavor, and will be unable to do so until we determine any
particular industry in which we may engage.

 

We are not
currently engaged in any substantive business activity except the
search for potential assets, property or businesses to acquire, and
we have no current plans to engage in any other activity in the
foreseeable future unless and until we complete any such
acquisition.  In our present form, we are deemed to be a
vehicle to acquire or merge with a business or
company.  We do not intend to restrict our search for
business opportunities to any particular business or industry, and
the areas in which we will seek out business opportunities or
acquisitions, reorganizations or mergers may include all lawful
businesses.  We recognize that the number of suitable
potential business ventures that may be available to us may be
extremely limited, and may be restricted as to acquisitions,
reorganizations and mergers with businesses or entities that desire
to avoid what such entities may deem to be the adverse factors
related to an initial public offering (“IPO”) as a
method of going public.  The most prevalent of these
factors include substantial time requirements, legal and accounting
costs, the inability to obtain an underwriter who is willing to
publicly offer and sell shares, the lack of or the inability to
obtain the required financial statements for such an undertaking,
state limitations on the amount of dilution to public investors in
comparison to the stockholders of any such entities, along with
other conditions or requirements imposed by various federal and
state securities laws, rules and regulations and federal and state
agencies that implement such laws, rules and
regulations.

 

Amendments
to Form 8-K by the SEC regarding shell companies and transactions
with shell companies that require the filing of all information
about an acquired company that would have been required to have
been filed had any such company filed a Form 10 with the SEC, along
with required audited, interim and proforma financial statements,
within four business days of the closing of any such transaction
(Item 5.01(a)(8) of Form 8-K); and the recent amendments to Rule
144 adopted by the SEC that were effective on February 15, 2008,
limit the resale of most securities of shell companies until one
year after the filing of such information, may eliminate many of
the perceived advantages of these types of going public
transactions.  These types of transactions are
customarily referred to as “reverse” reorganizations or
mergers in which the acquired company’s shareholders become
controlling shareholders in the acquiring company and the acquiring
company becomes the successor to the business operations of the
acquired company.  Regulations governing shell companies
also deny the use of Form S-8 for the registration of securities
and limit the use of this Form to a reorganized shell company until
the expiration of 60 days from when any such entity is no longer
considered to be a shell company.  This prohibition could
further restrict opportunities for us to acquire companies that may
already have stock option plans in place that cover numerous
employees.  In such instances, there may be no exemption
from registration for the issuance of securities in any business
combination to these employees, thereby necessitating the filing of
a registration statement with the SEC to complete any such
reorganization, and incurring the time and expense that are
normally avoided by reverse reorganizations or mergers.

 

Recent
amendments to Rule 144, adopted by the SEC and effective on
February 15, 2008, codify the SEC’s prior position limiting
the tradeability of certain securities of shell companies,
including those issued by us in any acquisition, reorganization or
merger, and further limit the tradeability of additional securities
of shell companies; these proposals will further restrict the
availability of opportunities for us to acquire any business or
enterprise that desire to utilize us as a means of going
public.

 

 

4

  

 

 

Any of
these types of transactions, regardless of the particular prospect,
would require us to issue a substantial number of shares of our
common stock that could amount to as much as 95% of our outstanding
voting securities following the completion of any such transaction;
accordingly, investments in any such private enterprise, if
available, would be much more favorable than any investment in
us.

 

Management
intends to consider a number of factors prior to making any
decision as to whether to participate in any specific business
endeavor, none of which may be determinative or provide any
assurance of success.  These may include, but will not be
limited to, as applicable, an analysis of the quality of the
particular business or entity’s management and personnel; the
anticipated acceptability of any new products or marketing concepts
that any such business or company may have; the merits of any such
business’ or company’s technological changes; the
present financial condition, projected growth potential and
available technical, financial and managerial resources of any such
business or company; working capital, history of operations and
future prospects; the nature of present and expected competition;
the quality and experience of any such business’ or
company’s management services and the depth of management;
the business’ or the company’s potential for further
research, development or exploration; risk factors specifically
related to the business’ or company’s operations; the
potential for growth, expansion and profit of the business
or  company; the perceived public recognition or
acceptance of the company’s or the business’ products,
services, trademarks and name identification; and numerous other
factors which are difficult, if not impossible, to properly or
accurately quantify or analyze, let alone describe or identify,
without referring to specific objective criteria of an identified
business or company.

 

Regardless,
the results of operations of any specific entity may not
necessarily be indicative of what may occur in the future, by
reason of changing market strategies, plant or product expansion,
changes in product emphasis, future management personnel and
changes in innumerable other factors.  Further, in the
case of a new business venture or one that is in a research and
development mode, the risks will be substantial, and there will be
no objective criteria to examine the effectiveness or the abilities
of its management or its business objectives.  Also, a
firm market for its products or services may yet need to be
established, and with no past track record, the profitability of
any such entity will be unproven and cannot be predicted with any
certainty.

 

Management
will attempt to meet personally with management and key personnel
of any entity providing any potential business opportunity afforded
to us, visit and inspect material facilities, obtain independent
analysis or verification of information provided and gathered,
check references of management and key personnel and conduct other
reasonably prudent measures calculated to ensure a reasonably
thorough review of any particular business opportunity; however,
due to time constraints of management, these activities may be
limited.

 

We are
unable to predict the time as to when and if we may actually
participate in any specific business endeavor.  We
anticipate that proposed business ventures will be made available
to us through personal contacts of directors, executive officers
and principal stockholders, professional advisors, broker dealers
in securities, venture capital personnel and others who may present
unsolicited proposals.  In certain cases, we may agree to
pay a finder’s fee or to otherwise compensate the persons who
submit a potential business endeavor in which we eventually
participate. Such persons may include our directors, executive
officers and beneficial owners of our securities or their
affiliates. In this event, such fees may become a factor in
negotiations regarding any potential venture and, accordingly, may
present a conflict of interest for such
individuals.  Management does not presently intend to
acquire or merge with any business enterprise in which any member
has a prior ownership interest.

 

Our
directors and executive officers have not used any particular
consultants, advisors or finders on a regular basis.

 

Although
we currently have no plans to do so, depending on the nature and
extent of services rendered, we may compensate members of
management in the future for services that they may perform for
us.  Because we currently have extremely limited
resources, and we are unlikely to have any significant resources
until we have determined a business or enterprise to engage in or
have completed a reorganization, merger or acquisition, management
expects that any such compensation would take the form of an
issuance of shares of our common stock to these persons; this would
have the effect of further diluting the holdings of our other
stockholders.  There are presently no preliminary
agreements or understandings between us and members of our
management respecting such compensation.  Any shares
issued to members of our management would be required to be resold
under an effective registration statement filed with the SEC or 12
months after we file the Form 10 information about the acquired
company with

 

 

5

  

 

 

the SEC as
now required by Form 8-K.  These provisions could further
inhibit our ability to complete the acquisition of any business or
complete any merger or reorganization with another entity, where
finder’s or others who may be subject to these resale
limitations refuse to provide us with any introductions or to close
any such transactions unless they are paid requested fees in cash
or unless we agree to file a registration statement with the SEC
that includes any shares that are to be issued to them, at no cost
to them.  These expenses could limit potential
acquisition candidates, especially those in need of cash resources,
and could affect the number of shares that our stockholders retain
following any such transaction, by reason of the increased
expense.

 

Substantial
fees are also often paid in connection with the completion of all
types of acquisitions, reorganizations or mergers, ranging from a
small amount to as much as $600,000 or more. These fees are usually
divided among promoters or founders or finders, after deduction of
legal, accounting and other related expenses, and it is not unusual
for a portion of these fees to be paid to members of management or
to principal stockholders as consideration for their agreement to
retire a portion of their shares of our common stock that are owned
by them or to provide an indemnification for all of our prior
liabilities.  Management may actively negotiate or
otherwise consent to the purchase of all or any portion of their
shares of common stock as a condition to, or in connection with, a
proposed reorganization, merger or acquisition.  It is
not anticipated that any such opportunity will be afforded to other
stockholders or that such other stockholders will be afforded the
opportunity to approve or consent to any particular stock buy-out
transaction.  In the event that any such fees are paid or
shares are purchased, these requirements may become a factor in
negotiations regarding any potential acquisition or merger by us
and, accordingly, may also present a conflict of interest for such
individuals. We have no present arrangements or understandings
respecting any of these types of fees or
opportunities.  Any of these types of fees that are paid
in shares of our common stock will also be subject to the resale
limitations embodied in the recent amendments to Rule
144.

 

None of
our directors, executive officers, founders or their affiliates or
associates has had any negotiations with any representatives of the
owners of any business or company regarding the possibility of an
acquisition, reorganization, merger or other business opportunity
with us.

Competitive

Competitive Position in the Industry and Methods of
Competition

 

Management
believes that there are literally thousands of shell companies
engaged in endeavors similar to those engaged in by us; many of
these companies have substantial current assets and cash
reserves.  Competitors also include thousands of other
publicly-held companies whose business operations have proven
unsuccessful, and whose only viable business opportunity is that of
providing a publicly-held vehicle through which a private entity
may have access to the public capital markets via a reverse
reorganization or merger.  There is no reasonable way to
predict our competitive position or that of any other entity in
these endeavors; however, we, having limited assets and no cash
reserves, will no doubt be at a competitive disadvantage in
competing with entities that have significant cash resources and
have recent operating histories when compared with the complete
lack of any substantive operations by us since 2002.

Need for
any Governmental Approval of Principal Products or
Services

 

Because we
currently have no business operations and produce no products nor
provide any services, we are not presently subject to any
governmental regulation in this regard.  However, in the
event that we complete a reorganization, merger or acquisition
transaction with an entity that is engaged in business operations
or provides products or services, we will become subject to all
governmental approval requirements to which the reorganized, merged
or acquired entity is subject or may become subject.

 

Effect of
Existing or Probable Governmental Regulations on the
Business

 

 Smaller
Reporting Company

 

We are
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 of the Exchange
Act, and we are subject to the disclosure requirements of
Regulation S-K of the SEC, as a “smaller reporting
company.”   That designation will relieve us
of some of the informational requirements of Regulation
S-K.

 

 Sarbanes/Oxley
Act

 

We are
also subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  The
Sarbanes/Oxley Act created a strong and independent accounting
oversight board to oversee the conduct of auditors of public
companies and strengthens auditor independence.  It also
requires steps to enhance the direct responsibility of senior
members of management for financial reporting and for the quality
of financial disclosures made by public companies; establishes
clear statutory rules to limit, and to expose to public view,
possible conflicts of interest affecting securities analysts;
creates guidelines for audit committee members’ appointment,
compensation and oversight of the work of public companies’
auditors; management assessment of our internal controls; auditor
attestation to management’s conclusions about internal
controls; prohibits certain insider trading during pension fund
blackout periods; requires companies and auditors to evaluate
internal controls and procedures; and establishes a federal crime
of securities fraud, among other provisions. Compliance with the
requirements of the Sarbanes/Oxley Act will substantially increase
our legal and accounting costs.

 

 Exchange
Act Reporting Requirements

 

Section
14(a) of the Exchange Act requires all companies with securities
registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act to comply
with the rules and regulations of the SEC regarding proxy
solicitations, as outlined in Regulation 14A. Matters submitted to
our stockholders at a special or annual meeting thereof or pursuant
to a written consent will require us to provide our stockholders
with the information outlined in Schedules 14A or 14C of Regulation
14; preliminary copies of this information must be submitted to the
SEC at least 10 days prior to the date that definitive copies of
this information are forwarded to the our stockholders.

 

 

7

  

 

 

 

We are
required to file annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports
on Form 10-Q with the Securities Exchange Commission on a regular
basis, and are required to timely disclose certain material events
(e.g., changes in corporate control; acquisitions or dispositions
of a significant amount of assets other than in the ordinary course
of business; and bankruptcy) in a Current Report on Form
8-K.

 

Research
and Development Costs During the Last Two Fiscal
Years

 

None; not
applicable.

 

Cost and
Effects of Compliance with Environmental Laws

 

We do not
believe that our current or intended business operations are
subject to any material environmental laws, rules or regulations
that would have an adverse material effect on our business
operations or financial condition or result in a material
compliance cost; however, we will become subject to all such
governmental requirements to which the reorganized, merged or
acquired entity is subject or may become subject.

 

Number of
Total Employees and Number of Full Time Employees

 

None.

ITEM
1A.  RISK FACTORS

 

Not

ITEM
2:  PROPERTIES

  

We have no
assets, property or business; our principal executive office
address and telephone number are the business office address and
telephone number of a stockholder, Duane S. Jenson, and are
currently provided at no cost. Because we have had no business, our
activities have been limited to keeping itself in good standing in
the State of Nevada and timely voluntarily filing our reports with
the SEC. These activities have consumed an insignificant amount of
management’s time; accordingly, the costs to Mr. Jenson
of providing the use of his office and telephone have been
minimal.

 

 ITEM
3:  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

 

We are not
a party to any pending legal proceeding. To the knowledge of our
management, no federal, state or local governmental agency is
presently contemplating any proceeding against us. No director,
executive officer or affiliate of ours or owner of record or
beneficially of more than 5% of our common stock is a party adverse
to us or has a material interest adverse to us in any
proceeding.

Market
Information

 

Our common
stock was listed on the OTC Bulletin Board of the National
Association of Securities Dealers (“NASD” [now
“FINRA”]) on December 13, 2005 under the symbol
“BLKR”.  On October 23, 2006, in conjunction
with the reverse split, NASDAQ changed our trading symbol,
“BLKR,” to “BLKE.”  There is
currently no established trading market for shares of our common
stock of.  Management does not expect any viable market
to develop in our common stock unless and until we complete an
acquisition or merger. In any event, no assurance can be given that
any market for our common stock will develop or be
maintained.

 

For any
market that develops for our common stock, the sale of
“restricted securities” (common stock) pursuant to Rule
144 of the SEC by members of management or any other person to whom
any such securities may be issued in the future may have a
substantial adverse impact on any such public
market.  For information regarding the requirements of
resales under Rule 144, see the heading “Rule 144”
below.

Shell
Companies

 

The
following is an excerpt from Rule 144(i) regarding resales of
securities of shell companies:

 

“(i)  Unavailability
to securities of issuers with no or nominal operations and no or
nominal non-cash assets .

 

(1)           This
section is not available for the resale of securities initially
issued by an issuer defined below:

 

 (i)
   An issuer, other than a business combination related
shell company, as defined in §230.405, or an asset-backed
issuer, as defined in Item 1101(b) of Regulation AB
(§229.1101(b) of this chapter), that has:

 

(A)           No
or nominal operations; and

 

 

 

10

  

 

 

(B)           Either
:

 

 (1)
  No or nominal assets;

 (2)
  Assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents;
or

 (3)
  Assets consisting of any amount of cash and cash
equivalents and nominal other assets; or

 

(ii)           An
issuer that has been at any time previously an issuer described in
paragraph (i)(1)(i).

 

(2)           Notwithstanding
paragraph (i)(1), if the issuer of the securities previously had
been an issuer described in paragraph (i)(1)(i) but has ceased to
be an issuer described in paragraph (i)(1)(i); is subject to the
reporting requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act;
has filed all reports and other materials required to be filed by
section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as applicable, during the
preceding 12 months (or for such shorter period that the issue was
required to file such reports and materials), other than Form 8-K
reports (§249.308 of this chapter); and has filed current
“Form 10 information” with the SEC reflecting its
status as an entity that is no longer an issuer described in
paragraph (i)(1)(i), then those securities may be sold subject to
the requirements of this section after one year has elapsed from
the date that the issuer filed “Form 10 information”
with the SEC.

 

(3)           The
term “Form 10 information” means the information that
is required by Form 10 or Form 20-F (§249.220f of this
chapter), as applicable to the issuer of the securities, to
register under the Exchange Act each class of securities being sold
under this rule.  The issuer may provide the Form 10
information in any filing of the issuer with the Commission.
 The Form 10 information is deemed filed when the initial
filing is made with the Commission.”

 

Securities
of a shell company cannot be publicly sold under Rule 144 in the
absence of compliance with this subparagraph, though the SEC has
implied that these restrictions would not be enforced respecting
securities issued by a shell company while it was not determined to
be a shell company.

 

 Section
4(1) of the Securities Act

 

Since we
are a “shell company” as defined in subparagraph (i) of
Rule 144, our shares of common stock cannot be publicly resold
under Rule 144 until we comply with the requirements outlined above
under the heading “Shell Companies.”  Until those
requirements have been satisfied, any resales of our shares of
common stock must be made in compliance with the provisions of the
exemption from registration under the Securities Act provided in
Section 4(1) thereof, applicable to persons other than “an
issuer, underwriter or a dealer.”  That will require
that such shares of common stock be sold in “routine trading
transactions,” which would include compliance with
substantially all of the requirements of Rule 144, regardless of
its availability; and such resales may be limited to our
non-affiliates.  It is the position of the SEC that the
Section 4(1) exemption is not available for the resale of any
securities of an issuer that is or was a shell company, by
directors, executive officers, promoters or founders or their
transferees.  See NASD Regulation, Inc. , CCH Federal
Securities Law Reporter, 1990-2000 Decisions, Paragraph No. 77,681,
the so-called “Worm-Wulff Letter.”

 

Use of
Proceeds of Registered Securities

 

There were
no proceeds received during the calendar year ended June 30, 2010,
from the sale of registered securities.

 

Purchases
of Equity Securities by Us and Affiliated Purchasers

 

None; not
applicable.

  

ITEM
6:  SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

 

Not
required for smaller reporting companies.

ITEM
7:  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION

 

When used
in this Annual Report, the words “may,”
“will,” “expect,” “anticipate,”
“continue,” “estimate,”
“project,” “intend,” and similar
expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements
within the meaning of Section 27a of the Securities Act and Section
21e of the Exchange Act regarding events, conditions, and financial
trends that may affect our future plans of operations, business
strategy, operating results, and financial
position.  Persons reviewing this Annual Report are
cautioned that any forward-looking statements are not guarantees of
future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties and
actual results may differ materially from those included within the
forward-looking statements as a result of various
factors.  Such factors are discussed further below under
“Trends and Uncertainties,” and also include general
economic factors and conditions that may directly or indirectly
impact our financial condition or results of operations.

 

Plan of
Operation

 

Our plan
of operation for the next 12 months is to: (i)consider guidelines
of industries in which we may have an interest; (ii) adopt a
business plan regarding engaging in the business of any selected
industry; and (iii) to commence such operations through funding
and/or the acquisition of a “going concern” engaged in
any industry selected.

 

During the
next 12 months, our only foreseeable cash requirements will relate
to maintaining our in good standing or the payment of expenses
associated with legal fees, accounting fees and reviewing or
investigating any potential business venture, which may be advanced
by management or principal stockholders as loans to us. Because we
have not determined any business or industry in which our
operations will be commenced, and we have not identified any
prospective venture as of the date of this Annual Report, it is
impossible to predict the amount of any such loan. Any such loan
will be on terms no less favorable to us than would be available
from a commercial lender in an arm’s length transaction. No
advance or loan from any affiliate will be required to be repaid as
a condition to any agreement with future acquisition
partners.

 

When and
if a business will commence or an acquisition made is presently
unknown and will depend upon various factors, including but not
limited to funding and its availability and if and when any
potential acquisition may become available to us at terms
acceptable to us.  The estimated costs associated with
reviewing and verifying information about a potential business
venture would be mainly for due diligence and the legal process and
could cost between $5,000 and $25,000.  These funds will
either be required to be loaned by management or raised in private
offerings; we cannot assure you that we can raise funds, if
needed.

  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

 

We have no
cash or cash equivalents on hand.  If additional funds
are required, such funds may be advanced by management or
stockholders as loans to us.  During the year ended June
30, 2010, expenses were paid by a principal stockholder in the
amount of $7,668.  During the same period in 2009,
additional expenses by a principal stockholder totaled
$9,400.  The aggregate amount of $61,435 outstanding as
of June 30, 2010, is unsecured and is due on
demand.  Because we have not identified any acquisition
or venture, it is impossible to predict the amount of any such
loan.

  

Results of
Operations

 

Other than
maintaining our good corporate standing in the State of Nevada,
paying and settling our debts and seeking the acquisition of
assets, properties or businesses that may benefit  us and
our stockholders, we have had no material business operations in
the two most recent calendar years.

During the
year ended June 30, 2010, we had a net loss of $7,668, resulting
from operations.  During this same period ending June 30,
2009, we had a net loss of $9,400, also resulting from
operations.  The decrease in our net loss is from June
30, 2009 to June 30, 2010 was due to a decrease in audit fees and
our overall operating expenses in general.  Except as
described above, we have received no revenues in either of our two
most recent calendar years.  See the Index to Financial
Statements, Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report.

 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements

 

We had no
Off-Balance Sheet arrangements during the fiscal year ended June
30, 2010.
