1720-004
Safety Series Gas Valves
                        The Robertshaw® 1720 Series Thermomagnetic Safety Valve is a control used to cut off the flow of gas to the burner in the event of a pilot outage. The magnet assembly is energized by voltage generated by a thermocouple that is heated by the pilot flame. When this flame is extinguished, the thermocouple voltage decreases until a spring overcomes the magnetic force and closes off both the pilot and main gas.

FEATURED PRODUCT



    UNI-GloFloss Light Green 15 yds   UNI Products Introduces the UNI Glo line of Phosphorescent Fly-tying Products
 UNI Products Inc., a world leader in supplying spooled fly-tying
materials, announces the introduction of the UNI Glo line of fly-tying
products. These revolutionary products offer fly tiers the opportunity
to create a wide range of phosphorescent flies. While UNI has
previously offered GloTinsel (previously UNI Glo), the
company has now added GloFloss and GloThread to the Glo group. The two
new products feature brighter and longer-lasting phosphorescence.
Advanced injection technology enabled the production of fine filaments
with phosphorescent pigments in the core surrounded by the
polyester/nylon coating. As is the case for GloYarn, the
phosphorescence cannot be worn, washed or even bleached out of the
fibers.
 Phosphorescence and fluorescence are often confused.
Phosphorescent materials emit light in total darkness, often for a
considerable length of time. Fluorescent materials emit light (in
addition to reflecting light like ordinary materials) only in the
presence of light. The phosphorescent pigment in UNI Glo products
absorbs light from any light source available (a camera flash is a
favored source) and releases light or glows in darkness or very low
light levels. The glow will last in excess of three hours in total
darkness. 
 Lures constructed of, or coated with, phosphorescent materials
have been proven effective when night fishing for walleye or bass by
North American anglers. However, fly fishers have been slow to
incorporate this feature in flies. A lack of suitable materials is the
likely explanation. While some Kiwi fly fishers have had considerable
success catching trout at night on phosphorescent “flies,” they have
been forced to use impregnated plastic bodies. With the introduction of
the UNI Glo line, fly tiers now have a group of legitimate fly-tying
materials with which to work. Uses for these products are limited only
by the fly-tiers imagination. Although the thread is available only in 
White, the floss is available in White, Light  Blue and Light Green and 
the GloTinsel is offered in Green, Light Blue, Orange ,Pink, White and 
Yellow.
Attractive tinted bodies are achieved by wrapping GloTinsel over
GloThread or GloFloss. In another application, lure-like bodies can be
created by stuffing translucent Mylar tubing with GloYarn. Unlike
impregnated plastics, these new materials permit tiers to control the
amount of phosphorescent material in their flies.

	All four products are available on spools for ease of tying. Ask for them at your local fly shop.   MORE »      UNI-GloFloss Light Blue 15 yds   UNI Products Introduces the UNI Glo line of Phosphorescent Fly-tying Products

We do not intend to use any of the proceeds from the offering to pay for the
cost of the offering. The cost of the offering shall be loaned us from Mr.
Ehlert. However, there is no written loan agreement to such effect and no
guarantee that Mr. Ehlert will make such loans to the Company.

The above figures represent only estimated costs. Roman Ehlert, our president,
has verbally agreed to lend funds to pay for the registration process and lend
funds to implement our business plan and to help maintain a reporting status
with the SEC in the form of a non-secured loan for the next twelve months and
after effectiveness of our registration statement until we complete our offering
as the expenses are incurred if no other proceeds are obtained by the Company.
However, there is no written loan agreement to such effect and no guarantee that
Mr. Ehlert will make such loans to the Company. The amounts actually spent by us
for any specific purpose may vary and will depend on a number of factors.
Non-fixed cost, sales and marketing and general and administrative costs may
vary depending on the business progress and development efforts, general
business conditions and market reception to our services. Accordingly, our
management has broad discretion to allocate the net proceeds to non-fixed costs.

An example of changes to this spending allocation for non-fixed costs include
management deciding to spend less of the allotment on product development and
more on sales and marketing. Such changes to spending may occur due to seasonal
variations in market demand for our products and services relative to when the
funds are received.


The completion in our industry is extremely high. Most of our competitors have
greater financial resources and may be able to withstand sales or price
decreases better than we can. We also expect to continue to face competition
from new market entrants.

We may be unable to continue to compete effectively with these existing or new
competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition and results of operations.


Company Description
We are a development stage company and we are in the business of selling freshly
squeezed juice from mobile stands in London, United Kingdom. Taking advantage of
mobility of our juice stands we are going to place them at what we believe to be
popular tourist places including strip centers, power


 centers and shopping malls
during the colder period of the year and sport sites events. At present moment
we do not have customers or juice stands and we currently have minimal
operations. We intend to place such juice stands in places we believe are
popular places for tourists and places with high volume of people traffic.

Being a development stage company, we have no revenues and have limited
operating history. Uni Line Corp. was incorporated in Nevada on September. 5,
2013. To date we have prepared a business plan, signed a lease agreement and
purchased one juice maker as a test model (without any equipment such as a
refrigerator and stand). (Commercial Juice Extractor).

Our principal executive office is located at Barons Court Road flat 1, London 
W14 9DU, Great Britain.Our phone number is +44 020 3287 6608.

Non-fixed cost, sales and marketing and general and administrative costs may
vary depending on the business progress and development efforts, general
business conditions and market reception to our services. Accordingly, our
management has broad discretion to allocate the net proceeds to non-fixed costs.

An example of changes to this spending allocation for non-fixed costs include
management deciding to spend less of the allotment on product development and
more on sales and marketing. Such changes to spending may occur due to seasonal
variations in market demand for our products and services relative to when the
funds are received.


The completion in our industry is extremely high. Most of our competitors have
greater financial resources and may be able to withstand sales or price
decreases better than we can. We also expect to continue to face competition
from new market entrants.

We may be unable to continue to compete effectively with these existing or new
competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition and results of operations.


Company Description
We are a development stage company and we are in the business of selling freshly
squeezed juice from mobile stands in London, United Kingdom. Taking advantage of
mobility of our juice stands we are going to place them at what we believe to be
popular tourist places including strip centers, power


 centers and shopping malls
during the colder period of the year and sport sites events. At present moment
we do not have customers or juice stands and we currently have minimal
operations. We intend to place such juice stands in places we believe are
popular places for tourists and places with high volume of people traffic.

Being a development stage company, we have no revenues and have limited
operating history. Uni Line Corp. was incorporated in Nevada on September. 5,
2013. To date we have prepared a business plan, signed a lease agreement and
purchased one juice maker as a test model (without any equipment such as a
refrigerator and stand). (Commercial Juice Extractor).

Our principal executive office is located at Barons Court Road flat 1, London 
W14 9DU, Great Britain.Our phone number is +44 020 3287 6608.
