Hawk Ridge Systems Releases xBOM for Bill of Materials Management in SOLIDWORKS
Oct 7 15
Hawk Ridge Systems announced a new release of xBOM, the premier solution for Bill of Materials Management for SOLIDWORKS. By introducing extensive Bill of Materials (BOM) Management capabilities, users of SOLIDWORKS Product Data Management (PDM) tools will now be able to manage their BOMs within their current infrastructure without the need for costly Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) systems. The xBOM solution is designed and optimized to process Bill of Materials within the SOLIDWORKS PDM environment. Easily accessible to any SOLIDWORKS PDM user, and with a price point under $750 it is a true ROI-driven tool. With xBOM, SOLIDWORKS Enterprise PDM users can easily merge BOM data from PDM, Excel and CSV files, while still tracking source history. This gives all authorized users and multiple departments one single place to manage BOMs and 3D CAD data. xBOM also addresses challenges with BOM version control which alleviates costly errors and rework charges. For a limited time, Hawk Ridge Systems is offering a free trial of xBOM for qualified PDM users. xBOM is the result of collaboration between the software development team at Hawk Ridge Systems and ATR Soft. Under the joint venture, Flex-X, Hawk Ridge Systems and ATR Soft are developing and delivering productivity tools for the global customer base of Dassault Systèmes SOLIDWORKS users.
