Polaris Greystone Financial Group, LLC
Polaris Wealth Advisors, a leading west coast investment management and financial planning firm, was looking to reinvigorate their brand identity and marketing materials across digital and traditional channels. They were also wanting to establish best practices for integrating their marketing efforts and existing client communications with their CRM system.
TE+A worked closely with the leadership of Polaris to develop a new look + feel for their corporate website and all client and prospect communication materials and videos. Additionally, TE+A created a digital publication library featuring pageturn technology and established an ongoing email lead gen and nurturing strategy.
In late 2015, Polaris Wealth Advisors merged with Greystone Financial Group, a Detroit based wealth management group. TE+A worked closely with the leadership of the two firms to rename, brand, launch and promote the new firm as Polaris Greystone Financial Group across all client touchpoints. Special attention was given to the need for business continuity across both firm’s existing client base and prospecting efforts.

SAN RAFAEL, Calif. and TROY, Mich., Oct. 21, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Polaris Greystone Financial Group, LLC ("PGFG"), an investment advisory firm with nearly $1 billion in client assets under management, has been formed through the combination of Polaris Wealth Advisers, LLC and Greystone Financial Group, Inc., the companies announced today. The newly formed group is dedicated to providing superior wealth management and retirement planning services to high net worth families and business owners.
Polaris Greystone Financial Group serves clients through offices in the San Francisco, Southern California, Houston and Detroit metropolitan areas. The firm currently operates two divisions: Polaris Greystone Wealth Management provides financial planning and investment management for individual high net worth families; Polaris Greystone Retirement Services offers retirement plan solutions and services to plan sponsors and participants within their plans. Polaris and Greystone can trace their corporate roots back to 1998 and 1993, respectively.
Jeffrey J. Powell, Polaris' founder, remains Chief Executive Officer, Managing Partner and Chief Investment Officer of the combined firm. Todd R. Moss, co-founder of Greystone, is now President and Senior Partner of PGFG and will help manage the firm's day-to-day operations.  
"The combination of Polaris and Greystone brings together two well-established investment advisory firms and enhances our ability to provide superior wealth management and retirement planning services," said Jeff Powell. "We share the same values and commitment to our clients, and together we can offer a broader portfolio of solutions to high net worth families and private businesses, through a larger team of talented professionals. We are excited by the opportunity to build on the PGFG platform to expand our services and extend into other key wealth markets throughout the United States." 
"In today's challenging financial services marketplace, investment advisors need greater scale to deliver a full range of resources to clients," noted Todd Moss. "By joining forces, Polaris and Greystone will have the critical mass to provide an enhanced range of products, attract talented employees, and support our business with the right technology and systems. We are enthusiastic about our ability to grow as a unified firm, while maintaining our tradition of excellent wealth management services."
Going forward, Polaris Greystone Financial Group is well positioned to expand its investment advisory services and geographic reach. Prior to the combination, Polaris was named to the Financial Times 300 Top Registered Investment Advisors. The firms' core competencies are highly complementary; for example, Polaris has strong money management capabilities and Greystone offers customized 401(k) plans. Both firms also have cultivated significant referral relationships. Polaris Greystone will continue Greystone's longstanding relationship with Doeren Mayhew, a national accounting firm with offices in Michigan, Texas, and Florida, and will continue participating in a national discount brokerage firm's referral program.
