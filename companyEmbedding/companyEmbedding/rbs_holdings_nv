(RBS N.V.) have approved the proposed transfers of asubstantial part of the business activities of RBS N.V. to RBS plc (the"Proposed Transfers"), subject, amongst other matters, to regulatoryand other approvals, further tax and other analysis in respect of theassets and liabilities to be transferred and employee consultationprocedures. This follows a period of extensive dialogue with keyregulators and rating agencies. The Proposed Transfers will not includethe Consortium Shared Assets referred to below.The Proposed Transfers will streamline the manner in which the GlobalBanking & Markets (GBM) and Global Transaction Services (GTS)businesses of RBSG and its subsidiaries and subsidiary undertakings(the "RBS Group") interact with clients with simplified access to theGBM and GTS product suites. They will provide benefits to clients ineffecting easier interaction with the RBS Group including management ofcollateral. Clients will continue to deal, and conduct business, withtheir local RBS teams as at present. There is no requirement forclients to take any action now and any action required in connectionwith the Proposed Transfers will be communicated in a timely way with aview to ensuring a smooth transition.The Proposed Transfers will not result in any change to the currentbusiness strategy for any of the transferred RBS N.V. businesses andthe way in which the RBS Group commercially operates will remainunchanged.The Proposed Transfers are consistent with RBS Group's efforts tosimplify its structure, thereby reducing risk, cost and complexity. Inaddition, the Proposed Transfers are expected to result in a simplifiedmanagement and reporting framework for the RBS Group across themultiple jurisdictions in which RBS plc and RBS N.V. operate.RBS N.V.'s businesses include the following product areas: Equities &Structured Retail Products, Emerging Markets, Lending, GlobalTransaction Services (GTS), and Short Term Markets & Financing (STMF).RBS N.V. also currently holds directly and indirectly certain otherassets which are owned by RBSG jointly with the Dutch State andSantander (the "Consortium Shared Assets"). As at 31 December 2010, RBSN.V. had consolidated total assets of EUR200.4bn (GBP172.8bn), a CoreTier 1 Capital Ratio of 8.7% and a Tier 1 Capital Ratio of 11.0%. As atthe same date, RBSG had consolidated total assets of GBP1.5tn, a CoreTier 1 Capital Ratio of 10.7% and a Tier 1 Capital Ratio of 12.9% andRBS plc, the receiving entity for the Proposed Transfers, hadconsolidated total assets of GBP1.3tn, a Core Tier 1 Capital Ratio of8.4% and a Tier 1 Capital Ratio of 10.1%. The Proposed Transfers arenot expected to have any impact on RBSG's capital position.It is expected that the Proposed Transfers will be implemented on aphased basis over a period ending 31 December 2013. A large part of theProposed Transfers (including the transfers of certain securitiesissued by RBS N.V.) is expected to have taken place by the end of 2012.This will be subject, amongst other matters, to regulatory and otherapprovals, further tax and other analysis in respect of the assets andliabilities to be transferred and employee consultation procedures.RBS plc and RBS N.V. have discussed the Proposed Transfers in detailwith the UK Financial Services Authority and De Nederlandsche Bank("DNB") and they will continue to be involved as the Proposed Transfersprogress through to completion. Approvals from these and otherregulators will be required prior to execution. Where available andpracticable, statutory transfer schemes will be used to implement theProposed Transfers which may require court approval.Due to legal constraints, securities and related guarantees which aregoverned by New York, New South Wales, New Zealand and Hong Kong law(including the three series of Trust Preferred Securities issued by RBSN.V. Capital Funding Trusts V, VI and VII) are currently not expectedto be transferred to RBS plc pursuant to the statutory transfer schemeswhich are anticipated to be used to implement the Proposed Transfers.Alternative steps will be considered in relation to such securities andguarantees, where reasonably practicable in RBS's opinion. In respectof securities and guarantees governed by other laws which have beenissued by RBS N.V., further analysis is ongoing to establish whetherthey will or will not be transferred to RBS plc pursuant to theProposed Transfers and further announcements will be made in duecourse. In the meantime, holders of RBS N.V. securities are notrequired to take any action in connection with the Proposed Transfers.The proposed transfers of securities from RBS N.V. to RBS plc are not,of themselves, expected to change the price that RBS plc, as part ofits normal market making activities, may bid for such securities.However, RBS cannot guarantee the price at which such securities maytrade. The market prices for such securities may be impacted by anumber of factors, including the value of the assets underlying suchsecurities and prevailing market conditions, any of which may affectthe value of the securities.For legal, tax and other reasons, there are expected to be certainoperations, assets and other liabilities in RBS N.V. which will not betransferred to RBS plc. RBSG is committed to providing the necessarysupport to ensure that RBS N.V. continues to meet its commitmentsduring and after the Proposed Transfers. Following completion of theProposed Transfers, RBS N.V. will continue to be authorised andregulated by DNB.The RBS Group has held detailed discussions on the Proposed Transferswith the three main rating agencies, Moody's, Standard & Poor's andFitch. The plan for the Proposed Transfers has been designed not toimpact the ratings of RBS N.V. or RBS plc. It is anticipated that theagencies will publish their credit opinions following thisannouncement.Certain unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financialinformation relating to RBS Holdings N.V. is set out in the Appendix tothis announcement.For Further Information Contact:RBS Group Investor Relations RBS Group Media RelationsEmete Hassan, Michael Strachan,Head of Debt Investor Relations Group Media Centre+44 207 672 1758 +44 131 523 4414DisclaimerNo person should place any reliance on the information in thisannouncement concerning securities/guarantees which are expected to beretained by RBS N.V. in connection with making an investment decisionor for any other purpose and should be aware that changes to thecurrent proposals (including, without limitation, to the identity ofthe securities/guarantees to be retained, the eventual manner in whichsecurities/guarantees are proposed to be transferred and to the timingpursuant to which they are proposed to be transferred) may be made ifrequired, or if determined by RBS N.V. or RBS plc (in their absolutediscretion) to be desirable for commercial or other reasons.Accordingly, nothing in this announcement should be taken as (or is) arepresentation that any of the securities/guarantees of RBS N.V. willbe transferred or retained, whether in the manner described in thisannouncement, in accordance with the timing set out in thisannouncement, or at all.

The financial informationhas been extracted from audited financial information for the yearended 31 December 2010 contained within the Annual Report and Accountsof RBS Holdings N.V. published on 29 March 2011 and does not reflectsubsequent events.The pro forma financial information has been prepared on the followingbasis:* The pro forma financial information has been prepared on thebasis of management's best estimate of the relevant third party assetsand liabilities of RBS N.V. that will be transferred to RBS plc.* The pro forma condensed consolidated statement of financialposition of RBS Holdings N.V. as at 31 December 2010 is presented toshow the effect of the Proposed Transfers as if the Proposed Transfershad occurred on 31 December 2010.* The pro forma condensed consolidated income statements of RBSHoldings N.V. for the years ended 31 December 2010, 2009 and 2008respectively, are presented to show the effect of the ProposedTransfers as if the Proposed Transfers had occurred on 1 January of therespective years.* Assets and liabilities to be transferred are presented based ontheir carrying values determined under IFRS.

Noperson should place any reliance on the pro forma financial informationin connection with making an investment decision or for any otherpurpose and should be aware that changes to the current proposals(including, without limitation, to the assets and liabilities to betransferred or retained, the eventual manner in which such assets andliabilities are proposed to be transferred and to the timing pursuantto which they are proposed to be transferred) may be made if required,or if determined by RBS N.V. or RBS plc (in their absolute discretion)to be desirable for commercial or other reasons. Accordingly, nothingin this pro forma financial information should be taken as (or is) arepresentation that any of the assets and liabilities referred to willbe transferred or retained, whether in a manner consistent with thefigures contained in this pro forma financial information, inaccordance with the timing set out above, or at all.

On 19 April 2011, the Boards of The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc (RBSG), The Royal Bank of Scotland plc (RBS plc), RBS Holdings N.V.1 and The Royal Bank of Scotland N.V.2 (RBS N.V.) announced that they had approved the proposed transfers of a substantial part of the business activities of RBS N.V. to RBS plc (the “Proposed Transfers”), subject, amongst other matters, to regulatory and other approvals, further tax and other analysis in respect of the assets and liabilities to be transferred and employee consultation procedures.

It is expected that the Proposed Transfers will include the transfer of a substantial part of the business conducted by RBS N.V. in The Netherlands as well as in certain EMEA branches of RBS N.V.3 (the “Transferring Businesses”) to RBS plc. Such transfer is expected to be effected by way of a Dutch statutory demerger (the “Demerger”) of the Transferring Businesses to RBS II B.V. (a Dutch company licensed as a bank in The Netherlands that has been established specifically for the purposes of the Dutch Scheme), followed by the merger of RBS II B.V. into RBS plc by way of a cross-border merger (together with the Demerger, the “Dutch Scheme”). The Dutch Scheme would be subject, amongst other matters, to regulatory and court approvals.
RBS plc and RBS N.V. announce that they have today published a list of all of RBS N.V.’s Structured Retail Products for which it is possible that RBS plc can become the issuer of such securities under the Dutch Scheme, indicating whether or not RBS plc is expected to become the issuer of those securities pursuant to the Dutch Scheme (subject to the relevant securities not having been exercised, redeemed or repurchased and cancelled prior to the implementation of the Dutch Scheme).

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
