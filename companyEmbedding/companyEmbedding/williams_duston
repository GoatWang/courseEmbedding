Microsoft Kin
Mobile User Experience & User Interface DeisgnWhile living in Seattle I was a part of a small Microsoft crew that designed and developed Microsoft’s first Social Media Device, the Microsoft KIN. I was one of only a few people on the team that created the interface, helped with some of the interactions on the device and also helped with the user experience.I was one of the early UI Designers on the team so I have tons of conceptual work that never went into the final product. The Microsoft division that was responsible for the production of the KIN was the Pioneer Studios group, a part of Microsoft PMX and Mobile team.Due to a non-disclosure agreement I am not able show any of the concept work.
