(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULT OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this annual report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report. Our audited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.  OVERVIEW  NGFC Equities, Inc. ("we", "us", "our", "NGFC", "NGFC Equities" or the "Company") was incorporated in the State of Florida on October 2, 2013. Since inception, the Company has been engaged in organizational efforts and obtaining initial financing. The Company was formed to (i) construct and/or purchase and manage a chain of combined gasoline, diesel and natural gas (NG) fueling and service stations (initially, in the Miami, FL area); (ii) construct conversion factories to convert NG to liquefied natural gas (LNG) and compressed natural gas (CNG); and (iii) construct conversion factories to retrofit vehicles currently using gasoline or diesel fuel to also run on NG in the United States.  At a Board of Directors meeting held on February 16, 2015, the Company chose to diversify its operations by adding two additional divisions to its original business strategy to set up three divisions as follows:  1.  Energy and Retail Division  2.  Healthcare Division  3.  Consulting Division  As we have indicated in the Schedule 14C Information that we filed with the Security and Exchange Commission on January 26, 2015, we received our stockholder approval to change the name of our Company from "Natural Gas Fueling and Conversion Inc." to "NGFC Equities, Inc." to better reflect our strategy of diversification.  The reason for the change in our business strategy came about through many meetings we had with various business owners both in the energy and retail sectors (where our original focus was) and also in other business sectors. Since we began our operations, we identified owners of various businesses with promising upside potential who showed an interest in joining us under the transparency of our public company platform with us providing administrative tasks with those business owners continuing to operate their business, and thus we have chosen to diversify our business objectives to operate profitable businesses in industries other than the energy and retail industry, mostly through subsidiaries that will be managed by experienced operators with our company providing administrative assistance as the majority or 100% owner while continuing to focus on our original concept of setting up "Operating Units" in the energy sector as we get the funding to do so.  As part of this change in our strategy, the Company acquired 55% of the equity of ECI-LATAM Inc. ("ECIL") that was incorporated in the State of Florida on March 25, 2014 and is engaged in installation and performing maintenance and repairs of large medical equipment that deal in sterilization and disinfection. ECIL also sells spare parts, consumables and service contracts for medical establishments. As of now 100% of ECIL sales and services are performed outside the USA. Also 100% of the maintenance and repairs for the period of these financial statements have been done only for the medical equipment belonging to Getinge Group, a public company based in Sweden who manufacture and distribute their own large medical equipment.  In May 2015 ECIL set up an "Animal Health Division," to manufacture, package, market and distribute globally, an infection healing cream for dairy animals. In August 2015, this Animal Health Division was transferred to a separate corporation incorporated in the state of Florida entitled La Veles Inc. ("LVI") with NGFC owning 73% of LVI. La Veles was planning on setting up a factory in the Republic of Serbia to manufacture this cream with Mr. Goran Antic acting as the Chief Executive Officer of La Veles Inc. However, the activation of this strategy did not proceed smoothly and in order to save time and cost, the Board on January 23rd, 2016 decided to be involved only with distribution of this anti-infection cream and also let ECIL directly handle the work through ECIL and not get La Veles Inc. be involved with it. ECIL currently has no formal agreement with the manufacturer of this Cream to distribute it. Currently LVI remains an inactive 100% owned subsidiary of NGFC. The cost of setting up LVI and making it inactive had been minimal for us due to the expertise of our staff in forming the corporation, handling most administrative and filing obligations through our internal team.  On March 24, 2015, the Company set up NGFC Limited Partnership ("NGLP", "the Partnership") with the Company acting as the General Partner. One objective of the Partnership was to raise funds in the private market through any exempt offerings to acquire gasoline stations that the Partnership would lease back to the Company to earn a fixed return. The Partnership also has invested a portion of its funds in the financial markets. One of the  unique features of the Partnership is an option the limited partners to the partnership will have to convert 100% of their contributed capital regardless of the balance of the capital account to shares of NGFC at a pre-agreed strike price within a pre-agreed period.  On May 20, 2016 we filed a Form 8-K deconsolidating NGLP from NGFC because in the event the investment by NGLP in public company stocks to be more than 40% of the total assets, that may require us to register NGFC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which we would like to avoid since the purpose of NGFC is to acquire companies to operate through subsidiaries and not be a passive investor while it is more practical for NGLP to make a better return on the money NGLP is holding by investing in any alternative investments while NGLP still consider acquiring land and building that house operating gasoline stations to rent to Energy and Retail division of NGFC to get a fixed return on their money. NGFC gave 30-day written notice to all limited partners of NGLP on July 19, 2016 informing NGFC's intention to resign as the general partner of NGFC effective August 19, 2016. Concurrently to the above events, Andrew Weeraratne the CEO of NGFC was appointed as the general partner of NGLP.  Also the Board, on the meeting held on May 20, 2016 approved to keep the option the current Limited Partners of NGLP have as of May 20, 2016 to convert 100% of their capital to NGFC shares at $0.30 per shares by March 31, 2017 effective even after deconsolidation of NGLP. If this conversion feature was executed by all 14 limited partners then their total capital (if any of them did not withdraw prior to March 31, 2017) of $535,350 could be converted at $0.30 cents per share to 1,784,500 shares of Class A Common Stock of NGFC.  On May 18, 2015 we formed Vanguard Energy Inc. (VE) in San Clemente, California as 55% stockholder with an individual Michael Laub as 45% stockholder to conduct some of the business in our Energy and Retail Division through VE. Mr. Laub is the founder and Chief Executive Officer of CNG United LLC based in San Clemente, California that deals in training installation of engines for gasoline vehicles to run on Natural Gas as well as safety and maintenance of hybrid engines and vehicles. On the 23rd of January 2016, the Board of Directors decided to discontinue the operation of VE, due to recent price decline in gasoline and until we assess the cost benefit of the vehicle conversion division, and have Mr. Laub who currently manages CNG United LLC work as a consultant for NGFC. The financial cost of setting up and discontinuing VE had been minimal for us due to the expertise of our staff in forming the corporation, handling most administrative and filing obligations through our internal team.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  We have incurred recurring losses to date. Our financial statements do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation.  We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities.  Our consolidated net loss attributable to common shareholders for the fiscal year from October 1, 2015 to September 30, 2016 is $717,673 and income from discontinued operations for the same period is $75,790. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 we realized $550 in long term capital losses and $25,608 in short term capital gains and hold $9,796 in unrealized capital gains of stock and option position and generated $889 in dividend revenue. During the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016 we had revenue of $147,282, cost of goods sold of $80,922 and a gross profit of $66,360 and incurred operating expenses of $821,266.  Our consolidated net loss attributable to common shareholders for the fiscal year from October 1, 2014 to September 30, 2015 is $424,559. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 we realized $7,008 in short term gains and hold $28,352 in unrealized capital losses of stock and option position and generated $333 in dividend revenue. During the fiscal year ending September 30, 2015 we had revenue of $62,429, cost of goods sold of $60,222 and a gross profit of $2,207 and incurred operating expenses of $404,192. The increase in capital gain and the decrease in unrealized losses from fiscal year 2015 to 2016 reflect the increase in investment account especially in NGLP even taking into consideration that NGLP was deconsolidated in May 2016. Increase in revenue and the corresponding increase in gross profits reflects the full year operation of ECIL in 2016 as opposed to partial year operation of ECIL in fiscal year 2015.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  Our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, has included an explanatory paragraph in their opinion that accompanies our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2016, indicating that our current liquidity position raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to improve our liquidity position we may not be able to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result if we are unable to continue as a going concern and, therefore, be required to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities other than in the normal course of business which could cause investors to suffer the loss of all or a substantial portion of their investment.  As of September 30, 2016 our current assets were $90,976. Our current liabilities were $168,498. Stockholders' deficit was $142,816 and as of September 30, 2016 and noncontrolling interest were $71,289. The weighted average number of shares outstanding was 25,099,112 for the period from October 1, 2015 to September 30, 2016.  As of September 30, 2015 our current assets were $644,392. Our current liabilities were $68,094. Stockholders' equity was $521,707 as of September 30, 2015 and noncontrolling interest were $540,468. The weighted average number of shares outstanding was 22,137,706 for the period from October 1, 2014 to September 30, 2015.  We believe we will require approximately $5.8 million of available capital for each proposed Operational Unit in our Energy and Retail Division comprised of a combined gasoline, diesel and NG fueling service station along with a convenience store and a vehicle conversion station. Therefore at this juncture, we plan to acquire a currently operating small fuel station and operate it until we find capital to build our completed operational units. Our subsidiary in healthcare division currently making enough cash flow to survive on their own and will need only minimal amount of money to stay afloat.  On March 23, 2016, the Company executed an agreement for an Equity Line sale of $3,000,000 worth of NGFC shares to Southridge Partners II LP ("Southridge") at a 90% discount on $0.40 cents per share, the price at which our shares were sold last on OTCPink. Pursuant to this equity line we filed a S-1 on March 29, 20016 and subsequently a series of S-1/As (Amendments to the S-1) to get SEC effectiveness for Southridge to sell up to 7,500,000 shares of our Class A Common Stock for $3,000,000.  These 7,500,000 shares are defined as Put Shares that we will put to Southridge pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. Southridge may also be referred to in this document as the Selling Security Holder. The Purchase Agreement with Southridge provides that Southridge is committed to purchase up to $3 million of our common stock. We may draw on the facility from time to time, as and when we determine appropriate in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement. This portion was calculated as approximately 33% of the Company's public float as of March 29, 2016 when we file out initial prospectus with reference this equity line.  We issued a note for $50,000 to Southridge as payment with reference to this agreement. We have recorded that amount as Loan payable to Southridge on our balance sheet and have charged additional-paid-in-capital account correspondingly. This loan is payable in full with accrued interest at 7% per annum by December 31, 2016  We received the effectiveness from the SEC on August 9, 2016 to begin selling our shares to Southridge under this Equity Line.  We made a put notice to Southridge on August 11, 2016 pursuant to this equity line to purchase $360,000 worth of put shares. However, Southridge did not execute that put notice since, according to Southridge, our closing bid price as reported by closing bid price for the Company's common stock on the Principal Market on a Trading Day as reported by Bloomberg Finance L.P. was below 75% of the price at which we requested Southridge to purchase our stock.  Apart from the above stated equity line with Southridge, ccurrently we have no other commitments to raise additional funds. We plan to get funding to acquire such smaller fuel station from this equity line offering. If such capital does not become available from the proceeds of any future offering or other sources, we will be able to continue operations as a development stage company for approximately the next 12 months from available cash on  hand while seeking additional sources of capital. There can be no assurance that such additional capital will be available.  Cash Flows from Operating Activities  As stated elsewhere in this report we deconsolidated NGLP from our Company financial statement during this fiscal year. On our cash flow statements we chose the option to Combine cash flows from discontinued operations with cash flows from continuing operations within each cash flow category and add the cash and cash equivalents included in assets held for sale at the beginning and end of the period to the respective balances in the cash line item from the balance sheet and have reconciled the cash balance per cash flow statements with the cash balance per balance sheet as of September 30, 2015 on a note to the financial statements. Following table shows reconciliation of ending cash balance on the cash flow statement with the cash balance on the balance sheet:   Period Ended Sept 30, 2015 Reconciliation of Cash flow ending cash balance with cash balance in balance sheets Cash balance per cash flow statement $ 444,775 Cash portion held by deconsolidated entity (356,792) Cash balance per balance sheet $ 87,983  We have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities. For the year ended September 30, 2016, net cash flows used in operating activities was $100,443. For the year ended September 30, 2015, net cash flows used in operating activities was $87,635.  Cash Flows from Investing Activities  During the fiscal year September 2015, NGLP began an investment account with Interactive Brokers LLC and transferred $380,000 to the brokerage account to invest in various stocks. During the fiscal year 2014, NGFC opened an account with the same brokerage and transferred $80,000 in cash to the brokerage account. NGFC has withdrawn funds from the investment account as needed during this fiscal year.  During the fiscal year 2016, on a consolidated basis $39,947 was invested in stocks and options. The market value of those stocks and options with NGFC as of September 30, 2016 was $35.020.  During the fiscal year 2015, on a consolidated basis $207,469 was invested in stocks and options. The market value of those stocks and options with NGFC as of September 30, 2015 was $50,862. As we acquired ECI-LATAM Inc. in February 2015, we received $33,335 in cash in bank.  On May 20, 2016 we deconsolidated NGFC Limited Partnership (NGLP) of which we were the General Partner and received 30% of gains and hence have been consolidating with our company since the inception of NGLP March 24, 2015, since we decided to resign as the general partner allowing NGLP to function as an independent partnership without us managing its business. We have shown the deconsolidation of NGLP under the caption "Assets of discontinued operations" in our balance sheet as of September 30, 2015. NGLP did not have any liabilities.  Cash Flows from Financing Activities  We have financed our operations from the issuance of equity instruments. For the year ended September 30, 2016, net cash outflows from financing activities was $332,492 of which $50,000 consists of cash contribution to our  subsidiary by a minority owner and $18,554 pay back of stockholder loans.  For the year ended September 30, 2015, net cash flows from financing activities was $628,720 of which $146,201 received from issuance of registered common stock under our Direct Public Offering that was closed in July of 2015. Sale of subsidiary ownership interest consists of net $485,350 sold to NGFC Limited Partners plus the net of realized gain and unrealized loss $1,585 allocated to NGFC or a total of $486,935, $450 sold to minority partner of Vanguard Energy Inc. and $200 sold to minority partner of La Veles Inc.  PLAN OF OPERATION AND FUNDING  Following is a brief description of the activities which we have established to accomplish our short term and long term goals when we broke down our company to three divisions. We have not been able to find the capital to accomplish what we anticipated with this strategy and also due to the merger agreement we have signed this situation may change.  Energy and Retail Division  �  Located several existing gasoline stations with convenience stores in Miami, Florida as our potential acquisition targets after conducting due diligence and required audits.  �  Continued to talk with a business broker to seek out additional gasoline stations with convenience stores and garages for us to acquire.  Healthcare Division  �  Seek to expand our subsidiary ECI-LATAM Inc. to do maintenance work for major equipment being sold by other major manufacturers of medical equipment rather than maintaining only the medical equipment of the Swedish manufacturer Getinge Group as we do now.  �  Meet with more companies in synergistic areas such as Cell Therapy to cure cancer to acquire as subsidiaries of our company for us to break into this new industry.  We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances of securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with our planned growth of our business.  Our existing working capital, we believe is adequate for us to continue with our operation for about ----months. If we are successful in either borrowing funds (for which there is no assurance), and raise funds from any future offerings (for which there is no assurance) facilitating us to acquire smaller gasoline stations with convenience stores, and generate positive cash flow as we have forecasted, we believe that will enable us to fund our operations over the next 12 to 36 months. We believe it would cost us about $5.8 million to build one of our model Operational Units and that will require us to raise substantial capital. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements or any commitments from any sources to lend us funds or to buy our common stock.  We have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement and through a direct public offering of equity. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) developmental expenses associated with a start-up business and (ii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and debt issuances. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations.  MATERIAL COMMITMENTS  As of the date of this Annual Report, we do not have any material commitments.  PURCHASE OF SIGNIFICANT EQUIPMENT  We plan to acquire a small gasoline fueling station along with a convenience store, after performing the required audits, during the next twelve months provided we raise enough funds from a future offering. Also we may buy a portable NG fueling station to be installed in the premises of gasoline station that we would buy within the next twelve months.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  As of the date of this Annual Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.  RELATED PARTIES  A party is considered to be related to the Company if the party directly or indirectly or through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the Company. Related parties also include principal owners of the Company, its management, members of the immediate families of principal owners of the Company and its management and other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests. A party which can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or if it has an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests is also a related party.
