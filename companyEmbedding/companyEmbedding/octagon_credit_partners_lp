Octagon Credit Investors, LLC is a 20+ year old, $16.0B below-investment grade corporate credit investment adviser.  Octagon focuses on leveraged loans, high yield bonds and structured credit. Through fundamental credit analysis and active portfolio management, Octagon's investment team identifies attractive relative value opportunities across below-investment grade asset classes, sectors and issuers.

Over its history, the firm has applied a disciplined, repeatable and scalable approach in its effort to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns to its investors.
The firm was founded in 1994 as a separate business unit of Chemical Bank; in 1999, Octagon spun out from Chase Manhattan Bank.
