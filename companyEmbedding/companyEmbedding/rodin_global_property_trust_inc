Form 10-K
A 10-K is a comprehensive summary report of a company's performance that must be submitted annually to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Typically, the 10-K contains much more detail than the annual report. It includes information such as company history, organizational structure, equity, holdings, earnings per share, subsidiaries, etc. 

The 10-K must be filed within 60 days (it used to be 90 days) after the end of the fiscal year.
Form 10-K/A
Amended Form 10-K
Form 10-Q
The SEC form 10-Q is a comprehensive report of a company's performance that must be submitted quarterly by all public companies to the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the 10-Q, firms are required to disclose relevant information regarding their financial position. The form must be submitted on time, and the information should be available to all interested parties. 

The 10-Q is due 35 days (it used to be 45 days) after each of the first three fiscal quarters. There is no filing after the fourth quarter because that is when the 10-K is filed.
Form 10-Q/A
Amended Form 10-Q
Form 3
A document that must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by an insider affiliated with a public company's operation or by any investor owning 10% or more of the company's outstanding shares

This document must be filed with the SEC no later than 10 days after an insider becomes affiliated with a company, and it must be filed for each company in which a person is an insider, regardless of whether or not the insider has an equity position in the company at that time.
Form 3/A
Amended Form 3
Form 4
A Form 4 is a document that must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) whenever there is a material change in the holdings of company insiders. Insiders required to submit a Form 4 include directors and officers of the company as well as any shareholders owning 10% or more of the company's outstanding stock.

This two-page document covers any buy-and-sell orders on the open market as well as the exercise of company stock options. A Form 4 is mandatory within two business days starting from the end of the day the material transaction occurred. This filing is related to Form 3 and the Form 5, which also cover changes to the company insider holdings.
Form 4/A
Amended Form 4
Form 5
The annual statement of beneficial ownership of securities.
Form 5/A
Amended Form 5
Form 8-K
An 8-K is a report of unscheduled material events or corporate changes at a company that could be of importance to the shareholders or the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Examples of events reported on an 8-K include acquisition, bankruptcy, resignation of directors, or a change in the fiscal year. Also known as Form 8k.
Form D
A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) required for companies that are selling securities in reliance on a Regulation D exemption or Section 4(6) exemption provisions. 

Form D is a brief notice of a company's executive officers and stock promoters, in lieu of the regular reports required when no exemption under Regulation D exists. 

Form D must be filed no later than 15 days after the first sale of securities.

Form D is also known as the Notice of Sale of Securities and is a requirement under Regulation D, Section 4(6) and/or the Uniform Limited Offering Exemption of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933. 

This act, often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, requires that these registration forms, providing essential facts, are filed to disclose important information upon registration of a company's securities. This helps the SEC achieve the objectives of this act - requiring investors to receive significant information regarding securities offered and prohibiting fraud in the sale of the offered securities.
Form D/A
Amended Form D
Form DEF 14A
A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that must be filed by or on behalf of a registrant when a shareholder vote is required. SEC Form DEF 14A is most commonly used in conjunction with an annual meeting proxy. The form should provide security holders with sufficient information to allow them to make an informed vote at an upcoming security holders' meeting or to authorize a proxy to vote on their behalf. It includes information about the date, time and place of the meeting of security holders; revocability of proxy; dissenter's right of appraisal; persons making the solicitation; direct or indirect interest of certain persons in matters to be acted upon; modification or exchange of securities; financial statements; voting procedures; and other details. 

All other filed by non-management definitive proxy statements - typically an annual meeting proxy.

Form DEF 14A, which is also known as "definitive proxy statement", is required under Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This form is filed with the SEC when a definitive proxy statement is given to shareholders and helps the SEC ensure that shareholders' rights are upheld.
Form S-1
The SEC form S-1 is the initial registration form for new securities required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for public companies. Any security that meets the criteria must have an S-1 filing before shares can be listed on a national exchange. 

Form S-1 requires companies to provide information on the planned use of capital proceeds, detail the current business model and competition, as well provide a a brief prospectus of the planned security itself, offering price methodology, and any dilution that will occur to other listed securities. The SEC also requires the disclosure of any material business dealings between the company and its directors and outside counsel. 

Form S-1 is also known as the "Registration Statement Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1933". 

Investors can view S-1 filings online to perform due diligence on new offerings prior to their issue. The form is sometimes amended as material information changes or general market conditions cause a delay in the offering. 

The Securities Exchange Act of 1933, often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, requires that these registration forms are filed to disclose important information upon registration of a company's securities. This helps the SEC achieve the objectives of this act, which is requiring investors to receive significant information regarding securities offered, and to prohibit fraud in the sale of the offered securities. 

A less rigid registration form is the S-3, which is for companies that don't have the same ongoing reporting requirements.

The purpose and nature of the
business to be conducted by the Partnership is (i) to conduct
any business that may be lawfully conducted by a limited
partnership organized pursuant to the Act, provided, however, that
such business shall be limited to and conducted in such a manner as
to permit the General Partner at all times to qualify as a REIT,

in this Agreement), or one or more series of any of such Classes,
with such designations, preferences and relative, participating,
optional or other special rights, powers and duties, all as shall
be determined by the General Partner in its sole and absolute

General Partner shall make such revisions to this Agreement as it
deems necessary to reflect the issuance of such additional

the class of Partnership Units so issued; (ii) (a) the additional
Partnership Units are (x) Partnership Units so issued in connection

connection with an issuance of Preferred Shares, New Securities or

the foregoing, for example, the Partnership shall issue Partnership
Interests consisting of Class A Units to the General Partner in
connection with the issuance of Class A REIT Shares and shall issue
Partnership Interests consisting of Class I Units to the General
Partner in connection with the issuance of Class I REIT Shares and

the General Partner in connection with the issuance of Class T REIT

redemption or exchange of debt, Partnership Units or other
securities issued by the Partnership.

proceeds or other consideration received from the issuance of such
additional REIT Shares, Preferred Shares, Junior Shares or New
Securities, as the case may be, and from the exercise of the rights
contained in any such additional New Securities, to the Partnership
in exchange for (x) in the case of an issuance of REIT Shares,
Partnership Units (without limiting the foregoing, for example, the
Partnership shall issue Partnership Interests consisting of Class A
Units to the General Partner in connection with the issuance of
Class A REIT Shares and shall issue
 
18


Partnership Interests consisting of Class T
Units to the General Partner in connection with the issuance of
Class T REIT Shares), or (y) in the case of an issuance of
Preferred Shares, Junior Shares or New Securities, Partnership
Units with designations, preferences and other rights, terms and
provisions that are substantially the same as the designations,
preferences and other rights, terms and provisions of such

however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner
may issue REIT Shares, Preferred Shares, Junior Shares or New
Securities (a) pursuant to Section 8.5(b) hereof, (b) pursuant to a
dividend or distribution (including any stock split) of REIT
Shares, Preferred Shares, Junior Shares, or New Securities to all
of the holders of REIT Shares, Preferred Shares, Junior Shares or
New Securities, as the case may be, (c) upon a conversion,
redemption or exchange of Preferred Shares, (d) upon a conversion
of Junior Shares into REIT Shares, (e) upon a conversion,
redemption, exchange or exercise of New Securities, or (f) in
connection with an acquisition of a property or other asset to be
owned, directly or indirectly, by the General Partner if the
General Partner determines that such acquisition is in the best
interest of the Partnership. In the event of any issuance of
additional REIT Shares, Preferred Shares, Junior Shares, or New
Securities by the General Partner, and the contribution to the
Partnership, by the General Partner, of the cash proceeds or other
consideration received from such issuance, if the cash proceeds
actually received by the General Partner are less than the gross
proceeds of such issuance as a result of any underwriter’s
discount or other expenses paid or incurred in connection with such
issuance, then the General Partner shall be deemed to have made a
Capital Contribution to the Partnership in the amount equal to the
sum of the cash proceeds of such issuance plus the amount of such
underwriter’s discount and other expenses paid by the General
Partner (which discount and expense shall be treated as an expense
for the benefit of the Partnership), and any such expenses shall be
allocable solely to the Class of Partnership Units issued to the
General Partner at such time.

(d) The Partnership issued Special
Limited Partnership Units to an Affiliate of the Advisor in
exchange for the cash contribution reflected on
Exhibit A hereto and for services performed or to be
performed for the Partnership and its Subsidiaries, and admitted
such Person as the Special Limited Partner. The Special
Limited Partner shall be entitled to certain distributions as
provided in Section 5.2 and certain preferential allocations of
items of income and gain under Section 5.1. The Special
Limited Partnership Units will be subject to the transfer
restrictions set forth in Article 9 and will be subject to
redemption pursuant to Section 8.6.

cause the Partnership to obtain such funds from outside borrowings
or (ii) elect to have the General Partner or any of its
Affiliates provide such Additional Funds to the Partnership through
loans or otherwise, provided, however, that the Partnership may not
borrow money from its Affiliates, unless a majority of the
Directors of the General Partner (including a majority of
Independent Directors) not otherwise interested in such transaction
approve the transaction as being fair, competitive, and
commercially reasonable and no less favorable to the Partnership
than loans between unaffiliated parties under the same
circumstances.

and the special provisions of Sections 4.5, 5.1(e), and 8.6, LTIP

(b) The Partnership shall maintain
at all times a one-to-one correspondence between LTIP Units and
Limited Partnership Units for conversion, distribution and other
purposes, including without limitation complying with the following
procedures: If an Adjustment Event (as defined below) occurs,

Units. The following shall be “ Adjustment
Events: ” (A) the Partnership makes a distribution on all
outstanding Limited Partnership Units, (B) the Partnership
subdivides the outstanding Limited Partnership Units into a greater

Units into a smaller number of interests, or (C) the Partnership
issues any Limited Partnership Units or General Partnership Units
in exchange for its outstanding Limited Partnership Units by way or
reclassification or recapitalization of its Limited Partnership
Units. If more than one Adjustment Event occurs, the
adjustment to the LTIP Units need be made only once using a single
formula that takes into account each and every Adjustment Event as
if all Adjustment Events occurred simultaneously. For the
avoidance of doubt, the following shall not be Adjustment
Events: (x) the issuance of Limited Partnership Units or
General Partnership Units in a financing, reorganization,
acquisition or other similar business transaction, (y) the issuance
of Limited Partnership Units or General Partnership Units to any
employee benefit or compensation plan or distribution reinvestment
plan, or (z) the issuance of any Limited Partnership Units or
General Partnership Units to the General Partner in respect of a
capital contribution to the Partnership of proceeds from the sale
of securities by the General Partner. If the Partnership takes
an action affecting the Limited Partnership Units other than
actions specifically described above as Adjustment Events and in
the opinion of the General Partner such action would require an
adjustment to the LTIP Units to maintain the one-to-one
correspondence described above, the General Partner shall have the
right to make such adjustment to the LTIP Units, to the extent
permitted by law, in such manner and at such time as the General
Partner, in its sole discretion, may determine to be appropriate
under the circumstances. If an adjustment is made to the LTIP
Units as herein provided the Partnership shall promptly file in the
books and records of the Partnership an officer’s certificate
setting forth such adjustment and a brief statement of the facts
requiring such adjustment, which certificate shall be conclusive
evidence of the correctness of such adjustment absent manifest
error. Promptly after filing of such certificate, the
Partnership shall mail a notice to each LTIP Holder setting forth
the adjustment to its LTIP Units and the effective date of such
adjustment.

(c) The LTIP Units shall rank pari
passu with the Limited Partnership Units as to (i) the payment
of regular and special periodic or other distributions and, (ii)
provided that the Capital Accounts of the LTIP Units have been
equalized with those of the Limited Partnership
 
20


Units pursuant to the special allocations
contemplated by Section 5.1(e), distributions of assets upon
liquidation, dissolution or winding up. As to the payment of
distributions and as to distribution of assets upon liquidation,
dissolution or winding up, any class or series of Partnership Units
which by its terms specifies that it shall rank junior to, on
parity with, or senior to the Limited Partnership Units shall also
rank junior to, or pari passu with, or senior to, as the case may
be, the LTIP Units.

(d) LTIP Units shall be subject to
the following special provisions:

(i) LTIP Units may, in the sole
discretion of the General Partner, be issued subject to vesting,
forfeiture and additional restrictions on transfer pursuant to the
terms of a Vesting Agreement. The terms of any Vesting
Agreement may be modified by the General Partner from time to time
in its sole discretion, subject to any restrictions on amendment
imposed by the relevant Vesting Agreement, if applicable. LTIP
Units that have vested under the terms of a Vesting Agreement are
referred to as “ Vested LTIP Units; ” all other
LTIP Units shall be treated as “ Unvested LTIP Units
.” Subject to the terms of any Vesting Agreement, a LTIP
Holder shall be entitled to Transfer its LTIP Units to the same
extent, and subject to the same restrictions as holders of Limited
Partnership Units are entitled to Transfer their Limited
Partnership Units pursuant to Article 9.

(ii) Unless otherwise specified in
the Vesting Agreement, upon the occurrence of any event specified
in a Vesting Agreement as resulting in either the right of the
Partnership or the General Partner to repurchase LTIP Units at a
specified purchase price or some other forfeiture of any LTIP
Units, then if the Partnership or the General Partner exercises
such right to repurchase or forfeiture in accordance with the
applicable Vesting Agreement, then the relevant LTIP Units shall
immediately, and without further action, be treated as cancelled
and no longer outstanding for any purpose. Unless otherwise
specified in the Vesting Agreement, no consideration or other
payment shall be due with respect to any LTIP Units that have been
forfeited, other than any distributions declared with respect to a
Partnership Record Date prior to the effective date of the
forfeiture. In connection with any repurchase or forfeiture of
LTIP Units, the balance of the portion of the Capital Account of
the holder that is attributable to all of its LTIP Units shall be
reduced by the amount, if any, by which it exceeds the target
balance contemplated by Section 5.1(e), calculated with respect to
the holder’s remaining LTIP Units, if any.

(iii) LTIP Units shall generally be
treated as Limited Partnership Units for purposes of Article 5, but
shall also be entitled to certain special allocations of gain under
Section 5.1(e).

(iv) The Redemption Right provided
to Limited Partners under Section 8.5 shall not apply with
respect to LTIP Units unless and until they are converted to
Limited Partnership Units as provided in Section 4.5.

(v) Any certificate evidencing an
LTIP Unit shall bear an appropriate legend indicating that
additional terms, conditions and restrictions on Transfer,
including without limitation any Vesting Agreement, apply to the
LTIP Unit.
 
21



(vi) Vested LTIP Units are eligible
to be converted into Limited Partnership Units under Section
4.5.

4.5 Conversion of LTIP
Units.

(a) An LTIP Holder shall have the
right (the “ Conversion Right ”), at its option,
at any time to convert all or a portion of its Vested LTIP Units
into Limited Partnership Units; provided, however, that an LTIP
Holder may not exercise the Conversion Right for fewer than one
thousand (1,000) Vested LTIP Units or, if such LTIP Holder holds
fewer than one thousand (1,000) Vested LTIP Units, all of the LTIP
Holder’s Vested LTIP Units. LTIP Holders shall not have
the right to convert Unvested LTIP Units into Limited Partnership
Units until they become Vested LTIP Units; provided, however, that
when a LTIP Holder is notified of the expected occurrence of an
event that will cause its Unvested LTIP Units to become Vested LTIP
Units, such Person may give the Partnership a Conversion Notice
conditioned upon and effective as of the time of vesting, and such
Conversion Notice, unless subsequently revoked by the LTIP Holder,
shall be accepted by the Partnership subject to such
condition. The General Partner shall have the right at any
time to cause a conversion of Vested LTIP Units into Limited
Partnership Units. In all cases, the conversion of any LTIP
Units into Limited Partnership Units shall be subject to the
conditions and procedures set forth in this Section 4.5.

(b) A holder of Vested LTIP Units
may convert such interests into an equal number of fully paid and
non-assessable Limited Partnership Units, giving effect to all
adjustments (if any) made pursuant to Section
4.4(b). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event may a
holder of Vested LTIP Units convert an amount of Vested LTIP Units
that exceeds (x) the Economic Capital Account Balance of such
holder, to the extent attributable to its ownership of LTIP Units,
divided by (y) the Partnership Unit Economic Balance, in each case
as determined as of the effective date of conversion (the “
Capital Account Limitation ”).

(c) In order to exercise its
Conversion Right, a LTIP Holder shall deliver a notice (a “
Conversion Notice ”) to the Partnership (with a copy
to the General Partner) not less than 10 nor more than 60 days
prior to a date (the “ Conversion Date ”)
specified in such Conversion Notice; provided, however, that if the
General Partner has not given to the LTIP Holders notice of a
proposed or upcoming Transaction (as defined below) at least thirty
(30) days prior to the effective date of such Transaction, then the
LTIP Holders shall have the right to deliver a Conversion Notice
until the earlier of (x) the tenth (10 th )
day after such notice from the General Partner of a Transaction or
(y) the third business day immediately preceding the effective date
of such Transaction. A Conversion Notice shall be provided in
the manner provided in Section 12.1. Each LTIP Holder
covenants and agrees with the Partnership that all Vested LTIP
Units to be converted pursuant to this Section 4.5 shall be free
and clear of all liens. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, a LTIP Holder may deliver a Redemption Notice pursuant to
Section 8.5 relating to those Limited Partnership Units that will
be issued to such holder upon conversion of such LTIP Units into
Limited Partnership Units in advance of the Conversion Date;
provided, however, that the redemption of such Limited Partnership
Units by the Partnership shall in no event take place until after
the Conversion Date. For clarity, it is noted that the
objective of this paragraph is to put an LTIP Holder in a position
where, if he or she so wishes, the Limited Partnership Units into
which its Vested LTIP Units will be converted can be redeemed by
the Partnership simultaneously with such conversion, with the
further
 
22


consequence that, if the General Partner elects
to assume the Partnership’s redemption obligation with
respect to such Limited Partnership Units under Section 8.5 by
delivering to such holder REIT Shares rather than cash, then such
holder can have REIT Shares issued to it simultaneously with the
conversion of its Vested LTIP Units into Limited Partnership
Units. The General Partner shall cooperate with an LTIP Holder
to coordinate the timing of the different events described in the
foregoing sentence.

(d) The Partnership, at any time at
the election of the General Partner, may cause any number of Vested
LTIP Units held by an LTIP Holder to be converted (a “
Forced Conversion ”) into an equal number of Limited
Partnership Units, giving effect to all adjustments (if any) made
pursuant to Section 4.4(b); provided, that the Partnership may not
cause a Forced Conversion of any LTIP Units that would not at the
time be eligible for conversion at the option of such LTIP Holder
pursuant to paragraph (b) above. In order to exercise its
right of Forced Conversion, the Partnership shall deliver a notice
(a “ Forced Conversion Notice ”) to the
applicable holder not less than 10 nor more than 60 days prior to
the Conversion Date specified in such Forced Conversion
Notice. A Forced Conversion Notice shall be provided in the
manner provided in Section 12.1.

(e) A conversion of Vested LTIP
Units for which a holder has given a Conversion Notice or the
Partnership has given a Forced Conversion Notice shall occur
automatically after the close of business on the applicable
Conversion Date without any action on the part of such LTIP Holder,
as of which time such LTIP Holder shall be credited on the books
and records of the Partnership with the issuance as of the opening
of business on the next day of an equal number of Limited
Partnership Units issuable upon such conversion. After the
conversion of LTIP Units as aforesaid, the Partnership shall
deliver to such LTIP Holder, upon its written request, a
certificate of the General Partner certifying its Limited
Partnership Units and remaining LTIP Units, if any, immediately
after such conversion.

(f) For purposes of making future
allocations under Section 5.1(e) and applying the Capital Account
Limitation, the portion of the Economic Capital Account balance of
the applicable holder that is treated as attributable to its LTIP
Units shall be reduced, as of the date of conversion, by the
product of the number of LTIP Units converted and the Limited
Partnership Unit Economic Balance.

(g) If the Partnership or the
General Partner shall be a party to any transaction (including
without limitation a merger, consolidation, interest exchange, self
tender offer for all or substantially all Limited Partnership Units
or other business combination or reorganization, or sale of all or
substantially all of the Partnership’s assets, but excluding
any transaction which constitutes an Adjustment Event), in each
case as a result of which Limited Partnership Units shall be
exchanged for or converted into the right, or the holders of such
interests shall otherwise be entitled, to receive cash, securities
or other property or any combination thereof (each of the foregoing
being referred to herein as a “ Transaction ”),
then the General Partner shall, immediately prior to the
Transaction, exercise its right to cause a Forced Conversion with
respect to the LTIP Units then eligible for conversion, taking into
account any allocations that occur in connection with the
Transaction or that would occur in connection with the Transaction
if the assets of the Partnership were sold at the Transaction price
or, if applicable, at a value determined by the General Partner in
good faith using the value attributed to the Partnership Units in
the context of the Transaction (in which case the Conversion Date
shall be the effective date of the Transaction).
 
23



In anticipation of such Forced
Conversion and the consummation of the Transaction, the Partnership
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each LTIP Holder
to be afforded the right to receive in connection with such
Transaction in consideration for the Limited Partnership Units into
which its LTIP Units will be converted into the same kind and
amount of cash, securities, and other property (or any combination
thereof) receivable upon the consummation of such transaction by a
holder of the same number of Limited Partnership Units, assuming
such holder of Limited Partnership Units is not a Person with which
the Partnership consolidated or into with the Partnership merged or
which merged into the Partnership or to which such sale or transfer
was made, as the case may be (a “ Constituent Person
”), or an affiliate of a Constituent Person. In the
event that holders of Limited Partnership Units have the
opportunity to elect the form or type of consideration to be
received upon consummation of the Transaction, prior to such
Transaction the General Partner shall give prompt written notice to
each LTIP Holder of such election and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to afford such holders the right to elect, by
written notice to the General Partner, the form or type of
consideration to be received upon conversion of the LTIP Units held
by such holder into Limited Partnership Units in connection with
such Transaction. If an LTIP Holder fails to make such an
election, such LTIP Holder (and any of its transferees) shall
receive upon conversion of the LTIP Units held by it (or by any of
its transferees) the same kind and amount of consideration that a
holder of Limited Partnership Units would receive if such holder of
Limited Partnership Units failed to make such an
election.

Subject to the rights of the
Partnership and the General Partner under any Vesting Agreement,
the Partnership shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the terms of the Transaction to be consistent with the provisions
of this Section 4.5 and to enter into an agreement with the
successor or purchasing entity, as the case may be, for the benefit
of any LTIP Holders whose LTIP Units will not be converted into
Limited Partnership Units in connection with the Transaction that
will (i) contain provisions enabling the LTIP Holders with
outstanding LTIP Units after such Transaction to convert their LTIP
Units into securities as comparable as reasonably possible under
the circumstances to Limited Partnership Units and (ii) preserve as
far as reasonably possible under the circumstances the
distribution, special allocation, conversion, and other rights set
forth in the Agreement for the benefit of LTIP Holders.

4.6 Capital Accounts.

(a) The Partnership shall maintain
for each Partner a separate Capital Account in accordance with the
rules of Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv). Each
Partner’s Capital Account shall be increased by (i) the
amount of such Partner’s Capital Contributions and
(ii) Profit allocated to such Partner and all items of
Partnership income and gain allocated to such Partner pursuant to
Sections 5.1(c), 5.1(d) and 5.1(e) and decreased by (x) the amount
of cash or Agreed Value of all actual and deemed distributions of
cash or property made to such Partner pursuant to this Agreement
and (y) Loss allocated to such Partner and all items of Partnership
deduction and loss allocated to such Partner pursuant to Section
5.1(c).
 
24



(b) In the event any interest in the
Partnership is Transferred in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, the transferee shall succeed to the Capital Account of
the transferor to the extent it relates to the transferred
interest.

(c) The provisions of the Agreement
relating to the maintenance of Capital Accounts are intended to
comply with Regulations Section 1.704-1(b), and shall be
interpreted and applied in a manner consistent with such
Regulations. In the event the General Partner shall determine
that it is prudent to modify the manner in which the Capital
Accounts, or any debits or credits thereto (including, without
limitation, debits or credits relating to liabilities which are
secured by contributed or distributed property or which are assumed
by the Partnership, the General Partner, or the Limited Partners)
are computed in order to comply with such Regulations, the General
Partner may make such modification, provided that it is not
likely to have a material effect on the amounts distributable to
any Person upon the dissolution of the Partnership. The
General Partner also shall (i) make any adjustments that are
necessary or appropriate to maintain equality between the Capital
Accounts of the Partners and the amount of Partnership capital
reflected on the Partnership’s balance sheet, as computed for
book purposes, in accordance with Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(g) and (ii) make appropriate modifications in the
event that unanticipated events might otherwise cause this
Agreement not to comply with Regulations Section 1.704-1(b) or
1.704-2.

4.7 No Interest on
Contributions.

No Partner shall be entitled to
interest on its Capital Contribution.

4.8 Return of Capital
Contributions.

No Partner shall be entitled to
withdraw any part of its Capital Contribution or its Capital
Account or to receive any distribution from the Partnership, except
as specifically provided in this Agreement. Except as
otherwise provided herein, there shall be no obligation to return
to any Partner or withdrawn Partner any part of such
Partner’s Capital Contribution for so long as the Partnership
continues in existence.

4.9 No Third Party
Beneficiary.

No creditor or other third party
having dealings with the Partnership shall have the right to
enforce the right or obligation of any Partner to make Capital
Contributions or loans or to pursue any other right or remedy
hereunder or at law or in equity, it being understood and agreed
that the provisions of this Agreement shall be solely for the
benefit of, and may be enforced solely by, the parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns. None of the rights or
obligations of the Partners herein set forth to make Capital
Contributions or loans to the Partnership shall be deemed an asset
of the Partnership for any purpose by any creditor or other third
party, nor may such rights or obligations be sold, transferred or
assigned by the Partnership or pledged or encumbered by the
Partnership to secure any debt or other obligation of the
Partnersh
