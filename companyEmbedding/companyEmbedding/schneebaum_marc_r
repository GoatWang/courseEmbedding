Job Details
               Sensors for Medicine and Science, Inc. ® (SMSI®) is developing new, broadly enabling, optical chemical sensing technologies. These patented technologies permit highly sensitive detection and measurement of molecules of significant commercial interest to the medical, industrial, and environmental communities. SMSI's technology platform enables performance that surpasses that of existing sensor technologies, and permits the development of new sensor applications. Significant advances achieved by the SMSI technology platform include:high sensitivityvery fast response timeslow power consumptionease of miniaturizationhigh-volume manufacturabilityhigh reliabilityA key breakthrough is the ability to achieve high sensitivity and fast response times simultaneously. The technology is potentially applicable to a wide range of molecules to be measured (analytes). Medically relevant analytes, for example, include glucose, oxygen, carbon dioxide, pH, nitric oxide, lactate, and anesthetic gases. There are also large market opportunities for sensing many of these analytes outside the medical field. The Company has two lead products:A miniature oxygen sensor , currently commercialized in a handheld metabolic monitor; andA miniature, implantable glucose sensor, currently under development for continuous, non-invasive glucose monitoring for people with diabetes. Read more about these in our Products Section . The trend in health care towards disease management has been fueled by the availability of new and improved diagnostic technologies.
