(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  The discussion of our results of operations reported in the unaudited, consolidated statements of operations compares the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 with the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013. The results of operations discussion is combined for Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. and Tanger Properties Limited Partnership because the results are virtually the same for both entities. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report. Historical results and percentage relationships set forth in the unaudited, consolidated statements of operations, including trends which might appear, are not necessarily indicative of future operations. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the term, "Company", refers to Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. and subsidiaries and the term, "Operating Partnership", refers to Tanger Properties Limited Partnership and subsidiaries. The terms "we", "our" and "us" refer to the Company or the Company and the Operating Partnership together, as the text requires.  Cautionary Statements  Certain statements made below are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Forward-looking statements, which are based on certain assumptions and describe our future plans, strategies, beliefs and expectations, are generally identifiable by use of the words "believe", "expect", "intend", "anticipate", "estimate", "project", or similar expressions. Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our: future issuances of equity and debt and the expected use of proceeds from such issuances; potential sales or purchases of outlet centers; anticipated liquidity and working capital; new outlet center developments; and real estate joint ventures. You should not rely on forward-looking statements since they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which are, in some cases, beyond our control and which could materially affect our actual results, performance or achievements. Factors which may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, but are not limited to, our inability to develop new outlet centers or expand existing outlet centers successfully; risks related to the economic performance and market value of our outlet centers; the relative illiquidity of real property investments; impairment charges affecting our properties; competition for the acquisition and development of outlet centers, and our inability to complete outlet centers we have identified; environmental regulations affecting our business; our dependence on rental income from real property; our dependence on the results of operations of our retailers; the fact that certain of our properties are subject to ownership interests held by third parties, whose interests may conflict with ours; risks related to uninsured losses; the risk that consumer, travel, shopping and spending habits may change; risks associated with debt financing; our potential failure to qualify as a REIT; our legal obligation to make distributions to our shareholders; our dependence on distributions from the Operating Partnership to meet our financial obligations, including dividends; the risk of a cyber-attack or an act of cyber-terrorism; and those factors set forth under Item 1A - "Risk Factors" in the Company's and the Operating Partnership's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013.

The average annual straight-line rent disclosed in the table above includes all concessions, abatements and reimbursements of rent to tenants. The average tenant allowance disclosed in the table above includes landlord costs.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  NET INCOME  In addition equity in earnings in unconsolidated joint ventures was higher in 2013 primarily due to transactions at the Deer Park property prior to our acquisition of an additional one-third interest. As a part of the refinance of the debt at Deer Park, a gain on early extinguishment of debt of $13.8 million was recorded. In addition a lawsuit was settled which resulted in income to Deer Park of approximately $9.5 million after expenses. Our one-third share of these transactions, recorded through equity in earnings prior to the acquisition, was approximately $7.8 million.  BASE RENTALS Base rentals increased $5.3 million, or 8%, in the 2014 period compared to the 2013 period. The following table sets forth the changes in various components of base rentals (in thousands): 2014 2013 Change Base rentals from existing properties $ 64,134 $ 62,342 $ 1,792 Base rentals from 2013 acquisition 5,980 2,044 3,936 Termination fees 121 36 85 Amortization of above and below market rent adjustments, net (623 ) (121 ) (502 ) $ 69,612 $ 64,301 $ 5,311  Base rental income generated from existing properties in our portfolio increased due to increases in rental rates on lease renewals and incremental rents from re-tenanting vacant spaces, as well as incremental base rental income from the expansion at our Sevierville and Charleston centers.  At September 30, 2014, the combined net value representing the amount of unamortized above market lease assets and below market lease liability values, recorded as a part of the purchase price of acquired properties, was a net above market lease asset which totaled approximately $8.7 million. If a tenant terminates its lease prior to the contractual termination of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance of the related above or below market lease value would be written off and could materially impact our net income positively or negatively. The change in the amortization of above and below market lease values was attributable to the market lease values recorded from the 2013 acquisition.  PERCENTAGE RENTALS Percentage rentals decreased $450,000, or 15%, in the 2014 period compared to the 2013 period. The following table sets forth the changes in various components of base rentals (in thousands): 2014 2013 Change Percentage rentals from existing properties $ 2,456 $ 3,055 $ (599 ) Percentage rentals from 2013 acquisition 178 29 149 $ 2,634 $ 3,084 $ (450 )  Percentage rentals represents revenues based on a percentage of tenants' sales volume above predetermined levels ("contractual breakpoints"). The decrease in percentage rentals is primarily a function of tenants renewing leases with higher base rents, and accordingly, higher contractual breakpoints. Reported tenant comparable sales for our consolidated properties for the rolling twelve months ended September 30, 2014 increased approximately 1% to $387 per square foot. Reported tenant comparable sales is defined as the weighted average sales per square foot reported in space open for the full duration of each comparison period.  EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENTS Expense reimbursements increased $2.0 million, or 7%, in the 2014 period compared to the 2013 period.

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  ACQUISITION COSTS The 2013 period included costs related to the acquisition of the additional ownership interest in the Deer Park property. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION Depreciation and amortization increased $1.6 million, or 6%, in the 2014 period compared to the 2013 period. The following table sets forth the changes in various components of depreciation and amortization (in thousands): 2014 2013 Change Depreciation and amortization expenses from existing properties $ 22,162 $ 22,351 $ (189 ) Depreciation and amortization expenses from 2013 acquisition 3,612 1,872 1,740 $ 25,774 $ 24,223 $ 1,551  Depreciation and amortization costs decreased at existing properties as certain construction and development related assets, as well as lease related intangibles recorded as part of the acquisition price of acquired properties, which are amortized over shorter lives, became fully depreciated during the reporting periods.  INTEREST EXPENSE  CASUALTY GAIN  GAIN ON PREVIOUSLY HELD INTEREST IN ACQUIRED JOINT VENTURE  EQUITY IN EARNINGS OF UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES  Comparison of the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to the nine months ended September 30, 2013  NET INCOME  In addition equity in earnings in unconsolidated joint ventures was higher in 2013 primarily due to transactions at the Deer Park property prior to our acquisition of an additional one-third interest. As a part of the refinance of the debt at Deer Park, a gain on early extinguishment of debt of $13.8 million was recorded. In addition a lawsuit was settled which resulted in income to Deer Park of approximately $9.5 million after expenses. Our one-third share of these transactions, recorded through equity in earnings prior to the acquisition, was approximately $7.8 million.  BASE RENTALS Base rentals increased $20.2 million, or 11%, in the 2014 period compared to the 2013 period.

Termination fees increased compared to the 2014 period due to a tenant that exited the outlet industry and terminated their leases prior to the end of their contractual obligation.  At September 30, 2014, the combined net value representing the amount of unamortized above market lease assets and below market lease liability values, recorded as a part of the purchase price of acquired properties, was a net above market lease asset which totaled approximately $8.7 million.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  The discussion of our results of operations reported in the unaudited, consolidated statements of operations compares the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013 with the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012. The results of operations discussion is combined for Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. and Tanger Properties Limited Partnership because the results are virtually the same for both entities. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report. Historical results and percentage relationships set forth in the unaudited, consolidated statements of operations, including trends which might appear, are not necessarily indicative of future operations. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the term, "Company", refers to Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. and subsidiaries and the term, "Operating Partnership", refers to Tanger Properties Limited Partnership and subsidiaries. The terms "we", "our" and "us" refer to the Company or the Company and the Operating Partnership together, as the text requires.  Cautionary Statements  Certain statements made below are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. We intend for such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995 and included this statement for purposes of complying with these safe harbor provisions. Forward-looking statements, which are based on certain assumptions and describe our future plans, strategies, beliefs and expectations, are generally identifiable by use of the words "believe", "expect", "intend", "anticipate", "estimate", "project", or similar expressions. You should not rely on forward-looking statements since they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which are, in some cases, beyond our control and which could materially affect our actual results, performance or achievements. Factors which may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, but are not limited to, those set forth under Item 1A - "Risk Factors" in the Company's and the Operating Partnership's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012. There have been no material changes to the risk factors listed there through September 30, 2013.  General Overview At September 30, 2013, we had 37 consolidated outlet centers in 24 states totaling 11.5 million square feet. The table below details our development activities at consolidated centers that significantly impacted our results of operations and liquidity from January 1, 2012 to September 30, 2013.

The average annual straight-line rent disclosed in the table above includes all concessions, abatements and reimbursements of rent to tenants. The average tenant allowance disclosed in the table above includes landlord costs.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  NET INCOME  Net income increased $40.0 million in the 2013 period to $56.2 million as compared to $16.2 million for the 2012 period. The increase in net income was attributable to an increase in base rentals from internal growth within our existing portfolio, the acquisition of a controlling interest in the property in Deer Park, NY on August 30, 2013, which caused us to consolidate the property for financial reporting purposes, and the addition of several expansions within our portfolio at existing properties since October 1, 2012. In addition, our equity in earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures increased $9.6 million, primarily due to a gain on early extinguishment of debt and the settlement of a lawsuit at Deer Park prior to our acquiring a controlling interest. In association with the acquisition, we recorded a gain of $26.0 million representing the difference between the recorded value and the fair market value of our original equity interest.  BASE RENTALS Base rentals increased $4.6 million, or 8%, in the 2013 period compared to the 2012 period. The following table sets forth the changes in various components of base rentals (in thousands): 2013 2012 Change Existing property base rentals $ 62,342 $ 59,467 $ 2,875 Base rentals from acquired properties 2,044 - 2,044 Termination fees 36 22 14 Amortization of above and below market rent adjustments, net (121 ) 173 (294 ) $ 64,301 $ 59,662 $ 4,639  Base rental income generated from existing properties in our portfolio increased due to increases in rental rates on lease renewals and incremental rents from re-tenanting vacant spaces.  Amortization of above and below market lease values decreased due to leases from prior year acquisitions becoming fully amortized during the period from October 1, 2012 to September 30, 2013. In addition, the purchase price allocation of the Deer Park acquisition resulted in an above market asset of approximately $6.1 million.  At September 30, 2013, the net asset representing the amount of unrecognized, combined above and below market lease values, recorded as a part of the purchase price of acquired properties, totaled approximately $11.3 million. If a tenant terminates its lease prior to the contractual termination of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance of the related above or below market lease value will be written off and could materially impact our net income positively or negatively.  PERCENTAGE RENTALS  Percentage rentals, which represent revenues based on a percentage of tenants' sales volume above predetermined levels, decreased $96,000, or 3%, from the 2012 period to the 2013 period. The decrease in percentage rentals is directly related to a slow down in the increase in tenant sales productivity in the 2013 period as compared to the 2012 period. Reported tenant comparable sales for our consolidated properties for the rolling twelve months ended September 30, 2013 increased approximately 1% to $384 per square foot. Reported tenant comparable sales is defined as the weighted average sales per square foot reported in space open for the full duration of each comparison period. The following table sets forth the changes in various components of percentage rentals (in thousands):   2013 2012 Change Existing property percentage rentals $ 3,055 $ 3,180 $ (125 ) Percentage rentals from acquired properties 29 - 29 $ 3,084 $ 3,180 $ (96 )  EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENTS Expense reimbursements increased $2.5 million, or 10%, in the 2013 period compared to the 2012 period. The following table sets forth the changes in various components of expense reimbursements (in thousands): 2013 2012 Change Existing property expense reimbursements $ 26,257 $ 24,908 $ 1,349 Property expense reimbursements from acquired properties 1,157 - 1,157 $ 27,414 $ 24,908 $ 2,506  Expense reimbursements, which represent the contractual recovery from tenants of certain common area maintenance, insurance, property tax, promotional, advertising and management expenses, generally fluctuate consistently with the reimbursable property operating expenses to which they relate.  OTHER INCOME Other income increased $371,000, or 14%, in the 2013 period as compared to the 2012 period. The majority of the increase is due to the incremental fees earned from the unconsolidated joint ventures that were added to the portfolio during the fourth quarter of 2012. The following table sets forth the changes in various components of other income (in thousands): 2013 2012 Change Existing property other income $ 3,045 $ 2,733 $ 312 Other income from acquired properties 59 - 59 $ 3,104 $ 2,733 $ 371  PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES Property operating expenses increased $2.2 million, or 8%, in the 2013 period as compared to the 2012 period. The increase is due primarily to the addition of the Deer Park property to the consolidated portfolio. The following table sets forth the changes in various components of property operating expenses (in thousands): 2013 2012 Change Existing property operating expenses $ 28,027 $ 27,614 $ 413 Property operating expenses from acquired properties 1,836 - 1,836 $ 29,863 $ 27,614 $ 2,249  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  General and administrative expenses increased $736,000, or 8%, in the 2013 period compared to the 2012 period. This increase was mainly due to additional share-based compensation expense related to the 2013 grants of restricted shares to directors and certain officers of the Company and the grant of performance shares to executive officers under a new long term incentive plan. Also, the 2013 period included higher payroll related expenses on a comparative basis to the 2012 period due to the addition of new employees since October 1, 2012.  ACQUISITION COSTS  The 2013 period includes costs related to the acquisition of the additional ownership interest in the Deer Park property during the period as well as costs from other potential acquisitions of operating properties.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION Depreciation and amortization decreased $586,000, or 2%, in the 2013 period compared to the 2012 period as certain construction and development related assets, as well as lease related intangibles recorded as part of the acquisition price of acquired properties, which are amortized over shorter lives, became fully depreciated during the reporting periods. The following table sets forth the changes in various components of depreciation and amortization (in thousands): 2013 2012 Change Existing property depreciation and amortization expenses $ 22,351 $ 24,809 $ (2,458 ) Depreciation and amortization expenses from acquired properties 1,872 - 1,872 $ 24,223 $ 24,809 $ (586 )  GAIN ON PREVIOUSLY HELD INTEREST IN ACQUIRED JOINT VENTURE  In August 2013, we acquired an additional one-third ownership interest in the Deer Park property, bringing our total ownership to a two-thirds interest. With the acquisition of a controlling interest, we have consolidated the property for financial reporting purposes since the acquisition date. The acquisition resulted in a gain of approximately $26.0 million, representing the difference between the recorded value and the fair market value of our original equity interest.  EQUITY IN EARNINGS (LOSSES) OF UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES  Equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated joint ventures increased approximately $9.6 million in the 2013 period compared to the 2012 period. The primary reasons for the increase were related to the transactions at the Deer Park property prior to our acquisition of an additional one-third interest in the property and its subsequent consolidation for financial reporting purposes. As a part of the refinance of the debt at Deer Park, a gain on early extinguishment of debt of $13.8 million was recorded. In addition, prior to the acquisition, the partnership settled a lawsuit with a third party which resulted in income to Deer Park of approximately $9.5 million after expenses. Our one-third share of these transactions, recorded through equity in earnings prior to the acquisition, was approximately $7.8 million. Incremental earnings from the addition of four centers held in unconsolidated joint ventures during the fourth quarter of 2012 accounted for the remainder of the increase.  Comparison of the nine months ended September 30, 2013 to the nine months ended September 30, 2012  NET INCOME  Net income increased $52.7 million in the 2013 period to $90.2 million as compared to $37.5 million for the 2012 period. The increase in net income was attributable to an increase in base rentals of $9.1 million from internal growth within our existing portfolio, the acquisition of a controlling interest in the property in Deer Park, NY on August 30, 2013, which caused us to consolidate the property for financial reporting purposes, and the addition of several expansions within our portfolio at existing properties since October 1, 2012. In addition, our equity in earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures increased $13.0 million, due to a gain on early extinguishment of debt and the settlement of a lawsuit at Deer Park prior to our acquiring a controlling interest, as well as incremental earnings from the addition of four centers held in unconsolidated joint ventures to the portfolio during the fourth quarter of 2012. In association with the acquisition, we recorded a gain of $26.0 million representing the difference between the recorded value and the fair market value of our original equity interest. Finally our depreciation and amortization decreased $6.6 million due to certain construction and development related assets and lease related intangibles recorded as part of the acquisition price of acquired properties, which are amortized over shorter lives, became fully depreciated during the reporting periods.  BASE RENTALS Base rentals increased $9.1 million, or 5%, in the 2013 period compared to the 2012 period. The following table sets forth the changes in various components of base rentals (in thousands): 2013 2012 Change Existing property base rentals $ 182,409 $ 173,754 $ 8,655 Base rentals from acquired properties 2,044 - 2,044 Termination fees 186 880 (694 ) Amortization of above and below market rent adjustments, net (48 ) 830 (878 ) $ 184,591 $ 175,464 $ 9,127  Base rental income generated from existing properties in our portfolio increased due to increases in rental rates on lease renewals and incremental rents from re-tenanting vacant spaces.  Termination fees decreased due to the 2012 period containing a tenant that exited the outlet industry and terminated their leases prior to the end of their contractual obligation.  Amortization of above and below market lease values decreased due to leases from prior year acquisitions becoming fully amortized during the period from October 1, 2012 to September 30, 2013. In addition, the purchase price allocation of the Deer Park acquisition resulted in an above market asset of approximately $6.1 million.  At September 30, 2013, the net asset representing the amount of unrecognized, combined above and below market lease values, recorded as a part of the purchase price of acquired properties, totaled approximately $11.3 million. If a tenant terminates its lease prior to the contractual termination of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance of the related above or below market lease value will be written off and could materially impact our net income positively or negatively.  PERCENTAGE RENTALS  Percentage rentals, which represent revenues based on a percentage of tenants' sales volume above predetermined levels, the breakpoint, increased $414,000, or 6%, from the 2012 period to the 2013 period. The increase in percentage rentals is directly related to higher tenant sales productivity, the majority of which occurred during the first six months of 2013. Reported tenant comparable sales for our consolidated properties for the rolling twelve months ended September 30, 2013 increased 1% to $384 per square foot. Reported tenant comparable sales is defined as the weighted average sales per square foot reported in space open for the full duration of each comparison period. The following table sets forth the changes in various components of percentage rentals (in thousands):   2013 2012 Change Existing property percentage rentals $ 6,927 $ 6,542 $ 385 Percentage rentals from acquired properties 29 - 29 $ 6,956 $ 6,542 $ 414  EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENTS Expense reimbursements increased $4.8 million, or 6%, in the 2013 period compared to the 2012 period. The following table sets forth the changes in various components of expense reimbursements (in thousands): 2013 2012 Change Existing property expense reimbursements $ 77,299 $ 73,499 $ 3,800 Property expense reimbursements from acquired properties 1,157 - 1,157 Termination fees allocated to expense reimbursements 88 278 (190 ) $ 78,544 $ 73,777 $ 4,767  Expense reimbursements, which represent the contractual recovery from tenants of certain common area maintenance, insurance, property tax, promotional, advertising and management expenses, generally fluctuate consistently with the reimbursable property operating expenses to which they relate.  OTHER INCOME Other income increased $1.2 million, or 20%, in the 2013 period as compared to the 2012 period. The majority of the increase is due to the incremental fees earned from the unconsolidated joint ventures that were added to the portfolio during the fourth quarter of 2012. The following table sets forth the changes in various components of other income (in thousands): 2013 2012 Change Existing property other income $ 7,457 $ 6,278 $ 1,179 Other income from acquired properties 59 - 59 $ 7,516 $ 6,278 $ 1,238  PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES Property operating expenses increased $5.1 million, or 6%, in the 2013 period as compared to the 2012 period. Existing property operating expenses increased in the 2013 period compared to the 2012 period as a result of higher common area maintenance costs for various projects and an increase in snow removal expenditures. The following table sets forth the changes in various components of property operating expenses (in thousands): 2013 2012 Change Existing property operating expenses $ 84,983 $ 81,679 $ 3,304 Property operating expenses from acquired properties 1,836 - 1,836 $ 86,819 $ 81,679 $ 5,140  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  . . .
