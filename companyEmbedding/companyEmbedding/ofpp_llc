What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The proposed policy letter provides guidance on green purchasing policies and strategies. It requires agencies to identify opportunities and give preference to the acquisition of green products and services, including but not limited to: (1) Alternative fuels and alternative fuel vehicles and hybrids; (2) biobased products; (3) Energy Star® and Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP)-designated products; (4) environmentally-preferable products and services; (5) electronics registered on the Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool; (6) low or no toxic or hazardous chemicals or materials or products; (7) non-ozone depleting substances; (8) recycled-content and/or remanufactured products; (9) renewable energy; and (10) water-efficient products. 
In addition, the proposed policy letter:

Requires agencies to first consider mandatory and preferred sources to obtain green products and services that meet their performance needs, and Start Printed Page 73905where these sources are unable to meet their needs, to purchase green products and services from other sources. 
Requires agencies to implement automatic substitution policies for the purchase of functionally equivalent green products and services in place of non-green products and services ordered through central supply agencies. 
Requires GSA, DLA, and other central supply agencies to supply designated green products and phase out any competing non-green products from their catalogs and on-line ordering systems. Agencies are encouraged in their comments to identify anticipated needs for non-green products listed in Federal catalogs and on-line ordering systems that may extend beyond January 1, 2010 where green products are currently available. 
Requires agencies to include requirements and preferences for the use of green products in all new service contracts and other existing service contracts as they are recompeted and encourages agencies to incorporate these requirements and preferences into existing contracts as they are modified or extended through options. 
Discusses agencies' responsibilities for accurate, complete, and timely reporting.

3. Applicability. This Letter applies to all executive agencies. 
4. Rescission. This policy letter rescinds Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) Policy Letter 92-4, Procurement of Environmentally-Sound and Energy-Efficient Products and Services, dated November 2, 1992. 
5. Definitions.


Alternative fuel is defined by Section 301 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, as implemented by the Secretary of Energy through rulemaking, at 10 CFR Part 490.2. 

Biobased product means a product determined by the Secretary of Agriculture to be a commercial or industrial product (other than food or feed) that is composed, in whole or in part, of biological products or renewable domestic agricultural materials (including plant, animal, and marine materials) or forestry materials. 

Energy efficient or FEMP-designated product means a product designated by the Federal Energy Management Program, Department of Energy as being among the highest 25 percent of equivalent products for energy efficiency. 

Energy Star® product means a product that is rated for energy efficiency under an Energy Star® program established by Section 324A of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. 

Environmentally preferable means products and services that have a lesser or reduced effect on human health and the environment when compared with competing products or services that serve the same purpose. This comparison may consider raw materials acquisition, product, manufacturing, packaging, distribution, reuse, operation, maintenance, or disposal of the product or service. 

Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) is an environmental procurement tool designed to help institutional purchasers in the public and private sectors evaluate, compare and select electronic products based on their environmental attributes. The first EPEAT standard applies to computer desktops, laptops and monitors. 

EPEAT-registered products are those products which meet the Institute of Electronic and Electrical Engineers (IEEE) 1680 Standard for the Environmental Assessment of Personal Computer Products, and products registered under similar standards developed after the date of this policy letter, and are listed on the EPEAT Product Registry located at www.epeat.net. 

Executive agency means an Executive department, a military department, or any independent establishment within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 101, 102, and 104(1), respectively, and any wholly owned Government corporation within the meaning of 31 U.S.C. 9101. 

Life-cycle cost effective means the life-cycle costs of a product, project, or measure are estimated to be equal to or less than the base case (i.e., current or standard practice or product). Additional guidance on measuring cost-effectiveness is specified in 10 CFR Parts 436.18(a), (b), and (c), 436.20, and 436.21. 

Ozone-depleting substances means any substance designated as a Class I or Class II substance by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 40 CFR Part 82. 

Postconsumer content means a material or product that has served its intended use and has been diverted or recovered from waste destined for disposal, having completed its life as a consumer item. 

Recovered material means waste material and by-products which have been recovered or diverted from solid waste, but such term does not include those materials and by-products generated from, and commonly reused within, an original manufacturing process. 

Recycled content products means products containing recovered materials designated for federal preferred procurement by the EPA under Section 6002 of RCRA. The products are also known as EPA-designated items. 

Renewable energy means energy produced by solar, wind, biomass, landfill gas, hydrokinetic, ocean (including tidal, wave, current and thermal), geothermal, municipal solid waste, or new hydroelectric generation capacity achieved from increased efficiency or additions of new capacity at an existing hydroelectric project. 

Sustainable means to create and maintain conditions, under which humans and nature can exist in productive harmony, that permit fulfilling the social, economic, and other requirements of present and future generations of Americans. Start Printed Page 73906


Water efficient product or service means a product or service that uses less water than competing products or services that serve the same purpose, including those meeting EPA's WaterSense standards. 
6. Background. E.O. 13423, Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy, and Transportation Management, issued on January 26, 2007 (72 FR 3919), directs federal agencies to conduct their environmental, transportation, and energy-related activities in support of their respective missions in an environmentally, economically and fiscally sound, integrated, continuously improving, efficient, and sustainable manner. In agency acquisitions of goods and services, the Executive Order requires: (i) use of sustainable environmental practices, including acquisition of biobased, environmentally preferable, energy-efficient, water-efficient, and recycled-content products, and (ii) use of paper of at least 30 percent postconsumer fiber content. 
Other goals of E.O. 13423 address improving energy efficiency, consuming renewable energy, reducing water consumption, increasing diversion of solid waste, ensuring sustainable/green construction of buildings, reducing petroleum use, and ensuring acquisition and use of EPEAT-registered electronic products. E.O. 13423 further requires that agency programs to reduce and better manage the use of toxic and hazardous chemicals include reducing the acquisition of such chemicals. 
Acquiring green products and services is a key element of successfully implementing E.O. 13423, an effective environmental management system (EMS), and a sustainability program. This policy letter provides guidance to agencies for implementing the green acquisition requirements of E.O. 13423, including its implementation within an EMS framework. E.O. 13423 also provides guidance to agencies that do not have an EMS or have not yet incorporated goals toward sustainability but are still required to implement an affirmative procurement program for green products and services as part of their overall acquisition strategy. 
7. Policy. It is the policy of the federal government to develop and implement green purchasing policies and affirmative procurement programs in order to conserve resources and be good stewards of the environment and reduce our negative impact on the environment. The purchase of green products applies to all acquisition and contracting mechanisms used by federal agencies, including service contracts, purchases made with government purchase and fleet cards and purchases below the micropurchase threshold. 
8. Responsibilities.

A. General requirements. In implementing this policy, Executive agencies shall: 
(1) Identify opportunities for and give preference to the acquisition of green products and services including but not limited to: 
(a) Alternative fuels and Alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) and hybrids as required by Section 303 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and amended by the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and E.O. 13423; 
(b) biobased products designated by the Department of Agriculture (USDA) under section 9002 of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (FSRIA); 
(c) Energy Star®, FEMP-designated, and those electronic products with the lowest available stand-by power as required by section 104 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and E.O. 13423; 
(d) Environmentally-preferable products and services in accordance with E.O. 13423; 
(e) EPEAT-registered electronics in accordance with E.O. 13423; 
(f) Low or no toxic or hazardous chemicals or materials or products containing lesser or no toxic or hazardous constituents; 
(g) Non-ozone depleting substances under the Clean Air Act as contained in EPA's Significant New Alternatives Program (SNAP); 
(h) Recycled content and/or remanufactured products designated by EPA under section 6002 of RCRA; 
(i) Renewable energy as required by section 203 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, E.O. 13423; and 
(j) Water efficient products, including those meeting EPA's “WaterSense” standards. 
(2) Ensure representation of environmental and energy experts, managers, or technical personnel on integrated procurement teams for all major acquisitions and consider each of the following factors: 
(a) Sustainable design practices; 
(b) Life cycle cost analysis; 
(c) Product or packaging take back (return to manufacturer for recycling or remanufacturing purposes); and 
(d) Maximization of energy and resource recovery in solid waste management. 
(3) Incorporate green purchasing requirements within agency, organizational, and facility environmental management systems. Guidance can be found in Incorporating Environmentally Preferable Purchasing into Environmental Management Systems, available at http://www.epa.gov/​epp/​pubs/​grn-pur/​green-pur-ems.htm. 
(4) Develop and implement a formal, comprehensive, written affirmative procurement program (APP), also referred to as a green purchasing plan, for all products and services covered by this policy letter. 
(a) Minimally, an APP must: 

State a preference for the acquisition of the green products and services identified above; 
Delineate the roles and responsibilities of contracting officials, program managers, product specifiers, and purchase card holders and administrators; 
Promote the acquisition of green products and services internally within the agency and externally to all product vendors and service providers, including other federal, state, and local agencies; 
Provide for annual compliance monitoring, corrective action, and/or auditing as appropriate; 
Provide mechanisms for reporting on the effectiveness of the program to demonstrate compliance; 
Require flow down of green product preferences to contractors and subcontractors; and 
For recycled content products only, require estimates of the total amount of recovered materials used in items supplied or used under the contract, certification that the minimum recycled content requirement was met, where appropriate, and implement procedures for verifying the estimates and certifications. 

(b) An effective APP should also address: 

Preference for green products and services in the agency's annual procurement forecasts for all products and services; 
Development of templates for incorporating green purchasing requirements into solicitations and contracts and/or using the model templates developed by other agencies; 
Use of Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) and other e-procurement tools to publicize and promote requirements for green products and services and/or sustainable acquisitions; 
The incorporation of green product requirements in the agency's automated contract writing system; 
Strategic sourcing opportunities for purchasing green products and services; 
Achievement of best value based on life cycle cost assessments of cradle-to-grave manufacture, use and disposition; 
Past performance evaluation of contractors' adherence to green Start Printed Page 73907components/sustainable aspects of contracts; 
Green and/or sustainable standards and performance indicators in statements of work, source selection factors, and performance-based acquisitions; 
Reporting of green contract requirements implementation through the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS); and 
For agencies that manage government specifications or commercial item descriptions, review and revise, as necessary, specifications and standards to permit the acquisition of green products and services. 

(5) Work with private standard setting organizations and participate, pursuant to OMB Circular A-119 and the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act (NTTAA), in the development of voluntary standards and specifications defining green products, practices and services. 
(6) Develop and require training on the acquisition of green products and services as well as agency sustainable practices for requirements personnel, procurement personnel, purchase card and travel card holders and administrators, fleet managers, and facilities managers. 
(7) Conduct pilot projects to test and measure results from the purchase and use of green products and services. Agencies may be requested to serve as a lead agency in coordinating a pilot and reporting government-wide results associated with the pilot. 
(8) Ensure that the agency (a) meets at least 95 percent of its requirements for acquiring an electronic product with an EPEAT-registered electronic product, unless there is no EPEAT standard for such product, (b) enables the Energy Star® feature on agency computers and monitors, (c) establishes and implements policies to extend the useful life of agency electronic equipment, and (d) uses environmentally sound practices with respect to disposition of agency electronic equipment that has reached the end of its useful life. 
B. Relationship of green purchasing requirements to other socio-economic programs. Executive agencies should first determine their specific performance requirements for products and services then identify sources that effectively meet the agency's performance needs. If an agency determines that a green product or service can meet its performance needs, it shall first consider mandatory and preferred sources to obtain green products or services. If these sources do not offer products or services that meet the agency's performance needs, the agency shall obtain such products and services from other sources. 
Nonprofit agencies employing people who are blind or severely disabled under the AbilityOne Program pursuant to the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act and Federal Prison Industries' UNICOR programs are mandatory sources. See Subparts 8.6 and 8.7 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). Small businesses, including Small Disadvantaged, Women-Owned, Native American, Alaska Native, HUB-zone, and Service-Disabled Veterans, are preferred sources. 
C. Automatic substitution policies. Executive agencies in coordination with General Services Administration (GSA) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) shall implement automatic substitution policies in accordance with the following guidelines: 
(1) GSA and DLA shall coordinate with Chief Acquisition Officers and Senior Officials appointed under Section 3(d) of E.O. 13423 to identify opportunities and establish policies to automatically substitute functionally equivalent green products and services in place of non-green products and services ordered by customer agencies. These products and services may include, but are not limited to, general office products, other paper products such as tissues and towels, biobased cleaning products, and/or any other green products and services appropriate to agencies' needs. 
GSA and DLA shall report to the OFPP Administrator annually on the products and services for which these automatic substitution policies have been implemented. 
(2) GSA and DLA shall provide only Energy Star® and FEMP-designated energy efficient products for all categories of products covered by the Energy Star® and FEMP programs, unless the head of an agency provides written justification as covered in paragraph 8.G.(2) of this policy letter. 
D. Compliance and listing of green products in federal catalogs and on-line ordering systems. GSA, DLA and any other central supply source shall: 
(1) Clearly identify and prominently display designated green products and services covered in this policy letter in federal catalogs and on-line ordering systems; and 
(2) Phase out competing non-green products from their supply catalogs, contracts, specifications, inventories, and schedules, in accordance with the following deadlines: 
(a) For a green product designated prior to the publication of this policy letter—by January 1, 2010 or an alternative deadline established in consultation with the Federal Environmental Executive and the Administrator of OFPP. 
(b) For a green product designated after the publication of this policy letter—the latter of January 1, 2010 or within one year after the date specified in subparagraph (c) or an alternative deadline established in consultation with the Federal Environmental Executive and the Administrator of OFPP. 
(c) The date referred to in subparagraph (b) is the date a notice is issued in the Federal Register by the manager of a green product program at USDA, EPA, or DOE designating new products for its lists that : 
(i) Can meet the functional performance requirements of competing non-green products in the same or similar product category; and 
(ii) Adequately address factors that would otherwise justify exemptions from green purchasing products as described in paragraph 8.G of this policy letter. 
E. Requirements for paper and printing. In implementing the policy for paper and paper products acquired through GSA, the Government Printing Office, or private entities, Executive agencies shall: 
(1) Require the use of printing and writing paper containing a minimum of 30 percent postconsumer fiber; 
(2) To the maximum extent practicable, ensure that all copier machines, faxes, and printers are set up to print double-sided documents and that any reports, studies, analyses, assessments or any other contract deliverables are provided as double-sided copies; 
(3) To the maximum extent practicable, require that all printing services require the use of recycled content paper and double-sided copying; 
(4) To the maximum extent practicable, refrain from specifying printing and writing papers that do not contain a minimum of 30 percent postconsumer fiber for products with a limited useful life such as annual reports, catalogues, training materials, and telephone directories as appropriate; and 
(5) To the maximum extent practicable, provide and transfer documents electronically to eliminate paper requirements. 
F. Service contracting. Executive agencies must include requirements and preferences for the use of green products in all new service contracts and recompeted service contracts where green products may be substituted for Start Printed Page 73908equivalent non-green products in the performance of the contract. Agencies are also encouraged to incorporate these requirements and preferences into existing contracts as they are modified or extended through options. Requirements and opportunities to incorporate sustainable practices and green products in service contracts are provided below. Agencies should explore further opportunities for including these practices and products in all relevant service contracts. 
(1) Buildings and leased space: When acquiring leased space or entering into construction contracts for buildings and other major assets, agencies shall: 
(a) implement the five Guiding Principles for High Performance and Sustainable Buildings identified in the Federal Leadership in High Performance and Sustainable Buildings Memorandum of Understanding and relate technical guidance found on the Whole Building Design Guide (www.wbdg.org) as long as it is life cycle cost effective to do so; and 
(b) ensure that new buildings are 30 percent more energy efficient than the 2004 International Energy Conservation Code for residential buildings or the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standard 90.1-2004 for non-residential buildings, if life-cycle cost effective. 
(2) Energy efficiency: In order to meet government-wide goals for energy efficiency, sustainable building, green product and service acquisition, and renewable energy, agencies are authorized and encouraged to use Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPC) and Utility Energy Savings Contracting (UESC) programs. ESPC and UESC programs are innovative tools for investing in building improvements to reduce energy and water use and increase the portion of remaining energy needs supplied from renewable energy sources. Agencies may use any combination of appropriated funds and private financing to carry out an individual project by covering its up front costs, as long as the entire project's future cost savings exceed the amounts required over time to repay the private financing. 
(3) Fleet and rental car services: GSA and or other federal fleet service providers shall, to the maximum extent practicable, include requirements for increasing alternative fuel use, retread tires, re-refined motor oil, biolubricants, and other vehicle related products designated as recycled content, energy efficient, biobased or environmentally preferable and reducing petroleum use to the maximum extent practicable. Agencies should also ensure that Government travel arrangements for federal employee travel contain preferences for alternative fuel vehicles filled with alternative fuel, hybrids, and other designated green products as feasible and applicable. 
(4) Janitorial services: Agencies shall include requirements for recycled content products (e.g., towels, sanitary tissue products, and plastic trash can liners) and biobased and/or environmentally preferable cleaning products in all janitorial contracts. 
(5) Laundry services: Agencies and their contractors shall request energy and water efficient equipment, and environmentally preferable or biobased detergents in laundry service contracts. 
(6) Meeting and conference services: Agencies shall, wherever possible, contract for meeting and conference services with contractors offering such green attributes as proximity to mass transportation, shuttle services using alternative fuel vehicles, recycling services, the use of recycled content and/or biobased products, energy and water efficient facilities, linen/towel reuse programs, reusable china and linens for food service, or sourcing food from local providers. 
G. Exemptions from requirements. Exemptions from the purchase requirements covered in this policy letter require written justifications in accordance with the following: 
(1) A decision not to procure EPA-designated recycled content products or USDA-designated biobased items directly or though a service contract requires written justification by the agency that a determination was made that such items: 
(a) Are not reasonably available within the time required; 
(b) Fail to meet performance standards established in applicable specifications or fail to meet the reasonable performance standards of the procuring agency; 
(c) Are only available at an unreasonable price (based on life cycle cost); or 
(d) Are not available from a sufficient number of sources to maintain a satisfactory level of competition. 
(2) A decision not to procure Energy Star® or FEMP designated energy efficient products directly or through a service contract requires written justification by the head of the agency that a determination was made that such products: 
(a) Are not cost effective over the life of the product taking energy cost savings into account; or 
(b) Are not reasonably available to meet the functional requirement of the agency. 
9. Federal Acquisition Regulatory Councils. The Defense Acquisition Regulations Council and the Civilian Agency Acquisition Council shall conduct periodic reviews of the relevant parts of the FAR to assure (1) that no unintended limitations to the acquisition of green products and services are contained therein, and (2) that the procurement policies established by this policy letter are fully reflected in the FAR. 
10. Reporting requirements. Agency activities conducted pursuant to this policy letter will be reported biennially to the President as required by E.O. 13423 and as otherwise required by statute. 
A. OFPP will collect data annually from agencies. Each Executive agency shall provide accurate, complete and timely data to OFPP in its annual requests. Requests may include, but are not limited to: 
(1) Quantitative data on purchases of indicator items; 
(2) Contract compliance data reported through the FPDS system; 
(3) Data documenting the results of participation in agency or government-wide pilots; 
(4) Evidence of preference language included in service contracts, procurement forecasts, solicitations, and/or competitive sourcing studies; and/or 
(5) Evidence of annual training, compliance monitoring, corrective action plans and implementation of corrective actions. 
B. Criteria for agency reporting to OFPP on green product purchasing and service acquisitions will be updated as necessary to ensure consistency with the requirements of this policy letter. 
11. Information. Questions or inquiries about this policy letter should be directed to the Office of Federal Procurement Policy, 725 17th Street, NW, Washington, DC 20503, telephone: 202-395-3501. 
12. Judicial review. This Policy Letter is not intended to provide a constitutional or statutory interpretation of any kind and it is not intended, and should not be construed, to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or any persons. It is intended only to provide policy guidance to agencies in the exercise of their discretion concerning federal contracting. Thus, this Policy Letter is not intended, and should not be construed, to create any substantive or Start Printed Page 73909procedural basis on which to challenge any agency action or inaction on the ground that such action or inaction was not in accordance with this Policy Letter. 
13. Effective date. This policy letter is effective December 28, 2007.

Reshaping Federal Contracting:
A Conversation with Anne Rung, OFPP Administrator

        Watch Replay    






Anne Rung wants to change how you do federal purchasing. Today, purchases and pricing are managed individually across thousands of procurement units. Rung’s vision? Manage entire categories of purchases collaboratively, cohesively and in sync across agencies. The result is a fundamental shift in how contractors experience competition and pursue partnerships.
OMB is also working to ensure that reform envisioned by the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) comes to fruition. CIO offices will have increased control of budget and governance, with IT provisions having a significant impact on the acquisition community.
Bloomberg Government invites you to attend an evening reception featuring OFPP Administrator Anne Rung to learn first-hand from the official reshaping category management and spearheading FITARA. Join us for an evening of discussion on what category management may mean for your business. Hear from Rung and meet agency and industry officials navigating this shift in the procurement landscape.

OFPP seeks to solidify category management following Rung exit






 




  October 17, 2016 


										Paul Murphy									








Welcome to Bloomberg Government’s Analyst Picks, our daily briefing of top stories affecting the federal market. Bloomberg Government clients have access to Washington’s best government contracting data and analysis. Get introduced to one of our product experts →





The Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) in the Office of Management and Budget released a draft circular on Oct. 7 designed to permanently entrench category management practices into federal agencies’ day-to-day acquisition practices for buying approximately $270 billion of “common goods” each year.
Category management, championed by former OFPP administrator Anne Rung, seeks to implement a variety of practices that identify best-in-class contracts, change inefficient buying and consumption patterns, and eliminate duplication. Rung left OFPP on Sept. 30 and will join Amazon.com Inc. in November.
“Common goods” include information technology hardware, mobile devices, office supplies and other basic needs that OFPP says account for more than one-half of all federal contract spending.
Language in the circular strengthens the governance role of the Category Management Leadership Council; enhances the responsibilities of the 10 common spend category managers; standardizes the identification and use of best-in-class contracts; promotes the sharing of contract information and the use of analytics; and sets policies to measure agency performance. The deadline for comments on the draft circular is Nov. 7.
If category management takes root, vendors can expect downward pressure on prices and continued consolidation of buying on large, vetted multiple-award contracts such as Alliant 2 and SEWP V.

Digital Service Contracting Professional Training and Development Program Challenge
















About the Challenge

Improving the way the Government builds and buys digital services Posted By: Office of Management and BudgetCategory: Other Submission Dates: 12 a.m. ET, May 23, 2015 - 11:59 p.m. ET, Jun 23, 2015

Winner Update:
The Challenge Managers, Traci Walker and Joanie Newhart, both of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), made the call to notify Team ICF International and ASI Government that their program design had been selected as the winner of the Digital Service Contracting Professional Training and Development Program challenge. This means they will have the opportunity to partner with the Office of Federal Procurement Policy and the US Digital Service to pilot their training program with 30 Federal contracting professionals and help foster transformative change in the Federal Digital Service acquisition culture.
The winning program design comprises customized learning paths, self-directed learning, guided learning, and a live digital assignment.
During the six month pilot, which kicks off on October 20, 2015, the challenge winner will work in close collaboration with OFPP and the U.S. Digital Service to test its concepts and produce the first cohort of certified digital service contracting experts. After successful completion of the pilot and incorporation of lessons learned, the final program design will be turned over to federal acquisition training institutions for implementation. This challenge is only the beginning of OMB’s efforts to develop digital service and IT expertise for contracting professionals, program managers, and other stakeholders.
 
_______________________________________________________________________________________
The US Digital Service and Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP), as part of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), give notice of the availability of the “Digital Service Contracting Professional Training and Development Program” prize competition and rules. Through a multi-phased challenge, participants are eligible for prize money up to $360,000.00 under this competition.
In August 2014, the US Digital Service was launched to bring in the country’s brightest digital talent to transform how government works for American citizens and businesses by dramatically improving the way government builds and buys digital services.
On December 4, 2014, Anne Rung, Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy, issued a memorandum titled Transforming the Marketplace: Simplifying Federal Procurement to Improve Performance, Drive Innovation, and Increase Savings.[i]  In this memorandum, Administrator Rung lays out several initiatives for driving greater innovation and strengthening Federal acquisition practices, one of which is building digital information technology (IT) acquisition expertise.
As part of this initiative, OFPP and the U.S. Digital Service are working together to focus on improving the process of IT acquisition, and specifically the acquisition of digital services. OFPP and the US Digital Service recognize the need for improving and simplifying the digital experiences that citizens and businesses have with the Government.  Strengthening digital services expertise in the Government is a key component of being able to reduce the risk of failed acquisitions and systems, and save taxpayer dollars.  The Digital Service Contracting Professional Training and Development Program prize competition seeks to spur innovation in the training and development of Federal Contracting Professionals who are fundamental to the success of digital service acquisitions. Through program concept white papers, up to three design presentations, and a pilot program, the effectiveness and feasibility of innovative training and development program approaches will be explored.
Please send inquiries or questions to Challenge@omb.eop.gov or post to the discussion thread on challenge.gov
Objective:  The goal of this prize competition is to develop a Digital Service Contracting Professional Training and Development Program for the Federal Government, which will be used to add a digital service core-plus specialization for contracting professionals under the Federal Acquisition Certification in Contracting (FAC-C) Program issued by OFPP[i].   The final results of the challenge will be provided to Federal training institutions, such as the Federal Acquisition Institute (FAI) and Defense Acquisition University (DAU), for those institutions to implement and maintain the program. This program will be one of many initiatives to foster transformative change in the Federal Digital Service acquisition culture.
The optimal comprehensive training and development program, intended for Federal Contracting Professionals, specifically Contracting Officers and Contract Specialists, will enable them to understand and apply strategic thinking, industry best practices, market place conditions, and appropriate acquisition strategies to the procurement of digital supplies and services. An ideal training and development program will be no longer than 6 months in total, and may include strategies such as rotational assignments, mentoring, in-classroom training, and detail assignments woven into an innovative approach to accomplish the stated objectives. A definition of a successful digital service buyer, novel ideas, leading-edge approaches, and iterative methodologies are highly encouraged in response to this Challenge.
Digital services, as defined by OMB, refers to “the delivery of digital information (data or content) and transactional services (e.g., online forms, benefits applications) across a variety of platforms, devices, and delivery mechanisms (e.g., websites, mobile applications, and social media).” Digital services may be delivered to customers either internal or external to the Government, or both.[ii]
The primary outcomes of this Digital Service Contracting Professional Training and Development Program are that participating Federal contracting professionals:

Become digital service procurement experts;
Are equipped with the knowledge necessary to be imbedded within agency Digital Service teams to serve as a business advisor to the team, its customers, and its stakeholders; and
Have the knowledge to lead agency training, workshops, and consultations in order to expand digital service procurement expertise within their agency and the government.

Specifically, the program must teach Federal Contracting Professionals how to:
(1) Understand and procure digital services and supplies utilizing concepts such as those described in the Digital Services Playbook [iii] and the TechFAR[iv] (e.g, DevOps, UX, Design Services, Agile Software Development, Open Source, Cloud, Iaas, SaaS, and PaaS);
(2) Appropriately measure the success of these contracts based on industry standards;
(3) Accurately describe and define the value received; and
(4) Encourage the use of commercial practices and innovative approaches (e.g. modular contracting, broad agency announcements, challenges and prizes) to ensure procurements can capture flexible and rapidly changing technology advancements.
The prize challenge will include three phases. Phase I asks for participants to submit a white paper that describes their concept for a training and development program that will meet the stated objectives. Up to three Phase I submissions will be selected as finalists and move to Phase II. These finalists are awarded $20,000 each in prize money to design in more detail their proposed concept program. At the end of Phase II, these finalists will present their in-depth program designs at an oral presentation and a one hour mock classroom training to a panel of Federal senior leaders. One winner will be selected and moves to Phase III, which requires that participant to develop and pilot its program for approximately 30 students.  In Phase III, up to $250,000 in milestone payments will be provided to assist the participant in developing their proposed pilot for a training and development program that can be easily adopted and implemented by the Government. Upon completion of Phase III, the finalist can win up to $50,000 in additional prize money for developing a program that fully met the stated objectives.
The pilot will be held in the Washington, DC area with local students. However, approaches for the proposed program that include virtual components to allow participation of students outside of the Washington, DC area (with some in-person sessions required) and/or self-pacing are highly encouraged, but must also demonstrate cost effectiveness.

The anticipated cost of the pilot and proposed program and any expected intangible benefits related to the program, or ways to utilize virtual components and/ or quantities of scale strategies to leverage the program across the government for Federal Contracting Professionals.
A concept for defining and evaluating how well the students have achieved the objectives of the program, including a comprehensive survey for the students and a description of how the digital assignment outcome will be assessed.

Phase II: Program Design
The Phase I finalists will receive $20,000 each and will have one month from the date of this award, to transform their program concepts into a detailed program designs, which meet the requirements provided below. One finalist will be selected as the winner of the challenge.  The winner’s name will be posted on Challenge.gov.
The finalists chosen in Phase I shall prepare a detailed program design, including the following three sections:

Program Description

More details on the major content focus areas with their performance objectives,
Comprehensive Syllabus
Defined instructional strategies and educational method for each content area,
Mock-ups or prototypes,

An understanding of how the program components will achieve the desired program outcomes,


Assessment Plan

More details on the planned assessment of how well the students have achieved the objectives of the program;
A remediation plan for trainees who do not achieve the goals; and
A concept for a Capstone or Practical Skills Test that might be required for certification.


Anticipated Cost to Implement Program

The estimated investment required to implement both the pilot and the resulting program. The pilot would be estimated on a basis of 30 students as will the resulting program. If the pilot is a scaled-down version of the fully-implemented program, the differentiation must be explained.
Any expected intangible benefits related to the program, or ways to leverage quantities of scale strategies to facilitate a widespread adoption of the program in the government.



Phase II Oral Proposal 
This program design will be presented to the judges through oral proposals. Additionally, a one hour mock classroom training shall be provided to the judges in order for the challengers to demonstrate one aspect of their proposed design. It will be up to the challenger to determine which aspect and method of delivery will best encompass the concept of their proposed design.
Phase III:  Program Development and Pilot
The challenge winner receives up to $250,000 in milestone payments and will have five months to develop and implement their design with up to 30 government contracting students.  Milestone payments will be made based on mutually agreed upon deliverables throughout the pilot based on the accepted design. An initial milestone payment will be determined to assist with the startup costs of the pilot.
OMB will select and provide students for the pilot project.  The students in the pilot project will be selected from contracting professionals who are certified at the Federal Acquisition Certification – Contracting (FAC-C) or Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act (DAWIA) Level II or above. These pilot students are the target demographic for the program, are influential early adopters of new and innovative acquisition strategies, and will have some experience in IT acquisition. These students will have managerial commitment and approval to fully participate and meet the requirements of the pilot; however it is anticipated that pilot participants will be not required to be 100% assigned to the pilots for the entire length of the program, and will remain in their current jobs during the pilot.
Assignment:   In order to help judge the effectiveness of the training and development program, as part of the pilot, the Federal contracting students will be expected to complete a “live” digital service assignment, which could be an actual project, procurement, or agency engagement. OMB will work with the Phase II winner to determine which assignment is best-suited for its specific pilot based on its proposed design.
In this phase, the training and development program is developed and major components are piloted by the Phase II winner with up to 30 students to validate the content, feasibility, instructional strategies, and expected outcomes of the training program. There shall be complete lesson plans, participant materials, mock-ups and prototypes, and training aids to test during the pilot delivery. The pilot program delivery is the “test drive” of the proposed challenge solution to determine whether it meets expected outcomes. In addition to the students assigned to the pilot, OMB will provide key stakeholders and government subject matter experts who can provide other limited assistance required to develop and pilot the program as requested by the challenger in Phases I and II. OMB will assist the Phase II winner with the identification of current Procurements/Projects/Digital Service teams that students will be assigned to work on during the course of the pilot. The nature of the assignment chosen will be based on a discussion between the Phase II winner and OMB during pilot program preparation.  Sample assignments might include:

Conducting a solicitation from Request For Proposal to Award to establish a Federal-wide Blanket Purchase Agreement.
Working with a Digital Service Agency team on drafting a Request for Proposal.
Assisting GSA’s 18F with a consulting effort and resulting acquisition.
Drafting a Digital Service Agency team’s acquisition strategy for multiple projects/acquisitions.

Submission shall include an end user survey to be delivered to the students based on the proposed program concept which will be used to determine how confident the participants are in their ability to apply the knowledge and skills learned.
Final Submission: Results of Pilot and Update of Proposed Program 
Upon completion of the pilot, the following information shall be provided to OMB by January 31, 2016 to help OMB judge the outcome of the proposed training and development program:

Results of the assessment of how well the students achieved the objectives of the proposed program, and update of the proposed remediation plan and concept for a Capstone or Practical Skills Test that might be required for certification;
Any logistical problems that surfaced in the execution of the pilot (this could relate to scheduling challenges, absenteeism on behalf of the participants, physical or logical roadblocks encountered), including what was done to resolve the problems, or what should be done if a scaled program were to be implemented to ensure success;
The pilot’s actual cost breakdown including contract services, equipment, facilities, hardware, software, training materials, as it relates to the proposed submission (this could include return on investment evaluations and alternative analyses);
An accountability report that captures how well the pilot was executed (pilot’s projected cost breakdown compared to the actual cost breakdown) and how quality was measured to get the expected results of the pilot.
The documented program design incorporating lessons learned and any changes made to the design initially proposed;
The final estimated investment required to implement the proposed program; and
A description of how Return on Investment (ROI) should be monitored (e.g., linkage to performance metrics, etc.).

Would OFPP/OMB consider extending the due date into mid-July as many potential interested training companies have been inundated this June responding to RFPs for Federal curriculum-related services?

Submission through Challenge.gov by June 23 is the registration. There is no pre-registration required. 

There is no public information about the judges being provided.

To whom it may concern,
We are curious about the Phase I requirements. The requirements state you are seeking an information white paper but the detailed requirements make it seem more like you want a proposed solution. Can you please clarify if Phase I requires a general information white paper on digital acquisitions, or if you want a focused proposal to solve your education needs?
Thank you for this opportunity.

Submission by the June 23 date is all that is needed.  There is not a separate registration process.  We have not posted the names of the judges and do not plan to do so.

In Phase I, we are asking for a concept paper, or white paper, that describes your concept for a training and development program that meets our objectives, as stated in the challenge.  We are not looking for a general information white paper on digital acquisitions.

This is a focused white paper to solve the education needs for a proposed digital service training and development program for contracting officers. This is the high level concept for this program, which will be more fully detailed in Phase II.

Where can we find the requirements and registration for this project?  Challenge.gov points to the Federal Register, and the Federal Register states that the document has been withdrawn from publication.  Is this challenge still valid?  Could you please let us know.  thank you.

All of the information is posted here on challenge.gov.  We had a technical problem with the Federal Register Notice - it will be re-posted soon but will contain the same information posted here.

Ms. Newhart, thank you for your reply and for re-posting information on the federal register.  Under the "Eligibility and Rules for Participating in the Challenge" bullet 1 states:  "Shall have registered to participate in the Challenge under the rules promulgated by OMB and published in this Notice".  However specific registration rules are not given.  Could you please clarify how to register?  Thank you in advance.

How does this clause impact licensed products on the GSA schedule and prior intellectual property:
"I hereby grant to the Federal Government, and others acting on behalf of the Federal Government, a royalty-free non-exclusive worldwide license to use, copy for use, and display publicly all parts of the submission for the purposes of the Challenge. This license may include posting or linking to the submission on the official OMB Web site and making it available for use by the public.”

What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.
