THE WOODLANDS, Texas, Nov. 11, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Huntsman Corporation (NYSE:    HUN) announced today the appointment of J. Kimo Esplin as Executive Vice President, Strategy and Investment, and the promotion of Sean Douglas to Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, with both appointments effective January 1, 2017.








In his new capacity, Mr. Esplin will report directly to Peter R. Huntsman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and focus his full time efforts on executing the planned spinoff of the Pigments & Additives and Textile Effects divisions, working with strategic opportunities for the Company and its other operating divisions, and representing the Company with shareholders and global partners.  Mr. Esplin served as the Company's CFO for 17 years.
In Mr. Douglas's new role as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, he will also report directly to Mr. Huntsman and be responsible for Finance, Treasury, Accounting, Tax, Investor Relations, Corporate Development and Information Technology.  Mr. Douglas joined the Company in 1990 and has held several positions, most recently Vice President, Corporate Development and Treasurer.

Sean too has proven himself to be an exceptional leader.  I am pleased with his promotion and I look forward to his continued contribution to this Company.
"As a Company, we are intensely focused on improving our free cash flow generation, growing our downstream differentiated businesses, and separating our Pigments and Additives and Textile Effects businesses.  Having Kimo and Sean assume their new roles at the beginning of the year will ensure our ability to successfully deliver these objectives."
