BEDFORD, Mass., Dec. 9, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Hologic, Inc. (Hologic or the Company) (NASDAQ: HOLX), a leading developer, manufacturer and supplier of premium diagnostics products, medical imaging systems and surgical products, with an emphasis on serving the healthcare needs of women, today announced that Stephen P. MacMillan has been named President and Chief Executive Officer, and a member of the Board of Directors. Mr. MacMillan succeeds Jack W. Cumming, who was named Chief Executive Officer in July 2013 and previously served in this capacity from 2001 to 2009. 
"Since our first meeting with Steve in late October, it was clear that he is the right leader to take Hologic forward," said David R. LaVance, Jr., Chairman of the Board. "The Board unanimously concluded that his track record of delivering strong financial results and creating shareholder value makes him the ideal chief executive officer for Hologic. During his tenure, Steve led Stryker Corporation to strong operating performance, including nearly tripling revenue, and delivered stock price appreciation that significantly outperformed the S&P 500 index. Hologic has made progress in reviewing the strategy, leadership and cost structure of each of its businesses, and the Board is confident that under Steve's leadership the Company can leverage its strong product platforms to drive value for shareholders and other key stakeholders. We look forward to working closely with Steve as he develops and executes strategies to enhance Hologic's financial and operational performance."  
Mr. MacMillan said, "Hologic's unparalleled portfolio of assets improves patient care, saves lives and reduces healthcare costs by decreasing unnecessary procedures. I am honored to join the Company at this time of tremendous opportunity. I will work with the talented team at Hologic to determine the best path forward for the Company and leverage its key franchises to drive sustainable growth. I am excited to take the necessary steps to enhance value for all shareholders."
Mr. LaVance added, "The Board and I thank Jack Cumming for his contributions to Hologic, which have positioned the Company to enhance its performance and capitalize on the many opportunities ahead. Under Jack's leadership, Hologic has implemented a series of important initiatives focused on unlocking the value of the Company's best-in-class products and market-leading technologies while refining its go-forward strategy."
"I was pleased to step in and help the Company redefine its near-term priorities and path forward," said Jack W. Cumming. "It has been a privilege to work with Hologic's employees throughout the past 12 years and I am confident the Company is taking the rights steps to create long-term value for shareholders. I truly believe Hologic is well-positioned for success."

BEDFORD, Mass., Dec. 9, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Hologic, Inc.

MacMillan has been named President and Chief Executive Officer, and a member of the Board of Directors. Mr. MacMillan succeeds Jack W. Cumming, who was named Chief Executive Officer in July 2013 and previously served in this capacity from 2001 to 2009. 
"Since our first meeting with Steve in late October, it was clear that he is the right leader to take Hologic forward," said David R. LaVance, Jr., Chairman of the Board. "The Board unanimously concluded that his track record of delivering strong financial results and creating shareholder value makes him the ideal chief executive officer for Hologic. During his tenure, Steve led Stryker Corporation to strong operating performance, including nearly tripling revenue, and delivered stock price appreciation that significantly outperformed the S&P 500 index. Hologic has made progress in reviewing the strategy, leadership and cost structure of each of its businesses, and the Board is confident that under Steve's leadership the Company can leverage its strong product platforms to drive value for shareholders and other key stakeholders. We look forward to working closely with Steve as he develops and executes strategies to enhance Hologic's financial and operational performance."  
Mr. MacMillan said, "Hologic's unparalleled portfolio of assets improves patient care, saves lives and reduces healthcare costs by decreasing unnecessary procedures. I am honored to join the Company at this time of tremendous opportunity. I will work with the talented team at Hologic to determine the best path forward for the Company and leverage its key franchises to drive sustainable growth. I am excited to take the necessary steps to enhance value for all shareholders."
Mr. LaVance added, "The Board and I thank Jack Cumming for his contributions to Hologic, which have positioned the Company to enhance its performance and capitalize on the many opportunities ahead. Under Jack's leadership, Hologic has implemented a series of important initiatives focused on unlocking the value of the Company's best-in-class products and market-leading technologies while refining its go-forward strategy."
"I was pleased to step in and help the Company redefine its near-term priorities and path forward," said Jack W. Cumming. "It has been a privilege to work with Hologic's employees throughout the past 12 years and I am confident the Company is taking the rights steps to create long-term value for shareholders. I truly believe Hologic is well-positioned for success."

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
