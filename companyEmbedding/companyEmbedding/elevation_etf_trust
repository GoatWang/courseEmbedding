Morningstar categories help investors and investment professionals make meaningful comparisons between funds. The categories make it easier to build well-diversified portfolios, assess potential risk, and identify top-performing funds. We place funds in a given category based on their portfolio statistics and compositions over the past three years. If the fund is new and has no portfolio history, we estimate where it will fall before giving it a more permanent category assignment. When necessary, we may change a category assignment based on recent changes to the portfolio.Fund OverviewCategoryNatural ResourcesFund FamilySummit WaterNet Assets5.97MYTD Return19.35%YieldN/ALegal TypeExchange Traded FundFund OperationsAttributesWTRXCategory AverageAnnual Report Expense Ratio (net)0.80%0.48%Holdings Turnover0.00%2,968.00%Total Net Assets2,905.492,905.49Yahoo Small BusinessData DisclaimerHelpSuggestionsPrivacyAbout Our AdsTerms (Updated)
