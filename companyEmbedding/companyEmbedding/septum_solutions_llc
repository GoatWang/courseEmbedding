Deviated Septum Surgery Risks







A deviated septum is a condition in which the nasal septum -- the bone and cartilage that divide the nasal cavity of the nose in half -- is significantly off center, or crooked, making breathing difficult. Most people have some sort of imbalance in the size of their breathing passages. In fact, estimates indicate that 80% of people, most unknowingly, have some sort of misalignment to their nasal septum. Only the more severe imbalances cause significant breathing problems and require treatment.

Deviated Septum Causes

Some people are born with a deviated septum. Other people develop a deviated septum after injury or trauma to the nose.

Deviated Septum Symptoms

The most common symptom of a deviated septum is nasal congestion, with one side of the nose being more congested than the other, along with difficulty breathing. Recurrent or repeated sinus infections can also be a sign of a deviated septum. Other symptoms include frequent:


Nosebleeds

Facial pain

Headache


Postnasal drip

Loud breathing and snoring during sleep

A deviated septum may also cause sleep apnea, a serious condition in which a person stops breathing during sleep.

Deviated Septum Treatments

Sometimes symptoms of a deviated septum can be relieved with medications. If medicine alone doesn't offer adequate relief, a surgical procedure called septoplasty may be needed to repair a crooked septum and improve breathing.

Deviated Septum Surgery

During septoplasty, a surgeon, working through the inside of the nose, makes a small incision in the septum and then removes the excess bone or cartilage required to even out the breathing space of the nostrils.
Sometimes, a rhinoplasty, or "nose job," is combined with septoplasty to improve the appearance of the nose. This procedure is called septorhinoplasty. Septoplasty may also be combined with sinus surgery.
Surgery to repair a deviated septum is usually performed in an outpatient setting under local or general anesthesia and takes about one to one and a half hours, depending on the amount of work being done. You should be able to go home three to four hours after surgery.
Internal splints or soft packing material may be put in the nose to stabilize the septum as it heals. If a septoplasty is the only procedure performed, there should be little to no swelling or bruising after surgery. However, if a septorhinoplasty is performed, a week or two of swelling and bruising is normal following the procedure.
If possible, it is best to wait until after the nose has stopped growing, around age 15, to have surgery.
Newer procedures are becoming available that use balloon septoplasty techniques that avoid actual surgery and are done in the office setting. These are being done for milder cases.


Continued

Deviated Septum Surgery Risks

No surgery is completely risk-free, and the benefits of undergoing surgery -- in this case, being able to breathe better -- must outweigh the risks. Septoplasty and septorhinoplasty are common and safe procedures; side effects are rare. Still, talk with your doctor about the possible risks of surgery before you make a treatment decision.
Although rare, risks of septoplasty and/or rhinoplasty may include:

Infection
Bleeding
Hole (perforation) of the septum
Loss of the ability to smell

If you are having nasal symptoms and think you may have a deviated septum, make an appointment to see an ear, nose, and throat doctor, or ENT. There are a number of reasons why you may be experiencing these symptoms, including chronic sinusitis or nasal allergies. Make sure you get the right diagnosis so that you can get the treatment you need.

Deviated Septum

            By Delialah Falcon. 
             
            May 7th 2016

Having a deviated septum refers to the partition that is located between the two nostrils being shifted to one side. Typically, the septum equally divides the two sides of the nose. A deviated septum can range from mild to severe. It has been estimated that nearly 80 percent of all septum are not perfectly centered; however, this usually remains unnoticed unless the deviation is severe enough to cause symptoms.
Understanding A Deviated Septum
The septum is a thin barrier that is made up of cartilage that separates the two nostrils. Generally the septum is thought to be located midway between the two areas, dividing them equally. A deviated septum occurs when this partition is off-center, shifting prominently to one side. A severely deviated septum can cause certain health problems and may require surgical treatment to be corrected.
Symptoms
Many people have a deviated septum and are completely unaware that they have the condition because it is not severe enough to cause troublesome symptoms. Some deviated septums may result in the development of bothersome symptoms, including:

An obstruction that develops in one or both nostrils. This obstruction may cause difficulty breathing through the nose and can worsen when suffering from a cold or other illness that causes the nasal cavity to swell.
Bloody noses may be more common when a deviated septum is present, as the nasal passages may become drier.
Pain may develop in the face if your deviated septum has become an irritant to the outer wall of the nose.
Repeated and chronic sinus infections (sinusitis) may occur due to blocked mucous, which can cause facial pain and blocked nasal passages.
Loud breathing or snoring during sleep can develop, occurring more often in infants and children.

Causes
A deviated septum is typically the result of one of two main causes:

In some cases a deviated septum occurs in-utero, occurring at some point during fetal development and becoming noticeable at birth.
In most cases a deviated septum occurs as a result of some sort of trauma or injury to the nose. Injury to the nose is likely the result of a trip or fall, sports injury, car accident, or physical altercation. However, infants may obtain a deviated septum during childbirth.
In some cases, age over time may lead to the deterioration of cartilage, making a deviated septum more prevalent and troublesome.

Risk Factors
Certain behaviors may increase your chances for acquiring a deviated septum. Risk factors associated with a deviated septum include:

Not wearing the proper facial equipment during sporting activities.
Engaging in contact sporting games.
Not wearing seatbelt restraints when driving or riding in a car.

Diagnostic Testing
Upon discussing your symptoms with your doctor, he or she will likely ask you if you’ve had any injury to the nose. The doctor will then use a tool called a nasal speculum to view the inside of your nose. The doctor will see up your nose with the lighted instrument and will be able to determine if you have a deviated septum. Your doctor may also refer you to an ear, nose and throat specialist for further diagnosis and treatment options.
Treatment Options
It may be necessary for your doctor to treat your symptoms rather than the deviated septum itself primarily. To treat symptoms such as nasal congestion and post nasal drip, your doctor may recommend a variety of simple remedies including:

Decongestants. Tablet and nasal spray decongestants may help relieve some nasal congestion. They should be used with caution as decongestants can increase heart rate and blood pressure, causing a nervous feeling throughout the body.
Antihistamines. Antihistamines are typically prescribed for allergy sufferers and can help relieve symptoms such as a runny nose and itchy eyes. They should also be used with caution as many antihistamines can produce a drowsy effect.
Steroid nasal sprays. These nasal sprays are available by prescription and can help to reduce nasal inflammation and swelling, as well as help to treat runny noses. Using this product may produce side effects such as irritated throat and dryness within the nose.

Because medications such as the types listed above are only momentary solutions, it may be necessary to undergo a surgical procedure to correct a deviated septum. The most common surgical solution to a deviated septum is septoplasty.
Septoplasty is a surgical procedure commonly used to treat and correct a deviated septum. It is performed within the nostrils and causes little residual bruising. During septoplasty, your surgeon will likely cut and remove part of the septum in order to replace it in the midline of the nose. This straightening and realignment of the septum will likely cure nosebleeds and any nasal obstruction.
If you concurrently suffer from allergies along with a deviated septum, you will not have relief from allergy symptoms and will need to address allergies in a separate treatment. In addition to septoplasty, you may elect to have a rhinoplasty. During a rhinoplasty procedure, the outer portion of the nose is altered and reshaped, which results in a change to the appearance of the nose.
Considerations
It may be possible to prevent trauma to the nose and therefore reduce your risk of developing a deviated septum by always wearing appropriate helmets during sports such as football, hockey and biking. Additionally, wearing a seatbelt while driving or riding in a car may help to prevent any injury to the nose in the event of a car accident.
A deviated septum refers to the septum that provides a division of cartilage to separate the two nostrils being off center. This deviation from the midline of the nose may cause troublesome symptoms and can usually be permanently corrected with surgery. There are other methods of treatment that may help, but only temporarily. The best way to prevent a deviated septum is to protect the nose from injury.

Instant Nasal Deviated Septum Relief for Deep, Easy Breathing and Sleep
You can add me to your list of positive reviews. ” I have used the Nose Cones for some time now and have experienced a great amount of relief in being able to breathe out of my left nostril, which otherwise is almost 100% blocked by a deviated septum. I do not sleep without it. I highly recommend this product. I tried the strips with adhesive that you can get in the store, that help you breathe right, but my skin was irritated and because of natural skin oils, the strips slip away during the night. Thank you for your product!” *Sincerely, Tim P. of Gallatin, TN Jan. 2, 2014
Very pleased with these little devices. Peaceful nights are a bonus!!!!*
Mr. David R., Nov. 6, 2012, UK
My wife and I have never slept better. I have been a sufferer of a deviated septum and allergies for years now. Consequently, I snore heavily which prevents me, and my wife, from getting a restful night’s sleep. Your Nose Cones have given me instant relief and allowed me to breathe freely without any discomfort. I am sleeping more soundly and therefore I have regained a tremendous amount of energy during the day.*
Tom B.
Seeking a simple, safe, easy solution for breathing difficulties due to a deviated septum?

Max-Air Nose Cones are squeezie-soft internal nasal dilators that gently stent open the nasal airway so that the breathing restrictions of your deviated septum are eliminated without surgery or pain. Inhale fully, deeply and effortlessly for easier breathing and deeper sleep.
Although a deviated septum may not be very visible on the outside of the nose, it can be highly troubling inside the nose; restricting nasal airflow and breathing volume to one or both nostrils.

Engineered, through extensive testing, Max-Air Nose Cones provide maximum deviated septum relief with superior comfort and fit.**
Squeezie-soft Max-Air Nose Cones
Max-Air Nose Cones not only maximize nasal airway relief, they are ultra-soft, simple-to-use and engineered for comfort and fit.
Made from specially selected FDA-certified medical material (latex-free and hypoallergenic), Max-Air Nose Cones are squeezie-soft, have side holes to make them lightweight for barely noticeable wear, yet are durable and resilient enough to bypass the nasal obstruction and allow maximum breathing relief.
You have a wonderful product that, even after two septoplasty surgeries, has drastically reduced my sleep apnea.* Robert P.
A look inside the nose. What does a deviated septum look like?
Here is an anatomically correct illustration of a deviated septum (shown in yellow). Max-Air Nose Cones simply, through gentle pressure, hold open narrowed airways to help restore full, deep nasal breathing (without surgical intervention), so that you may breathe well and sleep well.
 

What is a deviated septum?
A deviated septum is an abnormal curvature or “deviation” in the nasal septum. As shown above, when the septum is deviated it narrows one of the nasal airways and limits airflow.
The Max-Air Nose Cones are specifically suited to relieve the blocked, stuffy-nose feeling that is caused be a deviated septum.

What are the top 7 symptoms of a deviated septum?
THE PRIMARY SYMPTOM OF A DEVIATED SEPTUM IS DIFFICULTY INHALING THROUGH ONE NOSTRIL OR NASAL AIRWAY, WITH NO APPARENT NASAL CONGESTION.
A deviated septum can cause or complicate a whole host of nasal and sleep problems. In addition to difficulty inhaling through one nasal airway, other common symptoms are:


feelings of permanent or frequent nasal stuffiness or congestion that does not clear with use of medications
headaches (especially at night) when deviated septum breathing restrictions may impact your oxygen intake
frequent colds or sinus infections
difficulty breathing when sleeping on one side
snoring
mouth-breathing dependency
trouble using CPAP or an oral appliance
or, general trouble breathing during sleep


With its immediate stenting action (you will feel the rush of airflow immediately and hear a clear difference when inhaling), the Max-Air Nose Cones hold the airway open, even when sleeping to one side or the other. Start breathing more easily so that you may get to sleep faster, anytime that you choose.
What can be done to relieve a deviated septum?
Nose Cones work at the source of the airway problem, inside the nasal passageways.
Depending on the severity of the deviation, surgery may helpful in correcting the deviation. An Otolaryngologist (Ear, Nose & Throat Surgeon) will perform a septoplasty to straighten the nasal septum. For more information visit the American Academy of Otolaryngology website.
For milder cases of deviated septum of if you choose not to have the surgery, the “squeezie-soft” Max-Air Nose Cones may offer a simple solution in deviated septum.
Super soft (like a contact lens), Max-Air Nose Cones bypass nasal obstruction from a deviated septum by gently stenting an open-air pathway around the deviated septum, so that you may inhale freely and deeply with your nose.
 
How can I tell if the new Max-Air Nose Cones will work in my case?
There is an easy way to tell if the Max-Air Nose Cones will work for you. It is called the “Cottle Maneuver”.
Simply block one nostril with your thumb. Then gently take hold of the other nostril and manually dilate it by gently pulling it open laterally towards the cheek. Inhale normally through the manually dilated nostril. Repeat maneuver with the other side.
Do you feel an improvement in airflow?
If there is a feeling of improvement on one or both sides the Max-Air Nose Cones may be just the solution that you seek.
If there is no improvement, chances are that your obstruction is more complicated and it is advised that you seek attention from an Ear, Nose & Throat surgeon.

How the new Max-Air Nose Cones work to relieve a deviated septum.
Max-Air Nose Cones worn individually.
Nasal septal deviations can restrict airflow to one or both nostrils. The gentle pressure of Max-Air Nose Cones opens the deviated septum airway restriction, improves airflow and makes breathing easier, more symmetric and comfortable.
Often noses with a deviated septum have varying size nasal passages. The Cones are easy to customize for this issue. Simply purchase two sizes. Size one side according to the direction on our sizing guide, and then order a smaller size of the Max-Air Nose Cones for the problematic deviated septum side.
Some deviated septum noses only have problems and need help in one nostril. The Nose Cones may be separated and worn individually to combat this very prevalent condition.

Aerobic 
Aerobic units treat wastewater for homes and small businesses using the same process, only scaled down, as our municipal wastewater treatment systems use. They remove 85 to 98 percent of the organic matter and solids from the wastewater, producing effluent as clean as that from municipal wastewater treatment plants, and cleaner than that from conventional septic tanks.
Aerobic units, which are certified as Class I aerobic systems, treat wastewater well enough to be used in conjunction with spray systems, which distribute treated wastewater over lawns. They are the most common way to treat wastewater for spray systems.
The aerobic treatment process includes four main components that work together to purify wastewater:
A pretreatment tank, generally referred to as the “trash tank” because it removes materials that microorganisms (microbes) cannot degrade.
An aeration chamber, where aerobic microbes decompose waste in the water. An aeration system consists of an air pump, piping and diffusers that force air into the aeration chamber. The air pump, located near the aerobic tank, compresses air to flow into the aeration chamber. The diffuser forces the air into the water, dividing the air into bubbles that float to the surface. The oxygen in the air bubbles goes into the water for the microbes, while the rising bubbles mix with the water.
A settling chamber, commonly called a clarifier, which provides a place for the microbes that have treated the wastewater to settle out of the water.
A land application system, which distributes the wastewater into the soil for final treatment and disposal/reuse. Aerobic treatment units usually disperse wastewater via spray distribution systems, which include a disinfection component for removing disease-causing microorganisms, a pump tank for dosing water, and spray heads for spreading the water over the ground.
Aerobic treatment units can be built from concrete or fiberglass. Both materials are durable and can be used across the state.
Concrete tanks are heavier and require larger equipment to carry them to the site, which can delay installation during wet periods. Some concrete systems incorporate the trash tank, aeration chamber, clarifier and pump tank into a single structure; others include in one structure only the trash tank, aeration chamber and clarifier.
Fiberglass tanks are light enough to be carried to the installation site by a backhoe. They generally have an aeration chamber and clarifier in one structure. A separate trash tank and pump tank accompany the aeration chamber and clarifier.
Both tank types can meet your wastewater management needs. But the systems must be installed according to manufacturer specifications. They also must be watertight to prevent groundwater from entering the system and overloading the treatment unit and land application area.
It is important to maintain an active population of microbes in the system to break down solids. A variety of aerobic microorganisms living together in a mixed state can decompose many kinds of materials. The mixed state keeps the microorganisms and the solids suspended in the wastewater.
Aerobic treatment processes greatly lower biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), a common measure of pollution, as well as reduce the suspended solids that do not settle to the bottom of the clarifier. This process also removes some of the nitrogen and reduces the number of disease-causing organisms in the waste.
To remain effective, aerobic treatment unit components need regular maintenance. Poorly maintained systems may not produce water as clean as desired. Please see our service section for a complete list of the maintenance available.

Conventional 
Conventional septic systems have traditionally been the most commonly used technology for treating wastewater. These systems use gravity to treat and distribute wastewater in the soil. They have the lowest cost and require the least amount of maintenance, which is generally limited to periodic pumping of the septic tank.
A conventional gravity flow septic system consists of a series of tanks or a compartmented tank followed by a distribution system. The septic tanks are used to settle out solids and partially treat wastewater before it reaches the distribution system. The distribution system can be one of the standard subsurface drain field options. They consist of gravel-filled trenches, plastic chambers or plastic pipe installed underground to hold the wastewater leaving the tanks until it can seep into surrounding soil.
The soil provides most of the wastewater treatment. Soil particles filter solids and organic matter from the wastewater. Microbes living in the soil break down the solids and kill the bacteria and pathogens in the wastewater.
The size of the tanks and distribution system are based on the number of bedrooms in the house and the type of soil where the distribution system is installed.
The conventional gravity flow septic system is usually the most inexpensive system to install and operate for on-site wastewater disposal.
Conventional gravity flow septic systems cannot be installed in clay soils, shallow soils, rock, soils that become saturated during wet periods of the year, or soils with a high water table.

Low Pressure Dosing 
A low-pressure dosing system treats wastewater and then pumps it into the soil several times daily. Of the nonstandard drain fields, it is the least expensive to install and operate. The system generally has three components: a series of tanks or compartmented tanks used to settle out and partially treat the wastewater; a pump tank for dosing wastewater to the distribution system; and a system for distributing the wastewater to the soil.
The pump tank houses a pump that discharges wastewater to the distribution system three or four times a day. The distribution system consists of a small pipe with holes drilled in it, laid in narrow 6- to 12inch-wide trenches.
The pump discharges wastewater to the trenches. Once in the trench, the wastewater seeps into the soil.
The soil provides most of the wastewater treatment. Soil particles filter solids and organic matter from the wastewater. Microbes in the soil break down the solids and kill the bacteria and pathogens in the wastewater.

Subsurface Drip
A subsurface drip system distributes wastewater to the lawn through a system of tubing installed below the ground surface. It generally consists of four main components a treatment device, a pump tank, a filtering device and a drip distribution system.
Several treatment devices are available, including an aerobic unit, sand filter, or trickling filter. The minimum treatment required is a septic tank to settle the solids. Most drip systems require additional treatment of the wastewater before it enters the filtering system.
The pump tank stores the water until the drip field is ready for a dose of water. A high head pump delivers the water from the pump tank through the filtering device to the drip distribution system.
The filtering device can be a sand, disk or screen filter. Its main purpose is to remove larger particles from the wastewater so they do not cause problems with the drip emitters.
Depending on the waste water quality, the filter may need to be an automatic cleaning system.
The drip distribution system is made of a drip tubing approved by the manufacturer for use with wastewater. The tubing is generally 12 inch in diameter with an emitter in the tubing wall. The pressure inside the tubing is generally operated at 15 to 20 pounds per square inch (psi), with the water exiting the emitter at 0 psi.
The collection manifold for the drip system needs to be connected back to the treatment device for flushing solids collecting inside the drip tubing back to the treatment device.
The drip system has very small emitters that can become clogged with organic matter and solids if the system is improperly maintained.
Drip distribution systems require an ongoing maintenance contract to operate and maintain the drip field.

Deviated Septum Snoring | Snoring Habit

Deviated Septum Snoring

by SnoringHabit




A deviated septum can cause snoring; a condition which causes rapid muscle vibration of the area behind the throat due to swift air passage through this small opening. Other factors that can cause muscle relaxation like age, weight, and alcoholism may lead to snoring.
The medical website WebMD says bone and cartilage that is off center, or misaligned, is the very foundation of a deviated septum. Having one prevents airflow from going inside the body, causing snoring. Having air passage blocked can lead to sleepless nights for you, and the people nearby, since you cannot breathe properly. Eventually you will start snoring.
With a deviated septum, snoring can initiate unwantedly. Even if you do not want to sound like a chainsaw in the middle of the night – or day – you cannot stop yourself. The only solution to this problem is surgery. If nosebleeds, facial pain, headache, postnasal drip, loud breathing, and snoring during sleep coincide with your difficulty breathing, you may have a deviated septum.
A deviated septum can be treated with medicine. Treatment, according to Mayo Clinic, is through managing symptoms. Buying decongestants can relieve the nasal cavities and make those airways open all the time. This prevents the double trouble offered by this condition.
Antihistamines unclog the nose and make sure the nose is not runny anymore. It also prevents allergies, if any, that can really mess up the body. This is great if you have certain allergies as well, aside from a deviated septum.
Nasal steroid sprays lower inflammation so that the nasal passage does not experience pain anymore. The good thing about sprays is that it unclogs your nostrils so air canpass freely.
These are temporary solutions to the problem, because if you really want to rid yourself of deviated septum, you must be willing to go under the knife. Surgery is the only method of ridding yourself of the condition permanently. You are giving others a good night’s sleep once you successfully undergo septoplasty.
Your snoring can disrupt the sleep patterns of others. It’s simple – create enough ruckus and people might not get enough sleep, which they may sorely need after working hard. Without a deviated septum, snoring would have a hard time existing. It works hand-in-hand with gravity, causing the tissues at the back of the throat to fall back and block the airways. The sound is actually an indication that something is obstructing airflow, thus the horrible sound.
Mayo Clinic says septoplasty straightens and repositions the nose, dissolving all other symptoms that tag along with the condition. Surgery is difficult, and required, if you want to rid your body of this nuisance. Septoplasty becomes more difficult if the deviation is severe. This may force the doctor to reinsert your nose back in its proper place, cutting it up and fitting it inside like a picture puzzle.
A secondary surgery called rhinoplasty may be required. This involves reshaping the nose’s bone and cartilage so it fits well, permitting air to pass naturally. Breathing difficulty disappears. A crooked nose can make you feel like the air you are breathing is not enough. Technology can fix your lapses, so you’ll never feel different in and out of bed again.
Reshaping your nose improves state of health and confidence. It is the first thing people notice on the face because it is usually smacked-dab in the middle.
Undergoing septoplasty will make you notice some improvement to sleep quality. Since you can breathe better, you can doze off faster. You will get a pat on the back from the very people you aggravate with your snoring, commending you for not disturbing them anymore while they are sleeping. A lot of things will change if you let your surgeon modify you.
You can avoid sinus infection as well, if early actions toward your deviated septum are taken. Both medication and surgery are good in their respective areas, so take advantage of them whenever you can. ENT specialty group Berger Henry says a sinus infection can induce pain and vision problems, which can be a recurring trend because of the person’s blocked airways. Antibiotics can take care of the infection for now, but you need to have your doctor fix your septum for these symptoms to go away.
Without a deviated septum, snoring disappears. Your friends and your peers who may play practical jokes on you while you are snoring will no longer play the joker card. Overall health quality increases when you can breathe better and sleep well.
