Richard KaplanPastry Chef: Acute Events & CateringOwner: Brown Paper Chocolates

Info
Richard Kaplan

Richard Kaplan's Brown Paper Chocolates were recently nominated for the Gallo Gold Medal, a national award for artisanal food producers. Who better to ask for chocolate bunny advice?Congrats on the nomination, Richard. So are you a pastry chef? A chocolatier, a candy guy or what, exactly?I have been an executive chef for most of my career, and I handle the pastry chef duties for my catering company, Acute Events & Catering. But since I started Brown Paper Chocolates, I would have to answer: all of the above.What is it that a chocolatier does, exactly?I buy premium chocolate couverture from wholesale suppliers and make it into our signature candy line.What's your advice on shopping for chocolate Easter bunnies?Shop at a quality candy/confection store and try to purchase a product manufactured on site. If that isn't possible, purchase a good brand from your favorite spot.Why do the ears taste best?Because they're usually the first bite taken.What are your products?Our product is a two-inch-square block of high-quality chocolate in unusual flavor combinations (like pistachio, orange peel and Cointreau, and ancho chile and aejo tequila). The chocolate has a delicate consistency, and it comes wrapped in cool brown paper boxes.What's so good about them?The taste and texture are unforgettable.How much do they cost?From $5.99 to $8.99 a box.Where can you get them?From our Web site, www.brownpaper chocolates.com, and at Spec's and at Central Market, among others. There's a list of retailers on our Web site.Now that you've been nominated for a national award, will you remember all the little people?I have always lived by the motto, "Never forget where you came from." To this day, I still personally stock the shelves for our first retail customer.
