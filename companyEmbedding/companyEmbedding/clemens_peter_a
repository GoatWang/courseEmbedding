Roger Clemens, lot of 5 original 3.5 x 5 glossy photographs by celebrity photographer Peter Warrack. Vintage photographs from the original negative. Printed by Warrack as part of his personal archive. Previously unpublished.
In his early 20's, Peter Warrack lived in London, Rome, and Athens working for entertainment magazines and writing articles about events that he attended, like the Cannes Film Festival. It was during this period of time that his interest in photography began to develop. Over the years, Peter began to amass a very extensive collection of photographs of people he met. He attended many events and met many famed individuals of the time. He always took the time to research people before meeting them and was able to talk with them about their careers, their travels and even their families.
Verso bears official "Peter Warrack Archive" ink stamping. In very good condition, though might have light mounting residue on verso from previous mounting.
Provenance: From the Peter Warrack Estate.

Satisfaction 100% Guaranteed
