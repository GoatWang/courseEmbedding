Commentary

As of June 30, 2017

	Quarter in review


		The main contributors were Brink’s Co. (1.1% portfolio weighting), KLX, Inc. (2.8% portfolio weighting), and Colony NorthStar, Inc. (2.7% portfolio weighting).  Brink’s Company benefited from another positive earnings report and continued optimism surrounding its turnaround plan to elevate its margins to peer levels. KLX preannounced better-than-expected results and yearly guidance for both its business segments, most notably the Energy Services Group. Colony NorthStar saw its valuation multiple increase despite a tepid earnings release; it has outlined several factors that could enable it to trade more in-line with its higher-rated internally-managed hybrid REIT peers.

		WPX Energy, Inc. (1.0% portfolio weighting), Investors Bancorp, Inc. (4.1% portfolio weighting), and Vitamin Shoppe, Inc. (0.3% portfolio weighting) were the largest detractors from performance. WPX Energy, a well-funded energy exploration and production firm, declined in line with energy prices despite stronger-than expected oil production. Investors Bancorp missed earnings per share consensus as higher funding and Bank Secrecy Act compliance costs offset the good news on loan growth and continued low credit costs. Vitamin Shoppe cut its guidance largely due to Sports nutrition (about 30% of its business) experiencing sales declines and Nutriforce (its manufacturing/third-party sales segment) still operating at sub-scale levels.


	Looking ahead


		The Fund seeks to capitalize on behavioral biases that may cause the market to overreact to old, negative information or underreact to new, positive information on a company. We look for companies with significant insider buying or stock repurchases, and evidence of overreaction that has caused devaluation, in conjunction with sound fundamentals.

		The Fund had a realized year-to-date Beta of 0.75 and lower realized year-to-date volatility than the Russell 2000 Value Index (11.2% versus 14.1%, respectively) based on daily returns. The Barra-forecasted Beta is 0.87.

		The end-of-quarter cash level was 3.7%, which declined from 7.8% as of the end of the first quarter and 12.7% as of year-end 2016; during the quarter, we invested in four new companies, three of which had insider buying and one of which had share repurchases. We also reallocated some capital to existing holdings. Notably we were able to increase our weight in banks at substantial discounts of about 20% to recent peak prices, bringing our bank weight up to 11.8% from 8.8%.

		The portfolio currently holds 93 positions, with the top 10 accounting for 25% of the total and the top 25 accounting for 47%.

Disclaimer1Please refer to the prospectus for additional information about cut-off times. Total return assumes reinvestment of income. The Fund's adviser and/or its affiliates have contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses to the extent Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, dividend and interest expenses related to short sales, interest, taxes, expenses related to litigation and potential litigation and extraordinary expenses) exceed 1.30% for A Shares, 1.80% for C Shares, 1.05% for I Shares, 0.90% for L Shares, 1.55% for R2 Shares, 1.30% for R3 Shares, 1.05% for R4 Shares, 0.90% for R5 Shares and 0.80% for R6 Shares of the average daily net assets. The Fund may invest in one or more money market funds advised by the adviser or its affiliates (affiliated money market funds). The Fund's adviser has contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses in an amount sufficient to offset the fees and expenses of the affiliated money market funds incurred by the Fund because of the Fund's investment in such money market funds. This waiver is in effect through 12/31/2017 for A Shares, 12/31/2017 for C Shares, 12/31/2017 for I Shares, 12/31/2017 for L Shares, 12/31/2017 for R2 Shares, 2/28/2018 for R3 Shares, 2/28/2018 for R4 Shares, 2/28/2018 for R5 Shares and 12/31/2017 for R6 Shares, at which time the adviser and/or its affiliates will determine whether to renew or revise it. The difference between net and gross fees includes all applicable fee waivers and expense reimbursements. The quoted performance of the Fund includes performance of a predecessor fund/share class prior to the Fund's commencement of operations. Please refer to the current prospectus for further information.  Mutual funds have fees that reduce their performance: indexes do not. You cannot invest directly in an index. The Russell 2000 Value Index is an unmanaged index, measuring performance of those Russell 2000 companies with lower price-to-book ratios and lower forecasted growth values. The performance of the Lipper Small-Cap Value Funds Index includes expenses associated with a mutual fund, such as investment management fees. These expenses are not identical to the expenses charged by the Fund. Total return figures (for the fund and any index quoted) assume payment of fees and reinvestment of dividends (after the highest applicable foreign withholding tax) and distributions. Without fee waivers, fund returns would have been lower. Due to rounding, some values may not total 100%. Â©2017, American Bankers Association, CUSIP Database provided by the Standard & Poor's CUSIP Service Bureau, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. All rights reserved.The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10- year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.Rankings do not take sales loads into account.The following risks could cause the fund to lose money or perform more poorly than other investments. For more complete risk information, see the prospectus. Small-capitalization investments typically carry more risk than investments in well-established "blue-chip" companies since smaller companies generally have a higher risk of failure. Historically, smaller companies' stock has experienced a greater degree of market volatility than the average stock. From the commencement of operations of the Fund's Institutional Class until January 30, 2004, the Fund's investment adviser was Undiscovered Managers, LLC. Effective January 31, 2004, J.P. Morgan Investment Management, Inc. (JPMIM) became the Fund's investment advisor. Fuller & Thaler Asset Management, Inc. serves as the Fund's sub-advisor. The Fund is currently waiving fees. Please note the removal of this waiver would reduce returns.Total return assumes reinvestment of income. The top 10 holdings listed reflect only the Fund's long-term investments. Short-term investments are excluded. Holdings are subject to change. The holdings listed should not be considered recommendations to purchase or sell a particular security. Each individual security is calculated as a percentage of the aggregate market value of the securities held in the Fund and does not include the use of derivative positions, where applicable. P/E ratio: the number by which earnings per share is multiplied to estimate a stock's value.  P/B ratio: the relationship between a stock's price and the book value of that stock. Sharpe ratio measures the fund's excess return compared to a risk-free investment. The higher the Sharpe ratio, the better the returns relative to the risk taken. Tracking Error: The active risk of the portfolio, which determines the annualized standard deviation of the excess returns between the portfolio and the benchmark. Alpha: The relationship between the performance of the Fund and its beta over a three-year period of time. Standard deviation/Volatility: A statistical measure of the degree to which the Fund's returns have varied from its historical average. The higher the standard deviation, the wider the range of returns from its average and the greater the historical volatility. The standard deviation is calculated over a 36-month period based on Fund's monthly returns. The standard deviation shown is based on the Fund's Class A Shares or the oldest share class, where Class A Shares are not available. R2: The percentage of a Fund's movements that result from movements in the index ranging from 0 to 100. A Fund with an R2 of 100 means that 100 percent of the Fund's movement can completely be explained by movements in the Fund's external index benchmark. EPS: Total earnings divided by the number of shares outstanding. Risk measures are calculated based upon the Funds' broad-based index as stated in the prospectus.

Summary







 


Overall Rating

4 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 4 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 337 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.

What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average


This fund scores Above Average because it delivered returns that were in the top 22.5% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


High


This fund's expenses are rated as High because they are above the 80th percentile when compared with other funds in the category.





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks capital appreciation.




Strategy



The fund seeks to achieve its objective by investing primarily in common stocks of U.S. companies that the fund's sub-adviser believes have value characteristics. Such common stocks include stocks of small capitalization companies, similar to those that are included in the Russell 2000 Value Index and real estate investment trusts (REITs). In selecting stocks for the fund, the sub-adviser applies principles based on behavioral finance.


Risk



The securities of smaller, less well-known companies can be more volatile than those of larger companies. Value stocks can perform differently than other types of stocks and can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. These risks may be magnified in foreign markets. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.




Additional Disclosures

This description is only intended to provide a brief overview of the mutual fund. Read the fund's prospectus for more detailed information about the fund.
The Russell 2000® Value Index is an unmanaged market capitalization-weighted index of value-oriented stocks of U.S. domiciled companies that are included in the Russell 2000® Index. Value-oriented stocks tend to have lower price-to-book ratios and lower forecasted growth values.
The analysis on these pages may be based, in part, on adjusted historical returns for periods prior to the class's actual inception of 06/04/2004.  These calculated returns reflect the historical performance of the oldest share class of the fund, with an inception date of 12/28/1998, adjusted to reflect the fees and expenses of this share class (when this share class's fees and expenses are higher.)  Please refer to a fund's prospectus for information regarding fees and expenses.  These adjusted historical returns are not actual returns.  Calculation methodologies utilized by Morningstar may differ from those applied by other entities, including the fund itself.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Low


This fund scores Low because Morningstar has rated its risk below the 20th percentile when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average


This fund scores Above Average because it delivered returns that were in the top 22.5% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Risk



The securities of smaller, less well-known companies can be more volatile than those of larger companies. Value stocks can perform differently than other types of stocks and can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. These risks may be magnified in foreign markets. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

The Morningstar information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or redistributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. Transaction Fee:A transaction fee is similar to a  brokerage fee or commission which you pay when you buy or sell a stock. For some funds available through Fidelity you are required to pay a transaction fee. However, you will not pay a sales load on Transaction Fee (TF) funds. You will only be charged a transaction fee when you buy a FundsNetwork TF fund, not when you sell one. All other fees and expenses described in a fund's prospectus still apply. You can choose to buy or sell shares directly from the fund itself or its principal underwriter or distributor without paying a transaction fee to Fidelity.Online Transaction Fees:  $49.95 for most funds.  Certain funds will have a transaction fee of $75. To identify any applicable transaction fees associated with the purchase of a given fund, please refer to the "Fees and Distributions" tab.Fidelity Automated Service Telephone (FAST): 25% off representative-assisted rates, Maximum: $187.50, Minimum:$75Representative-Assisted: 0.75% of principal, Maximum: $250, Minimum: $100Automatic Investment: $5 per transaction, after the initial investment.Sales load:A sales charge added to the price of the fund.  Funds have different sales charge structures, including front-end loads, back-end loads (deferred), and no loads. Sales loads can either be charged when a fund is purchased, commonly known as a front-end load, or when a fund is sold, known as a deferred load. Not  all funds charge a load. Refer to the Loads, Expense and Minimums section of the fund's prospectus for details on these amounts. Although no load funds do not have a front-end or deferred load, they may incur other fees, such as a 12b-1 fee.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated. Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower. Except for Life of Fund returns, the analysis on these pages may be based, in part, on adjusted historical returns for periods prior to the class's actual inception of 6/4/2004.  These calculated returns reflect the historical performance of the oldest share class of the fund, with an inception date of 12/28/1998, adjusted to reflect the fees and expenses of this share class (when this share class's fees and expenses are higher.)  Please refer to a fund's prospectus for information regarding fees and expenses.  These adjusted historical returns are not actual returns.  Calculation methodologies utilized by Morningstar may differ from those applied by other entities, including the fund itself.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
6. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
7. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
8. The analysis on these pages may be based, in part, on adjusted historical returns for periods prior to the class's actual inception of 6/4/2004.  These calculated returns reflect the historical performance of the oldest share class of the fund, with an inception date of 12/28/1998, adjusted to reflect the fees and expenses of this share class (when this share class's fees and expenses are higher.)  Please refer to a fund's prospectus for information regarding fees and expenses.  These adjusted historical returns are not actual returns.  Calculation methodologies utilized by Morningstar may differ from those applied by other entities, including the fund itself.
9. StyleMap� depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
10. Please note Regional Diversification information is based on the equity components only.
11. Expense caps and waivers are limits that the fund company has placed on the level of the expenses borne by the fund until 12/31/2017 and indicates the maximum level of expenses (with certain exceptions) that the fund would be paying until that time. After the expiration date, the expense cap and/or waiver may be terminated or revised, which may lower the fund's yield and return.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

JPMorgan Fleming Asset Management Expands Investment Advisory Practice Through Acquisition of Undiscovered Managers | Business Wire


























































JPMorgan Fleming Asset Management Expands Investment Advisory Practice Through Acquisition of Undiscovered Managers






November 18, 2003 05:32 PM Eastern Standard Time



				NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 18, 2003--JPMorgan Fleming Asset Management announced today its acquisition of certain assets of Undiscovered Managers, LLC, a Dallas-based investment advisor to sub-advised mutual funds. In connection with the transaction, Mark Hurley, CEO and Chairman of Undiscovered Managers, and members of his senior team will join JPMorgan Fleming.  The transaction will pair Undiscovered Managers' relationships with the investment advisor market with JPMorgan Fleming's broad product offerings and wealth management expertise. The combined team will focus on bringing innovative product ideas and wealth management solutions to the investment advisory community. 

 The terms of the transaction were not disclosed.  George Gatch, Managing Director and President of JPMorgan Funds said: "We are thrilled to combine Undiscovered Managers' insights in the investment advisory market with JPMorgan Fleming's unparalleled product and wealth management expertise. This transaction is designed specifically to increase the value we bring to the investment advisory community. We are enthusiastic about the opportunity to expand our ability to assist advisors in serving the needs of the affluent market by partnering with Mark and his team."  "Undiscovered Managers' strong focus and commitment to the investment advisor community gives us a unique perspective in understanding this dynamic market. We are excited to partner with JPMorgan Fleming, with its vast resources and its institutional approach to asset management. In particular, it is one of the largest alternative asset managers in the world. As part of their team, we will have an opportunity to create unique products that will help advisors better solve their clients' problems," said Mark Hurley, CEO and Chairman of Undiscovered Managers.  The following Undiscovered Managers Funds will continue to be sub-advised by the sub-advisor appointed at each such fund's inception: Behavioral Growth Fund - Fuller & Thaler Asset Management, Inc., Behavioral Value Fund - Fuller & Thaler Asset Management, Inc., and the Small Cap Growth Fund - Mazama Capital Management, Inc. All of these funds will remain available through financial advisors and will keep their original tickers and names.  Pending shareholder approval, JPMorgan Fleming will be named the investment advisor to the Undiscovered Managers Behavioral Growth Fund (UBRLX, UBRRX), Behavioral Value Fund (UBVLX), REIT Fund (URTLX) and the Small Cap Growth Fund (USRLX), all of which have outperformed their benchmarks since inception.(1)  "Our strategy is to design and deliver strong performing, innovative products to our clients," said Andrew Spencer, Managing Director and Chief Investment Officer of JPMorgan Funds. "The Undiscovered Managers Funds are a welcomed addition to the JPMorgan Fund Family, and we look forward to complementing them with existing and new products that meet the needs of our clients."  The only sub-advisory change affects the Undiscovered Managers REIT Fund. Prior to this announcement, Undiscovered Managers had entered into an agreement with JPMorgan Fleming to have it replace the current sub-advisor to the REIT Fund, subject to trustee and shareholder approval. "Our initial agreement was solely to have JPMorgan Fleming replace our REIT sub-advisor," Hurley explained. "JPMorgan Fleming's REIT team is nationally recognized for its expertise and has been selected as a manager by many of the top pension plans in the country." He added, "We then arrived at a separate agreement to be acquired by JPMorgan Fleming. It became clear to us that by joining the JPMorgan Fleming team, we could take our entire business to another level."  The acquisition comes at a time when investors and their advisors are faced with the challenge of making prudent investment decisions amid difficult markets. JPMorgan Fleming's existing mutual fund product range consists of 70 equity, fixed income, tax efficient and sector funds including the most recently launched JPMorgan Intrepid Funds - JPMorgan Fleming's premier U.S. domiciled behavioral finance funds. The JPMorgan Funds currently have approximately $110 billion in total net assets.  As a part of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Fleming Asset Management is a global asset management leader providing world-class investment solutions to corporations, governments, institutions, endowments, foundations and individuals. The firm is responsible for close to $527 billion in assets under management as of September 30, 2003.(2)  (2) This includes JPMorgan Private Bank.  Past performance is not indicative of future returns. Investment returns will fluctuate, so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than original cost.  For more complete information, including charges or ongoing expenses please read the prospectus. Please read carefully before investing or sending money.  JPMorgan Fleming Asset Management is the marketing name for the asset management business of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.

Undiscovered Managers Funds has expanded its roster of nine funds with two new international funds, the UM International Equity Fund and the UM International Small Cap Equity Fund. The investment objective of both funds is capital appreciation by investing in publicly traded stocks in Europe, Asia, Australia and New Zealand.Mark Hurley, Undiscovered Managers' president, says he selected Unibank Securities as sub-advisor for both funds because its "returns have been driven primarily by stock and sector selection, not country selection. We believe such an approach to international investing is far more sustainable over the long run."
