How Drizly Works




We work with local stores so you can shop their shelves using your smartphone or computer to order beer, wine and liquor at the touch of a button.  You still have to drink it the old fashioned way, though.










Shop Now









Enter your address to shop beer, wine and liquor available at your location.











Shop and order from thousands of products. No markups. Seriously.











Grab some glasses - your order will be prepped and packed by our store partners.  You'll be notified when it's on the way.
