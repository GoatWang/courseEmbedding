                    This is a great place to grow up or raise your family- I should know- I grew up here!  We love the small town feel but then close enough to Fort Wayne or South Bend if major shopping is needed!  Leesburg is home to some very popular things- like my favorite- Lakes!! Lake Tippecanoe is one of the lakes that is home in Leesburg, this lake is the deepest natural lake in Indiana and was recently featured on a Lakefront Bargain Hunt Show of HGTV!  This lake is filled with fun- from all sports including skiing, wakeboarding, surfing, to jet skiing- paddle boarding, kayaking- to just floating or fishing- Lake Tippecanoe is a summer destination to not be forgotten! If you golf we are home to the Lake Tippecanoe Country Club where golfing and club life is quite popular!  We have Patona Bay Boat Service proving new boat sales and service on the lake as well as the famous Tippy Ballroom Gardens- if you are looking for a place to call home- Lake Tippecanoe is calling you! It called us and we have not left!  Leesburg is also a great town with all kinds of places to eat and drink- and visit- Tippy Winery just opened and is a favorite landing spot of the locals and tourists alike- with live music and wonderful atmosphere to enjoy family and friends!  Come see what we all love so much and visit Leesburg and Lake Tippecanoe!
