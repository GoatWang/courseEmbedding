Variable Annuities

The opportunity for market appreciation with tax-deferral






























Variable annuities provide the opportunity for market appreciation — through a variety of investment options — with tax-deferral and future income. Variable annuities are designed for people willing to take on more risk in exchange for greater growth potential. While there is risk associated with a variable annuity, many offer guarantees of principal and downside protection at an additional cost and depending on contract rider availability. However, these guarantees do not apply to the investment performance or amounts held in the variable investment options.













Investment Edge®
Defers current taxes when trying to accumulate wealth and provides tax-efficient distributions, adding powerful tax advantages to a diversified portfolio.


BENEFITSDiversificationTax-efficient Tax deferralDeath Benefit





Retirement Cornerstone®
A single tax-deferred platform comprised of two separate accounts with distinct features that help address different goals - offering the ability to not only accumulate, but also protect retirement income.


BENEFITSInvestment opportunityGuaranteed incomeDeath benefit guarantees





Structured Capital Strategies®
Several investment options, some of which allow participation in the upside potential of indices, up to a cap, that track certain domestic, international and commodities markets, and which have a built-in partial protection feature.
 


BENEFITSUpside potential up to a capPartial protectionTax deferral





The Accumulator® Series
A long-term retirement product that allows the ability to invest for growth potential on a tax-deferred basis. Also provides for guaranteed benefits through optional riders available for an additional fee.


BENEFITSInvestment Lifetime incomeDeath benefit






















Important Note AXA believes that education is a key step toward addressing your financial goals, and we've designed this material to serve simply as an informational and educational resource.  Accordingly, the information on this website does not offer or constitute investment advice and makes no direct or indirect recommendation of any particular product or of the appropriateness of any particular investment-related option.  Your needs, goals and circumstances are unique, and they require the individualized attention of your financial professional.
Annuities are long-term financial products designed for retirement purposes. In essence, annuities are contractual agreements in which payment(s) are made to an insurance company, which agrees to pay out an income or a lump sum amount at a later date. There are contract limitations and fees and charges associated with annuities, administrative fees, and charges for optional benefits. A financial professional can provide cost information and complete details. Variable annuities are subject to fluctuation in value and market risk, including loss of principal.
Withdrawals from annuities are subject to normal income tax treatment and if taken prior to age 59½, may be subject to an additional 10% federal income tax penalty. Withdrawals may also be subject to a contractual withdrawal charge.
Please consider the charges, risk, expenses, and investment objectives carefully before purchasing a variable annuity. For a prospectus containing this and other information, please contact a financial professional. Read it carefully before you invest or send money.
Guarantees are based on the claims-paying ability of AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company (NY,NY).
Variable annuities are issued by AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company (NY, NY) and co-distributed by affiliates AXA Distributors, LLC and AXA Advisors, LLC (members FINRA, SIPC).GE-92925 (10/2016)

Growth potential
Downside protection
Tax-free retirement income



Live more for today
Live more for today with financial security against life’s unknowns.  Because BrightLife® Grow Survivorship provides a life insurance benefit for the next generation, you and your spouse will know that your children will be taken care of when you’re no longer around.
Keep more of the money you earn
You can access the policy’s cash value, potentially tax-free, if you need it, for important financial goals or to help maintain your quality of life in retirement.  It also provides a financial security benefit that is generally tax-free for your children, so more of your money will stay in your family, instead of going toward taxes. 
Build more for tomorrow
This policy includes a growth component, so you can build cash value by tracking a market index, with potential for growth and some protection from market downturns.  A survivorship policy is generally more cost-effective than two separate policies, giving you the potential to have your cash value accumulate more quickly over time.

Split your premiums however you want
Change your allocation at any time

Take advantage of tax benefits
Not only does your cash value have the potential to grow tax-deferred, but you can generally take loans tax-free and your beneficiaries typically receive an income tax-free life insurance benefit.
Personalize your policy with optional riders
You can customize your BrightLife Grow Survivorship policy with one or more optional features. Some charge an additional fee, some are automatically included, though all have certain limitations.

Choosing the indexed strategy that's right for you
Market outlook should be a key factor in your choice of Core, Plus, or Hi-Par Options

Comparing the indexed strategies with hypothetical returns
To further demonstrate the differences in the Indexed Strategies, the chart below shows four different hypothetical S&P 500® returns — at 3%, 6%, 10% and 13%. The bars indicate what your corresponding performance would be for each of the strategies selected.

Under current federal tax rules, you generally may take federal income tax-free withdrawals up to your basis (total premiums paid) in the policy or loans from a life insurance policy that is not a Modified Endowment Contract (MEC). Certain exceptions may apply for partial withdrawals during the policy's first 15 years. If the policy is a MEC, all distributions (withdrawals or loans) are taxed as ordinary income to the extent of gain in the policy, and may also be subject to an additional 10% premature distribution penalty prior to age 59 1/2, unless certain exceptions are applicable. Loans and partial withdrawals will decrease the death benefit and cash value of your life insurance policy and may be subject to policy limitations and income tax. In addition, loans and partial withdrawals may cause certain policy benefits or riders to become unavailable and may increase the chance your policy may lapse. If the policy lapses, is surrendered or becomes a MEC, the loan balance at such time would generally be viewed as distributed and taxable under the general rules for distribution of policy cash values.

Overview

View By Product Type









Life insurance: a multi-purpose financial tool
Life insurance is designed primarily to protect your family’s financial security after you die. But your needs change and some types of insurance can offer you access to assets to meet needs during your lifetime. So it’s a smart addition to any financial plan — because it can serve different functions within your overall investment strategy.
Security for your family should something happen to you
Life insurance can help:

Pay debts and taxes after your death
Allow your family to maintain its standard of living 
Support your dependents’ goals and dreams 
Provide immediate access to cash1 

Should your need for a death benefit decrease, certain types of life insurance may serve to provide funds for other needs.  Please discuss these options with your financial professional.
A must-have for your financial plan
No matter what kind of life insurance you choose, there’s no substitute for the peace of mind it can provide. Life insurance is one of the ways you can protect your family’s financial security should something happen to you. Talk to your financial professional/licensed insurance agent about your long-term needs, and he or she can help you determine:

Which type of insurance is right for you
How much protection you and your family need

How to make the most of your premium dollars


How much life insurance do you need?
One very simple way to get a rough estimate may be to base the amount of insurance on your current, after-tax income (since life insurance is generally paid out tax free). Multiply that by the number of years your beneficiaries will need the income. Remember to make an allowance for inflation. 
But there is no substitute for a careful evaluation and review of your life insurance needs with your financial advisor.  If you aren't yet working with a financial professional, we can have someone contact you.

Life Insurance: is not a deposit of any bank; is not FDIC insured; is not insured by any federal government agency; is not guaranteed by any bank or savings association.
1 Withdrawals and loans from life insurance policies may be subject to fees, penalties, and income taxes depending on the specific life insurance policy and the policyholder’s tax situation. Withdrawals reduce the policy value and death benefit. Loans taken from the policies also accrue interest, which will further decrease the policy's cash value and death benefit.
Life insurance and annuities are issued by AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company (AXA Equitable) and by various unaffiliated carriers through AXA Network, LLC and its subsidiaries. Co-distributed by AXA Distributors, LLC and AXA Advisors, LLC, members FINRA, SIPC.AXA Equitable, AXA Network, AXA Distributors and AXA Advisors are affiliated companies. All guarantees are based on the claims-paying ability of AXA Equitable. The guarantees do not apply to the investment portfolios. AXA Financial, Inc. and its subsidiaries do not provide tax or legal advice.

Universal Life Insurance

More options, more flexibility






























Universal Life Insurance provides death benefit protection, as well as a savings or cash value component. It builds cash value because the insurance company credits your policy each month with a fixed interest rate. You have some flexibility to pay your premiums in different amounts or at different times.














BrightLife® Protect
A flexible-premium, cost-effective life insurance policy offering both the opportunity for lifetime insurance protection and the potential accumulation of cash value through allocation to a Select Account and/or a Fixed Account.

A deferred variable annuity, such as Retirement Cornerstone®, is a long-term financial product designed for retirement purposes. It is a contractual agreement in which payment(s) are made to an insurance company, which agrees to pay out an income or a lump sum amount at a later date. Variable annuity contracts offer tax-deferred growth potential and optional features such as living and death benefits. Guarantees are based on the claims-paying ability of the issuing company.
Withdrawals from an annuity contract are taxable as ordinary income and, if made prior to age 59½, may be subject to an additional 10% federal tax. Withdrawals may also be subject to withdrawal charges. Amounts invested in an annuity’s portfolios are subject to fluctuation in value and market risk, including loss of principal. There are fees and charges associated with a variable annuity contract, which include, but are not limited to, operations charges, sales and withdrawal charges, administrative fees, and additional charges for optional benefits. See the prospectus for complete details.
If you are purchasing an annuity contract to fund an Individual Retirement Annuity (IRA) or employer-sponsored retirement plan, you should be aware that such annuities do not provide tax-deferral benefits beyond those already provided by the Internal Revenue Code. Before purchasing one of these annuities, you should consider whether its features and benefits beyond tax deferral meet your needs and goals. You may also want to consider the relative features, benefits and costs of these annuities with any other investment that you may use in connection with your retirement plan or arrangement.
The contingent withdrawal charge declines from 7% over a seven-year period for the Series B product. Please see the prospectus for the withdrawal charge scale for other annuities in the Retirement Cornerstone® Series. This content is not a complete description of all material provisions of the variable annuity contract. The prospectus contains more complete information, including investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses, limitations and restrictions. Please read the prospectus and any applicable supplements, and consider this information carefully before purchasing a contract.
There are certain contract limitations and restrictions associated with the Retirement Cornerstone® contract, which include, but are not limited to, a contract fee and additional charges for optional benefits. In addition, the underlying investment portfolios charge management fees and have other expenses. For costs and complete details of coverage, speak to your financial professional/insurance-licensed registered representative. Certain types of contracts, features and benefits may not be available in all jurisdictions. AXA Equitable offers other variable annuity contracts with different fees, charges and features. Not every contract is available through the same selling broker/dealer. AXA Equitable may discontinue contributions and transfers among investment options or make other changes in contribution and transfer requirements and limitations. If we discontinue contributions and transfers into the Protected Benefit Account, you will no longer be able to fund your guaranteed benefits.
Retirement Cornerstone® is a registered service mark AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company, New York, NY 10104. Retirement Cornerstone® variable annuities are issued by AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company, New York, NY 10104. All contract and rider guarantees, including optional benefits and any fixed subaccount crediting rates or annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability of AXA Equitable. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which this annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency from which this annuity is purchased or any affiliates of those entities and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims paying ability of AXA Equitable.

Life Insurance

Term Life Insurance

Pure protection for a limited time






























Term life insurance provides low-cost death benefit protection for temporary needs. It pays a level death benefit and does not build up cash value. Term insurance typically offers the most protection for your premium dollar, making it generally the most affordable type of insurance available value.




Advantages of Term Life Insurance
If your insurance need is projected for a certain number of years, for example, until a debt is paid off, or if cost is a prime consideration, Term may be right for you.
You can choose protection for one to twenty years and Term can save you money or allow you to purchase a larger death benefit than may otherwise be manageable.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
