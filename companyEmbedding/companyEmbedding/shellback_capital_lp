 Career History



Analyst

                                    Current                


Shellback Capital LP


                  Shellback Capital’s seeks to achieve capital appreciation primarily through investments in equity securities. The firm mainly invests in US-listed equities, although investments may be made in non-US equities. Long positions are taken in securities of companies that Shellback believes are attractively valued, with an emphasis on companies that they believe are likely to achieve earnings above consensus expectations. Short positions are taken in securities of companies which Shellback believes are overvalued by the market, with emphasis on companies with strong potential to achieve earnings below consensus expectations or companies showing deteriorating financial characteristics. Positions may also be used for hedging and risk management purposes.The funds’ investment strategy is based on a research-intensive security selection process. While attention is paid to general macro-economic and financial market conditions, Shellback believes the stock selection process is the most important determinant to achieving superior investment results. Shellback generally develops proprietary earnings models for issuers in which the funds invest. In addition to the emphasis on fundamental analysis, Shellback may also use technical analysis to screen for potential investments and monitor current positions. Securities of all market-caps may be included in the portfolio, including small- to mid-cap companies.Shellback's funds utilize leverage to take advantage of market opportunities. The funds may borrow money from banks or brokerage firms, purchase securities on margin, as well as finance positions and lend funds through repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements. Shellback's investment program emphasizes active management of the funds’ portfolio. Excess funds may be invested in short-term investments, including US Government securities, money market funds, commercial paper, certificates of deposit and bankers’ acceptances.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

                          Stock prices used are the "total returns" stock price and will include
                          dividends, spinoffs, splits, and other adjustments.  Because of this, stock
                          prices shown here will likely not
                          match a stock's actual closing stock price on the same date.
