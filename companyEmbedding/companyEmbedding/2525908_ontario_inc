Diggers & Dealers: Northern Star names Plutonic buyer | The West Australian















Yahoo7The West AustralianFinanceDiggers & Dealers: Northern Star names Plutonic buyerNick EvansMonday, 1 August 2016 2:05AMNorthern Star Resources is pushing ahead with its Millennium underground mine.UPDATE 10.05am:  The Canadian buyer of Northern Star Resources’ Plutonic gold mine will spend up to $65.5 million in cash and scrip in a multi-layered deal outlined by the WA gold miner today.Canada’s 2525908 Ontario Inc - a company associated with mining executive Chris Bradbrook - will pay $12.5 million in cash up front.If the company lists on the Toronto Stock Exchange within 12 months, Northern Star will take $25 million worth of its stock - or $25 million in cash in a year if no listing is achieved - plus up to $8 million worth of options in its stock.Mr Bradbrook’s company will pay a 2 per cent net smelter royalty on gold production from Plutonic, capped at $10 million, and further milestone payments, worth up to another $10 million, based around the extension of Plutonic’s gold endowment.Northern Star said the deal was still to be finalised, but the Canadian company had exclusive rights to negotiate a deal for Plutonic until August 15.The in-principle agreement brings to a close Northern Star’s six month sales process over the ageing gold mine, which is producing about 100,000 ounces of gold a year.Northern Star said it expected to produce 485,000 to 515,000oz this financial year, at an average all-in sustaining cost of $1000 to $1050/oz.Shares in Northern Star were up nine cents, or 1.71 per cent, to $5.36 at 1.40pm.7News UpdateArt heist man pleads guiltyNat Fyfe commits to Freo for six more yearsBrought to you by Seven NewsRelated storiesRebrandSay bye to Amart Sports, and hello to more Rebel storesInfection scareParents warned after dust found on PMH surgery traysMan chargedVictim dies in hospital 11 days after alleged assaultWA NewsThe biggest vessel the world has ever seen

							ASX demands more detail on Northern Star deal

 Email 






					Written by THE WEST AUSTRALIAN 



					Published: 02 August 2016				



 

Northern Star Resources’ celebration at joining the S&P-ASX 100 index was marred yesterday when the company was forced into a trading halt shortly after announcing the sale of its Plutonic gold mine.
In a move likely to spark further debate about enforcement of disclosure rules around asset sales and financing deals, the Australian Securities Exchange halted trading in Northern Star after demanding more information over the mooted deal with Canada’s 2525908 Ontario Inc.
Northern Star released the name of the putative buyer, a company associated with mining executive Chris Bradbrook, before the market opened, saying it was an in-principle agreement only, and that final terms were still under discussion.
Two hours later a trading halt was called after the ASX demanded Northern Star outline the likely terms of the transaction.
Northern Star did not return to trading until late in the day, after announcing Mr Bradbrook’s company would pay up to $67 million for the ageing 100,000 ounce a year gold mine.
It will pay $12.5 million in cash up front.
If the company lists on the Toronto stock exchange within 12 months, Northern Star will take $25 million worth of its stock, or $25 million in cash in a year if no listing is achieved, plus up to $8 million worth of options in its stock.
Mr Bradbrook’s company will pay a 2 per cent net smelter royalty on gold production from Plutonic, capped at $10 million, and further milestone payments, worth up to another $10 million, based around the extension of Plutonic’s gold endowment.
Northern Star said the deal was still to be finalised, but the Canadian company had exclusive rights to negotiate a deal for Plutonic until August 15.
Northern Star shares closed up 4¢ to $5.31.
