(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with "Selected Financial Data" and our Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto.  Overview  Nature of Our Business  Denny's Corporation (Denny's) is one of America's largest franchised full-service restaurant chains. Denny's, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Denny's, Inc., owns and operates the Denny's brand. At December 28, 2016, the Denny's brand consisted of 1,733 franchised, licensed and company operated restaurants. Of this amount, 1,564 of our restaurants were franchised or licensed, representing 90% of the total restaurants, and 169 were company operated.  Our revenues are derived primarily from two sources: the sale of food and beverages at our company restaurants and the collection of royalties and fees from restaurants operated by our franchisees under the Denny's name. Sales and customer traffic at both company and franchised restaurants are affected by the success of our marketing campaigns, new product introductions, product quality enhancements, customer service and menu pricing, as well as external factors including competition, economic conditions affecting consumer spending and changes in guests' tastes and preferences. Sales at company restaurants and royalty income from franchise restaurants are also impacted by the opening of new restaurants, the closing of existing restaurants, the sale of company restaurants to franchisees and the acquisition of restaurants from franchisees.  Our operating costs are exposed to volatility in two main areas: payroll and benefit costs and product costs. The volatility of payroll and benefit costs results primarily from changes in wage rates and increases in labor related expenses, such as medical benefit costs and workers' compensation costs. Additionally, changes in guest counts and investments in store-level labor impact payroll and benefit costs as a percentage of sales. Many of the products sold in our restaurants are affected by commodity pricing and are, therefore, subject to price volatility. This volatility is caused by factors that are fundamentally outside of our control and are often unpredictable. In general, we purchase food products based on market prices or we set firm prices in purchase agreements with our vendors. In an inflationary commodity environment, our ability to lock in prices on certain key commodities is imperative to controlling food costs. In addition, our continued success with menu management helps us offer menu items that provide a compelling value to our customers while maintaining attractive product costs and profitability.  2016 Summary of Operations  During 2016, we achieved domestic system-wide same-stores sales growth of 0.9%, comprised of a 1.1% increase at company restaurants and a 0.8% increase at domestic franchised restaurants. In addition to growing system-wide same-store sales in 14 of the past 15 quarters, Denny's achieved its sixth consecutive year of positive system-wide same-store sales.  A total of 240 remodels were completed during 2016, comprised of 27 at company restaurants and 213 at franchised restaurants. These remodels were in our Heritage image, which we launched late in 2013. This updated look reflects a more contemporary diner feel to further reinforce our America's Diner positioning. We anticipate over 200 remodels will be completed system-wide in 2017. By the end of 2018, we expect 75% of the system will have been remodeled to the most current image.  During 2014, we implemented a new franchise agreement, which included a royalty rate of 4.5% and an advertising contribution of 3%, excluding any incentives. There were approximately 600 franchised restaurants (42%) operating under this agreement as of December 28, 2016, and we expect there to be approximately 700 franchised restaurants (49%) operating under this agreement by the end of 2017. We anticipate that existing franchisees will elect to migrate to the new fee structure over the next decade as incentives under previous franchise agreements expire. Due to the long-term migration of existing franchisees, we will not see the full benefit of the higher royalty rate for some time. For 2016, our average domestic royalty rate was approximately 4.11%.  During 2014, our Board of Directors approved the termination and liquidation of the Advantica Pension Plan (the "Pension Plan"). During 2016, we completed the liquidation of the Pension Plan. Accordingly, we made a final contribution of $9.5 million to the Pension Plan and recognized a settlement loss of $24.3 million, reflecting the recognition of unamortized actuarial losses that were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. As a result, operating income decreased $16.2 million to $47.0 million in 2016 from $63.2 million in 2015. Net income decreased $16.6 million to $19.4 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, in 2016 compared to $36.0 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, in 2015.  Growing the Brand  Over the last five years our growth initiatives have led to 219 new restaurant openings. During 2016, we had net restaurant growth of 23 restaurants, with 50 openings and 27 closures. Our openings included 14 franchised international locations, including four in Canada, three in Mexico, two in Honduras, two in the Philippines, one in the United Arab Emirates, one in Trinidad and one in Puerto Rico. Our goal is to increase net restaurant growth through all avenues:  Balancing the Use of Cash  We are focused on balancing the use of cash between reinvesting in our base of company restaurants, growing and strengthening the brand and returning cash to shareholders. During 2016, cash capital expenditures were $34.0 million, comprised of $19.7 million in capital expenditures and restaurants acquisition costs of $14.3 million. The capital expenditures included approximately $6.4 million allocated towards the remodel of 27 company restaurants. The restaurant acquisition costs include $13.7 million for ten high-volume franchised restaurants and $0.6 million related to a franchised restaurant that was acquired during 2015.  In November 2016, as part of our previously authorized share repurchase programs, we entered into a variable term, capped accelerated share repurchase (the "2016 ASR") agreement with MUFG Securities EMEA plc ("MUFG"), to repurchase an aggregate of $25 million of our common stock. Pursuant to the terms of the 2016 ASR agreement, we paid $25 million in cash, received approximately 1.5 million shares of our common stock (which represents the minimum shares to be delivered based on the cap price) and recorded $18.1 million of treasury stock related to these shares. The remaining balance of $6.9 million is included as additional paid-in capital in shareholders' equity as of December 28, 2016 as an equity forward contract. The total aggregate number of shares of our common stock repurchased pursuant to the ASR agreement will be based generally on the average of the daily volume-weighted average prices of our common stock, less a fixed discount, over the term of the 2016 ASR agreement, subject to a minimum number of shares. Subsequent to the year ended December 28, 2016, we settled the 2016 ASR agreement. See Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.  During 2016, including shares repurchased under the 2016 ASR, we repurchased a total of 4.6 million shares for $51.8 million. In addition, we recorded 1.5 million shares and $13.1 million in treasury stock as a result of settling the 2015 ASR. Since initiating our share repurchase programs in November 2010, we have repurchased a total of 35.8 million shares of our common stock for $265.9 million. As of December 28, 2016, there was $79.2 million remaining under the current repurchase program.  Factors impacting comparability  For 2016, 2015 and 2014, the following items impacted the comparability of our results:   Company restaurant sales have increased from $334.7 million in 2014 to $367.3 million in 2016, primarily as a result of the increase in same-store sales and acquisitions of restaurants from franchisees.   Royalty income, which is included as a component of franchise and license revenue, has increased from $90.8 million in 2014 to $98.4 million in 2016, primarily as a result of the increase in same-store sales and a higher royalty rate.   Initial franchise fees, included as a component of franchise and license revenue, are generally recognized in the period in which a restaurant is sold to a franchisee or when a new restaurant is opened. These initial fees are completely dependent on the number of restaurants sold to or opened by franchisees during a particular period and, as a result, can cause fluctuations in our total franchise and license revenue from year to year.   Occupancy revenues, also included as a component of franchise and license revenue, result from leasing or subleasing restaurants to franchisees. When restaurants are sold and leased or subleased to franchisees, the occupancy costs related to these restaurants move from costs of company restaurant sales to costs of franchise and license revenue to match the related occupancy revenue. As leases or subleases with franchisees expire, franchise occupancy revenue and costs could decrease if franchisees enter into direct leases with landlords. At the end of 2016, we had 294 franchise restaurants that are leased or subleased from Denny's.   Our fiscal year ends on the last Wednesday in December. As a result, a fifty-third week is added to a fiscal year every five or six years. We had a 52 week year in 2016 and 2015 and a 53 week year in 2014, which impacts the comparison of our financial information. We estimate that the additional 2014 operating week added approximately $8.3 million of company restaurant sales and $2.4 million of franchise and license revenue and resulted in approximately $0.6 million of additional general and administrative expenses, $3.6 million of additional operating income and $2.2 million of additional net income.

Company restaurant sales for 2016 increased $14.2 million, or 4.0%, primarily resulting from the increase in same-store sales and a 4 equivalent unit increase in company restaurants. Company restaurant sales for 2015 increased $18.4 million, or 5.5%, primarily resulting from the increase in same-store sales and from the November 2014 reopening of our highest volume restaurant in Las Vegas, Nevada.  Total costs of company restaurant sales as a percentage of company restaurant sales were 82.2% in 2016, 83.4% in 2015 and 86.3% in 2014.  Product costs were 24.6% in 2016, 25.4% in 2015 and 25.9% in 2014. The decrease in 2016 was primarily due to lower commodity costs. The decrease in 2015 was primarily due to the favorable impact of product mix and the leveraging effect of higher sales, partially offset by the increased cost of eggs.  Payroll and benefits were 38.9% in 2016, 38.7% in 2015 and 39.8% in 2014. The increase in 2016 was primarily due to a 0.8 percentage point increase in labor costs, a 0.3 percentage point increase in group insurance and a 0.2 percentage point increase in workers' compensation costs, partially offset by a 1.1 percentage point decrease in incentive compensation costs. Contributing to the increase in labor costs was the impact of the California Paid Sick Leave law, which became effective in July 2015. The decrease in 2015 was primarily due to a 1.0 percentage point decrease in labor costs, a 0.7 percentage point decrease in workers' compensation costs and a 0.2 percentage point decrease in group insurance, partially offset by a 0.8 percentage point increase in incentive compensation costs.  Occupancy costs were 5.3% in 2016, 5.8% in 2015 and 6.2% in 2014. The 2016 decrease is primarily related to a 0.3 percentage point decrease in general liability costs and a 0.2 percentage point decrease in rent and property taxes due to an increase in capital leases during the year. The 2015 decrease is primarily related to a 0.4 percentage point decrease in general liability costs.  Other operating expenses were comprised of the following amounts and percentages of company restaurant sales:   Fiscal Year Ended December 28, 2016 December 30, 2015 December 31, 2014 (Dollars in thousands) Utilities $ 12,426 3.4 % $ 12,866 3.6 % $ 13,915 4.2 % Repairs and maintenance 6,406 1.7 % 6,017 1.7 % 5,971 1.8 % Marketing 13,112 3.6 % 12,527 3.5 % 12,329 3.7 % Other direct costs 17,285 4.7 % 16,218 4.6 % 15,643 4.7 % Other operating expenses $ 49,229 13.4 % $ 47,628 13.5 % $ 47,858 14.3 %  Franchise Operations Franchise and license revenue and costs of franchise and license revenue were comprised of the following amounts and percentages of franchise and license revenue for the periods indicated: Fiscal Year Ended December 28, 2016 December 30, 2015 December 31, 2014 (Dollars in thousands) Royalties $ 98,416 70.5 % $ 94,755 68.6 % $ 90,835 66.0 % Initial fees 2,717 1.9 % 2,478 1.8 % 1,893 1.4 % Occupancy revenue 38,505 27.6 % 40,987 29.7 % 44,883 32.6 % Franchise and license revenue $ 139,638 100.0 % $ 138,220 100.0 % $ 137,611 100.0 % Occupancy costs $ 28,062 20.1 % $ 30,416 22.0 % $ 33,134 24.1 % Other direct costs 12,743 9.1 % 12,929 9.4 % 11,627 8.4 % Costs of franchise and license revenue $ 40,805 29.2 % $ 43,345 31.4 % $ 44,761 32.5 %  Royalties increased by $3.7 million, or 3.9%, in 2016 primarily resulting from a 18 equivalent unit increase in franchised and licensed restaurants, a 0.8% increase in domestic same-store sales and a higher average royalty rate as compared to 2015. Royalties increased by $3.9 million, or 4.3%, in 2015 primarily resulting from a 5.7% increase in domestic same-store sales and a higher average royalty rate as compared to 2014. The higher average royalty rates for both periods resulted as certain restaurants transitioned to a higher rate structure.  Initial fees increased by $0.2 million, or 9.6%, in 2016 as a higher number of restaurants were opened by franchisees and sold to franchisees during the current year period. Initial fees increased by $0.6 million, or 30.9%, in 2015 as a higher number of restaurants were opened by franchisees and a higher number of successor franchise agreements were signed compared to the prior year period. Occupancy revenue decreased by $2.5 million, or 6.1%, in 2016 and by $3.9 million, or 8.7%, in 2015 primarily resulting from lease expirations.  Occupancy costs decreased by $2.4 million, or 7.7%, in 2016 and by $2.7 million, or 8.2%, in 2015 primarily resulting from lease expirations. Other direct costs were essentially flat in 2016 and increased by $1.3 million, or 11.2%, in 2015 due to increased franchise administrative costs. As a result, costs of franchise and license revenue decreased by $2.5 million, or 5.9%, in 2016 and by $1.4 million, or 3.2%, in 2015.  Other Operating Costs and Expenses  Other operating costs and expenses such as general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization expense relate to both company and franchise operations.  General and administrative expenses are comprised of the following:   Fiscal Year Ended December 28, 2016 December 30, 2015 December 31, 2014 (In thousands) Share-based compensation $ 7,610 $ 6,635 $ 5,846 Other general and administrative expenses 60,350 59,967 53,061 Total general and administrative expenses $ 67,960 $ 66,602 $ 58,907  General and administrative expenses increased by $1.4 million in 2016. The increase in share-based compensation is primarily the result of forfeitures during 2015. The increase in other general and administrative expenses is comprised of $2.3 million in investments in personnel and technology and $0.8 million related to market valuation changes in our deferred compensation plan liabilities, partially offset by a $2.7 million decrease in incentive compensation. General and administrative expenses increased by $7.7 million in 2015 primarily resulting from increases of $3.2 million in incentive compensation, $1.9 million in payroll and benefits and $0.8 million in share-based compensation.  Depreciation and amortization is comprised of the following:   Fiscal Year Ended December 28, 2016 December 30, 2015 December 31, 2014 (In thousands) Depreciation of property and equipment $ 17,012 $ 16,548 $ 15,627 Amortization of capital lease assets 3,630 3,449 3,536 Amortization of intangible and other assets 1,536 1,475 2,055 Total depreciation and amortization expense $ 22,178 $ 21,472 $ 21,218  The increase in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily the result of our investments in company unit remodels during the past two years.

Denny's (also known as Denny's Diner on some of the locations' signage) is a full-service pancake house/coffee shop/fast casual family restaurant chain. It operates over 1,600 restaurants in the United States (including Puerto Rico and Guam), Canada, Mexico, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Curaçao, Costa Rica, Venezuela, Honduras, Japan (transliterated as デニーズ Denīzu), New Zealand, Qatar, Philippines, and United Arab Emirates.
Denny's is known for always being open, serving breakfast, lunch, and dinner around the clock. Unlike many other restaurant chains, Denny's does not close on holidays and nights, except where required by law. Many of the restaurants are located in proximity to freeway exits, bars, and in service areas. Denny's started franchising in 1963, and most Denny's restaurants are now franchisee-owned.[2]

History[edit]




Very first Denny's location in Lakewood California, 1953.


Denny's was founded by Harold Butler and Richard Jezak, who opened Danny's Donuts in Lakewood, California in 1953.[2] In 1956, a year after Jezak's departure from the then-6-store chain, Butler changed the concept, shifting it from a donut shop to a coffee shop with store #8. Danny's Donuts was renamed Danny's Coffee Shops and changed its operation to 24 hours. In 1959, to avoid confusion with Los Angeles restaurant chain Coffee Dan's, Butler changed the name from Danny's Coffee Shops to Denny's Coffee Shops. Two years later, in 1961, Denny's Coffee Shops was renamed Denny's.[2] The business continued to expand, and by 1981, there were over 1,000 restaurants in all 50 U.S. states. The company absorbed many of the old Sambo's restaurants and used their mid-century design in some of their restaurants. In 1977, Denny's introduced the still-popular Grand Slam breakfast. In 1994, Denny's became the largest corporate sponsor of Save the Children, a national charity. All but six Denny's closed for the first time ever on Christmas 1988; many of the restaurants were built without locks, and some had reportedly lost their keys.[3]
Denny's main offices were located in La Mirada, California, until 1989. At that time, the office was first moved to Irvine, California and subsequently moved to the Spartanburg, South Carolina, headquarters of the parent company Trans World Corporation (TW Corporation) that acquired Denny's in 1987. In 1992, private equity firm, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts acquired a 47% interest in TW Corporation, later known as The Flagstar Companies, and encouraged the company to sell non-core businesses.[4] Eventually, Denny's operations dominated the parent company to such an extent that The Flagstar Companies changed its name again to Denny's Corporation. It now trades on the NASDAQ under the symbol DENN.
From 1990 through 1993, Denny's offered a free meal to anyone on his/her birthday. The offer included a limited number of meal options from a special birthday menu. The promotion began in the 1990s; though occasionally individual franchises had offered it before that time. Because too many people went to Denny's more than once on their birthdays, the management had to restrict the rules to only one meal per person, per birthday, with proof of legal birth date required though a driver's license, photo ID, or a birth certificate. Since 2009, the restaurant chain has offered a free Birthday Build-Your-Own Slam on the customer's birthday.
In 1994, Denny's began renovating its stores, with a lighter color scheme; select locations also began serving Baskin-Robbins ice cream for a short time. Houston, Texas, was the test market for the chain-wide renovation.[5]

Some Denny's restaurants employ the "diner" concept, using modular buildings that resemble classic 1950s diners. In May 1997, the first Denny's Classic Diner was opened in Fort Myers, Florida. The diner concept was created by Ron, Marcia, Marc, and Todd York, the principals of Denny's Franchisee SWFRI, Inc. Today,[when?] there are about 40 Denny's Diners in the United States. Additionally, there are several diners that resemble the modular buildings but are actually stick construction.[citation needed]
Domestic and international growth[edit]
In July 2010, Denny's presence in the United States saw a major expansion when Pilot Flying J started opening Denny's locations inside their Flying J-branded truck stop locations.[6] 123 Pilot Flying J conversions were eventually completed.[7]
As of the end of 2011, there were a total of 1,685 Denny's restaurants. While the company owns and operates some restaurants, the majority are operated through a franchising model. 1,593 of Denny's 1,685 restaurants are located in the 50 U.S. states (including the District of Columbia), 11 in Puerto Rico, two in Guam, one in Chile, 60 in Canada, five in Mexico, three in Costa Rica, two in Honduras, one in El Salvador, and eight in New Zealand. There is also a Denny's attached to the Holiday Beach Hotel in Otrabanda, Willemstad, Curaçao.[8] Along with the regular Denny's menu, the Curaçao restaurant offers a selection of local ("kriyoyo") dishes. This is also true of the two locations in Guam, which have a separate "Only on Guam"[9] menu featuring Chamorro-style dishes. There are also about 578 Denny's restaurants in Japan operated independently under a license by a subsidiary of Seven & I Holdings[10] since 1984.[11] At least five restaurants are planned to be opened in Polandstarting in 2016.[citation needed]
In June 2012, Denny's opened a location in the Las Américas International Airport, its first location in an airport and its first in the Dominican Republic.[12][13] In July 2012, Denny's announced it had signed an agreement with a franchisee to open 50 restaurants in southern China over 15 years, beginning in 2013. This makes it Denny's largest international development deal at that time.[14][15]
On August 29, 2014, Denny's opened its first location in New York City, with some patrons waiting as long as two hours before its official opening to eat there. Located in Lower Manhattan, the location is designed to be more upscale than the typical Denny's, serves alcohol, and offers a location-exclusive $300 Grand Cru Slam, which is the typical Grand Slam Breakfast served with a bottle of Dom Pérignon.[16][17]
Health inspection records[edit]
In October 2004, Dateline NBC aired a segment titled "Dirty Dining", in which the 10 most popular family and casual dining chains in the United States were examined: Applebee's, Bob Evans, Chili's, Denny's, IHOP, Outback Steakhouse, Red Lobster, Ruby Tuesday, TGI Friday's, and Waffle House. As part of the segment, the producers examined the health inspection records for 100 restaurants over 15 months and totaled all of the critical violations, or violations that can result in adverse effects to the customers' health. Denny's had the fewest violations, averaging fewer than one violation per restaurant. Denny's attributes this relative success to its adherence to the principles of Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points.[18]
Animal welfare efforts[edit]
Denny's works with the Humane Society of the United States to address animal welfare issues. In 2008, Denny's began switching to cage-free eggs, and in 2012, the company announced that it will work with its suppliers to move away from the practice of keeping pigs in gestation crates.[19]
Controversies[edit]
Discrimination[edit]
Since the 1990s, Denny's has been involved in a series of discrimination lawsuits involving several cases of servers denying or providing inferior service to racial minorities, especially black customers.[20]
In 1994, Denny's settled a class action lawsuit filed by thousands of black customers who had been refused service, forced to wait longer, or pay more than white customers. The $54.4 million settlement was the largest to date under federal public-accommodations laws established thirty years earlier.[21]
In 1995, a black Denny's customer in Sacramento, California was told that he and his friends had to pay up front at the counter upon ordering their meals. He questioned the waitress: "We asked the waitress about it and she said some black guys had been in earlier who made a scene and walked out without paying their bill. So the manager now wanted all blacks to pay up front."[22]
A 1993 incident occurred when six black United States Secret Service agents visited a Denny’s restaurant in Annapolis, Maryland. They were forced to wait an hour for service while their white companions were seated immediately.[23][24]
In San Jose, California, in 1994, several black teenagers were refused service unless they agreed to pay in advance.[25][26]
In 1997, six Asian-American students from Syracuse University visited a local Denny’s restaurant late at night. They waited for more than half an hour as white patrons were regularly served, seated, and offered more helpings. They complained to management and to their server but were forced to leave the establishment by two security guards called by Denny’s management. Then, according to the students, a group of white men came out of Denny's, attacked them[27] and shouted racial epithets. Several of the students were beaten into unconsciousness.[28][29]
After the $54.4 million settlement, Denny's created a racial sensitivity training program for all employees. Denny's has also made efforts at improving its public relations image by featuring African-Americans in their commercials, including one featuring Sherman Hemsley and Isabel Sanford, actors from the popular The Jeffersons television series.[30][31] In 2001, Denny's was chosen by Fortune magazine as the "Best Company for Minorities."[32] In 2006 and 2007, Denny's topped Black Enterprise's "Best 40 Companies for Diversity."[33]
In 2014, a Denny's location in Deming, New Mexico became subjected to a discrimination claim by an LGBT group, alleging that wait staff used homophobic slurs and refused to serve a group of gay, lesbian, and transgender customers who were attending a gay pride celebration. One year later, Denny's agreed to donate $13,000 to Deming Pride, pay $3,250 to a female customer who was subjected to the abusive behavior by wait staff, as well as retrain employees regarding discrimination policies.[34]
Sudden closures[edit]
In June 2017, a total of eight Denny's locations in Colorado, including Colorado Springs and Pueblo, abruptly shut down due to a franchise owner failing to pay nearly $200,000 in back taxes as well as over $30,000 in sales tax from the previous year. In addition, several employees claimed there were issues with accounts not being paid, bounced checks and paychecks not arriving on time. As a result of the seizure of the eight Denny's locations by the IRS, numerous employees were left without employment, and claimed that no advanced warning was given regarding the sudden closures. The franchise owner immediately left the state of Colorado following the closures.[35][36]

Denny's (also known as Denny's Diner on some of the locations' signage) is a full-service pancake house/coffee shop/fast casual family restaurant chain. It operates over 1,600 restaurants in the United States (including Puerto Rico and Guam), Canada, Mexico, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Curaçao, Costa Rica, Venezuela, Honduras, Japan (transliterated as デニーズ Denīzu), New Zealand, Qatar, Philippines, and United Arab Emirates.
Denny's is known for always being open, serving breakfast, lunch, and dinner around the clock. Unlike many other restaurant chains, Denny's does not close on holidays and nights, except where required by law. Many of the restaurants are located in proximity to freeway exits, bars, and in service areas. Denny's started franchising in 1963, and most Denny's restaurants are now franchisee-owned.[2]

History[edit]




Very first Denny's location in Lakewood California, 1953.


Denny's was founded by Harold Butler and Richard Jezak, who opened Danny's Donuts in Lakewood, California in 1953.[2] In 1956, a year after Jezak's departure from the then-6-store chain, Butler changed the concept, shifting it from a donut shop to a coffee shop with store #8. Danny's Donuts was renamed Danny's Coffee Shops and changed its operation to 24 hours. In 1959, to avoid confusion with Los Angeles restaurant chain Coffee Dan's, Butler changed the name from Danny's Coffee Shops to Denny's Coffee Shops. Two years later, in 1961, Denny's Coffee Shops was renamed Denny's.[2] The business continued to expand, and by 1981, there were over 1,000 restaurants in all 50 U.S. states. The company absorbed many of the old Sambo's restaurants and used their mid-century design in some of their restaurants. In 1977, Denny's introduced the still-popular Grand Slam breakfast. In 1994, Denny's became the largest corporate sponsor of Save the Children, a national charity. All but six Denny's closed for the first time ever on Christmas 1988; many of the restaurants were built without locks, and some had reportedly lost their keys.[3]
Denny's main offices were located in La Mirada, California, until 1989. At that time, the office was first moved to Irvine, California and subsequently moved to the Spartanburg, South Carolina, headquarters of the parent company Trans World Corporation (TW Corporation) that acquired Denny's in 1987. In 1992, private equity firm, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts acquired a 47% interest in TW Corporation, later known as The Flagstar Companies, and encouraged the company to sell non-core businesses.[4] Eventually, Denny's operations dominated the parent company to such an extent that The Flagstar Companies changed its name again to Denny's Corporation. It now trades on the NASDAQ under the symbol DENN.
From 1990 through 1993, Denny's offered a free meal to anyone on his/her birthday. The offer included a limited number of meal options from a special birthday menu. The promotion began in the 1990s; though occasionally individual franchises had offered it before that time. Because too many people went to Denny's more than once on their birthdays, the management had to restrict the rules to only one meal per person, per birthday, with proof of legal birth date required though a driver's license, photo ID, or a birth certificate. Since 2009, the restaurant chain has offered a free Birthday Build-Your-Own Slam on the customer's birthday.
In 1994, Denny's began renovating its stores, with a lighter color scheme; select locations also began serving Baskin-Robbins ice cream for a short time. Houston, Texas, was the test market for the chain-wide renovation.[5]

Some Denny's restaurants employ the "diner" concept, using modular buildings that resemble classic 1950s diners. In May 1997, the first Denny's Classic Diner was opened in Fort Myers, Florida. The diner concept was created by Ron, Marcia, Marc, and Todd York, the principals of Denny's Franchisee SWFRI, Inc. Today,[when?] there are about 40 Denny's Diners in the United States. Additionally, there are several diners that resemble the modular buildings but are actually stick construction.[citation needed]
Domestic and international growth[edit]
In July 2010, Denny's presence in the United States saw a major expansion when Pilot Flying J started opening Denny's locations inside their Flying J-branded truck stop locations.[6] 123 Pilot Flying J conversions were eventually completed.[7]
As of the end of 2011, there were a total of 1,685 Denny's restaurants. While the company owns and operates some restaurants, the majority are operated through a franchising model. 1,593 of Denny's 1,685 restaurants are located in the 50 U.S. states (including the District of Columbia), 11 in Puerto Rico, two in Guam, one in Chile, 60 in Canada, five in Mexico, three in Costa Rica, two in Honduras, one in El Salvador, and eight in New Zealand. There is also a Denny's attached to the Holiday Beach Hotel in Otrabanda, Willemstad, Curaçao.[8] Along with the regular Denny's menu, the Curaçao restaurant offers a selection of local ("kriyoyo") dishes. This is also true of the two locations in Guam, which have a separate "Only on Guam"[9] menu featuring Chamorro-style dishes. There are also about 578 Denny's restaurants in Japan operated independently under a license by a subsidiary of Seven & I Holdings[10] since 1984.[11] At least five restaurants are planned to be opened in Polandstarting in 2016.[citation needed]
In June 2012, Denny's opened a location in the Las Américas International Airport, its first location in an airport and its first in the Dominican Republic.[12][13] In July 2012, Denny's announced it had signed an agreement with a franchisee to open 50 restaurants in southern China over 15 years, beginning in 2013. This makes it Denny's largest international development deal at that time.[14][15]
On August 29, 2014, Denny's opened its first location in New York City, with some patrons waiting as long as two hours before its official opening to eat there. Located in Lower Manhattan, the location is designed to be more upscale than the typical Denny's, serves alcohol, and offers a location-exclusive $300 Grand Cru Slam, which is the typical Grand Slam Breakfast served with a bottle of Dom Pérignon.[16][17]
Health inspection records[edit]
In October 2004, Dateline NBC aired a segment titled "Dirty Dining", in which the 10 most popular family and casual dining chains in the United States were examined: Applebee's, Bob Evans, Chili's, Denny's, IHOP, Outback Steakhouse, Red Lobster, Ruby Tuesday, TGI Friday's, and Waffle House. As part of the segment, the producers examined the health inspection records for 100 restaurants over 15 months and totaled all of the critical violations, or violations that can result in adverse effects to the customers' health. Denny's had the fewest violations, averaging fewer than one violation per restaurant. Denny's attributes this relative success to its adherence to the principles of Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points.[18]
Animal welfare efforts[edit]
Denny's works with the Humane Society of the United States to address animal welfare issues. In 2008, Denny's began switching to cage-free eggs, and in 2012, the company announced that it will work with its suppliers to move away from the practice of keeping pigs in gestation crates.[19]
Controversies[edit]
Discrimination[edit]
Since the 1990s, Denny's has been involved in a series of discrimination lawsuits involving several cases of servers denying or providing inferior service to racial minorities, especially black customers.[20]
In 1994, Denny's settled a class action lawsuit filed by thousands of black customers who had been refused service, forced to wait longer, or pay more than white customers. The $54.4 million settlement was the largest to date under federal public-accommodations laws established thirty years earlier.[21]
In 1995, a black Denny's customer in Sacramento, California was told that he and his friends had to pay up front at the counter upon ordering their meals. He questioned the waitress: "We asked the waitress about it and she said some black guys had been in earlier who made a scene and walked out without paying their bill. So the manager now wanted all blacks to pay up front."[22]
A 1993 incident occurred when six black United States Secret Service agents visited a Denny’s restaurant in Annapolis, Maryland. They were forced to wait an hour for service while their white companions were seated immediately.[23][24]
In San Jose, California, in 1994, several black teenagers were refused service unless they agreed to pay in advance.[25][26]
In 1997, six Asian-American students from Syracuse University visited a local Denny’s restaurant late at night. They waited for more than half an hour as white patrons were regularly served, seated, and offered more helpings. They complained to management and to their server but were forced to leave the establishment by two security guards called by Denny’s management. Then, according to the students, a group of white men came out of Denny's, attacked them[27] and shouted racial epithets. Several of the students were beaten into unconsciousness.[28][29]
After the $54.4 million settlement, Denny's created a racial sensitivity training program for all employees. Denny's has also made efforts at improving its public relations image by featuring African-Americans in their commercials, including one featuring Sherman Hemsley and Isabel Sanford, actors from the popular The Jeffersons television series.[30][31] In 2001, Denny's was chosen by Fortune magazine as the "Best Company for Minorities."[32] In 2006 and 2007, Denny's topped Black Enterprise's "Best 40 Companies for Diversity."[33]
In 2014, a Denny's location in Deming, New Mexico became subjected to a discrimination claim by an LGBT group, alleging that wait staff used homophobic slurs and refused to serve a group of gay, lesbian, and transgender customers who were attending a gay pride celebration. One year later, Denny's agreed to donate $13,000 to Deming Pride, pay $3,250 to a female customer who was subjected to the abusive behavior by wait staff, as well as retrain employees regarding discrimination policies.[34]
Sudden closures[edit]
In June 2017, a total of eight Denny's locations in Colorado, including Colorado Springs and Pueblo, abruptly shut down due to a franchise owner failing to pay nearly $200,000 in back taxes as well as over $30,000 in sales tax from the previous year. In addition, several employees claimed there were issues with accounts not being paid, bounced checks and paychecks not arriving on time. As a result of the seizure of the eight Denny's locations by the IRS, numerous employees were left without employment, and claimed that no advanced warning was given regarding the sudden closures. The franchise owner immediately left the state of Colorado following the closures.[35][36]

Denny's (also known as Denny's Diner on some of the locations' signage) is a full-service pancake house/coffee shop/fast casual family restaurant chain. It operates over 1,600 restaurants in the United States (including Puerto Rico and Guam), Canada, Mexico, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Curaçao, Costa Rica, Venezuela, Honduras, Japan (transliterated as デニーズ Denīzu), New Zealand, Qatar, Philippines, and United Arab Emirates.
Denny's is known for always being open, serving breakfast, lunch, and dinner around the clock. Unlike many other restaurant chains, Denny's does not close on holidays and nights, except where required by law. Many of the restaurants are located in proximity to freeway exits, bars, and in service areas. Denny's started franchising in 1963, and most Denny's restaurants are now franchisee-owned.[2]

History[edit]




Very first Denny's location in Lakewood California, 1953.


Denny's was founded by Harold Butler and Richard Jezak, who opened Danny's Donuts in Lakewood, California in 1953.[2] In 1956, a year after Jezak's departure from the then-6-store chain, Butler changed the concept, shifting it from a donut shop to a coffee shop with store #8. Danny's Donuts was renamed Danny's Coffee Shops and changed its operation to 24 hours. In 1959, to avoid confusion with Los Angeles restaurant chain Coffee Dan's, Butler changed the name from Danny's Coffee Shops to Denny's Coffee Shops. Two years later, in 1961, Denny's Coffee Shops was renamed Denny's.[2] The business continued to expand, and by 1981, there were over 1,000 restaurants in all 50 U.S. states. The company absorbed many of the old Sambo's restaurants and used their mid-century design in some of their restaurants. In 1977, Denny's introduced the still-popular Grand Slam breakfast. In 1994, Denny's became the largest corporate sponsor of Save the Children, a national charity. All but six Denny's closed for the first time ever on Christmas 1988; many of the restaurants were built without locks, and some had reportedly lost their keys.[3]
Denny's main offices were located in La Mirada, California, until 1989. At that time, the office was first moved to Irvine, California and subsequently moved to the Spartanburg, South Carolina, headquarters of the parent company Trans World Corporation (TW Corporation) that acquired Denny's in 1987. In 1992, private equity firm, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts acquired a 47% interest in TW Corporation, later known as The Flagstar Companies, and encouraged the company to sell non-core businesses.[4] Eventually, Denny's operations dominated the parent company to such an extent that The Flagstar Companies changed its name again to Denny's Corporation. It now trades on the NASDAQ under the symbol DENN.
From 1990 through 1993, Denny's offered a free meal to anyone on his/her birthday. The offer included a limited number of meal options from a special birthday menu. The promotion began in the 1990s; though occasionally individual franchises had offered it before that time. Because too many people went to Denny's more than once on their birthdays, the management had to restrict the rules to only one meal per person, per birthday, with proof of legal birth date required though a driver's license, photo ID, or a birth certificate. Since 2009, the restaurant chain has offered a free Birthday Build-Your-Own Slam on the customer's birthday.
In 1994, Denny's began renovating its stores, with a lighter color scheme; select locations also began serving Baskin-Robbins ice cream for a short time. Houston, Texas, was the test market for the chain-wide renovation.[5]

Some Denny's restaurants employ the "diner" concept, using modular buildings that resemble classic 1950s diners. In May 1997, the first Denny's Classic Diner was opened in Fort Myers, Florida. The diner concept was created by Ron, Marcia, Marc, and Todd York, the principals of Denny's Franchisee SWFRI, Inc. Today,[when?] there are about 40 Denny's Diners in the United States. Additionally, there are several diners that resemble the modular buildings but are actually stick construction.[citation needed]
Domestic and international growth[edit]
In July 2010, Denny's presence in the United States saw a major expansion when Pilot Flying J started opening Denny's locations inside their Flying J-branded truck stop locations.[6] 123 Pilot Flying J conversions were eventually completed.[7]
As of the end of 2011, there were a total of 1,685 Denny's restaurants. While the company owns and operates some restaurants, the majority are operated through a franchising model. 1,593 of Denny's 1,685 restaurants are located in the 50 U.S. states (including the District of Columbia), 11 in Puerto Rico, two in Guam, one in Chile, 60 in Canada, five in Mexico, three in Costa Rica, two in Honduras, one in El Salvador, and eight in New Zealand. There is also a Denny's attached to the Holiday Beach Hotel in Otrabanda, Willemstad, Curaçao.[8] Along with the regular Denny's menu, the Curaçao restaurant offers a selection of local ("kriyoyo") dishes. This is also true of the two locations in Guam, which have a separate "Only on Guam"[9] menu featuring Chamorro-style dishes. There are also about 578 Denny's restaurants in Japan operated independently under a license by a subsidiary of Seven & I Holdings[10] since 1984.[11] At least five restaurants are planned to be opened in Polandstarting in 2016.[citation needed]
In June 2012, Denny's opened a location in the Las Américas International Airport, its first location in an airport and its first in the Dominican Republic.[12][13] In July 2012, Denny's announced it had signed an agreement with a franchisee to open 50 restaurants in southern China over 15 years, beginning in 2013. This makes it Denny's largest international development deal at that time.[14][15]
On August 29, 2014, Denny's opened its first location in New York City, with some patrons waiting as long as two hours before its official opening to eat there. Located in Lower Manhattan, the location is designed to be more upscale than the typical Denny's, serves alcohol, and offers a location-exclusive $300 Grand Cru Slam, which is the typical Grand Slam Breakfast served with a bottle of Dom Pérignon.[16][17]
Health inspection records[edit]
In October 2004, Dateline NBC aired a segment titled "Dirty Dining", in which the 10 most popular family and casual dining chains in the United States were examined: Applebee's, Bob Evans, Chili's, Denny's, IHOP, Outback Steakhouse, Red Lobster, Ruby Tuesday, TGI Friday's, and Waffle House. As part of the segment, the producers examined the health inspection records for 100 restaurants over 15 months and totaled all of the critical violations, or violations that can result in adverse effects to the customers' health. Denny's had the fewest violations, averaging fewer than one violation per restaurant. Denny's attributes this relative success to its adherence to the principles of Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points.[18]
Animal welfare efforts[edit]
Denny's works with the Humane Society of the United States to address animal welfare issues. In 2008, Denny's began switching to cage-free eggs, and in 2012, the company announced that it will work with its suppliers to move away from the practice of keeping pigs in gestation crates.[19]
Controversies[edit]
Discrimination[edit]
Since the 1990s, Denny's has been involved in a series of discrimination lawsuits involving several cases of servers denying or providing inferior service to racial minorities, especially black customers.[20]
In 1994, Denny's settled a class action lawsuit filed by thousands of black customers who had been refused service, forced to wait longer, or pay more than white customers. The $54.4 million settlement was the largest to date under federal public-accommodations laws established thirty years earlier.[21]
In 1995, a black Denny's customer in Sacramento, California was told that he and his friends had to pay up front at the counter upon ordering their meals. He questioned the waitress: "We asked the waitress about it and she said some black guys had been in earlier who made a scene and walked out without paying their bill. So the manager now wanted all blacks to pay up front."[22]
A 1993 incident occurred when six black United States Secret Service agents visited a Denny’s restaurant in Annapolis, Maryland. They were forced to wait an hour for service while their white companions were seated immediately.[23][24]
In San Jose, California, in 1994, several black teenagers were refused service unless they agreed to pay in advance.[25][26]
In 1997, six Asian-American students from Syracuse University visited a local Denny’s restaurant late at night. They waited for more than half an hour as white patrons were regularly served, seated, and offered more helpings. They complained to management and to their server but were forced to leave the establishment by two security guards called by Denny’s management. Then, according to the students, a group of white men came out of Denny's, attacked them[27] and shouted racial epithets. Several of the students were beaten into unconsciousness.[28][29]
After the $54.4 million settlement, Denny's created a racial sensitivity training program for all employees. Denny's has also made efforts at improving its public relations image by featuring African-Americans in their commercials, including one featuring Sherman Hemsley and Isabel Sanford, actors from the popular The Jeffersons television series.[30][31] In 2001, Denny's was chosen by Fortune magazine as the "Best Company for Minorities."[32] In 2006 and 2007, Denny's topped Black Enterprise's "Best 40 Companies for Diversity."[33]
In 2014, a Denny's location in Deming, New Mexico became subjected to a discrimination claim by an LGBT group, alleging that wait staff used homophobic slurs and refused to serve a group of gay, lesbian, and transgender customers who were attending a gay pride celebration. One year later, Denny's agreed to donate $13,000 to Deming Pride, pay $3,250 to a female customer who was subjected to the abusive behavior by wait staff, as well as retrain employees regarding discrimination policies.[34]
Sudden closures[edit]
In June 2017, a total of eight Denny's locations in Colorado, including Colorado Springs and Pueblo, abruptly shut down due to a franchise owner failing to pay nearly $200,000 in back taxes as well as over $30,000 in sales tax from the previous year. In addition, several employees claimed there were issues with accounts not being paid, bounced checks and paychecks not arriving on time. As a result of the seizure of the eight Denny's locations by the IRS, numerous employees were left without employment, and claimed that no advanced warning was given regarding the sudden closures. The franchise owner immediately left the state of Colorado following the closures.[35][36]

No Kid Hungry








Ending Childhood Hunger Across America
The team members at Denny's love to feed people, so it is hard for them to imagine kids not getting enough food each day. So, Denny's partnered with Share Our Strength’s No Kid Hungry program to make ending childhood hunger one of their main philanthropic causes. Every September, Denny’s locations across America participate in Share Our Strength’s Dine Out For No Kid Hungry™, a national fundraising event that brings together thousands of restaurants and millions of consumers to help make sure that no child in America grows up hungry.

Our History
Harold Butler and Richard Jezak opened a donut stand in 1953 and called it Danny’s Donuts. Butler’s stated promise was “To serve the best cup of coffee, make the best donuts, give the best service, offer the best value and stay open 24 hours a day.” Today that donut stand is a restaurant chain with a slightly different name, over 1,700 locations and a proven reputation for keeping Mr. Butler’s original promise.
