  Aug 20, 2008 10:13 AM ET Howell Jr. Named Gray Chief Hilton H. Howell Jr. to replace J. Mack Robinson atop Gray Television.By Michael Malone   bcmikemalone Hilton H. Howell Jr. will replace J. Mack Robinson atop Gray Television as Robinson steps down as chairman and CEO. The Gray board unanimously appointed Howell, Robinson’s son-in-law, as CEO, and he will remain vice chairman of the board.Robinson, 85, continues as a board member and the company’s chairman emeritus. Robert Prather Jr. remains Gray’s president and chief operating officer."My decision to step down should not come as a surprise to anyone, given that I'm now 85 years old," Robinson said. "I have been so proud to be associated with Gray since 1993. In the past 15 years, the company has grown from its small-town roots in Albany, Ga., into one of the finest television-broadcast companies in the country, now serving 30 markets with 36 primary television stations and 40 digital second channels across the United States."Howell added: "I am looking forward to expanding my role with Gray and to working together with Bob Prather and all of the associates of the company to continue to improve the fine news operations and local commitment of all our television properties. My family has been investors in and board members of Gray or its predecessors since the founding of KWTX-TV in Waco, Texas, in 1951 and I look forward to continuing and building on that commitment.” Tags:You May Also Like: Next Article:  Tina Fey, Amy Poehler to Return as Golden Globes HostsView the discussion thread.
