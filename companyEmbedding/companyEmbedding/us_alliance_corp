IN THE HEARTLAND, WE KNOW THE VALUE OF BEING PREPARED.
Safeguarding our family’s future should be as uncomplicated as our midwestern way of life.
Here in the Midwest, we recognize that life can change like the weather. Being prepared for the unexpected is second nature to us, and when we’re faced with uncertainty we find peace of mind in having friends and neighbors in our communities that we can count on for support. At USAlliance – Life and Security, we’re Kansans too, and we are the neighbors that you trust for support and stability when facing the unexpected – an uncertain financial future.

Millwork









A Door System Is Only As Good As The Sum Of Its Components
That is why we use quality millwork and hardware in the construction of our Alliance Door Systems. We have the ability to custom machine the frame components, headers, jamb legs, astragals, mulls, doors, sidelites and transoms to your specifications, making installation at the job site quick and worry-free. Each door system arrives at your building site packaged to help protect the door from dings and dents during the construction process.
We also know that architectural design, placement, environment and exposure each present a different set of challenges. Our frame materials are designed to address each of these challenges and are the perfect complement to your door choice.
 



Frames
 
 
 







 
 
 






Solid Wood Door Frames
We offer a solid Douglas Fir and Hemlock door system for staining or a primed frame for painting.
The engineered jamb legs (solid wood edge-glued over finger-jointed solid wood) are dimensionally more stable than a one-piece jamb leg and resist twisting or bowing.
 
 
 




Wood Plastic Composite Exterior Door Frames And Mouldings
This solid, low-maintenance option is durable and resistant to moisture, rot and insects. Test results show very little warping, expansion and splitting when installed properly. Made from wood fiber, wood plastic composites behave like real wood when manipulated. These woodgrain textured frame components can be machined, stained or painted. This 100% recyclable product is a cost effective, low-maintenance alternative to solid wood exterior door frames.
 
 
 




SuperFrame
SuperFrames are an innovative product that takes advantage of the durability of Bamboo. The finger-jointed Chinese Cedar jamb legs are joined with 8 inches of Bamboo at the base and are nearly impervious to water infiltration, bug infestation and common rot. This frame system is primed and sealed on all sides so it is easy to paint without additional sanding or priming. SuperFrame offers superior performance at a great value.
