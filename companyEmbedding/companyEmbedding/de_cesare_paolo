P&G JAPAN: THE SK-II GLOBALIZATION PROJECT

1

|

P a g e

 

Executive Summary

This case examines P&G and whether or not they have the ability and means to make their SK-IIproduct a global brand. In this case, we examine P&G's need for a new global strategy and their abilityto develop SK-II into a worldwide beauty product. Ultimately we will see that P&G needs to expandtheir hold in the Japanese market while becoming more familiar with the needs of potential markets.

Analysis

In recent years Paolo de Cesare was very successful at the head of the European and Japanese MaxFactor divisions, but the idea of taking the SK-II that was so successful in the Japanese market global isvery risky. Up until the 1980's, P&G Japan was only a minor contributor to the P&G internationalgrowth. In 1985, Durk Jager found that the key reasons for the failure lied in the fact that they had notrecognized the distinctive needs of the Japanese consumer. Over the next four years under hismanagement changes were made to research, advertising and distribution that provided a 270%increase in sales, and Jager assumed the position of group vice president for Asia. However, in the 1990sthe business could not keep up with the competitors in the Japanese market. Just as indicated in thearticle "Philips versus Matsushita," the organization began to be more focused on the structure of thecompany than the strategy of the company and where it was going. Jager then developed Organization2005, his strategy in the rapid development and roll out of new products globally, which also involvedseveral management changes. Just as indicated in the article "Philips versus Matsushita," theorganization began to be more focused on the structure of the company than the strategy of thecompany and where it was going.

1] As Paolo DeCesare, what factors do you need to consider before deciding what torecommend in your SK-II presentation to the global leadership team (GLT)? What kind ofanalysis will you need to do in preparing for that meeting?

As Paolo De Cesare, the factors need to consider before deciding what to recommend in the SK-IIpresentation to the global leadership team (GLT) are:(1)

This is P&G’s first

-ever proposal to expand a Japanese brand worldwide. Other countries have adifferent culture than that of consumers in Japan which is why this is a big risk.

(2) P&G’s global organization is in the midst of a 2005 restructuring program; it can be disruptive.(3) Cost in 1980’s of running all local product development labs and manufacturing plants was limiting

profits; ever since then

local general managers’ resisted emergence of new products because of the

negative impact on local profit.

(4) Lingle’s POV was P&G should meet the demands of every nation, but still have local self sufficient

subsidiaries; P&G built their company around his POV.

(5) Lafley’s POV was that most of the advertising budget should be spent on two products

- MaxFactorColor and SK-II; SK-II had such a high margin.(6) D

e Cesare’s

POV was there is a great opportunity for SK-II to break into the $9 billion worldwideprestige skin care market.

(7) Jager’s POV was that a major product development technology center was needed for demanding

 Japanese consumers; this would also support product development throughout Asia and other parts ofthe world.

(8) Ram’s POV was SK

-II should be introduced into Chinese department stores as Oil of Olay moves

into “second

-

tier stores”; also predicted China to be the 2nd largest market in the world for

prestigebeauty products.

As Paolo DeCesare, what factors do you need to consider bIBSM Case9Group No.4(1) How the organizational changes including culture, processes, and structure of O2005 affect SK-II’s financial and operational status?(2) Japan, China, and Europe, which areas are attractive?(3) After analysis which area is attractive, figure out what entry strategies is most appropriate.1. As Paolo DeCesare, what factors do you need to consider before deciding what to recommend in your SK-II presentation to the GLT? What kind of analysis will you need to do in prearing for that meeting?2. Does SK-II have the potential to become a global brand within Proctor &Gamble’s worldwide operations? Why or why not?1. We decided to enter the Chinese market.2. So it was unwise to entry the Europe market.3.We could make Japanese market as our regional development core, trying to increase the market share.3. Which of the three market options should Paolo De Cesare recommend to the GLT? What benefits do you expect to gain? What risks do you see?.We can produce new product, anti-aging and whitening ones, in order to catch new customersThen we would get into China markets. We had to teach customers and invest equipment, so it was few short-term benefits. We had to convince P&G’s CEO so that the cost of teaching could be shared with competitors.4. How should he implement your recommended option? What are the implications for P&G’s new post-O2005 organization? What support and/or resistance do you expect? How will you manage it?Thank you for your listening!Full transcriptMore presentations by

P&G JAPAN: THE SK-II GLOBALIZATION PROJECT 
1 
| 
P a g e 
Executive Summary 
This case examines P&G and whether or not they have the ability and means to make their SK-II 
product a global brand. In this case, we examine P&G's need for a new global strategy and their ability 
to develop SK-II into a worldwide beauty product. Ultimately we will see that P&G needs to expand 
their hold in the Japanese market while becoming more familiar with the needs of potential markets. 
Analysis 
In recent years Paolo de Cesare was very successful at the head of the European and Japanese Max 
Factor divisions, but the idea of taking the SK-II that was so successful in the Japanese market global is 
very risky. Up until the 1980's, P&G Japan was only a minor contributor to the P&G international 
growth. In 1985, Durk Jager found that the key reasons for the failure lied in the fact that they had not 
recognized the distinctive needs of the Japanese consumer. Over the next four years under his 
management changes were made to research, advertising and distribution that provided a 270% 
increase in sales, and Jager assumed the position of group vice president for Asia. However, in the 1990s 
the business could not keep up with the competitors in the Japanese market. Just as indicated in the 
article "Philips versus Matsushita," the organization began to be more focused on the structure of the
