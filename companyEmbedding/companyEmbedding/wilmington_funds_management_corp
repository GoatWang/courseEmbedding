Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.
Bank of America, N.A. and the U.S. Trust Company of Delaware (collectively the "Bank") do not serve in a fiduciary capacity with respect to all products or services.

Privacy Policy






PRIVACY POLICY AND NOTICE
      OF THE FUNDS AND THEIR DISTRIBUTOR
      June 8, 2012    
The Wilmington Funds, their distributor and their agents (referred to as "the Funds", "we" or "us") recognize that consumers (referred to as "you" or "your") expect us to protect both your assets and financial information.  We respect your right to privacy and your expectation that all personal information about you or your account will be maintained in a secure manner.  We are committed to maintaining the confidentiality, security and integrity of client and shareholder information.  We want you to understand the Funds’ policy that governs the handling of your information, how the Funds gather information, how that information is used and how it is kept secure.

Information The Funds Collect:
        The Funds collect nonpublic personal information about you from the following sources:  

We may receive information from you, or from your financial representative, on account applications, other forms or electronically (such as through the 	Funds’ website or other electronic trading mechanisms). Examples of this information include your name, address, social security number, assets and income.


We may receive information from you, or from your financial representative, through transactions with us or others, correspondence and other communications.  Examples of this information include specific investments and your account balances.


We may obtain other personal information from you in connection with providing you a financial product or service.  Examples of this information include depository, debit or credit account numbers.


Information Sharing Policy
      The Funds may share nonpublic personal information about you, as described above, with financial or non-financial companies or other entities, including companies that may be affiliated with the Funds and other nonaffiliated third parties, for the following purposes:

We may share information when it is necessary and required to process a transaction or to service a customer relationship.  For example, information may be shared with a company that provides account record keeping services or a company that provides proxy services to shareholders.


 We may share information when it is required or permitted by law.  For example, information may be shared in response to a subpoena or to protect you against fraud or with someone who has established a legal beneficial interest, such as a power of attorney.


We may disclose some or all of the information described above to companies that perform marketing or other services on our behalf.  For example, we may share information about you with the financial intermediary (bank, investment bank or broker-dealer) through whom you purchased the Funds’ products or services, or with providers of marketing, legal, accounting or other professional services.  The Funds will not, however, disclose a consumer's account number or similar form of access number or access code for credit card, deposit or transaction accounts to any nonaffiliated third party for use in telemarketing, direct mail or other marketing purposes.

Except as described above, the Funds do not share customer information.  We will not rent, sell, trade, or otherwise release or disclose any personal information about you.  Any information you provide to us is for the Funds’ use only.  If you decide to close your account(s) or become an inactive customer, we will adhere to the privacy policies and practices as described in this notice.
Information Security:

When the Funds share nonpublic customer information with third parties hired to facilitate the delivery of certain products or services to our customers, such information is made available for limited purposes and under controlled circumstances designed to protect our customers’ privacy.  We require third parties to comply with our standards regarding security and confidentiality of such information.  We do not permit them to use that information for their own or any other purposes, or rent, sell, trade or otherwise release or disclose the information to any other party.  These requirements are reflected in written agreements between the Funds and the third party service providers.
The Funds protect your personal information in several ways.  We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to guard your nonpublic personal information.  In addition, the Funds’ Transfer Agent and Shareholder Servicing Agent have procedures in place for the appropriate disposal of nonpublic personal information when they are no longer required to maintain the information.
Each of the following sections explains an aspect of the Funds’ commitment to protecting your personal information and respecting your privacy.
Employee Access to Information:

      Our Code of Ethics, which applies to all employees, restricts the use of customer information and requires that it be held in the strictest of confidence.   Employee access to customer information is authorized for business purposes only, and the degree of access is based on the sensitivity of the information and on an employee’s or agent's need to know the information in order to service a customer's account or comply with legal requirements.
Visiting The Funds' Website:
The Funds’ website gathers and maintains statistics about the number of visitors as well as what information is viewed most frequently.  This information is used to improve the content and level of service we provide to our clients and shareholders.

Information or data entered into a website will be retained.


 Where registration to a website or re-entering personal information on a website is required, "cookies" are used to improve your online experience.  A cookie is a way for websites to recognize whether or not you have visited the site before.  It is a small file that is stored on your computer that identifies you each time you re-visit our site so you don't have to resubmit personal information.  Cookies provide faster access into the website.


We may also collect non-personally identifiable Internet Protocol ("IP") addresses for all other visitors to monitor the number of visitors to the site.  These non-personally identifiable IP addresses are never shared with any third party.

E-mail: 
      If you have opted to receive marketing information from the Funds by e-mail, it is our policy to include instructions in all marketing messages on how to unsubscribe from subsequent e-mail programs.  Some products or services from the Funds are intended to be delivered and serviced electronically.  E-mail communication may be utilized in such cases.  If you participate in an employer-sponsored retirement plan administered by the Funds, we may, at your employer’s request, send you e-mail on matters pertaining to the retirement plan.
Please do not provide any account or personal information such as social security numbers, account numbers, or account balances within your e-mail correspondence to us.  We cannot use e-mail to execute transaction instructions, provide personal account information, or change account registration. We can, however, use e-mail to provide you with the necessary forms or you may contact customer service toll-free at 1-800-836-2211.
Surveys/Aggregate Data:
      Periodically, the Funds may conduct surveys about financial products and services or review elements of customer information in an effort to forecast future business needs.  The Funds then generate reports that include aggregate data regarding its customers.  Aggregate data classifies customer information in various ways but that does not identify individual customers.  These reports may also include information on website traffic patterns and related information.  These reports are used for the Funds’ planning, statistical and other corporate purposes.  Aggregate data may also be shared with external parties, such as marketing organizations.  However, no information is shared by which any individual customer could be identified.
Changes to Our Privacy Statement:
      The effective date of this policy is June 8, 2012.  We reserve the right to modify this policy at any time.  When it is revised or materially changed, we will update the effective date.  You can determine whether there have been changes since the last time you reviewed by simply checking the effective date.

      Notice will be provided to you in advance of any changes that would affect your rights under this policy statement

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60) 

DAYS





      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):
Starting Quarter

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.
