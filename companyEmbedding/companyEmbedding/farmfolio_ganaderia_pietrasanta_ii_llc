What is Form D? What It Is Used For
Form D disclosures could be used to track and understand better your competitors. The information in Form D is usually highly confidential for ventures and startups and they don’t like revealing it. This is because it reveals amount raised or planned to be raised as well as reasons for the financing. This could help competitors. Entrepreneurs usually want to keep their financing a ‘secret’ so they can stay in stealth mode for longer.
Why Fundraising Reporting Is Good For Farmfolio Ganaderia Pietrasanta Also
The Form D signed by Peter Kern might help Farmfolio Ganaderia Pietrasanta Llc’s sector. First, it helps potential customers feel more safe to deal with a firm that is well financed.

Ganaderia Pietrasanta IIMonteria, Colombia

Overview
Coconut, Teak and Cattle Production in the South American Tropic
Located in the caribbean coastal region of Colombia, Ganaderia Pietrasanta (GP) is a 1270 acre (514 ha) majestic tropical landscape. Comprised of 164 acres (66 ha) of high quality Teak, 36 acres (15 ha) of Organic Passion fruit production as well as 1070 acres (433 ha) of intensive grass fed cattle grazing and an ongoing development of 618 acres (250 ha) of coconut. This property is one of three ranches that used to make part of the region’s iconic farm “La Antioqueña”, a ranch that was built and developed in 1910 by Jose Maria Posada, grandfather to Mauricio Posada, current CEO of GP. “El Balsal”, as the ranch was initially named, is located 1 hour outside the city of Montería, Capital of Córdoba. Known for its plentiful water sources, rich soil and short distance to Colombia’s most prominent ports, Cordoba is the ideal location for agriculture development in Colombia.

Financial Projection
Financial projections assume current exchange rate of 3,000 and no increase in the land value. These calculations are purely based off of the production of harvests and cattle sales. It is likely that a rise in commodity prices and/or in Colombian Peso could significantly increase the future payouts of this operation.

Rating Details

Political Risk — 8
The Colombian political currently stable and is projected to improve with the further economic development of the country.
Currency Risk — 9
The Colombian Peso is currently at an all time high against the USD (3400 to 1). The 10 year average price of the currency is between 2000-2200. The currency is historically tied to the price of certain commodities, primarly oil, due to it’s export levels, however with oil approaching 20 year lows, it could be an opportunistic time to invest in peso denominated assets.
Climate Risk — 9
GP is located in the humid tropical climate of the Northern Carribean coast of Colombia. This area experiences large amounts of rainfall between the months of April-November, however is not subject to traditional tropical risks such as Hurricanes.
Management Risk — 8
The property has been family owned and operated since 1910. Strong background in cattle management and agroforestry implementation.
Financial Risk — 8
The company currently maintains a low Debt to Equity Ratio of 15%, strong track record of financial performance in cattle grazing, and potential for increased performance further modernization of the ranch.




Cattle Operation
From generation to generation, GP has progressed to become one of the region’s most innovative cattle ranchers in the region. Once a traditional grazing ranch, GP has evolved and modernized its cattle operation by implementing the Voisin intensive rotational grazing system. Since implementing the system, GP has become one of the country’s leaders in pastured beef production per hectare. While the national average is 0.5 heads of cattle per hectare, the Voisin system originally developed by the french produces five to six heads of cattle per hectare with daily weight gains of 800-900 grams of grass fed beef which has maximized profitability for the ranch. On average the ranch will rotate 4500 head of cattle between 220-350 kilos. The average time period per head at the ranch is between 3-4 months. During this period it is expected the average weight gain per head will be between 80-100 kilos. Cattle pricing in the region averages 3500-4000 pesos per kilo.  
Agroforestry and Crop Production
In an effort to diversify the farm, GP began implementing agroforestry and crop production. In the early 2000’s. The initial 134 acres (54 ha) of teak were planted in 2004 and were followed by another 30 acres (12 ha) in 2010. The rate of growth and the good quality teak from the plantation at GP is largely credited to the type and high quality seeds put in place; resulting in a large teak forest operation. The teak operation at GP uses 3 key management techniques: Stand Dynamics, Thinning and Pruning, as well as Rotation. These techniques are used by the top teak authorities in the world. Production figures per acre in the region are based on a 18-20 year crop rotation. GP estimates gross production to be $48,886 per acre of logs. In an effort maximize profitability GP will be self harvesting and milling logs into boards onsite. We anticipate this will significantly increase sales pricing, but have not factored this into the revenue projections. More recently, GP has implemented crop production of Maracuya (Yellow Passion Fruit) due to high domestic demand, which has exploded in recent years thanks to the high A and C vitamins this delicious sweet and sour fruit contains as well as its powerful antioxidants. Currently, GP is producing 12 acres (5 ha) of organic production with an additional 24 (10 ha) under development. Maracuya (Yellow passionfruit) vines bear throughout the year at GP but peak periods are between August to December and March to May. At the later time, the fruits are somewhat smaller, with less juice. In Monteria, passion fruits mature from June through January, with heaviest crops in July and August and October and November. Ripe fruits fall to the ground and will roll in between mounded rows. In order to not attract flies or ants, fruits are collected daily to avoid spoilage from soil organisms. Fruits are collected in lugs or boxes, not in bags to prevent “sweating”. If not sent immediately to processing plants, the fruits should be spread out on wire racks where there will be good air circulation. Many factors influence the yield of passionfruit vines. In general, yields of commercial plantations range from 20,000 to 35,000 lbs per acre. At GP, with hand pollination, 36 acres (15 ha) will yield 6.6 tons of fruit. On the average, a bushel of passion fruits at GP weighs 36 lbs (16 kg); yields 13 1/3 lbs (6 kg) of pulp from which is obtained 1 gal (3.785 liters)–that is 10.7 lbs (4.5 kg) of juice, and 2.6 lbs (1.18 kg) of seeds. With some strains, the juice yield is much higher; helping returns to be higher.

Passion FruitEvery year, the product is consumed in more markets. Its intense flavour with strong, naturally concentrated aroma makes passion fruit stand out from other tropical fruits. It has become an important ingredient in world cuisine, thereby boosting the product’s marketing and demand.
The value of passionfruit varies widely, prices can range from $14 to $90 per 7 kg carton. Prices are highest from September to November when very little fruit is harvested, and are lowest during the peak harvest periods through summer, autumn and winter.
Passion fruit is good in vitamin C, providing about 30 mg per 100 g. Vitamin-C (ascorbic acid) is a powerful water soluble anti-oxidant. Consumption of fruits rich in vitamin C helps the body develop resistance against flu-like infectious agents and scavenge harmful, pro-inflammatory free radicals. 
The fruit carry very good levels of vitamin-A (provides about 1274 IU per 100 g), and flavonoid antioxidants such as ß-carotene and cryptoxanthin-ß. Current research studies suggest that these compounds have antioxidant properties, and along with vitamin A are essential for good eye-sight.
CattleCattle today are the basis of a multibillion-dollar industry worldwide. The international trade in beef for 2014 was over $30 billion and represented only 23% of world beef production.
The production of milk, which is also made into cheese, butter, yogurt, and other dairy products, is comparable in economic size to beef production, and provides an important part of the food supply for many of the world’s people. Cattle hides, used for leather to make shoes, couches and clothing, are another widespread product.
Teak treeWood very durable, resistant to fungi. Used for poles, beams, trusses, columns, roofs, doors, window frames, flooring, planking, panelling, and staircases, and other constructional work. One of the best timbers for furniture and cabinet-making, wagon and railway carriages. Due to its better shape-retention ability, teak is popular in marine constructions and is a class by itself for boat- and ship building, particularly for decking. On account of its resistance to chemicals, teak articles are used in chemical laboratories; suitable for casks and vats for shipping corrosive liquids and for storing vegetable oils, fruit syrups, chutneys etc.
It has been estimated that at least 100,000 ha more could potentially be planted with teak in Central America: 25% located in Guatemala, 25% in Nicaragua, 20% in Costa Rica and 15% in El Salvador and Panama. With a rotation period of 25 years, these countries could be harvesting 5,720 ha/year or, approximately 1.43 million/m3/ of roundwood.
CoconutsAs a commercial crop, the long period from planting to full bearing has discouraged planting. The price of the primary product, copra (dried coconut kernel), is subject to world commodity markets, and the present price for copra has been depressed in the face of competition from other vegetable oils.
The market for copra and coconut oil is worldwide. All large and medium-sized producers including PNG, Solomon Islands, and Samoa have oil mills and export mainly the oil. World exports of coconut oil in 2002 was 1822 million mt (2 million t) compared to only 0.160 mt (0.176 t) of copra exported.
The primary coconut products traded internationally are derived from the fruit: copra and desiccated coconut, coconut cream and protein, whole mature nuts, coir, and activated carbon from shells. Young drinking nuts, coconut water (fresh, canned or frozen), and palm sugar are important in local economies and have a ready market in developed countries with large Asian populations. The other primary products in local economies include shell charcoal, mature nuts for cooking and food uses, brooms, ropes, and coconut shell products, some of which may find niche markets overseas. For many Pacific island states, copra and its by-product, copra press cake, are the only important exports.
