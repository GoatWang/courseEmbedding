PROFILE

Natelli Communities is headed by Tom Natelli, its president and CEO.  For over 25 years the company has continued to build on its reputation as the premier developer of master planned communities in the Washington, DC metropolitan area by focusing on excellence in all aspects of the community design, development, construction and management processes.  The company has consistently developed the best selling master planned communities in the markets in which it operates.
The company is well versed in local and regional planning, regulatory, market, environmental and development matters, and principally acquires unimproved, un-entitled property in the mid-Atlantic region for long-term development.  The company develops a vision for each property, seeks the input of local communities and other interested parties, undertakes the rezoning and entitlement processes, and physically develops the properties into finished communities.  Residential, retail and office components are sold to national and regional builders under coordinated programs that govern the type, style and level of finish of each of the products constructed by third-parties.  Natelli builds some of the products in each community through its affiliates, Main Street Homes, Main Street Commercial and Natelli Homes.
Natelli Communities has developed over 10,000 home sites and several million square feet of office and retail space in the mid-Atlantic region, in communities ranging in size from several hundred to several thousand units.  Natelli’s portfolio of completed projects includes the highly regarded 1,000 acre community of Avenel in Potomac, Maryland, for which it received the 1996 Urban Land Institute’s “Award of Excellence for Master Planned Communities”.
Natelli also developed the Lakelands Community in Gaithersburg, Maryland, a 2,000 unit neo-traditional community that was the best-selling community in Montgomery County, Maryland for four years in a row during the build-out of the project.  Natelli earned the Environmental Developer of the Year Award in 2002 for the Lakelands Community.
Other notable communities include Sunset Island, a 600 unit resort community built on a 37 acre island in Ocean City, Maryland that was the best selling community in the Ocean City market during the build out of the community.
The company is developing the Villages of Urbana in Frederick County, Maryland.  The Villages of Urbana is approved for 3,000 homes, 800,000 square feet of retail and 1,500,000 square feet of office.  The Villages of Urbana has been the best-selling community in Frederick County for 8 years in a row, with over 2,000 homes developed from 2001 thru 2009.
Natelli is also developing Bay Forest, an 800 home lifestyle community in the resort area of Bethany Beach, Delaware, which has been the best selling community of townhomes and single family homes in Sussex County, Delaware, since its inception in 2006.
The company is currently, or has developed many other communities including Longmead Crossing (2,000 homes), Dearbought (700 homes), Manor Oaks (500 homes), Glenbrook (350 homes), and many others.

        Developer Natelli dead at 67

Natelli


Skip Lawrence





























































BETHESDA -- Anthony Natelli, a major land developer in Frederick and Montgomery counties for three decades, died of a brain hemorrhage Thursday, his company said.
Mr. Natelli made his mark in the building industry with Potomac's Avenel golf course community. His other projects, recently completed or in progress, include Dearbought in Frederick, Glenbrook in Middletown and the approximately 3,500-home Villages of Urbana.
Mr. Natelli, 67, lived in Avenel. He died from a brain hemorrhage Thursday at Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, according to a statement issued by Gaithersburg-based Natelli Communities.
Mr. Natelli was chairman of the privately held firm, and his son, Thomas Natelli, is president and chief executive officer.
Thomas Natelli's assistant, Joan Colona, said Friday he was not available for comment. Industry experts said the elder Mr. Natelli's death won't change the company's developments in progress.
"It definitely wouldn't have an impact on the projects," said Bryan Patchan, president of the Frederick County Builders Association.
According to Natelli Communities, Tony Natelli, a New Jersey native, left the accounting field for real estate in 1977.
"With striking creativity and an unparalleled work ethic, Tony Natelli helped change the landscape of suburban Maryland over the last 30 years," the firm's statement said.
Mr. Patchan echoed the praise, citing the success of the 900-home Avenel, which hosts an annual Professional Golf Association tournament.
"He took a landfill and turned it into one of the most prestigious communities in the Washington metro area," Mr. Patchan said.
For Avenel, Mr. Natelli in 1996 won the Urban Land Institute Award of Excellence for the "finest planned community in the nation," according to Natelli Communities.
"He was kind of a legend in our industry," Mr. Patchan said.
Villages of Urbana commenced in the early 1990s and is still ongoing, one of the county's largest developments ever planned.
"I would reference him as a visionary who established a higher standard for development in Frederick County," said County Commissioner Mike Cady, liaison to the Planning Commission.
"He was mild-mannered," Mr. Cady said.
Mr. Natelli's death won't affect a school financing arrangement between the county and Natelli Communities because a contract has already been signed, Mr. Cady said.
Mr. Natelli, born July 13, 1936, in Jersey City, N.J., was involved in various civic and charitable organizations.
The company's statement said his family was "inspired by his life and humbled by his death."
He is survived by his wife of 47 years, Trudy; his five children, Nancy, Tony, Thomas, Mary and Michael; their spouses; 15 grandchildren and one great grandchild.
A memorial service is scheduled March 30 at 5 p.m. at Our Lady of Mercy Catholic Church, 9200 Kentsdale Drive in Potomac.
