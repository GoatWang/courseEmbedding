Our Team   Roger G. Worthington













Roger G. Worthington







Law School: 
 University of Texas at Austin, J.D., 1986


College: 
 University of Texas at Austin, B.A., summa cum laude, 1983


Member: 
 State Bar of Texas; State Bar of California


Born: 
 Chico, California


	Roger Worthington believes in giving back. Worthington has donated over
	 $1 million directly to medical research on the early detection, prevention,
	 treatment and cure of asbestos-related mesothelioma. Most of the latter
	 amount has been donated to the cancer research foundation he helped found,
	 the Mesothelioma Applied Research Foundation, Inc. (
	MARF), a 501(c)(3) non-profit whose mission is to eradicate mesothelioma as
	 a life ending disease. More important than dollars, he has donated thousands
	 of hours to the foundation, which has funded over $5 million in research
	 grants through a competitive peer-review process.

In 2005, MARF awarded Roger the Congressman Bruce Vento “Hope Builder
	 " Award in recognition of his efforts to persuade industry, the drug
	 companies, trial lawyers, and the federal government to fund therapy-focused
	 mesothelioma research. Roger dedicated the award to his dad, “Punch
	 “Worthington who has asbestosis and lung cancer.

	In addition, Worthington has raised over $1 million for the Pacific Heart
	 Lung & Blood Institute (PHLBI), another 501(c)(3) nonprofit research foundation. PHLBI's mission
	 is to improve the prevention,
	diagnosis, and treatment of chest diseases through independent research, collaboration,
	 and education. The foundation is located in Los Angeles, California. Through
	 PHLBI, Worthington has funded the creation of the Punch Worthington Research
	 Laboratory, which is located at the UCLA Medical School in Los Angeles.

Worthington believes in educating our children about the importance of
	 protecting the environment that sustains all life. In 2002, he and his
	 wife/partner Ann endowed a professorship for Ecology and Evolutionary
	 Biology at the University of Texas in Austin. The course will introduce
	 students to the key concepts of genetics, evolution, and ecology so they
	 will have a better comprehension of the interplay between the population,
	 pollution and natural and manufactured ecosystems.

Worthington is active in his community and takes a strong interest in the
	 wellbeing and health of his neighbors in Dana Point, California. He actively
	 promotes cycling as a healthy recreation in California and Oregon His
	 office is a sponsor of the
	Team OUCH Professional Cycling Team. He readily gives back to the University of
	 Texas. To honor his college mentor, Biology Professor Larry Gilbert, Worthington
	 also provides financial support for Dr. Gilbert’s field research
	 on non-chemical methods for controlling the imported fire ant at the U.T.
	 Brackenridge Field Laboratory in Austin, Texas. In 2002, he and his wife
	 Ann created the Worthington Essay Prize. Click here to learn more about
	 Worthington’s Community Service.

Our Team





Worthington & Caron, PC: Asbestos Lawyers for Life

Worthington & Caron, PC has been committed to
	empowering mesothelioma patients and their families since 1990. The firm, comprised
	 of Attorney
	Roger G. Worthington and
	John M. Caron, is based in California and handles asbestos-related mesothelioma cases
	 throughout the United States.

Medical Empowerment

	People who choose Worthington & Caron after receiving a mesothelioma cancer
	diagnosis become more than just our clients. Our attorneys are not just your legal
	 advocates. We are here to advocate for the best possible
	treatment options. By connecting you to leading mesothelioma physicians and emerging
	clinical trials, we give you the medical empowerment you deserve after a diagnosis.

Legal Empowerment
Worthington & Caron, PC has practiced nothing but asbestos-related
	 litigation since 1990. Our team is completely dedicated to these cases
	 for life – hence our motto “Asbestos Lawyers for Life.”
	 We tailor our representation to each individual client and his or her
	 unique needs. Our clients are never ignored, never marginalized, and never
	 left on their own.
Commitment to Research
The team at Worthington & Caron, PC has personally donated thousands
	 of dollars to mesothelioma research. Attorney Roger Worthington even helped
	 found the Mesothelioma Applied Research Foundation, a non-profit organization
	 committed to advancing mesothelioma research for early detection and improved
	 patient prognosis.
For Us, It’s Personal

	Worthington & Caron’s team of attorneys have personally experienced
	 the effects of
	asbestos cancer. Roger Worthington’s father, Punch, battled asbestos cancer. We
	 want what every other mesothelioma patient and their family wants –
	 a cure. We fight for mesothelioma patients for hope – for life.

More Than $2.5 Billion Recovered

	When looking for a mesothelioma advocate to have in your corner, results
	 matter. Not only do we passionately care about advancing mesothelioma
	 research and empowering patients, but that passion also translates into
	 results. Worthington & Caron’s attorneys have
	recovered more than $2.5 billion in verdicts and settlements for mesothelioma
		 cancer patients.

	asbestos cancer victims and their families.

Mr. Caron graduated with honors from Indiana University in Bloomington,
	 Indiana in 1984, completing his undergraduate curriculum in three years.
	 After working a year for a major pharmaceutical company, Mr. Caron attended
	 Southwestern University School of Law located in Los Angeles, California.
	 As part of an accelerated program emphasizing application of legal theories
	 to practical skills which accepts less than 50 students per year (Southwestern's
	 Conceptual Approach to Legal Education Program, or S.C.A.L.E.), Mr. Caron
	 was able to complete his law degree in just two years. Mr. Caron also
	 served as an editor for Southwestern’s Law Review.
Mr. Caron began his legal career working at an insurance defense law firm
	 where he became one of the firm’s youngest partners at age 28. As
	 a defense attorney, Mr. Caron succeeded in consistently obtaining outstanding
	 results for his clients through trial, arbitration and mediation.

	Mr. Caron joined the Law Office of
	Roger G. Worthington in 2005 where he has devoted his practice solely to the representation
	 of asbestos cancer victims. He became a partner with the firm in 2007.
	 The in-depth, behind-the-scenes understanding of how insurance companies
	 evaluate and settle personal injury claims which Mr. Caron gained as a
	 defense attorney, has proven invaluable to the firm’s representation
	 of asbestos cancer clients.

Mr. Caron is a frequent speaker and contributor to Veterans and Union meetings
	 where he seeks to advance awareness of asbestos disease and the rights
	 of affected families. Mr. Caron is also devoted to the cause of raising
	 funds to find a cure for asbestos cancers.
Known for his energy, insight and dedication to his clients, Mr. Caron
	 is uniquely qualified to help asbestos cancer victims obtain the compensation
	 they deserve.
