        Who Made Partner at Kirkland, Covington, Goodwin and Curtis    

October 4, 2016





One hundred and twelve lawyers have been promoted to partner at four major law firms, according to a collection of recent announcements.
The large majority (81 of the lawyers) are non-equity partners at Kirkland & Ellis.
Thirteen lawyers — mostly in Washington — were promoted to partner at Covington & Burling, while 15 were named partner at Goodwin Procter. At Curtis Mallet-Prevost Colt & Mosle, there were four lawyers named partner.
The disproportionately high number of partner promotions at Kirkland takes into account the firm’s business model of promoting many associates to non-equity partner as a mid-way point to equity status. Kirkland does not announce promotions of non-equity partners who become equity partner.
We’ve laid out the promotion announcements below in the format they were released.
