Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the LMI Aerospace 1Q 2014 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.
This call includes forward-looking statements, including statements related to LMI's outlook for 2014 and beyond. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from these statements. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in our report on 10 -- on Form 10-K of the year ended December 31, 2013 and in our other filings with the SEC. These forward-looking statements are based on management's expectations of the day of this presentation. We undertake no obligation to update any of the statements. Our presentation also includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, an effort to provide additional information to investors. Our GAAP results and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Dan Korte, CEO. Mr. Korte, you may begin.
Daniel G. J. Korte
Thank you, Kevin, and good morning to everyone. I am Dan Korte, CEO of LMI Aerospace. Joining me on the call today from LMI is Cliff Stebe, Chief Financial Officer.
Welcome to our first quarter 2014 conference call. We are here to discuss our press release issued earlier this morning, and I will give you an update on where our efforts will be spent in the near term.
The first quarter of 2014 reflects many of the transitions we have started to refine our business going forward, and I believe these changes will positively affect our results over the long term. As many of you are aware, I took over as CEO of LMI Aerospace on March 10, 2014. Since I have joined the company, I have focused on evaluating the factors key to our long-term growth and success. I have spent my first 8 weeks touring each of LMI's manufacturing sites and immersing myself in the business. I have met with many of LMI's strategic customers and suppliers. I am excited about the future of both the company and the industry as a whole. We currently find ourselves in a robust commercial aircraft production cycle, with multiple new aircraft expected to be introduced to the market later in the decade. We believe our recent acquisitions, which expand the company's capabilities, will position ourselves for new opportunities.
As we continue on in 2014, we will carry out the actions necessary to support the focus areas we laid out in the press release. Our leadership team will continue evaluating and refining our strategy and organizing our team to ensure that our resources are aligned with the execution of that strategy. We look forward to sharing that information with you later this year. We must accelerate the integration of our Aerostructures business to realize the full benefits and synergies. We have put a team in place to oversee each specific project and ensure the improvements we expect are measurable and achieved in a timely manner.
Cost reduction is critical to improve our competitive position in the marketplace. The items we discussed in the press release certainly are some of the tools we are using. We have placed significantly more emphasis in these areas since I joined LMI, and we are looking across the entire organizations for ways to improve our results. The steps we have already taken to remove cost from the organization should provide savings of over $4 million and provide significant benefit in the future.

We are targeting an additional $6 million in cost savings beyond those reductions. Also, the closure of our Fort Worth, Texas plant and Savannah machining center are now substantially complete. We will continue driving efforts towards centers of excellence throughout the organization. Quality in delivery will remain a fundamental focus, as our ability to meet our commitments and customers' needs is vital to our success. We plan to partner with our major customers to find new and creative solutions designed not only to lower cost, but to optimize the end product by analyzing the entire value stream process. We're also seeing new opportunities to work with our critical aerospace customers. We are working through the proposal process on numerous areas of potential new business and opportunities to grow revenue in the future.
Finally, we must develop the future leadership in employees of LMI by providing our people with the opportunities to refine and improve their skills. We see a tremendous amount of talent in the organization, and I am confident that we can further enhance our capabilities.
So I'd now like to have Cliff Stebe to speak with you in more detail about the results reported this morning. Cliff?
Clifford C. Stebe
Thanks, Dan. Good morning, everyone. I'll discuss some of the operational highlights for the quarter and address how they impact the financial statements for LMI. Just to set the stage, we've now owned the Valent and TASS acquisitions for over a year now, and it will no longer be discussed separately except in relation to integration and acquisition expenses that affect comparability in the quarter.
Overall, we generated $95.8 million in revenue and had a net loss of $0.4 million or $0.03 per diluted share. That compares to $106.1 million in revenue and $1.8 million of net income or $0.14 per fully diluted share in the first quarter of 2013.
First quarter 2014 results included a $0.4 million in charges for restructuring activities, $200,000 in expenses related to integration activities and $400,000 from other non-recurring project costs at the facilities being closed.
Pre-tax income for the first quarter of 2014, excluding those non-recurring items, was $0.6 million. First quarter 2013 results included $2.5 million in cost associated with the step up of acquired inventories and $0.5 million in integration and acquisition expenses.
The positive aspect of the first quarter was that we generated $5.1 million of free cash flow, which was used to pay down our debt. This was the second quarter in a row that we generated positive free cash flow. We expect this trend to continue in 2014, as we continue to put pressure on working capital levels and receive further payments for design build and tooling programs, implement inventory reduction processes at our plants and reduce capital spend.
I will start with the Aerostructures group results. Aerostructures generated $77.7 million of revenue, down 6.5% from $83.1 million in the prior quarter. The decrease was entirely driven by a $5.5 million reduction in tooling sales on a development program from the first quarter of 2013. We do expect to see tooling sales ramp back up later in 2014. Large commercial aircraft was up 2.7% at $38.5 million from $37.5 million in the prior year. We saw growth in the Boeing 737 program of $2.1 million and growth of $2 million in the Boeing 787 model. These increases were offset with the Boeing 747, which was down $2.6 million; and 767 model, which was down $700,000 as compared to last year's quarter.
Sales of military products were down 13.6%. We generated $12.1 million in the quarter compared to $14 million in the quarter last year. The driver here was nearly $1.7 million decline on Black Hawk, a combination of lower demand and some price reductions.

Aerostructure's gross margin was $14.2 million or 18.3% of sales compared to $16.6 million or 20% of sales in the first quarter of 2013. First quarter of 2014 results were negatively impacted by the previously mentioned non-recurring project costs at facilities being closed, coupled with lower plant utilization at those same facilities. We also incurred start-up costs on transferred productions to other facilities. The decrease in sales volume primarily relating to tooling, unfavorable sales mix and lower production levels contributed to the decline in gross margin and gross margin percentage in the first quarter of 2014. Expected performance on long-term contracts, which we talked a tremendous amount about at year end, was stable from the previous quarter -- at the end of 2013.
SG&A for the Aerostructures group was $11.4 million compared to $11.1 million in the prior-year quarter due to increases of $0.4 million of restructuring expenses, $0.4 million of professional services, offset by decreases of $0.3 million in integration expenses and $0.2 million in acquisition expenses.
Shifting now to Engineering Services. During the first quarter, total revenue was $18.7 million compared to $23.6 million in the prior-year quarter. The decline was largely driven by a decline in sales to corporate and regional jet, aircraft manufacturers and military customers. We have seen stability in Engineering Services in the first quarter as both sales and operating profit improved from the fourth quarter of 2013.
Corporate and regional aircraft had sales of $3.4 million in this quarter, down 45.2% from $6.2 million in the first quarter of 2013. Although we continue to support the Bombardier Learjet 85 project, the program is maturing and fewer resources were needed in the quarter, which led to a $2.7 million decline in revenue from $4.2 million in the first quarter of 2013.
On the military side, sales were down $5.1 million to $2.4 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared to 2013. The decrease was primarily a result of a $4.1 million reduction in the Boeing Tanker program, as the program design phase is winding down.
We did see growth in large commercial aircraft, which was $9.9 million, up from $7.5 million last year due to growth on the Airbus A350 platform and a nacelle system project.
Another bright spot was a $900,000 increase in MRO services. In addition, sales related to design delivery of tooling on various programs supporting commercial aircraft were up $1 million at $3.4 million in the first quarter compared to $2.4 million in the same quarter of 2013. This was an area of business development focus for the engineering group, as several large design programs have slowed down, and they've seen some success for their efforts in this area.
For the Engineering Services group, despite weaker revenue in the first quarter of 2013, gross profit percentages improved to 17.6% in 2014 versus 14.8% in the first quarter of 2013. Gross margin in dollars remained relatively flat at $3.3 million in the first quarter of 2014, compared to $3.5 million in quarter 1 2013. The increase in gross profit percentage was primarily the result of better labor efficiencies and utilization, in addition to reductions in overhead expenses.
SG&A for the Engineering Services group was $2.4 million or 12.8% of net sales compared to $2.9 million or 12.3% of net sales in the prior-year quarter. The reduction of SG&A expenses relates to cost reduction activities and integration.
Interest expense was $4.3 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared to $4.1 million in the first quarter of 2013. As discussed last year -- at the end of last year on income taxes, we established a valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of 2013 as a result of our -- and as a result, our tax benefit for the quarter was 3.5% of our pre-tax loss compared to 24.7% in quarter 1 2013. We should have minimal income tax expense or benefit recognized in future quarters due to the valuation allowance we have established at the end of 2013.

Next I'll talk a bit about cash. We generated operating cash flow of $10 million in the quarter -- in the first quarter of 2014 as compared to the use of cash of $10.5 million in quarter 1 2013. This was entirely driven by the $13.5 million milestone payment on design build program. This was offset by growth in receivables with other customers and deferring additional inventory cost and development programs.
Net cash used for investing activities was $4 million in the quarter as compared to $10.7 million in the first quarter of last year. In 2013, we had spent capital expenditures on a large development program. We used the cash generated in the first quarter of 2014 to pay down $5.3 million of debt.
One last note, we are in compliance with our debt covenants as of the end of the first quarter of 2014. We are in the midst of working on a new capital structure for the company that we hope to complete during the second quarter to give us the flexibility we need to make the investments and changes in the business necessary to grow the company for the long term. Additionally, we will be filing our 10-Q later today.
That is a look at the numbers. And I'll turn it back over to Dan.
Daniel G. J. Korte
Thanks, Cliff. Our focus on customer satisfaction has always been a hallmark of LMI's culture and values. We believe that execution in the key areas we discussed earlier will not only enable us to better satisfy our customers' needs, but will also position the company to achieve continued growth and success in the years to come. We've generated some positive momentum in a number of these areas in the past few weeks, and we are committed to ensure those actions continue. We have much still to do. But we have started to put the plans in place that we see as critical to the future of the business.
With that, Kevin, we are ready for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
In the top of your release, you talked about significant new work on the 737-MAX. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about that and tell us a little bit about how your content compares to the NG. And kind of related, is there anything you have to spend in terms of either development or CapEx that we should be thinking about?
Clifford C. Stebe
Sam, this is Cliff. Hope you're doing well. This 737 content is a new award for us that we had previously mentioned in our fourth quarter release. It's about $100,000 per ship set. We have -- are still in negotiations with customers relative to finalizing the potential to carry over our existing legacy work on the 737 -- from the 737NG to the 737-MAX.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Okay. And then, just generally, can you talk about the restructuring plan? You mentioned that the actions to date [ph] savings of about $4 million and you've got other actions that could save another $6 million. How much more needs to be expensed and, really, in what periods should we be thinking about those expenses hitting?
Daniel G. J. Korte
Yes. We're -- I mean, we're trying to get the bulk of those savings in this year. Some of them may carry into 2015. We're putting the plans in place for each and every one of those items. But we're very early in the process right now. And quite frankly, we're not done yet. We're still looking for other areas of opportunity as well. But that's we've identified at this point in time in the first 8 weeks here that we've been tackling it.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
But can you size what the total expenses would be in terms of what you've identified to-date?

Clifford C. Stebe
Can you repeat that again, Sam? I think you broke up a little bit.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
The expenses that are going to flow through the income statement. Like this quarter, you had some restructuring charges. Can you size what kind of spending we're going to see for the actions you've already identified?
Clifford C. Stebe
I think until we finalize our full plans relative to this, I would say it's likely in excess of $1 million, but I wouldn't say dramatically higher than that.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Okay. And then, last question, and I'll turn it over. The Black Hawk decline, you mentioned pricing and volume. I'm assuming the pricing stays here, but -- is there any reason to think why the volume should start to stabilize? Is it just a 1-quarter phenomenon, or is it longer term?
Clifford C. Stebe
The pricing concessions really began in the first quarter of last year, but were not fully in effect. So those have been there for the better part of the last 3 quarters. I think, at this point, from what we see in the remainder of the year, I think stabilizations should be pretty likely on the Black Hawk program.
Operator
Our next question comes from Yair Reiner of Oppenheimer.
Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division
So you mentioned in the press release that you need to start investing more in new technology and in automation. Can you just give us a sense of what that implies in terms of maybe the type of CapEx you'll need to invest going forward?
Daniel G. J. Korte
Yes. We're still looking at the areas that we think automation may help. I mean, we see some areas, for instance, in some of our manufacturing areas with processes like polishing and other things that are -- have pretty good payback -- cost benefit payback to use some level of automation. Again, it's just -- there's a number of business cases that we're trying to pull together here. It's not across the board, but we see -- do see good opportunities to put. In some key areas, some real labor intensive areas of our business, some automation that will not only lower cost , but we think, will also help our customers help drive some quality improvement in our end-to-end processes.
Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division
Got it. And I guess, is this part of -- I imagine this is part of the motivation behind trying to recapitalize, as you mentioned, in the prepared remarks. And with respect to that, is it going to be debt, or is there a possibility that you'll have to -- or you'll want to raise some equity as well?
Clifford C. Stebe
At this point, we are not considering the equity path.
Daniel G. J. Korte
And to your point, the cost reductions that we see out there -- I just want to iterate again, I think we're pretty early in that process. We've identified a couple of them right now. But the other reason to have the additional financing in place is we're looking at some other major programs for some of our customers that would require broader capital investments, and we need to have the flexibility to be able to make those investments as well. So it's not just about cost reduction, it's also about new business opportunities.
Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division
Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then, the commentary suggested that you've really been spending quite a bit of time on the cost side of the equation and on the margin side of the equation. I imagine that you are beginning [ph] to put equal amount of effort on the outward facing efforts to try to identify new business opportunities and development opportunities. With that in mind, what still needs to happen before you feel comfortable enough about the top line in your expense structure to be able to guide again?

Daniel G. J. Korte
I think key to that is the analysis we're doing on our overall strategy. I mean, it is looking at all the markets we serve and what are the market opportunities. But it's also the questions that we're asking ourselves about how we want to participate in each of those individual markets. And we are not -- after 8 weeks, we've started to have some good hard questions, but we're not through that analysis yet.
Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division
If you had to guess right now, do you expect guidance to be reinstated some time in '14? Or, do you think it's better to think of that as 2015 event?
Daniel G. J. Korte
I don't think we're ready to make an assessment yet on when we'll be ready to offer guidance again. But understand, we are going to try to get through this as quickly as we can. But some of the questions are pretty deep and meaty questions and we want to do it right. So we're -- although we're trying to move quickly, we also want to do the job well.
Operator
Our next question comes from Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
So the first one on -- maybe on the cost structure, Dan. The $10 million [indiscernible] to get cost savings out of the organization, I imagine those [indiscernible] on the Aerostructures side. But can you parse it that way between Aerostructures and Engineering Services? And then, can you give us some perspective on Engineering Services now that you've seen that business kind of in the role you are today, where you see it sitting within the overall organization going forward?
Daniel G. J. Korte
The cost reductions we talked about are across both the Aerostructures and the services business. The bulk of them are on the Aerostructures side. There's been a lot of cost reduction done on the services side over the last couple of quarters. In fact, I think you'll see -- as Cliff mentioned, we see some stabilization and some better margins starting to emerge from that business. It's an easier business model to drive cost reduction out of quickly because it's primarily rightsizing the headcount for the business that you have. On the Aerostructures side, it takes a bit longer, some of them are much more complicated. And so, I think it is a mix of both, but more weighted towards the Aerostructures side. Did you have [ph] the second half of your question there that I may have missed, Myles. So...
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
I did. It was more of the strategic fits of the two businesses within LMI now that you're in the role?
Daniel G. J. Korte
Yes, I, mean that's part of the work that we're still doing. We're looking at the design build strategy, the market analysis, the size of that market, the competitive forces in that particular market. And that's probably one of the meatier questions that we're analyzing right now as a team. So but I'm real happy to see that, for the near term, at least, the business has stabilized. I think we've come pretty close to matching our headcount to the revenue. A little bit more work to go, and we've actually seen a bit of uptick in the marketplace over the last quarter. So that's good, while we're continuing our strategic analysis.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Okay. And then, one other one -- it's still on the same kind of vein, the $10 million in cost plan. Is that a plan that rightsizes the cost structure of Aerostructures to get it back to the EBIT performance margins it was in '11 and '12? Or was that just a period of time when you had mature programs that were kind of clicking along and it's going to be hard to get back there even with your $10 million cost savings?
Daniel G. J. Korte
Well, it's -- we have -- product mix always has a big effect on margins. But I will say, just putting aside for a moment what the end target should look like, I don't feel the $10 million is enough yet. I feel there's more opportunity to drive cost out of the organization. And it's -- yes, we'd like to see our margins improve, but it's also -- just trying to run the most efficient business we can. And so, we're very, very focused on it. Cliff, do you want to add anything there?

Clifford C. Stebe
Yes. I would just say the Valent acquisition -- and I'm hesitant to continue to talk about that. The margin in those businesses were not the same as those in legacy Aerostructures. So to get back to the 26%, 27%, given those margins are historically closer to 15%, is -- would be very challenging. And I don't see us getting there in the near term.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Okay. And one cleanup one for you, Cliff, which is on interest expense run rate. Is this the right run rate now prior to the capital structure move? And then, under your contemplated scenarios, kind of, what's the most likely interest rate? Is it going to be looking at convertibles and maybe having a lower interest rate run rate or is it -- going to see a rate higher and the higher interest rate -- interest expense run rate?
Clifford C. Stebe
I think you're going to see a higher run rate, Myles. We are really -- the type of capital structure we're looking at, we want minimal, if any covenants, and would like a tremendous amount of more flexibility to run the business and make the investments in the business that we believe are necessary for the long-term viability of the company and to grow this thing. So you'll see interest expense tick up upon closure of the deal.
Operator
I'm not showing any further questions in the queue. Mr. Korte, I'd like to turn the call back over to you.
Daniel G. J. Korte
Okay. Thank you, Kevin, and thanks to everyone for attending today. I'm really looking forward to my first full quarter with the company. After 8 weeks here, I think, I can see either the opportunities that we have, the capabilities of the organization. And by the next quarter, we look forward to sharing more with you on the progress we've made on the key focus areas that we've had. So we look forward to speaking to all of you on our next call. Thank you again.
Operator

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the LMI Aerospace Third Quarter 2014 Conference Call.
[Operator Instructions] This call includes forward-looking statements including statements related to LMI's outlook for 2014 and beyond. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from these statements. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in our annual report on form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, and our other filings with the SEC. These forward-looking statements are based on management's expectations as of the date of this presentation, and we undertake no obligation to update any of these statements. Our presentation also includes certain non-GAAP financial measures in an effort to provide additional information to investors. Our GAAP results and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release.
At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dan Korte, CEO. Mr. Korte, please begin.
Daniel G. J. Korte
Thank you, Howard, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2014 conference call. I'm Dan Korte, CEO of LMI Aerospace, as Howard mentioned. Joining me on the call today from LMI is Cliff Stebe, Chief Financial Officer. We're here to discuss our third quarter results. Starting with an update on what we've accomplished since the last time we spoke. We'll also, review our ongoing areas of focus and provide commentary on our corporate strategy. The third quarter results include the impact of several initiatives designed to improve our business going forward. And I believe these changes should positively affect our results over the long term.
First, we continue to focus on margin improvement initiatives and achieve strong accomplishments since the last time we spoke. We successfully lowered the price of externally purchased content and negotiated new pricing for engineering changes on a 787 program, converting it from an unprofitable contract into a profitable contract. The teams focus on driving down working capital levels also helped us generate a record $21 million in operating cash during the quarter, allowing us to pay down nearly $17 million of debt as we make progress delevering our balance sheet. In addition, we continue to win new content on the 787 program. And finally, related to our initiative to further remove operating costs, increase asset utilization and improve our competitive position we announced earlier today the closure of our St. Charles, Missouri machining operations, formerly a Valent location. The work at this site will be largely transferred to other LMI facilities, and we're also shifting some work between other sites, as we transition the company to more focused, efficient centers of excellence.
We expect between $0.9 million and $1.1 million in nonrecurring, restructuring and relocation costs associated with these transfers. But this will yield over $1.5 million in annual savings once implemented. These decisions are never easy, but we believe it is in the best interest of the company and our customers to make these changes. We are truly thankful for all the hard work and dedication to LMI by the employees impacted.
Finally, we continue to make good progress negotiating several additional long-term customer agreements and hope to have those completed by our next earnings call within the next quarter. At the same time, given the outlook within our aerospace end markets, we see a large number of new business development opportunities and are working diligently to put LMI in a position to capitalize on this potential new work.

Now moving to our current market environment, we have seen several industry developments since our last earnings call that will positively impact LMI in the future. For example, Gulfstream recently unveiled 2 new aircraft, the G500 and G600, and LMI has secured contracts to provide structural assemblies, skin and components for both platforms. We have continued to build upon our long-standing relationship with Gulfstream and have been awarded over $700,000 of content on each of these platforms, more content than we have on any other Gulfstream platform today. The G500 and G600 have a wider cabin, higher speed and better fuel efficiency then the G650. When they move into production over the coming years, they should certainly, improve our revenue trajectory and long-term profitability. In addition, we are pleased to announce that a key milestone was achieved on the company's first major design-build program with the rollout of the Mitsubishi Regional Jet, which includes our tailcone. I was still thrilled to be present at this significant event in Nagoya, Japan, and excited to be moving into the next phase of this program.
We saw another major milestone in relation to the Embraer KC-390 military transport plane, which had its rollout celebration on October 21, in Brazil. LMI designed and build all the flat assemblies for this aircraft. Finally, we saw Boeing announce another gold rate increase on the 737 for 2018, and that will certainly benefit LMI going forward.
Before turning the call over to Cliff, I wanted to spend some time talking about our refined corporate strategy. Our team put significant effort in determining the long-term goals for LMI, and developing an operational plan to achieve them. We have set as our overriding mission to provide the best solutions to our customers, with a focus on operational excellence in the production of components and assemblies. Our goals are to substantially grow revenue by winning 2 major business development awards each year, delivering annual gross margin improvement, delevering the balance sheet to strengthen our financial flexibility and enable further investment. And integrate our operations into more efficient value streams. The key to doing all of this is operational excellence, which comes through improved performance, superior customer service, continuous people development and technology and innovation. We see countless opportunities in this market for LMI, and expect this to continue given the strength of the aerospace cycle. We will pursue increased content across all our key customers, and also seek to further penetrate Airbus, which represents an entire section in to market, where we have barely begun to scratch the surface. We're focused on trying to find new awards that will benefit 2015, as we see only modest revenue growth in 2015, as the majority of our large wins don't contribute until 2016 and beyond. We are also making changes to how we position our engineering services business, where results have clearly been a disappointment. We're more heavily utilizing our Sri Lankan resources, and we'll focus on further streamlining overhead to provide a more attractive cost structure to our customers. And what has become a highly competitive marketplace impacted by a slowdown in new development programs. We've also made changes to our business development strategy to market our services to a broader array of customers and put additional focus on the aftermarket, which is a segment of this business, which is grown nicely this year. We expect this to continue.
Overall, we believe we're taking the necessary steps to position the company for improved operating performance and topline performance overtime. With the new strategic vision in place, we remain committed to building a customer focused, world-class aerospace organization that deliverers unique value-added products and systems, and provide superior long-term shareholder returns. One other note, we'll return to providing guidance starting in March for 2015.

I'd now like to have Cliff Stebe speak with you in more detail about the third quarter financial results reported this morning. Cliff?
Clifford C. Stebe
Thanks, Dan. Good morning, everyone. I'll discuss some of the operational highlights for the quarter and address how they impacted the financial statements for LMI. Overall, we generated $97.3 million in revenue and had a net income of $1.4 million for the quarter, or $0.11 per fully diluted share. This compares to $104.7 million in revenue and $2.1 million of net income or $0.16 per fully diluted share in the third quarter of 2013. The third quarter 2014 operating profits included a total of $2.4 million of net favorable nonrecurring unusual items driven by a favorable reversal of a loss reserve on a long-term contract as Dan mentioned, worth $4.6 million. Somewhat offset by $0.9 million of accelerated depreciation, $0.8 million of restructuring expense, and $0.5 million in environmental expenses. The third quarter 2014 operating income, excluding the net favorable nonrecurring items discussed above, would have been $4.4 million or 4.5% of sales, compared to $6.6 million for the third quarter 2013. Third quarter of 2014 also included a discrete income tax benefit of $0.3 million.
Also, on a positive note, as Dan mentioned, this was the fourth quarter in a row in which we generated positive cash flow. We generated $21.1 million of cash from operations this quarter. We utilize this cash as Dan mentioned to pay down $16.7 million of debt, including $9 million to take the borrowings on our revolving credit agreement to 0 at quarter end, and retired $5 million of our senior secured notes.
We expect operating cash flow to be positive through the remainder of 2014, as we continue to work on improving profitability and bringing down our working capital. We'll continue to put pressure on working capital and profitability well into the future.
Now let me turn to the segment results, starting with the Aerostructures group. Aerostructures generated $82.9 million of revenue in the third quarter, down 2.6% from $85.1 million in the prior year period. The decrease was primarily driven by 20.7% reduction in sales of military products, or we generated $13 million of revenue in the quarter, compared to $16.4 million last year. Difference was entirely driven by the KC-390 program, which saw a sales fall $3.3 million this quarter due to nonrecurring tooling revenue in the prior period. Large commercial aircraft remained unchanged during the third quarter of 2014 when compared to the third quarter of 2013. We continue to see year-over-year growth in the Boeing 737 and 787 platforms, which were $1.7 million and $1.6 million higher, respectively, versus 2013. Total volume on the Boeing 737 and 787 were $24.1 million and $3.5 million, respectively. However, our largest customer did change inventory practices during the quarter, which reduced sales by $0.8 million in the quarter, most notably on the 737 program. We expect an impact on the fourth quarter as well of a similar level. The 737 and 787 increases were offset by continued decline in sales for the Boeing 767 and 747 due to lower demand, which we saw sales fall $3.3 million and $1.6 million respectively versus last year.
Aerostructures gross profit was $20.4 million or 24.6% of sales, compared to $17.3 million or 20.3% of sales in the third quarter of 2013. The previously mentioned reversal of loss reserves on a long-term contract contributed $4.6 million of that gross profit, which was partially offset by $0.5 million of accelerated depreciation. Excluding the impact of these items, the gross profit margin would have been 19.6% of sales in the third quarter 2014, again, compared to 20.3% in third quarter, but up from 19% excluding unusuals in the second quarter of 2014, reflecting the impact of cost reductions being implemented. Aerostructures gross margin was impacted by unfavorable sales mix and lower production levels in the third quarter of 2014, in an effort to reduce working capital. Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the Aerostructures group was $12.5 million, compared to $11.3 million in the prior year period. The difference in SG&A primarily relates to $0.4 million of restructuring cost, environmental expense of $0.5 million, and $0.4 million of accelerated depreciation. Excluding these nonrecurring costs, SG&A costs would have decreased $0.1 million in the third quarter versus the prior year period.

Shifting now to Engineering Services segment. The company has continued to experience a decline in demand with total revenue falling to $14.7 million in the third quarter of 2014, compared to $20.2 million in the prior year period. The decline was largely driven by lower design work on tooling for Boeing and work for military customers. We did see slight growth in the corporate regional jet aircraft revenue, which rose to $4.4 million from $4 million last year. Primarily, due to additional revenue this quarter on the Bombardier Learjet 85 project. Sales related to design and delivery of tooling on various programs supporting commercial aircraft were down $3.3 million to $6.6 million in the quarter versus $9.9 million in the third quarter 2013. This relates to a decline in revenue for a design work on tooling for Boeing. On the military side, sales were up $2.1 million to $2.7 million in the third quarter 2014 compared to 2013. The decrease primarily reflects the reduction in the Boeing Tanker program, as the design phase is winding down. Gross profit for the segment was $1.6 million or 10.9% of net sales for the third quarter of 2014, compared to $3.3 million or 16.3% of sales for the prior year third quarter. The decrease in gross profit was primarily attributable to the decline in sales, as fixed costs are spread over lower volumes. The quarter of -- this quarter for 2014 also, was unfavorably impacted by a cumulative catch up adjustment of $0.4 million on the MRJ program, which has experienced higher-than-expected testing costs. SG&A for the Engineering Services group was $2.9 million or 19.7% of net sales, compared to $2.5 million or 12.4% of net sales in the prior year period. Increase was primarily attributable to $0.4 million of restructuring and $0.2 million of accelerated stock compensation expense related to the departure of a key officer of this segment during the third quarter of 2014. Excluding these adjustments, SG&A would have been $2.2 million or $0.3 million less than the same period in 2013 reflecting cost-reduction activities.
Interest expense was $5.9 million in the quarter of 2014, compared to $4.3 million in the third quarter of 2013. The $1.6 million increase was entirely related to the higher average interest rates on the high-yield notes that were put in place back in June. As we have actually reduced our total borrowings outstanding from the prior year. We expect to continue be able to reduce debt levels in the fourth quarter. The company recognized an income tax benefit for the third quarter of 2014 of $0.8 million. $0.3 million of which relates to an income tax carry back for higher-than-expected tax credits earned.
Next, I'll talk a bit about cash. As I mentioned earlier, we generated operating cash flow of $21.1 million in third quarter as compared to the use of $1 million in the third quarter of 2013. This is a result of improved cash collections and reduced program investments to support long-term contracts, stretched vendor terms and reduced inventory levels. Net cash used for investing activities was $2.5 million, as compared to $3.3 million last year. I'll relook the higher capital spending during the next 2 quarters as we make investments to support certain programs and replace older equipment. Since quarter end, we've continued to generate positive free cash flow.
As mentioned previously, we utilized the cash flow generated in the quarter to pay down $16.7 million of long-term debt, which will help reduce interest expense going forward, as we -- as well as strengthen our balance sheet. One last note, we're in compliance with our debt covenants as the end of third quarter. Additionally, we will be filing our 10-Q later today. That is the look at the numbers, with that, Howard, we are ready for questions.

Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question or comment comes from the line of Tyler Hojo from Sidoti.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company, Inc.
So just to kind of start on kind of some of the programs you mentioned in the prepared remarks. 787, you said content went up, where is it today? And then also just on the G500 and G600, really nice to see kind of content wins there. Just wondering if there's some opportunities to kind of scale that up even further as kind of development progresses?
Clifford C. Stebe
Tyler, it's good to talk to you again. The 787 content, as we looked into 2015 is around $220,000 per ship set. We've got a pretty significant portion of work statement that kicks in 2015, as we're picking up some work on the -8 that we had not started in 2014. Relative to our ability to grow on the G500 and G600, we continue to see opportunities on those aircraft. And we'll continue to look to build on that, I would say, while I work at this point is been place, but we will still continue to see some smaller opportunities overtime.
Daniel G. J. Korte
Tyler, this is Dan. I'd also add that on the 787 program, well, some of the wins that we've had in the last quarter, they're not just -- some of them really in our machining operations, but we've also had 2 wins in our composite facility. And we've been trying to grow our composite capabilities. We've got a new autoclave installed up there this quarter. And it was nice to see 2 different contracts wins on the 787 for that facility. So I think good progress on the 787 front.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company, Inc.
That's great. Can you quantify how much of the 787 content pickup was actually on the composite side? And how many autoclaves do you have now, is it 2 or 3?
Daniel G. J. Korte
We actually have 2 autoclaves in operation today. But the newest one we just added is a pretty decent size autoclave. It's an 8x30 foot autoclave. So we got a lot of capability there. The content is relatively small. The composite work, I think it's going to be about between $4 million and $5 million a year in content, which to the size of the company it may seem small, but these are our first major production contracts. So to be honest, I probably wouldn't want them to be much bigger. We've got to make sure, that we've got all our processes working smoothly that we get that facility into a production mode. And then, we look to grow that capability over the next couple of years. But it's nice to have a good start and be in production.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company, Inc.
Okay. Great. Great to hear. And maybe just a question on the Engineered Services business. Can you talk a little bit about, I guess, what caught you by surprise in terms of the sequential decline in revenue. And maybe, just kind of in your response, you could talk about kind of where headcount is today. And just kind of thoughts on how strategic this piece of the business still is?
Daniel G. J. Korte
Let's see, Tyler, if the design programs come, some of the major design programs in the industry come down, we see our content come down at the same ratio that the programs are coming down. And Cliff mentioned, the tanker program it's not a surprise, but that program is moving into the test phase, less design work, which is where our key capabilities are. So we've been riding down that wave, and unfortunately, over the -- as that occurs. We're seeing start up of a lot of new customers as well. Also, some existing customers have been actually expanded work, even though it doesn't look like it overall. I mentioned some strength in the aftermarket business there, it's actually up year-on-year and it's been up, I think, every quarter this year. As far as, its revenue, as a subset of the overall Engineering Services, but it's a really hard market to predict. There is not much backlog in Engineering Services, you kind of have to -- what you win today, you start on next week, and you've got to constantly out there winning new programs. So it is difficult for us to forecast. And as we get to a point to the next earnings call, we're releasing guidance. I think, we're going to -- we will make sure that we frame that piece of it appropriately for that matter. I think our overall headcount is probably down about 30 heads, overall. So not -- I mean, it's still probably less than right around 10% of the workforce. That's the nice thing about this business. It's relatively easy to right size it and to move up and down. We've got little more work to do there though as we mentioned. We've got some work to do on overheads. I think another bright spot in that area is we see more opportunities in using our Sri Lankan workforce, where we provide blended rates to our customers and are able to hit a little bit lower labor rates, which is, I think been attractive to a number of our key customers.

Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company, Inc.
Okay. And just maybe lastly, if you wouldn't mind just commenting on kind of the overall cost restructuring initiatives. I guess, based on the new cost outs that you talked about, you'll be up to $11.5 million in savings on an annualized basis. Do you still see more room there or maybe just give us an update on kind of what you see today?
Daniel G. J. Korte
Yes, Tyler, we do still see more room. We've got more activities. Our list of cost reduction activities that we still have in process is relatively long at this point. As you get into the list, it gets harder and harder to do them, they take more time. This, one we just announced this morning, with the closure of this facility, there's literally a few months of work that go into a decision like that and making sure that you can do it right, and making sure that you don't impact your customers. But we continue to see the, I think, pretty reasonable opportunities to continue to lower our cost structure. I also say that of the $10 million that we announced prior, none of that cost is -- we are not allowing that to slip back into our operation. We've been very diligent and we are tracking that to ensure that we continue to receive the benefits of that, as well as the additional $1.5 million we talked about this morning, in every financial period.
Clifford C. Stebe
I think, for instance Tyler, I mean, freight, we deem to be great opportunity for us. Where we're located, the interdependency of the -- of each one of the plants. I mean, there's several million dollars of spend there that we're certainly taking a hard look at, logistics are trying to impact that.
Daniel G. J. Korte
I think that, just to build on what Cliff said, the other area that we've made some progress on this quarter, but we're surely not done yet -- done working through yet is working capital, overall. We're looking at our inventory levels. We're looking at -- it's literally all the elements of working capital to see where else we can reduce in order to drive more cash out of this business and help delever.
Operator
Our next question or comment comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
I was wondering if you could start with Engineering Services kind of where we left off. And the color in the press release talks about, if the trends don't improve there's a risk on impairment. And so 2 questions, one is what is the level that you think should improve toward? And are the impairments writing off goodwill and intangibles held on balance sheet, and if so is there any implications to covenants?
Clifford C. Stebe
I'll take the more accounting side of that question. I think, the impairments mention there's certainly goodwill on intangibles if we continue to see a trend at this level. I think our focus over the next few years is to build this. I think we're kind of running at around the $65 million trajectory. And I think our goal is to get that back into the high 70s and $80 million range over time. It's going to take a bit of work to do that. And we're going to have to continue to reposition ourselves in the marketplace to win. And certainly, what Dan mentioned earlier, relative to how we're changing our sales process there. What we can do around cost to make ourselves more competitive, because as the demand has declined in the overall market, we've seen increased competition, particularly from overseas and lower-cost countries. So we're trying to take better advantage of what we have to offer in that space.
Daniel G. J. Korte
Myles, just to add to that. I mean, we don't see the services side of the business as the strongest opportunity for growth. As Cliff said, we would like to see it more in the $70 million to $80 million range out in the future. But most of our growth push is on the Aerostructures side of the business. But there's a real nice synergistic benefit to having the engineering business as a part of LMI. So if we can kind of keep it at that $70 million to $80 million range, I mean, sure, if we see some great opportunities out there to profitably grow it, we'd look hard at them and probably jump on them. But it's not where we're putting the bulk of our energies as far as the growth prospects for LMI.

Clifford C. Stebe
And Myles, you did ask a question relative to impact on covenants. And it does not have a impact on covenants.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Okay. And, Dan, when you did your strategic review of the business when you first got in, you obviously, looked at this business as -- and evaluated core and non-core with the team and came to I think, a conclusion that's core and had to add value of low invested capital and potential to turn around. If it doesn't get back in that 70, 80s, is it still got all of those characteristics or is it volume dependent that it actually has to rebound to just kind of fill in what you thoughts as?
Daniel G. J. Korte
Well, I guess, I would say like any part of our business, we can't figure out a way to profitably run it ourselves. And then we have to look at alternatives. Our view right now though is we can't. I mean, we think that we can grow this business, we can make it profitable, and we can make it a contributing part of the business. But again, we're looking at the entire portfolio constantly. And having discussions amongst the team on how best to run the business. So if we decide, if some point is unattainable the we got to look at other options. But for now, that's not the situation. We've taken a little bit of a dip here. And yes, we maybe lick our wounds a little bit for a day, but then we jump right back in. And we think we've got some ways to build a backup.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
So one of the positives, I heard you say Dan, was that you turned the 8, 7 contracts from a loss to profitable position. And I'm curious, did you do that internally through cost, or you do it through supply chain, or you do it through contract renegotiation? Can you just -- and are there other programs, contracts like that, that are kind of long hold in the tent that you're just in a bad place with respect to the contract that you can try and get out of?
Clifford C. Stebe
I think, relative to this contract in particular, it was a combination of couple of different things. There were some pretty significant engineering changes to the program. So we're able to go back in and negotiate prices for those changes. We did a bunch of work with the supply chain. Mainly as this has got a ton of external content. We're able, once the bombs settle down on this particular program to be able to negotiate better forward pricing. And we continue to put pressure on all of our long-term programs as well. As every other piece of the work we do to try to make them more efficient, particularly, relative to labor. So certainly, the big change on this was relative to the supply-chain costs and secondary relative to the price.
Daniel G. J. Korte
Myles, just to add to that, I think one of the things that is really nice about this change and this program, I mean, in the history of LMI, we have never had a loss program before this one. And this came into the company through the Valent acquisition. We've now turned this from a loss contract into a profitable contract. So we're back to having a portfolio of no unprofitable programs. It doesn't mean that every program is as profitable as we would like, and we work on that every single day, but it's nice to have a clean slate.
Clifford C. Stebe
And I think, we've got -- we barely scratched the surface in this contract. We just hit right on the -9, we are really haven't yet started the -8 yet. We've got a lot of time for further improvement on this and we're pushing the teams to do exactly that.
Daniel G. J. Korte
Yes, we've got our lean team in there, quite regularly right now. They're looking at laying out the production -- relaying out the production flow. They're looking at some new ways to move product around the factory more efficiently, new ways to build the products. So as Cliff said, we're very, very early on in the low rate production phase of the program yet as it continues to ramp up. So we've got opportunities to rip out more cost and make it even more profitable.

Operator
Our next question or comment comes from the line of Bill Hoffmann from RBC Capital Markets.
William Hoffmann - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
Dan, I wondered if you could help us a little bit as we look forward with the Embraer and Mitsubishi ramp up over the next couple of quarters. And then you also mentioned getting some additional aftermarket business. Just wondering if you can help us quantify that and how we should think about that going forward?
Daniel G. J. Korte
The MRJ and Embraer programs although they both had their rollout here in the last couple of months, I mean, those programs don't really start to ramp up for another year or so. So they're there in the test phase of the program. We're doing some low rate production just to support the program right now, but nothing is happening in the production phase in 2015. But the programs are out there, it look like they're going to be successful. We've seen some on the MRJ side. I think it had some good progress on the order book, which is encouraging to me. And these are quite frankly, our first 2 major design build programs, where we did the designs, we kind of owned the intellectual property in the design. So it's a -- and we used our engineering workforce, the engineering services workforce to do that work. So it's a, I think there's some -- we're kind of happy with the progress that we're making on them at this point. We got to get them through the test phase though, and there's always some risk in that phase of the program. But we hope to see them up in production in the next year or 2. Your Second path of your question, I believe did I miss it.
William Hoffmann - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
The aftermarket business, you talked about 1, you've gone from opportunity there, but 2, just wondering for the scale of what we might think about for that?
Daniel G. J. Korte
The aftermarket business is part of the -- our Engineering Services business. If you go back, it's really the TASS organization that was acquired years ago. They do a number of -- they've got a broad range of customers and everybody from the U.S. Navy to other aerospace customers that they support Southwest Airlines et cetera. That business, it hasn't been a -- I wouldn't call it meteoric growth, but it has been steady growth in that business. And customers like what we do, and continue to come back to us. I probably -- I'll probably hold off on the projection on where it's going until next quarter, when we try to put some guidance out there. Although out of the 2 sides of the -- if you just take the Engineering Services business, it's a bit easier to forecast the aftermarket business than it is the front-end design business, because some of that after market business is ongoing kind of recurring long-term relationships with our customers. So that'll help us with the volatility of those projections going forward.
William Hoffmann - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
And then, Cliff, just want -- you guys did a great job this quarter on working capital management, just any thoughts on incremental opportunity there? Are you getting to a point where you're in better shape going forward?
Clifford C. Stebe
I still think there is opportunity there, Bill, I think, there is still somethings we can do. I think, inventory is probably the biggest opportunity there. But certainly, we're going to -- we've got some further opportunity to pressurize payables, might even be able to do a little bit on -- still on accounts receivable. So I think all in all, there's certainly some dollars to go get there and we're pushing the team very hard again. We push the team harder this quarter. We know, we still have work to do. Just like the cost reductions Dan mentioned. There's more to be done.

Daniel G. J. Korte
Yes, though we -- I mean, probably just an interesting aside, but we have weekly cost-reduction meetings, we have weekly working capital meetings with all the key team members to go drive these things down. I mean, it is a key initiative that we're going to drive and continue to drive.

Our next question or comment comes from the line of Ian Gilbertson from Invesco.
Ian Gilbertson
Already touched on all my questions.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] I'm showing no additional audio questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Korte for any closing remarks.
Daniel G. J. Korte
Thanks, Howard. Let me just close by saying that we're very excited about the progress we've made in such a short period of time. But this is just a starting point for LMI. We know, we can and must do more, much more. And we're taking the necessary steps as we refine our long-term strategic plan. We believe that execution in the key areas I discussed earlier, will exceed our customer's expectations and position the company to achieve continued growth and success in the years to come. My personal thanks to the LMI team, as they continue to excel in providing significant value to the important customers we serve. And my thanks to LMI shareholders for their enduring patience and interest in the future of our company. Thank you.
