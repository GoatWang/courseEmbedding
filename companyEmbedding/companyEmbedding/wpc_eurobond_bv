MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY
"Since the start of 2016, we have accomplished several important objectives: transitioning toward higher-quality revenue streams, implementing sustainable expense reductions, enhancing the quality of our real estate portfolio, and continuing to strengthen and add flexibility to our balance sheet," said Mark J. DeCesaris, Chief Executive Officer of W. P. Carey. "Furthermore, I am pleased to report that we increased AFFO per diluted share to $5.12 for 2016 and expect to generate between $5.10 and $5.30 for 2017.
"From an operational standpoint, we continued to move our revenue mix away from one-time structuring revenues and towards recurring lease revenues and asset management fees. We also improved efficiency throughout the company, implementing a sustainable 20% reduction in G&A expenses.
"We remained focused on proactive asset management, improving asset criticality within the portfolio and extending its weighted-average lease term, both of which we believe will enhance long-term value. Our recent bond issuances and the extension of our credit facility increased our weighted-average debt maturity, while lowering interest expense and enabling us to grow our unencumbered asset pool."
 
QUARTERLY FINANCIAL RESULTS
Revenues
Total Company: Revenues excluding reimbursable costs (net revenues) for the 2016 fourth quarter totaled $202.5 million, down 12.9% from $232.4 million for the 2015 fourth quarter, due primarily to lower net revenues from Owned Real Estate.    
Owned Real Estate: Owned Real Estate revenues excluding reimbursable tenant costs (net revenues from Owned Real Estate) for the 2016 fourth quarter were $165.3 million, down 14.0% from $192.2 million for the 2015 fourth quarter, due primarily to $15.0 million of lease termination income recognized during the prior-year period related to a property held for sale as of December 31, 2015 and sold during the first quarter of 2016, and lower lease revenues resulting from planned dispositions.    
Investment Management: Investment Management revenues excluding reimbursable costs (net revenues from Investment Management) for the 2016 fourth quarter were $37.2 million, down 7.5% from $40.2 million for the 2015 fourth quarter, due primarily to lower structuring revenues resulting from a combination of lower investment activity on behalf of the Managed Programs overall and a lower proportion of investments on behalf of the CPA®REITs (which earn a higher structuring fee rate than that of the other Managed Programs), partly offset by higher asset management revenues as a result of growth in assets under management.Net Income Attributable to W. P. Carey
Net income attributable to W. P. Carey for the 2016 fourth quarter was $47.7 million, down 6.5% compared to $51.0 million for the 2015 fourth quarter, due primarily to lower net revenues and a reversal of reserves for foreign real estate transfer taxes during the prior-year period, partly offset by a lower provision for income taxes, an allowance for credit losses recorded during the prior-year period and lower interest expense.Adjusted Funds from Operations (AFFO)
AFFO for the 2016 fourth quarter was $1.22 per diluted share, down 3.9% from $1.27 per diluted share for the 2015 fourth quarter, due primarily to (i) lower lease revenues resulting from planned dispositions; and (ii) lower structuring revenues, partly offset by (i) higher asset management fees and distributions of available cash from the Company's interests in the operating partnerships of the Managed Programs resulting from growth in assets under management; and (ii) lower interest expense resulting from a lower weighted-average interest rate on the Company's debt.    
Note: Further information concerning AFFO, a non-GAAP supplemental performance metric, is presented in the accompanying tables and related notes.Dividend
As previously announced, on December 7, 2016, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.99 per share, equivalent to an annualized dividend rate of $3.96 per share. The dividend was paid on January 13, 2017 to stockholders of record as of December 30, 2016. 
FULL YEAR FINANCIAL RESULTS
Revenues
Total Company: Net revenues for the 2016 full year totaled $849.7 million, down 1.2% from $859.7 million for the 2015 full year, due primarily to lower net revenues from Investment Management, partly offset by higher net revenues from Owned Real Estate.    
Owned Real Estate: Net revenues from Owned Real Estate for the 2016 full year totaled $729.9 million, up 2.4% from $712.6 million for the 2015 full year, due primarily to higher lease termination income resulting from the disposition of a property during the first quarter of 2016 and higher lease revenues as a result of real estate acquisitions.    
Investment Management: Net revenues from Investment Management for the 2016 full year totaled $119.7 million, down 18.6% from $147.1 million for the 2015 full year, due primarily to lower structuring revenues resulting from a combination of lower investment activity on behalf of the Managed Programs and a lower proportion of investments on behalf of the CPA®REITs (which earn a higher structuring fee rate than that of the other Managed Programs), partly offset by higher asset management revenues as a result of growth in assets under management.Net Income Attributable to W. P. Carey
Net income attributable to W. P. Carey for the 2016 full year totaled $267.7 million, up 55.4% compared to $172.3 million for the 2015 full year, due primarily to a $71.3 million aggregate gain on sale of real estate recognized in 2016, a lower provision for income taxes, lower general and administrative expenses and lower interest expense, partly offset by higher impairment charges, a reversal of reserves for foreign real estate transfer taxes during 2015 and lower net revenues. 
AFFO
AFFO for the 2016 full year totaled $5.12 per diluted share, up 2.6% compared to $4.99 per diluted share for the 2015 full year, due primarily to (i) lower general and administrative expenses resulting from cost reduction initiatives implemented in 2016; (ii) higher asset management fees and distributions of available cash from the Company's interests in the operating partnerships of the Managed Programs as a result of growth in assets under management; and (iii) lower interest expense resulting from a lower weighted-average interest rate on the Company's debt, partly offset by lower structuring revenues.Dividends
Dividends declared during 2016 totaled $3.93 per share, an increase of 2.6% compared to total dividends declared during 2015 of $3.83 per share. 
AFFO GUIDANCE
For the 2017 full year, the Company expects to report AFFO of between $5.10 and $5.30 per diluted share, based on the following key assumptions: (i)   acquisitions for the Company's Owned Real Estate portfolio of between $450 million and $650 million;
(ii)   dispositions from the Company's Owned Real Estate portfolio of between $350 million and $550 million;
(iii)  acquisitions on behalf of the CPA­®REITs of between $300 million and $500 million; and

__________



(a)  


Comprised of revenues of $7.1 million from two hotels for the three months ended December 31, 2016; and revenues of $30.7 million from two hotels and $0.1 million from one self-storage facility for the year ended December 31, 2016. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, we sold our remaining self-storage facility.


(b) 


Amounts for the three months and year ended December 31, 2015 include $15.0 million of lease termination income related to a property classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2015 and sold during the three months ended March 31, 2016. Amount for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes $32.2 million of lease termination income related to the property.


(c) 


We earn investment management revenue from CWI 1 and CWI 2 in our role as their advisor. Pursuant to the terms of their subadvisory agreements, however, 20% of the fees we receive from CWI 1 and 25% of the fees we receive from CWI 2 are paid to their respective subadvisors. In connection with the acquisitions of multi-family properties on behalf of CPA®:18 – Global, we entered into agreements with third-party advisors for the day-to-day management of the properties for which we pay 30% of the initial acquisition fees and 100% of asset management fees paid to us by CPA®:18 – Global.


(d)  


Amount for the three months ended December 31, 2015 includes expenses related to our formal strategic review of $4.5 million. Amounts for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 include expenses related to our formal strategic review of $5.2 million and $5.7 million, respectively.


(e) 


Amounts for the three months and year ended December 31, 2015 include a reversal of $25.0 million of reserves for German real estate transfer taxes, of which $7.9 million was previously recorded as merger expenses in connection with our merger with one of our managed funds, CPA®:15, or the CPA®:15 Merger, in September 2012 and $17.1 million was previously recorded in connection with the restructuring of a German investment, Hellweg 2, in October 2013. At the time of the restructuring, we owned an equity interest in the Hellweg 2 investment, which we jointly owned with CPA®:16 – Global. In connection with our merger with another one of our managed funds, CPA®:16 – Global, or the CPA®:16 Merger, in January 2014, we acquired CPA®:16 – Global's controlling interest in the investment. Therefore, the reversal related to the Hellweg 2 investment has been recorded in Property acquisition and other expenses in the consolidated financial statements for the three months and year ended December 31, 2015, since we now consolidate the Hellweg 2 investment.


(f) 


Amount represents restructuring and other compensation-related expenses resulting from a reduction in headcount and employee severance arrangements.

Non-GAAP Financial Disclosure
Due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, as discussed below, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc., or NAREIT, an industry trade group, has promulgated a non-GAAP measure known as FFO, which we believe to be an appropriate supplemental measure, when used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP, to reflect the operating performance of a REIT. The use of FFO is recommended by the REIT industry as a supplemental non-GAAP measure. FFO is not equivalent to nor a substitute for net income or loss as determined under GAAP.
We define FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the standards established by the White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, as revised in February 2004. The White Paper defines FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of property, impairment charges on real estate, and depreciation and amortization from real estate assets; and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and jointly owned investments. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and jointly owned investments are calculated to reflect FFO. Our FFO calculation complies with NAREIT's policy described above.
We modify the NAREIT computation of FFO to include other adjustments to GAAP net income to adjust for certain non-cash charges such as amortization of real estate-related intangibles, deferred income tax benefits and expenses, straight-line rents, stock compensation, gains or losses from extinguishment of debt and deconsolidation of subsidiaries, and unrealized foreign currency exchange gains and losses. Our assessment of our operations is focused on long-term sustainability and not on such non-cash items, which may cause short-term fluctuations in net income but have no impact on cash flows. Additionally, we exclude non-core income and expenses such as property acquisition and other expenses, which includes costs recorded related to the restructuring of Hellweg 2, the reversal of liabilities for German real estate transfer taxes that were previously recorded in connection with the CPA®:15 Merger, and our formal strategic review, certain lease termination income, and expenses related to restructuring and other compensation-related expenses resulting from a reduction in headcount and employee severance arrangements. We also exclude realized gains/losses on foreign exchange transactions (other than those realized on the settlement of foreign currency derivatives), which are not considered fundamental attributes of our business plan and do not affect our overall long-term operating performance. We refer to our modified definition of FFO as AFFO. We exclude these items from GAAP net income to arrive at AFFO as they are not the primary drivers in our decision making process and excluding these items provides investors a view of our portfolio performance over time and makes it more comparable to other REITs which are currently not engaged in acquisitions, mergers and restructuring which are not part of our normal business operations. We use AFFO as one measure of our operating performance when we formulate corporate goals, evaluate the effectiveness of our strategies, and determine executive compensation.
We believe that AFFO is a useful supplemental measure for investors to consider as we believe it will help them to better assess the sustainability of our operating performance without the potentially distorting impact of these short-term fluctuations. However, there are limits on the usefulness of AFFO to investors. For example, impairment charges and unrealized foreign currency losses that we exclude may become actual realized losses upon the ultimate disposition of the properties in the form of lower cash proceeds or other considerations. We use our FFO and AFFO measures as supplemental financial measures of operating performance. We do not use our FFO and AFFO measures as, nor should they be considered to be, alternatives to net earnings computed under GAAP or as alternatives to cash from operating activities computed under GAAP or as indicators of our ability to fund our cash needs.

Default:
 

(a)                                
The Issuer or the Guarantor, as
applicable, shall, not later than 10:00 am (London time) on
the Business Day prior to which any payment in respect of the Notes
becomes due, pay to such account of the Paying Agent as the Paying

in respect of the Notes, an amount sufficient (together with any
funds then held by the Paying Agent and available for the purpose)
to pay all principal and interest and/or other amounts referred to
in Section 1001 of the Base Indenture and Section 302 and
Section 303 of the Supplemental Indenture due in respect of

The Issuer hereby authorises and
directs the Paying Agent from funds so paid to the Paying Agent to
make payment of all amounts due on the Notes in accordance with the
terms of the Notes, the Indenture and the provisions of this
Agreement. If any payment provided for in clause 5(a) is after

pursuant to clause 5(a), received the full amount payable in
respect thereof on such date but receives such full amount later,
together with accrued interest (if any) in accordance with the
Indenture, it shall forthwith so notify the Issuer, the Guarantor
and the Trustee. Unless and until the full amount of any such
principal or interest payment has been made to it, the Paying Agent
shall not be bound to make such payments.
 

(d)                                
Without prejudice to
clause 5(b), if the Paying Agent pays out on or after the due
date therefor (other than as a result of its own gross negligence
or wilful misconduct) to persons entitled thereto, or becomes
liable to pay out, any amounts on the assumption (which is not
negated by reasonable evidence to the contrary) that the
corresponding payment by the Issuer or the Guarantor, as
applicable, has been or shall be made, the Issuer or the Guarantor,
as applicable, shall on demand reimburse the Paying Agent for the
relevant amount, and pay interest to the Paying Agent on such
amount from (and including) the date on which it is paid out to
(but excluding) the date of reimbursement at the rate per annum
equal to the cost to the Paying Agent of funding the amount paid
out, as certified by the Paying Agent and expressed as a rate per
annum.
 

(e)                                 
Payment of only part of the amount
payable in respect of a Note may only be made at the discretion of
the relevant Noteholder(s) (except as the result of a
withholding or deduction for or on account of any taxes permitted
by the Indenture). If at any time a Paying Agent makes a partial
payment in respect of any Note presented to it, it shall inform the
Registrar of the same such that the Registrar may record the same
on the register of Notes.
 

6.                                     
REPAYMENT
 

Any sums paid by, or by arrangement
with the Issuer, to the Paying Agent pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement shall not be required to be repaid to the Issuer or the
Guarantor unless and until the Notes in respect of which such sums
were paid shall have been purchased or redeemed pursuant to the
terms of the Indenture and cancelled, but in any of these events
the Paying Agent shall (provided that all other amounts due under
this Agreement shall have been duly paid) upon written request by
the Issuer forthwith repay to the Issuer or the Guarantor, as
applicable, sums equivalent to the amounts which would otherwise
have been payable on the relevant Notes together with any fees
previously paid to the Paying Agent in respect of such Notes.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Paying Agent shall not be
obliged to make any repayment to the Issuer or the Guarantor, as
applicable, so long as any amounts which under this Agreement
should have been paid to or to the order of the Paying Agent by the
Issuer or the Guarantor, as applicable, shall remain unpaid. The
Paying Agent shall not, however, be otherwise required or entitled
to repay any sums properly received by it under this
Agreement.

it becomes aware of such requirement and shall give to the Paying
Agent such information as the Paying Agent requires to enable it to
make such deduction or withholding; and
 

(d)                                
except where such requirement arises
as a result of prepayment of the Notes in accordance with the
Indenture or by virtue of the relevant holder failing to satisfy
any certification or other requirement in respect of its Notes, the
Paying Agent shall give notice thereof to the Issuer, the Guarantor
and the Trustee as soon as it becomes aware of the requirement to
withhold or deduct.

MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY
"For the 2017 first quarter, we generated AFFO per diluted share of $1.25, which reflects a number of the proactive steps we took over the last year, including planned real estate dispositions, financing activities that lowered our overall cost of debt and our focus on operational efficiency," said Mark J. DeCesaris, Chief Executive Officer of W. P. Carey. "We also raised our quarterly cash dividend to 99.5 cents per share, while maintaining a conservative payout ratio. As has been the case since we converted to a REIT in 2012, the vast majority of the earnings that support our dividend were generated through our core competency of net lease investing for our Owned Real Estate portfolio."
QUARTERLY FINANCIAL RESULTS
Revenues

Total Company: Revenues excluding reimbursable costs (net revenues) for the 2017 first quarter totaled $188.1 million, down 23.0% from $244.2 million for the 2016 first quarter, due primarily to lower net revenues from Owned Real Estate.                         
Owned Real Estate: Owned Real Estate revenues excluding reimbursable tenant costs (net revenues from Owned Real Estate) for the 2017 first quarter were $163.5 million, down 23.8% from $214.7 million for the 2016 first quarter, due primarily to $32.2 million of lease termination income recognized during the prior-year period related to a property sold during that period and lower lease revenues resulting from planned dispositions, partly offset by lease revenues from properties acquired during 2016.                       
Investment Management: Investment Management revenues excluding reimbursable costs (net revenues from Investment Management) for the 2017 first quarter were $24.6 million, down 16.6% from $29.5 million for the 2016 first quarter, due primarily to lower structuring revenues resulting from lower investment activity on behalf of the Managed Programs, partly offset by higher asset management fees as a result of growth in assets under management.

Net Income Attributable to W. P. Carey

Net income attributable to W. P. Carey for the 2017 first quarter was $57.5 million, up 0.2% compared to $57.4 million for the 2016 first quarter, due primarily to lower depreciation and amortization resulting from planned dispositions, restructuring and other compensation expenses recognized during the prior-year period, an allowance for credit losses recorded during the prior-year period, lower interest expense and expenses related to our formal strategic review (which was completed in May 2016) recognized during the prior-year period, partly offset by lower net revenues.

Adjusted Funds from Operations (AFFO)

AFFO for the 2017 first quarter was $1.25 per diluted share, down 4.6% from $1.31 per diluted share for the 2016 first quarter, due primarily to (i) lower structuring revenues; (ii) lease termination income recognized during the prior-year period related to a property sold during that period; and (iii) lower lease revenues resulting from planned dispositions. These factors were partly offset by (i) lower interest expense, due primarily to a lower weighted-average interest rate on the Company's debt; (ii) lower general and administrative expenses; and (iii) higher asset management fees.                                      
Note: Further information concerning AFFO, a non-GAAP supplemental performance metric, is presented in the accompanying tables and related notes.

Dividend

As previously announced, on March 16, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.9950 per share, equivalent to an annualized dividend rate of $3.98 per share. The dividend was paid on April 17, 2017 to stockholders of record as of March 31, 2017.

For the 2017 full year, the Company affirms that it expects to report AFFO of between $5.10 and $5.30 per diluted share, based on the following key assumptions:                             (i)   acquisitions for the Company's Owned Real Estate portfolio of between $450 million and $650 million;                      (ii)   dispositions from the Company's Owned Real Estate portfolio of between $350 million and $550 million;                        (iii)  acquisitions on behalf of the CPA® REITs of between $300 million and $500 million; and                       (iv)  acquisitions on behalf of other Managed Programs of between $400 million and $700 million.

BALANCE SHEET AND CAPITALIZATION
Euro-Denominated Bond Issuance

As previously announced, on January 19, 2017, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of €500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.250% Senior Notes due July 19, 2024, issued by its wholly owned subsidiary, WPC Eurobond B.V., and guaranteed by W. P. Carey Inc. The Company used the net proceeds from this offering to reduce amounts outstanding under its senior unsecured credit facility.

Senior Unsecured Credit Facility

As previously announced, on February 22, 2017, the Company amended and restated its senior unsecured credit facility, increasing the capacity under the facility to $1.85 billion. The facility is comprised of a $1.5 billion revolving line of credit maturing in four years with two six-month extension options, a €236.3 million ($250.0 million equivalent) term loan maturing in five years and a $100.0 million delayed draw term loan also maturing in five years.

 (a) 
 FFO and AFFO are non-GAAP measures. See below for a description of FFO and AFFO. 


 (b) 
 Amount for the three months ended March 31, 2016 includes an adjustment of $15.6 million due to the acceleration of a below-market lease from a tenant of a domestic property that was sold during that period. 


 (c) 
 Amount for the three months ended March 31, 2016 includes an adjustment to exclude $27.2 million of the $32.2 million of lease termination income recognized in connection with a domestic property that was sold during that period, as such amount was determined to be non-core income.

 (e) 
 Effective July 1, 2016, the amortization of debt premiums and discounts, which was previously included in Other amortization and non-cash items, is included in Amortization of deferred financing costs. Prior periods are retrospectively adjusted to reflect this change. Amortization of debt premiums and discounts for the three months ended March 31, 2016 was $0.6 million. 


 (f) 
 Amount for the three months ended March 31, 2016 includes expenses related to our formal strategic review, which was completed in May 2016, of $5.5 million. 


 (g)

Non-GAAP Financial Disclosure
Due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, as discussed below, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc., or NAREIT, an industry trade group, has promulgated a non-GAAP measure known as FFO, which we believe to be an appropriate supplemental measure, when used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP, to reflect the operating performance of a REIT. The use of FFO is recommended by the REIT industry as a supplemental non-GAAP measure. FFO is not equivalent to nor a substitute for net income or loss as determined under GAAP.
We define FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the standards established by the White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, as revised in February 2004. The White Paper defines FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of property, impairment charges on real estate, and depreciation and amortization from real estate assets; and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and jointly owned investments. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and jointly owned investments are calculated to reflect FFO. Our FFO calculation complies with NAREIT's policy described above.
We modify the NAREIT computation of FFO to include other adjustments to GAAP net income to adjust for certain non-cash charges such as amortization of real estate-related intangibles, deferred income tax benefits and expenses, straight-line rents, stock compensation, gains or losses from extinguishment of debt and deconsolidation of subsidiaries, and unrealized foreign currency exchange gains and losses. Our assessment of our operations is focused on long-term sustainability and not on such non-cash items, which may cause short-term fluctuations in net income but have no impact on cash flows. Additionally, we exclude non-core income and expenses such as property acquisition and other expenses (which includes expenses related to the formal strategic review that we completed in May 2016), certain lease termination income, and expenses related to restructuring and other compensation-related expenses resulting from a reduction in headcount and employee severance arrangements during the three months ended March 31, 2016. We also exclude realized gains/losses on foreign exchange transactions (other than those realized on the settlement of foreign currency derivatives), which are not considered fundamental attributes of our business plan and do not affect our overall long-term operating performance. We refer to our modified definition of FFO as AFFO. We exclude these items from GAAP net income to arrive at AFFO as they are not the primary drivers in our decision making process and excluding these items provides investors a view of our portfolio performance over time and makes it more comparable to other REITs which are currently not engaged in acquisitions, mergers and restructuring which are not part of our normal business operations. We use AFFO as one measure of our operating performance when we formulate corporate goals, evaluate the effectiveness of our strategies, and determine executive compensation.
We believe that AFFO is a useful supplemental measure for investors to consider as we believe it will help them to better assess the sustainability of our operating performance without the potentially distorting impact of these short-term fluctuations. However, there are limits on the usefulness of AFFO to investors. For example, impairment charges and unrealized foreign currency losses that we exclude may become actual realized losses upon the ultimate disposition of the properties in the form of lower cash proceeds or other considerations. We use our FFO and AFFO measures as supplemental financial measures of operating performance. We do not use our FFO and AFFO measures as, nor should they be considered to be, alternatives to net earnings computed under GAAP or as alternatives to cash from operating activities computed under GAAP or as indicators of our ability to fund our cash needs.

7

any other Debt  of the Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries
since the first day of such four consecutive fiscal quarterly 
period had occurred on the first day of such period (except that,
in making this computation, the amount of Debt under any revolving
credit facility, line of credit or similar facility shall be
computed based upon the average daily balance of such Debt during
such period); and (3) in the case of any acquisition or
disposition by the Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries of any
asset or group of assets with a fair market value in excess of $1.0
million since the first day of such four consecutive fiscal
quarterly period, whether by merger, stock purchase or sale or
asset purchase or sale or otherwise, such acquisition or
disposition had occurred as of the first day of such period with
the appropriate adjustments with respect to such acquisition or
disposition being included in such pro forma
calculation.
 

If the Debt giving rise to the need
to make the calculation described above or any other Debt incurred
after the first day of the relevant four-quarter period bears
interest at a floating rate, then, for purposes of calculating the
Annual Debt Service Charge, the interest rate on such Debt shall be
computed on a pro forma basis by applying the average daily rate
which would

four consecutive fiscal quarterly period to the greater of the
amount of such Debt outstanding at the end of such period or the
average amount of such Debt outstanding during such
period.

Maintenance of Unencumbered Asset Value . The Guarantor
shall not have at any time Total Unencumbered Asset Value of less
than 150% of the aggregate principal amount of all of its and its
Subsidiaries’ outstanding Unsecured Debt (determined on

variations as are required or permitted by or pursuant to Original
Indenture or this First Supplemental Indenture and may have such
letters, numbers or other marks of identification and such legends
or endorsements placed thereon as may, consistently with the
Original Indenture, be determined by the officer of the Company
executing the Notes as evidenced by the execution of the Notes.
Each Note shall be dated the date of its authentication or, if
later (in the case of Notes issued in fully-registered global form
pursuant to Section 301(1)), effectuation. The Notes and any
beneficial interest in the Notes shall be in minimum denominations
of €100,000 and integral multiple of €1,000 in excess
thereof.
 

The terms and notations contained in
the Notes shall constitute, and are hereby expressly made, a part
of the Original Indenture as supplemented by this First
Supplemental Indenture; and the Company, the Guarantor and the
Trustee, by their execution and delivery of this First Supplemental
Indenture, expressly agree to such terms and provisions and to be
bound thereby; provided, that, to the extent of any inconsistency
between the terms and provisions in the Original Indenture, as
supplemented by this First Supplemental Indenture, and those
contained in the Notes, the Notes shall govern.

Global Notes . The Notes designated herein shall be issued
initially in the form of one or more fully-registered permanent
global Securities (the “ Global Notes ” and
each, a “ Global Note ”) without coupons, kept
by the CSK, as common safe-keeper for the Clearing Systems, in
accordance with applicable safekeeping procedures.
 

It is intended that the Notes, while
represented by one or more Global Notes, shall be recognized as
eligible collateral for Eurosystem monetary policy and intra-day
credit

reasonable best efforts to maintain and satisfy any requirements
for such Eurosystem collateral eligibility.
 

(2)          
Book-Entry Provisions . This Section 301(2) shall
apply only to the Global Notes kept by the CSK in accordance with
applicable safekeeping procedures.
 

The Company shall execute and the
Trustee shall, in accordance with this Section 301(2),
authenticate and the CSK shall effectuate the Notes as herein
provided. The aggregate principal amount of the Global Note may
from time to time be increased or decreased by adjustments made on
the Note Register.
 

Members of, or participants in, the
Clearing Systems (“ Agent Members ”) shall have
no rights under the Indenture with respect to any Global Note held
on their behalf by the Clearing Systems or by the CSK as common
safe-keeper for the Clearing Systems or under such Global Note, and
the nominee of the CSK may be treated by the Company, the
Guarantor, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Paying Agent, and any
respective agent of the Company, the Guarantor, the Trustee, the
Registrar or the Paying Agent, as applicable, as the absolute owner
and Holder of such Global Note for all purposes whatsoever.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent the
Company, the Guarantor, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Paying
Agent or any respective agent of the Company, the Guarantor, the
Trustee, the Registrar or the Paying Agent, as applicable, from

beneficial interests in Global Notes shall not be entitled to
receive Certificated Notes (as defined below). If required to do so
pursuant to any applicable law or regulation, owners of a
beneficial interest in the Notes may obtain Certificated Notes in
exchange for their beneficial interests in a Global Note upon
written request in accordance with the Clearing Systems’ and
the Registrar’s procedures.
 

The Global Note shall be exchanged
for one or more Notes in definitive, fully registered certificated
form, without coupons (the “ Certificated Notes
”), if (i) the Company has been notified that the
Clearing Systems (or any additional or alternative clearing system

and the Paying Agent on behalf of which the Global Note may be
held) has been closed for business for a continuous period of 14
days (other than by reason of holidays, statutory or otherwise) or
has announced an intention permanently to cease business or does in
fact do so or (ii) an Event of Default in respect of the Notes
has occurred and is continuing and the Registrar has received a
request from the Clearing Systems.
 

Upon surrender by a Clearing System
of the Global Note, Certificated Notes shall be issued to each
person that the Clearing System identifies as the beneficial owner
of the Notes represented by the Global Note. Upon the issuance of
Certificated Notes, the
 
10 





 

Registrar is required to register
the Certificated Notes in the name of that person or persons, or
their nominee, and cause the Certificated Notes to be delivered
thereto.
 

In connection with the exchange of a
Certificated Note, or a portion thereof, for a beneficial interest
in a Global Note, the Trustee shall cancel such Certificated Note,
or portion thereof, and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee
shall authenticate and deliver, to the transferring Holder a new
Certificated Note representing the principal amount not so
transferred.

the CSK, its successors and their respective nominees. Interests of
beneficial owners in a Global Note shall be transferred in
accordance with the rules and procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream.
 

(5)

on the face thereof:

Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

If an individual or company (''agent'') agrees to act upon behalf of another organization or person (''the principal''), then an agency agreement is typically used. This document gives the agent the authority to act in the principal's interests. It also covers the nature of the relationship between the two parties, including information on when the agency agreement is terminated and responsibilities of the agent, plus compensation for the action.

Additional information that may be present in the document can include territory the agent may represent, trademark information, insurance protection and indemnification. If the agent were to incur expenses while acting as an agent, the agreement typically includes how they should be handled and other terms. Other topics one may include in the document are terms concerning records, taxes, warranties and state of governing law.

An agency agreement is a document that clearly states and defines the relationship between the parties, and protects both of their interests. Without drawing up the agreement, the agent may not be aware of the scope of their abilities. It is often used in the medical field, such as between a drug representative and the medication manufacturer.
