 Fir Tree Portfolio Company Quotes on Positive Activism®






AES Corporation (AES: NYSE)



	
						                            "I have always appreciated Fir Tree's thoughtful advice, which we took into consideration when we adopted a new capital allocation strategy when I was named CEO of the AES Corporation in September of 2011."
								                
Andres Gluski, President and CEO






Capmark Financial Group Inc. (CPMK: OTC US)



	
						                            “The Fir Tree team has been a value-add creditor.  They participated in numerous settlement negotiations throughout the restructuring process which facilitated the company’s success post emergence.”
								                
Bill Gallagher,  President and CEO






CIT Group Inc. (CIT: NYSE)



	
						                            "Fir Tree was a constructive voice in a complex and challenging restructuring."
								                
Jeffrey Peek, former Chief Executive Officer






Echelon International Corp (formerly EIN: NYSE)




"Fir Tree asked if I would serve on the board to Echelon, a real estate development company located in Florida. Working with management, substantial value was created and the company was sold profitably to a third-party."
Stephen Blank, former Fir Tree representative to Echelon Board of Directors






Encore Acquisition Co. (formerly EAC: NASDAQ)



	
						                            "Owning nearly 10% of Encore Acquisition at the time, Fir Tree supported us on a number of strategic fronts including a shareholder repurchase plan and MLP formation for our long lived assets that created tremendous shareholder value." 
								                
Jonny Brumley,  Chief Executive Officer






FGIC Corporation



	
						                            "Fir Tree led the ad hoc  group of investors in FGIC insured bonds through an innovative restructuring over the last three years that will likely serve as a blueprint for the industry going forward.  The rehabilitation plan was a 'win-win' for all parties and Fir Tree was a valued partner to our management team."
								                
John S. Dubel, Chief Executive Officer






Lehman Brothers (formerly LEH: NYSE)



	
						                            Fir Tree helped design and lead an innovative board design and selection process for what is now the largest bankruptcy in history. Incentives were put in place to align interests and empower the board to increase the overall value of the estate on an expedited basis. Fir Tree, a hedge-fund creditor that helped select the directors, said in statement that it tried to "attract best in class directors who will work to maximize value" for Lehman creditors. Fir Tree said it looked for people who are "highly respected in a range of critical areas, including real estate, derivatives, private equity and restructuring." Wall Street Journal, December 5, 2011 Lehman says its "active board" approach resembles a private equity board and says its new directors were recruited to work closely with the team that has been managing its still considerable real-estate holdings.…"Given the highly results-oriented nature of this compensation package, …I would say this is an eminently reasonable package and likely to deliver more value to debtors…," said Paul Hodgson, compensation expert at GMI Ratings. Dow Jones, March 19, 2012







Nextel Communications (formerly NXTL: NASDAQ)



	
						                            “Fir Tree approached Nextel with an inventive debt for equity swap that greatly improved our company’s financial strength."
								                
Dennis Weibling,  former Chief Executive Officer






Plains Exploration & Production Company (formerly PXP: NYSE)



	
						                            "As a large owner of our company in 2007, through a series of constructive dialogues, we worked with Fir Tree on a shareholder value creation program that was implemented following a large company acquisition."
								                
James Flores,  Chief Executive Officer






Powerhouse Technologies, Inc. (formerly PWRH: NASDAQ)



	
						                            "Fir Tree’s long term view and support of my management team was a critical component of our successful turnaround.  It was refreshing to have a major investor with both highly constructive ideas and a long term view."
								                
Richard Haddrill,  Chairman of the Board and former Chief Executive Officer






R.H. Donnelly Corp (formerly RHD: NYSE)



	
						                            "In 2000 I was appointed to the RH Donnelley board as Fir Tree’s representative.   At the time Donnelley was the largest yellow page business in the US and it had recently been spun  off from its parent company, Dun & Bradstreet.  This was a time when the Internet began to emerge as a game changing technological threat and so my focus for value creation centered on tech initiatives and ensuring that capital allocation was done to maximize shareholder value."
								                
Darius Gaskins, former Fir Tree representative to RH Donnelly Board of Directors






Rite Aid Corporation (RAD: NYSE)



	
						                            "I first met the Fir Tree team when they were large holders of Rite-Aid debt and they approached me with an innovative debt-for-equity swap proposal.  We ended up completing many debt-for-equity swaps with Fir Tree which both helped us deleverage and provided us with the financial flexibility to grow our business."
								                
Dave Jessick,  former Chief Financial Officer






Syncora Guarantee Inc. (SYCRF: OTC US)



	
						                            "We have worked with Fir Tree on a number of inventive restructuring transactions for us, and they have been a good partner.  They provided constructive support to our management team and were quick to commit large sums of capital to complex deals."
								                
Claude LeBlanc,  Chief Restructuring Officer 






The Official Information Company (formerly TCM: NYSE)



	
						                            “The principals at Fir Tree were instrumental partners in the growth and development of The Official Information Company.  Their smart and constructive advice helped us develop, finance and execute a growth plan that created five separate operating businesses which were later sold in multiple value-enhancing transactions on behalf of our shareholders.”
								                
Ian Thomas,  former Chief Executive Officer






W.P. Carey Inc. (WPC: NYSE)



	
						                            "Fir Tree's meaningful suggestions regarding our dividend policy and information disclosures were enormously helpful.  We believe they significantly enhanced shareholder value."
								                
Trevor Bond, Chief Executive Officer

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
