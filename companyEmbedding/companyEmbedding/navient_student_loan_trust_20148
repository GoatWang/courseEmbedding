Refinance student loans the new-fashioned way
BETTER RATES THROUGH BETTER DATA ANALYSIS



Our data-driven evaluation of your full financial profile gives us the ability to offer qualified borrowers lower, more personalized rates than traditional lenders can.
How it works












Why Refinance Student Loans


We’ve made saving money on student loans simple. When you refinance student loans, you get credit for the positive changes to your financial profile since you originally took out the loans. A student loan refinance is a good choice for people who have seen advances in their income, career, or credit score since they were in school.


Our data-driven evaluation of your full financial profile gives us the ability to offer qualified borrowers lower, more personalized rates than traditional lenders can. So whether you want to pay off your student faster or just reduce your student loan payments, we can help. Refinance your student loans and accelerate everything that life has to offer.



 



A refinancing experience built to save you time and money
QUICK & SIMPLE TO APPLY





2 MINS TO GET YOUR ESTIMATED RATE
By analyzing information beyond your credit score, we can quickly provide you a rate estimate. You will receive your final rate when your application to refinance has been approved.



LOAN APPLICATION
We look at data other lenders don’t, like savings, education, and earning potential. This helps us build a better picture of your full financial profile so that we can offer the fairest rates possible rates.



LOAN DECISION
If you’re approved to refinance student loans with Earnest, you can set your exact monthly payment and choose between a variable and fixed rate. How do we decide? Read our eligibility guide.



 




“To be able to pay off my student loans before their original term date and save so much on the life of the loan is huge.”
Noel True, NYU MFA – $85,900 Refinanced, $38,400 saved

Disclaimers




The average savings calculation is the sum of all projected savings divided by the number of clients included in the projected savings calculation. These calculations assume that clients’ interest rates will not change over time, that clients make all payments on-time, and that no loans will be prepaid.
Here’s what our math includes:

Projected savings for clients who provided outstanding balance, APR, and current monthly payment amount for their existing student loan(s)
Both fixed and variable rate loans

And here’s what our math excludes, and why:

Savings from any client who stated that the current interest rate on their loan was greater than 12%. (Why: this is intended to filter out any cases where client error may skew the savings calculation higher.)
For any client who stated that the projected term of their loan was greater than 25 years, we do not include in our calculation any additional savings that might be realized if their existing loan were to take longer than 25 years to pay off in-full. (Why: 25 years is the maximum term allowed for a Federal student loan, or the cap on any Federal student loan under Income Based Repayment.)
Savings from any client whose indicated monthly payment was not sufficient to pay down the loan balance over time. (Why: this is intended to filter out any cases where the client misstated either their monthly payment amount, interest rate, or both.)
All refinancings by clients who chose a longer term than their existing student loan. (Why: some clients choose longer loan terms to match their monthly loan obligations to their unique life circumstances; while we encourage clients to take advantage of Earnest’s flexible term and monthly payment features, these cases are not indicative of the savings that result from lower rates through better data.)



Explanation of Rates “With Autopay”
Rates shown include 0.25% APR reduction where client agrees to make monthly principal and interest payments by automatic electronic payment. Use of autopay is not required to receive an Earnest loan.


Explanation of Precision Pricing™ Savings
Savings calculations are based on refinancing $121,825 in student loans at an existing loan servicer’s interest rate of 7.5% fixed APR with 10 years, 6 months remaining on the loan term. The other lender’s savings and APR (light green line) represent what would happen if those loans were refinanced at the other lender’s best fixed APRs. The Earnest savings and APR (white line) represent refinancing those loans at Earnest’s best fixed APRs.
Savings is computed as the difference between the future scheduled payments on the existing loans and payments on new Earnest and “other lender” loans. The calculation assumes on-time loan payments, no change in interest rates, and no prepayment of loans.

Earnest



















            About Us          




We believe many financially responsible people aren’t getting the credit they deserve. That’s why we strive to eliminate unnecessary costs from the banking process and offer our clients the low rates they deserve.


WHY WE STARTED EARNEST


We believe the fundamental role of banks and lenders is to help people realize their hopes and dreams. But we realized the financial system had forgotten this primary purpose, instead serving to enrich a privileged few. So we started Earnest to restore the trust that is sorely missing from the current system, and to build a modern financial institution that actually delivers on making clients’ lives better.


Whatever your ambition, we help get you there. We do low-cost lending to financially responsible people, and allow them to customize their repayment plan to fit their needs. We want to help our clients take control of their finances and realize their dreams—and in doing so create a relationship with them that lasts a lifetime.


WHO WE ARE
We are a skilled team of design, math, finance, and technology geeks who noticed a lack of trust in the financial system and decided to do something about it. We created a company that combines data science, streamlined design, and exceptional service to bring people a fast, low-cost, and hyper-personalized financial experience. Our mission is to make credit more accessible by reducing the costs and barriers faced by millions of financially responsible people.

Disclaimers




The average savings calculation is the sum of all projected savings divided by the number of clients included in the projected savings calculation. These calculations assume that clients’ interest rates will not change over time, that clients make all payments on-time, and that no loans will be prepaid.
Here’s what our math includes:

Projected savings for clients who provided outstanding balance, APR, and current monthly payment amount for their existing student loan(s)
Both fixed and variable rate loans

And here’s what our math excludes, and why:

Savings from any client who stated that the current interest rate on their loan was greater than 12%. (Why: this is intended to filter out any cases where client error may skew the savings calculation higher.)
For any client who stated that the projected term of their loan was greater than 25 years, we do not include in our calculation any additional savings that might be realized if their existing loan were to take longer than 25 years to pay off in-full. (Why: 25 years is the maximum term allowed for a Federal student loan, or the cap on any Federal student loan under Income Based Repayment.)
Savings from any client whose indicated monthly payment was not sufficient to pay down the loan balance over time. (Why: this is intended to filter out any cases where the client misstated either their monthly payment amount, interest rate, or both.)
All refinancings by clients who chose a longer term than their existing student loan. (Why: some clients choose longer loan terms to match their monthly loan obligations to their unique life circumstances; while we encourage clients to take advantage of Earnest’s flexible term and monthly payment features, these cases are not indicative of the savings that result from lower rates through better data.)



Explanation of Rates “With Autopay”
Rates shown include 0.25% APR reduction where client agrees to make monthly principal and interest payments by automatic electronic payment. Use of autopay is not required to receive an Earnest loan.


Explanation of Precision Pricing™ Savings
Savings calculations are based on refinancing $121,825 in student loans at an existing loan servicer’s interest rate of 7.5% fixed APR with 10 years, 6 months remaining on the loan term. The other lender’s savings and APR (light green line) represent what would happen if those loans were refinanced at the other lender’s best fixed APRs. The Earnest savings and APR (white line) represent refinancing those loans at Earnest’s best fixed APRs.
Savings is computed as the difference between the future scheduled payments on the existing loans and payments on new Earnest and “other lender” loans. The calculation assumes on-time loan payments, no change in interest rates, and no prepayment of loans.

Interest-Only Repayment2
Partial Interest Repayment2
In-School Deferment2

0.25% for automatic loan payment withdrawal4
An additional 0.25% if your automatic payment is from a SunTrust account4
1% principal balance reduction upon graduation5

Cosigners are great
If someone with a good credit history is a cosigner, your Custom Choice Loan is more likely to be approved. It could be an eligible parent, guardian, or a friend.
In-school Refinance Option
With this new option, you can refinance existing private student loans into a new Custom Choice Loan.

Your new loan will give you the flexibility to select a repayment term and repayment option that is right for you now.
The process is easy  after approval this option will be presented  just list which loans you'd like to refinance.

        SunTrust Bank, Member FDIC. © 2017 SunTrust Banks, Inc.
        SunTrust and the Custom Choice Loan are federally registered service marks of SunTrust Banks, Inc.
        
        Certain restrictions and limitations may apply. SunTrust Bank reserves the right to change or discontinue these programs without notice. All loan programs are subject to approval and may not be available in certain jurisdictions.
SunTrust recommends comparing all aid alternatives including grants, scholarships, and both federal and private student loans. Compare SunTrust private student loans.

1 Any applicant who applies for the loan the month of, the month prior to, or the month after their graduation date, as stated on the application or certified by the school, will only be offered the immediate repayment option.
2 Making interest only payments while in school will not reduce the principal balance on the loan. Partial Interest Payment plan of $25 per month is available on loans of $5,000 or more; click here to see payment examples. For Partial Interest and Fully Deferred loans, any accrued and unpaid interest will be capitalized (added to your principal loan balance) when repayment of principal and interest begins. Payments may be deferred (a) while student is enrolled at least half-time at an approved school, and (b) during the 6 month grace period after graduation or dropping below half-time status, but the total initial deferment period, including the grace period, may not exceed 66 months from the first disbursement date. In any case, the initial deferment period may not exceed 66 months from the first disbursement date. There are no prepayment penalties.
3 The fixed interest rate assigned to a loan will never change except as required by law or if you request and qualify for the ACH reduction benefit(s).
4 Interest rate reductions offered for automatic payment from a bank account: 0.25% interest rate reduction for ACH payment from any bank account and an extra 0.25% interest rate reduction when ACH payments are made from a SunTrust Bank account. ACH interest rate reduction(s) only apply when full payments (including both principal and interest) are automatically drafted from a bank account. Interest rate reduction(s) will remain on the account unless (a) the automatic deduction of payments is stopped (including times during deferment or forbearance) or (b) there are three automatic deductions returned for insufficient funds within the life of the loan. The additional SunTrust Bank account ACH interest rate reduction will be applied after the first automatic payment is successfully deducted from a SunTrust Bank checking, savings or money market account and will be removed for the reasons stated above or if you close your SunTrust account. In the event the benefit(s) is removed, the interest rate stated in the Credit Agreement shall be applied in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.
5 The 1% principal reduction is based on the net disbursed loan amount, which is the total dollar amount of all disbursements made, excluding the dollar amount of any reductions, cancellations, or returns, as applicable. To receive the reward, the benefit must be requested from the servicer, and the student borrower must have earned a bachelor's degree or higher and proof of such graduation (e.g. copy of diploma, final transcript or letter on school letterhead) must be provided to the servicer. This reward is available once during the life of the loan, regardless of whether the student borrower receives more than one degree.

Review Frequently Asked Questions about the Custom Choice Loan
Call a SunTrust representative at 866-232-3889



Step one - Apply Online:

Students and cosigners, if applicable, apply online (they may apply at the same time or during separate sessions)
An Application and Solicitation Disclosure outlining current interest rate ranges, loan cost examples, federal student loan alternatives, and other general loan information is presented electronically to the student borrower and cosigner, if applicable

Step two - Consider the Option to Refinance Existing Private Student Loans into the New Loan:

The process is easy  after approval this option will be presented  just list which loans you'd like to refinance
Learn more about the In-School Refinance Option

Step three - Loan Options:

Upon passing the initial credit review16, loan options (including interest rates, repayment plans and repayment terms) are presented online

Step four - Loan Documentation:

Once loan options are selected, a list of required documentation is presented
Required documentation must be submitted before the loan process will continue
Documentation can be uploaded online or submitted by fax or mail

Step five - Loan Packet (Approval Disclosure, Credit Agreement, etc):

After all required documentation has been received and approved, a Loan Packet will be sent outlining the terms of the loan based on the preliminary loan amount before school certification and, for applicants opting to refinance existing student loans1, the payoff amounts provided by the student
The Loan Packet, including the Approval Disclosure, must be accepted within 30 calendar days if the student and, if applicable, the cosigner, agree to the loan terms
Acceptance of this can be given through the applicant's online account, by fax or by mail

Step six - School Certification:

Certification of the loan is required by the student's school of attendance and will be requested by SunTrust
The school will certify the loan ensuring that the student is enrolled at least half time, that the loan amount is correct, and will confirm disbursement specifications

Step seven - Final Disclosure:

After school certification is received, the final loan terms will be outlined in a Final Disclosure which will be mailed to both the student borrower and cosigner, if applicable; for convenience, the Final Disclosure is also available online
3 Day rescission period  the student borrower and cosigner, if applicable, will have three business days to cancel or rescind the loan
					
SunTrust must wait until this three business day period has expired before disbursement of funds can take place
No action is required by the borrower and cosigner, if applicable, unless either desires to cancel or rescind the loan



Step eight - Loan Disbursement:

Funds for the upcoming semester/academic period

Amounts and timing of when a loan is disbursed is given to SunTrust by the school
A loan may have up to four disbursements and disbursement amounts do not have to be equal
Funds are sent to the school and applied to the student's account; any overage of funds above/beyond what is owed to the school is handled between the school and student


Payoffs for loans being refinanced

If a portion of the new loan is being used to refinance existing private student loans, payoffs are sent to the Servicer; more about this option
Payments should continue to be made on any loans being refinanced until they are paid off  time will elapse between when this option is requested and when the loans are actually paid off
If the payoff amount(s) sent by SunTrust do not cover the entire balance owed on the existing loan(s), the outstanding balance(s) will remain your responsibility





What is a cosigner?
A cosigner is an additional applicant besides the student, such as a parent, guardian, grandparent or other person, who will bear the same legal responsibility as the student.
Why is a cosigner important?
Many students don't have a substantial credit history or have other concerns about being approved for a private student loan, and adding a creditworthy cosigner may help them qualify and also obtain a lower interest rate.
What makes a good cosigner on a loan?

				A good cosigner:
					
Has a substantial credit history
Does not have any serious negative items on their credit report
Meets their credit obligations on time
Is not over burdened with debt
Has steady employment and/or income sufficient to meet debt obligations

Can a cosigner be released from the loan?
The cosigner can be released from liability after a specific number of consecutive monthly principal and interest payments (either 36 or 48 monthly payments, as set forth in your Credit Agreement) have been made on-time.13 The borrower must meet credit criteria on their own at that time. For more details, click here.
What if there is an unfortunate event, such as death or disability, of the student borrower?
In the event of the primary borrower's death or permanent disability, the loan will be forgiven. Proper documentation is required and the cosigner won't be responsible for repayment.15
How is a cosigner added to a Custom Choice loan?

				Applying as a cosigner takes about 15 minutes. Either the cosigner or the student can start the application  the EasyInviteSM tool, within the online application, allows the cosigner or the student to be invited to the application.





SunTrust recommends comparing all aid alternatives including grants, scholarships, and federal student loans, prior to applying for a private student loan. Before selecting a private student loan, compare options offered by SunTrust.

1 Private student loans that can be refinanced with a new SunTrust private student loan are private student loans and private consolidation loans that the student applicant used for, or to refinance loans used for, postsecondary Qualified Higher Education Expenses not currently in a past due status. Loans that cannot be refinanced into this loan are (1) private student loans for which the student applicant is not the primary borrower, (2) Federal student loans and (3) student loans made by an educational institution; learn more about the In-School Refinance Option.
2 Interest rate reductions offered for automatic payment from a bank 
	account: 0.25% interest rate reduction for ACH payment from any bank account and an extra 0.25% 
	interest rate reduction when ACH payments are made from a SunTrust Bank account. ACH interest rate reduction(s) 
	apply when full payments (including both principal and interest) are automatically drafted from a bank account. 
	Interest rate reduction(s) will remain on the account unless (1) the automatic deduction of payments is 
	stopped (including times during deferment or forbearance) or (2) there are three automatic deductions 
	returned for insufficient funds within the life of the loan. The additional SunTrust Bank account ACH interest rate reduction will be applied after the first automatic payment is successfully deducted from a SunTrust Bank checking, savings or money market account and will be removed for the reasons stated above or if you close your SunTrust Bank account.  In the event the benefit(s) is removed, the interest rate stated in the Credit Agreement shall be applied in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.
3 The 1% principal reduction is based on the net disbursed loan amount, which is the total dollar amount of all disbursements made, excluding the dollar amount of any reductions, cancellations, or returns, as applicable. To receive the reward, the benefit must be requested from the servicer, the student borrower must have earned a bachelor's degree or higher and proof of such graduation (e.g. copy of diploma, final transcript or letter on school letterhead) must be provided to the servicer. This reward is available once during the life of the loan, regardless of whether the student borrower receives more than one degree.
4 The variable interest rate for each calendar month is calculated by adding the 
	current One-month LIBOR index (captured on the 25th day of each month, or the next 
	business day thereafter, of the month immediately preceding such calendar month and 
	rounded up to the nearest 1/8th of one percent) to the margin. The current One-month LIBOR index is 
	1.250% on 07/01/17.  LIBOR stands for 
	London Interbank Offered Rate. The One-month LIBOR is the Current Index, as published 
	in the "Money Rates" section of the Wall Street Journal (Eastern Edition). The interest rate will be determined after you apply. The variable interest rate and Annual Percentage Rate (APR) depend upon (1) the student's and cosigner's (if applicable) credit histories, (2) the repayment option and loan term selected, and (3) the requested loan amount and other information provided on the online loan application. If approved, applicants will be notified of the rate qualified for within the stated range.  The variable interest rate will increase or decrease if the One-month LIBOR 
	index changes. Rates and terms effective for applications received on or after 07/01/17. 
5 Current fixed interest rates depend on (1) the student's and cosigner's, if applicable, credit histories, (2) the repayment option and loan term selected, and (3) the requested loan amount and other information provided on the online loan application. If approved, applicants will be notified of the rate qualified for within the stated range. The fixed rate assigned to a loan will never change except as required by law or if you request and qualify for the ACH reduction benefit(s). Rates and terms effective for applications received on or after 07/01/17.

For Partial Interest and Fully Deferred loans, any accrued and unpaid interest will be capitalized (added to your principal loan balance) when repayment of principal and interest begins. Payments may be deferred (a) while student is enrolled at least half-time at an approved school, and (b) during the 6 month grace period after graduation or dropping below half-time status, but the total initial deferment period, including the grace period, may not exceed 66 months from the first disbursement date. There are no prepayment penalties. For Immediate Repayment loans, repayment of principal and interest begins 30-60 days after the final disbursement. The minimum monthly payment is $50.00.

12 The aggregate maximum student loan debt allowed is $150,000 (includes all student loans and certain unsecured consumer debt).
13 A cosigner may be released from the loan upon request to the servicer provided that the student borrower is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident alien and has met credit criteria, and a specific number of consecutive monthly principal and interest payments have been made on-time (received within 10 calendar days after the due date), as set forth in the Credit Agreement. Cosigner release may not be available for loans in a forbearance status.
14 The legal age for entering into contracts is 18 years of age in every state except Alabama (19 years old), Nebraska (19 years old, only for wards of the state), and Mississippi and Puerto Rico (21 years old).
	
15 If the student borrower on a loan dies after disbursement of all or part of the loan and the loan has not previously become a charged off loan due to non-payment or bankruptcy, then the outstanding principal and accrued interest balance on such loan shall be forgiven if the servicer is informed of the student borrower's death and receives acceptable proof of death. If the student borrower on a loan becomes totally and permanently disabled and the loan has not previously become a charged off loan due to non-payment or bankruptcy, the student borrower may apply to have the loan balance discharged by completing a discharge application.
16 The initial credit review is based on all the information you and your cosigner (if applicable) provide during the application process and the information obtained from your credit report (and any cosigner's credit report). If you pass the initial credit review, documentation will be requested to verify your identity and annual income and, if applicable, payoff documentation for any private student loan you request to refinance. A signed Loan Packet, including the Credit Agreement, Approval Disclosure and Applicant Self-Certification Form is required before a final loan decision is made. Your school will be required to certify the loan amount for the upcoming academic year/semester prior to disbursement.

Many people hear a lot of advice about how to save for a college education. It's never too early to start saving; and a little saving today goes a long way toward the future.

If savings, grants and scholarships don't cover the full cost of college, there are several financing options to consider:

Federal student loans (Stafford, PLUS and Grad PLUS) - offered by the federal Direct loan program; learn more. If you need help understanding the difference between federal and private student loans, view our loan comparison chart.
Private Student Loans - With a private student loan from SunTrust, have the money you need for education related expenses. Students have the option to either defer or make payments while enrolled at least half-time at an approved school. Compare private student loan options offered by SunTrust.
Home equity loans - If you own a home or other property, you may want to explore options for home equity loans to finance college tuition and expenses.
Home equity lines of credit - A home equity line of credit offers a smart, flexible and affordable way to use your home's equity to pay for the important things in your life  both now and in the future.



No matter what stage you're at in planning for a college education, you'll need to determine how much you need to save, estimate the cost of college and analyze financing needs for each year of college. Our calculators can help you determine how much you may need to save or borrow for college.

Review Frequently Asked Questions about the Custom Choice Loan
Call a SunTrust representative at 866-232-3889



Step one - Apply Online:

Students and cosigners, if applicable, apply online (they may apply at the same time or during separate sessions)
An Application and Solicitation Disclosure outlining current interest rate ranges, loan cost examples, federal student loan alternatives, and other general loan information is presented electronically to the student borrower and cosigner, if applicable

Step two - Consider the Option to Refinance Existing Private Student Loans into the New Loan:

The process is easy  after approval this option will be presented  just list which loans you'd like to refinance
Learn more about the In-School Refinance Option

Step three - Loan Options:

Upon passing the initial credit review16, loan options (including interest rates, repayment plans and repayment terms) are presented online

Step four - Loan Documentation:

Once loan options are selected, a list of required documentation is presented
Required documentation must be submitted before the loan process will continue
Documentation can be uploaded online or submitted by fax or mail

Step five - Loan Packet (Approval Disclosure, Credit Agreement, etc):

After all required documentation has been received and approved, a Loan Packet will be sent outlining the terms of the loan based on the preliminary loan amount before school certification and, for applicants opting to refinance existing student loans1, the payoff amounts provided by the student
The Loan Packet, including the Approval Disclosure, must be accepted within 30 calendar days if the student and, if applicable, the cosigner, agree to the loan terms
Acceptance of this can be given through the applicant's online account, by fax or by mail

Step six - School Certification:

Certification of the loan is required by the student's school of attendance and will be requested by SunTrust
The school will certify the loan ensuring that the student is enrolled at least half time, that the loan amount is correct, and will confirm disbursement specifications

Step seven - Final Disclosure:

After school certification is received, the final loan terms will be outlined in a Final Disclosure which will be mailed to both the student borrower and cosigner, if applicable; for convenience, the Final Disclosure is also available online
3 Day rescission period  the student borrower and cosigner, if applicable, will have three business days to cancel or rescind the loan
					
SunTrust must wait until this three business day period has expired before disbursement of funds can take place
No action is required by the borrower and cosigner, if applicable, unless either desires to cancel or rescind the loan



Step eight - Loan Disbursement:

Funds for the upcoming semester/academic period

Amounts and timing of when a loan is disbursed is given to SunTrust by the school
A loan may have up to four disbursements and disbursement amounts do not have to be equal
Funds are sent to the school and applied to the student's account; any overage of funds above/beyond what is owed to the school is handled between the school and student


Payoffs for loans being refinanced

If a portion of the new loan is being used to refinance existing private student loans, payoffs are sent to the Servicer; more about this option
Payments should continue to be made on any loans being refinanced until they are paid off  time will elapse between when this option is requested and when the loans are actually paid off
If the payoff amount(s) sent by SunTrust do not cover the entire balance owed on the existing loan(s), the outstanding balance(s) will remain your responsibility





What is a cosigner?
A cosigner is an additional applicant besides the student, such as a parent, guardian, grandparent or other person, who will bear the same legal responsibility as the student.
Why is a cosigner important?
Many students don't have a substantial credit history or have other concerns about being approved for a private student loan, and adding a creditworthy cosigner may help them qualify and also obtain a lower interest rate.
What makes a good cosigner on a loan?

				A good cosigner:
					
Has a substantial credit history
Does not have any serious negative items on their credit report
Meets their credit obligations on time
Is not over burdened with debt
Has steady employment and/or income sufficient to meet debt obligations

Can a cosigner be released from the loan?
The cosigner can be released from liability after a specific number of consecutive monthly principal and interest payments (either 36 or 48 monthly payments, as set forth in your Credit Agreement) have been made on-time.13 The borrower must meet credit criteria on their own at that time. For more details, click here.
What if there is an unfortunate event, such as death or disability, of the student borrower?
In the event of the primary borrower's death or permanent disability, the loan will be forgiven. Proper documentation is required and the cosigner won't be responsible for repayment.15
How is a cosigner added to a Custom Choice loan?

				Applying as a cosigner takes about 15 minutes. Either the cosigner or the student can start the application  the EasyInviteSM tool, within the online application, allows the cosigner or the student to be invited to the application.





SunTrust recommends comparing all aid alternatives including grants, scholarships, and federal student loans, prior to applying for a private student loan. Before selecting a private student loan, compare options offered by SunTrust.

1 Private student loans that can be refinanced with a new SunTrust private student loan are private student loans and private consolidation loans that the student applicant used for, or to refinance loans used for, postsecondary Qualified Higher Education Expenses not currently in a past due status. Loans that cannot be refinanced into this loan are (1) private student loans for which the student applicant is not the primary borrower, (2) Federal student loans and (3) student loans made by an educational institution; learn more about the In-School Refinance Option.
2 Interest rate reductions offered for automatic payment from a bank 
	account: 0.25% interest rate reduction for ACH payment from any bank account and an extra 0.25% 
	interest rate reduction when ACH payments are made from a SunTrust Bank account. ACH interest rate reduction(s) 
	apply when full payments (including both principal and interest) are automatically drafted from a bank account. 
	Interest rate reduction(s) will remain on the account unless (1) the automatic deduction of payments is 
	stopped (including times during deferment or forbearance) or (2) there are three automatic deductions 
	returned for insufficient funds within the life of the loan. The additional SunTrust Bank account ACH interest rate reduction will be applied after the first automatic payment is successfully deducted from a SunTrust Bank checking, savings or money market account and will be removed for the reasons stated above or if you close your SunTrust Bank account.  In the event the benefit(s) is removed, the interest rate stated in the Credit Agreement shall be applied in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.
3 The 1% principal reduction is based on the net disbursed loan amount, which is the total dollar amount of all disbursements made, excluding the dollar amount of any reductions, cancellations, or returns, as applicable. To receive the reward, the benefit must be requested from the servicer, the student borrower must have earned a bachelor's degree or higher and proof of such graduation (e.g. copy of diploma, final transcript or letter on school letterhead) must be provided to the servicer. This reward is available once during the life of the loan, regardless of whether the student borrower receives more than one degree.
4 The variable interest rate for each calendar month is calculated by adding the 
	current One-month LIBOR index (captured on the 25th day of each month, or the next 
	business day thereafter, of the month immediately preceding such calendar month and 
	rounded up to the nearest 1/8th of one percent) to the margin. The current One-month LIBOR index is 
	1.250% on 07/01/17.  LIBOR stands for 
	London Interbank Offered Rate. The One-month LIBOR is the Current Index, as published 
	in the "Money Rates" section of the Wall Street Journal (Eastern Edition). The interest rate will be determined after you apply. The variable interest rate and Annual Percentage Rate (APR) depend upon (1) the student's and cosigner's (if applicable) credit histories, (2) the repayment option and loan term selected, and (3) the requested loan amount and other information provided on the online loan application. If approved, applicants will be notified of the rate qualified for within the stated range.  The variable interest rate will increase or decrease if the One-month LIBOR 
	index changes. Rates and terms effective for applications received on or after 07/01/17. 
5 Current fixed interest rates depend on (1) the student's and cosigner's, if applicable, credit histories, (2) the repayment option and loan term selected, and (3) the requested loan amount and other information provided on the online loan application. If approved, applicants will be notified of the rate qualified for within the stated range. The fixed rate assigned to a loan will never change except as required by law or if you request and qualify for the ACH reduction benefit(s). Rates and terms effective for applications received on or after 07/01/17.
6 Click here to see payment examples. Certain repayment terms are only available for loan amounts of $5,000 or more. Click here to find out more about available options.
7 Any applicant who applies for the loan the month of, the month prior to, or the month after their graduation date, as stated on the application or certified by the school, will only be offered the immediate repayment option. Partial Interest Repayment is available on loans of $5,000 or more.
8 Making interest only or partial interest payments while in school will not reduce the principal balance of the loan. Partial Interest Payment plan of $25 per month is available on loans of $5,000 or more; click here to see a payment example. For Partial Interest and Fully Deferred loans, any accrued and unpaid interest will be capitalized (added to your principal loan balance) when repayment of principal and interest begins. Payments may be deferred (a) while student is enrolled at least half-time at an approved school, and (b) during the 6 month grace period after graduation or dropping below half-time status, but the total initial deferment period, including the grace period, may not exceed 66 months from the first disbursement date. There are no prepayment penalties. For Immediate Repayment loans, repayment of principal and interest begins 30-60 days after the final disbursement. The minimum monthly payment is $50.00.
9 Typically the grace period is six months from (a) the date the student graduates, (b) the date the student drops below half-time status or (c) the date that is 60 months from the first disbursement date. The immediate repayment option does not have a grace period.
10 The minimum loan amount is $1,001 with exceptions based on the student's state of permanent residence, as follows: Alaska: $5,001, Colorado: $3,001, New Mexico: $2,501, Oklahoma: $5,001, Rhode Island: $5,001, South Carolina: $3,601. The Custom Choice Loan is available to applicants who are U.S. citizens or permanent resident aliens; it is not available to international students or students/cosigners whose permanent residency state is Iowa or Wisconsin.
11 The maximum annual loan amount for the upcoming semester/academic period is determined by the school's cost of attendance, minus other financial aid such as federal student loans, scholarships or grants, up to $65,000.
12 The aggregate maximum student loan debt allowed is $150,000 (includes all student loans and certain unsecured consumer debt).
13 A cosigner may be released from the loan upon request to the servicer provided that the student borrower is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident alien and has met credit criteria, and a specific number of consecutive monthly principal and interest payments have been made on-time (received within 10 calendar days after the due date), as set forth in the Credit Agreement. Cosigner release may not be available for loans in a forbearance status.
14 The legal age for entering into contracts is 18 years of age in every state except Alabama (19 years old), Nebraska (19 years old, only for wards of the state), and Mississippi and Puerto Rico (21 years old).
	
15 If the student borrower on a loan dies after disbursement of all or part of the loan and the loan has not previously become a charged off loan due to non-payment or bankruptcy, then the outstanding principal and accrued interest balance on such loan shall be forgiven if the servicer is informed of the student borrower's death and receives acceptable proof of death. If the student borrower on a loan becomes totally and permanently disabled and the loan has not previously become a charged off loan due to non-payment or bankruptcy, the student borrower may apply to have the loan balance discharged by completing a discharge application.
16 The initial credit review is based on all the information you and your cosigner (if applicable) provide during the application process and the information obtained from your credit report (and any cosigner's credit report). If you pass the initial credit review, documentation will be requested to verify your identity and annual income and, if applicable, payoff documentation for any private student loan you request to refinance. A signed Loan Packet, including the Credit Agreement, Approval Disclosure and Applicant Self-Certification Form is required before a final loan decision is made. Your school will be required to certify the loan amount for the upcoming academic year/semester prior to disbursement.

1 Any applicant who applies for the loan the month of, the month prior to, or the month after their graduation date, as stated on the application or certified by the school, will only be offered the immediate repayment option.
2 Making interest only payments while in school will not reduce the principal balance on the loan. Partial Interest Payment plan of $25 per month is available on loans of $5,000 or more; click here to see payment examples. For Partial Interest and Fully Deferred loans, any accrued and unpaid interest will be capitalized (added to your principal loan balance) when repayment of principal and interest begins. Payments may be deferred (a) while student is enrolled at least half-time at an approved school, and (b) during the 6 month grace period after graduation or dropping below half-time status, but the total initial deferment period, including the grace period, may not exceed 66 months from the first disbursement date. In any case, the initial deferment period may not exceed 66 months from the first disbursement date. There are no prepayment penalties.
3 The fixed interest rate assigned to a loan will never change except as required by law or if you request and qualify for the ACH reduction benefit(s).
4 Interest rate reductions offered for automatic payment from a bank account: 0.25% interest rate reduction for ACH payment from any bank account and an extra 0.25% interest rate reduction when ACH payments are made from a SunTrust Bank account. ACH interest rate reduction(s) only apply when full payments (including both principal and interest) are automatically drafted from a bank account. Interest rate reduction(s) will remain on the account unless (a) the automatic deduction of payments is stopped (including times during deferment or forbearance) or (b) there are three automatic deductions returned for insufficient funds within the life of the loan. The additional SunTrust Bank account ACH interest rate reduction will be applied after the first automatic payment is successfully deducted from a SunTrust Bank checking, savings or money market account and will be removed for the reasons stated above or if you close your SunTrust account. In the event the benefit(s) is removed, the interest rate stated in the Credit Agreement shall be applied in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.
5 The 1% principal reduction is based on the net disbursed loan amount, which is the total dollar amount of all disbursements made, excluding the dollar amount of any reductions, cancellations, or returns, as applicable. To receive the reward, the benefit must be requested from the servicer, and the student borrower must have earned a bachelor's degree or higher and proof of such graduation (e.g. copy of diploma, final transcript or letter on school letterhead) must be provided to the servicer. This reward is available once during the life of the loan, regardless of whether the student borrower receives more than one degree.

Fitch Affirms Navient Student Loan Trust 2014-8 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms Navient Student Loan Trust 2014-8
    





November 10, 2016 10:58 AM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed the outstanding senior and subordinate notes 
      of Navient Student Loan Trust 2014-8 at 'AAAsf' and 'Asf', respectively. 
      The Rating Outlook is Stable. The affirmations are due to the notes 
      passing both Fitch's credit and maturity stresses at the commensurate 
      rating level. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this 
      release.
    

      Although the class B note passes Fitch's 'AA' cash flow stress 
      scenarios, the recommendation is to affirm at 'Asf' because the implied 
      ratings from Fitch's cash flow model are sensitive to modest increases 
      in defaults. Despite the observation of recent high defaults in the 
      trust, Fitch expects defaults to decrease in the coming years as the 
      collateral seasons. If the default decline does not materialize, ratings 
      may be affected.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      U.S. Sovereign Risk: The trust collateral consists of Federal Family 
      Education Loan Program (FFELP) loans, 20.2% of which are rehabilitated 
      loans. Guarantees are provided by the transaction's eligible guarantors 
      and reinsurance is provided by the U.S. Department of Education (ED) for 
      at least 97% of principal and accrued interest. Fitch's U.S. sovereign 
      rating is currently 'AAA'/Outlook Stable.
    

      Collateral Performance: Due to observations of recent high defaults for 
      this trust, a proxy was used to account for the actual trust 
      performance. Fitch assumes a base case default rate of 29.25% and a 
      64.00% default rate under the 'AAAsf' credit stress scenario. The base 
      case default assumption of 29.25% implies a constant default rate of 
      9.0% (assuming a weighted average life of 3.3 years); equal to the 
      trailing-12-month (TTM) constant default rate (CDR) utilized in the 
      maturity stresses. Fitch believes defaults will likely decline as the 
      trust's collateral becomes more seasoned. Fitch applies the standard 
      default timing curve in its credit stress cash flow analysis. The claim 
      reject rate is assumed to be 0.50% in the base case and 3.0% in the 
      'AAAsf' case.
    

      The TTM average levels of deferment, forbearance, income-based repayment 
      (before adjustment) and constant prepayment rate (voluntary and 
      involuntary) are 11.9%, 18.2%, 12.8% and 14.7%, respectively, which are 
      used as the starting point in cash flow modelling. Subsequent declines 
      or increases are modelled as per criteria. The borrower benefit is 
      assumed to be approximately 0.07%, based on information provided by the 
      sponsor.
    

      Basis and Interest Rate Risk: Fitch applies its standard basis and 
      interest rate stresses to this trust as per the agency's criteria.
    

      Payment Structure: Credit Enhancement (CE) is provided by excess spread, 
      overcollateralization, and, for the senior class A notes, the 
      subordination of the class B note. Liquidity support is provided by a 
      reserve account currently sized at $1,958,717. The reserve account 
      balance is required to be maintained at the greater of (i) 0.25% of the 
      pool balance and (ii) $1,019,764. As of the July 2016 distribution date, 
      senior parity is 104.8% (4.6% CE) and total parity is at the specified 
      overcollateralization of 101.01% (1.0% CE). Excess cash will be released 
      to the certificate holder as long as the target overcollateralization 
      amount, equal to the greater of 1.0% CE or $1,500,000, is maintained.
    

      Maturity Risk: Fitch's student loan ABS cash flow model indicates that 
      the notes are paid in full on or prior to the legal final maturity dates 
      under the commensurate rating scenario.
    

      Operational Capabilities: Navient Solutions, Inc. (Navient) provides 
      day-to-day servicing for the trust's entire portfolio. Fitch believes 
      Navient is an acceptable servicer of FFELP student loans.
    

      CRITERIA VARIATIONS
    

      Under Fitch's criteria 'Rating U.S. Federal Family Education Loan 
      Program Student Loan ABS Criteria', dated July 26, 2016, Fitch does not 
      address the process by which it gives certain credit to short-term 
      assets in its cash flow analysis, and it is therefore considered a 
      criteria variation. There is no rating impact from such variation.
    

      Under Fitch's criteria 'Rating U.S. Federal Family Education Loan 
      Program Student Loan ABS Criteria', dated July 26, 2016, Fitch utilizes 
      its Default Model to derive lifetime default rate assumptions. Fitch 
      assumed a base case default rate for the credit stresses based on actual 
      trust performance, which is higher than the output from its Default 
      Model, and is therefore considered a criteria variation. Had the Default 
      Model output been used as the base case, the implied rating for the 
      class B note would have been 'AA' as well, but would be less sensitive 
      to increases in defaults.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Since the FFELP student loan ABS relies on the U.S. government to 
      reimburse defaults, 'AAAsf' FFELP ABS ratings will likely move in tandem 
      with the 'AAA' U.S. sovereign rating. Aside from the U.S. sovereign 
      rating, defaults, basis risk, and loan extension risk account for the 
      majority of the risk embedded in FFELP student loan transactions. 
      Additional defaults, basis shock beyond Fitch's published stresses, 
      lower than expected payment speed, and other factors could result in 
      future downgrades. Likewise, a buildup of CE driven by positive excess 
      spread given favorable basis factor conditions could lead to future 
      upgrades.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in 
      relation to this rating action.

      --Class A-1 note at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.

      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions

      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative

For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating.

Refinance student loans the new-fashioned way
BETTER RATES THROUGH BETTER DATA ANALYSIS



Our data-driven evaluation of your full financial profile gives us the ability to offer qualified borrowers lower, more personalized rates than traditional lenders can.
How it works












Why Refinance Student Loans


We’ve made saving money on student loans simple. When you refinance student loans, you get credit for the positive changes to your financial profile since you originally took out the loans. A student loan refinance is a good choice for people who have seen advances in their income, career, or credit score since they were in school.


Our data-driven evaluation of your full financial profile gives us the ability to offer qualified borrowers lower, more personalized rates than traditional lenders can. So whether you want to pay off your student faster or just reduce your student loan payments, we can help. Refinance your student loans and accelerate everything that life has to offer.



 



A refinancing experience built to save you time and money
QUICK & SIMPLE TO APPLY





2 MINS TO GET YOUR ESTIMATED RATE
By analyzing information beyond your credit score, we can quickly provide you a rate estimate. You will receive your final rate when your application to refinance has been approved.



LOAN APPLICATION
We look at data other lenders don’t, like savings, education, and earning potential. This helps us build a better picture of your full financial profile so that we can offer the fairest rates possible rates.



LOAN DECISION
If you’re approved to refinance student loans with Earnest, you can set your exact monthly payment and choose between a variable and fixed rate. How do we decide? Read our eligibility guide.



 




“To be able to pay off my student loans before their original term date and save so much on the life of the loan is huge.”

Disclaimers




The average savings calculation is the sum of all projected savings divided by the number of clients included in the projected savings calculation. These calculations assume that clients’ interest rates will not change over time, that clients make all payments on-time, and that no loans will be prepaid.
Here’s what our math includes:

Projected savings for clients who provided outstanding balance, APR, and current monthly payment amount for their existing student loan(s)
Both fixed and variable rate loans

And here’s what our math excludes, and why:

Savings from any client who stated that the current interest rate on their loan was greater than 12%. (Why: this is intended to filter out any cases where client error may skew the savings calculation higher.)
For any client who stated that the projected term of their loan was greater than 25 years, we do not include in our calculation any additional savings that might be realized if their existing loan were to take longer than 25 years to pay off in-full. (Why: 25 years is the maximum term allowed for a Federal student loan, or the cap on any Federal student loan under Income Based Repayment.)
Savings from any client whose indicated monthly payment was not sufficient to pay down the loan balance over time. (Why: this is intended to filter out any cases where the client misstated either their monthly payment amount, interest rate, or both.)
All refinancings by clients who chose a longer term than their existing student loan. (Why: some clients choose longer loan terms to match their monthly loan obligations to their unique life circumstances; while we encourage clients to take advantage of Earnest’s flexible term and monthly payment features, these cases are not indicative of the savings that result from lower rates through better data.)



Explanation of Rates “With Autopay”
Rates shown include 0.25% APR reduction where client agrees to make monthly principal and interest payments by automatic electronic payment. Use of autopay is not required to receive an Earnest loan.


Explanation of Precision Pricing™ Savings
Savings calculations are based on refinancing $121,825 in student loans at an existing loan servicer’s interest rate of 7.5% fixed APR with 10 years, 6 months remaining on the loan term. The other lender’s savings and APR (light green line) represent what would happen if those loans were refinanced at the other lender’s best fixed APRs. The Earnest savings and APR (white line) represent refinancing those loans at Earnest’s best fixed APRs.
Savings is computed as the difference between the future scheduled payments on the existing loans and payments on new Earnest and “other lender” loans. The calculation assumes on-time loan payments, no change in interest rates, and no prepayment of loans.

And here’s what our math excludes, and why:

Savings from any client who stated that the current interest rate on their loan was greater than 12%. (Why: this is intended to filter out any cases where client error may skew the savings calculation higher.)
For any client who stated that the projected term of their loan was greater than 25 years, we do not include in our calculation any additional savings that might be realized if their existing loan were to take longer than 25 years to pay off in-full. (Why: 25 years is the maximum term allowed for a Federal student loan, or the cap on any Federal student loan under Income Based Repayment.)
Savings from any client whose indicated monthly payment was not sufficient to pay down the loan balance over time. (Why: this is intended to filter out any cases where the client misstated either their monthly payment amount, interest rate, or both.)
All refinancings by clients who chose a longer term than their existing student loan. (Why: some clients choose longer loan terms to match their monthly loan obligations to their unique life circumstances; while we encourage clients to take advantage of Earnest’s flexible term and monthly payment features, these cases are not indicative of the savings that result from lower rates through better data.)



Explanation of Rates “With Autopay”
Rates shown include 0.25% APR reduction where client agrees to make monthly principal and interest payments by automatic electronic payment. Use of autopay is not required to receive an Earnest loan.


Explanation of Precision Pricing™ Savings
Savings calculations are based on refinancing $121,825 in student loans at an existing loan servicer’s interest rate of 7.5% fixed APR with 10 years, 6 months remaining on the loan term. The other lender’s savings and APR (light green line) represent what would happen if those loans were refinanced at the other lender’s best fixed APRs. The Earnest savings and APR (white line) represent refinancing those loans at Earnest’s best fixed APRs.
Savings is computed as the difference between the future scheduled payments on the existing loans and payments on new Earnest and “other lender” loans. The calculation assumes on-time loan payments, no change in interest rates, and no prepayment of loans.

Earnest



















            About Us          




We believe many financially responsible people aren’t getting the credit they deserve. That’s why we strive to eliminate unnecessary costs from the banking process and offer our clients the low rates they deserve.


WHY WE STARTED EARNEST


We believe the fundamental role of banks and lenders is to help people realize their hopes and dreams. But we realized the financial system had forgotten this primary purpose, instead serving to enrich a privileged few. So we started Earnest to restore the trust that is sorely missing from the current system, and to build a modern financial institution that actually delivers on making clients’ lives better.


Whatever your ambition, we help get you there. We do low-cost lending to financially responsible people, and allow them to customize their repayment plan to fit their needs. We want to help our clients take control of their finances and realize their dreams—and in doing so create a relationship with them that lasts a lifetime.


WHO WE ARE
We are a skilled team of design, math, finance, and technology geeks who noticed a lack of trust in the financial system and decided to do something about it. We created a company that combines data science, streamlined design, and exceptional service to bring people a fast, low-cost, and hyper-personalized financial experience. Our mission is to make credit more accessible by reducing the costs and barriers faced by millions of financially responsible people.

Repayment Plans1
Take a moment to consider the best way for you to pay back your loan. There are up to four options to choose from:

Immediate Repayment
Interest-Only Repayment2
Partial Interest Repayment2
In-School Deferment2

Interest Rate Options
Choose between a fixed or variable rate:

Fixed ratesYour rate will never change.3
Variable ratesVariable rates are based on market conditions, so if market rates go up or down, so does your rate.



What you want, including a graduation present.

Interest Rate Reductions
Even a small percentage can make a big difference.

0.25% for automatic loan payment withdrawal4
An additional 0.25% if your automatic payment is from a SunTrust account4
1% principal balance reduction upon graduation5

Cosigners are great
If someone with a good credit history is a cosigner, your Custom Choice Loan is more likely to be approved. It could be an eligible parent, guardian, or a friend.
In-school Refinance Option
With this new option, you can refinance existing private student loans into a new Custom Choice Loan.

Your new loan will give you the flexibility to select a repayment term and repayment option that is right for you now.
The process is easy  after approval this option will be presented  just list which loans you'd like to refinance.

        Certain restrictions and limitations may apply. SunTrust Bank reserves the right to change or discontinue these programs without notice. All loan programs are subject to approval and may not be available in certain jurisdictions.

1 Any applicant who applies for the loan the month of, the month prior to, or the month after their graduation date, as stated on the application or certified by the school, will only be offered the immediate repayment option.
2 Making interest only payments while in school will not reduce the principal balance on the loan. Partial Interest Payment plan of $25 per month is available on loans of $5,000 or more; click here to see payment examples. For Partial Interest and Fully Deferred loans, any accrued and unpaid interest will be capitalized (added to your principal loan balance) when repayment of principal and interest begins. Payments may be deferred (a) while student is enrolled at least half-time at an approved school, and (b) during the 6 month grace period after graduation or dropping below half-time status, but the total initial deferment period, including the grace period, may not exceed 66 months from the first disbursement date. In any case, the initial deferment period may not exceed 66 months from the first disbursement date. There are no prepayment penalties.
3 The fixed interest rate assigned to a loan will never change except as required by law or if you request and qualify for the ACH reduction benefit(s).
4 Interest rate reductions offered for automatic payment from a bank account: 0.25% interest rate reduction for ACH payment from any bank account and an extra 0.25% interest rate reduction when ACH payments are made from a SunTrust Bank account. ACH interest rate reduction(s) only apply when full payments (including both principal and interest) are automatically drafted from a bank account. Interest rate reduction(s) will remain on the account unless (a) the automatic deduction of payments is stopped (including times during deferment or forbearance) or (b) there are three automatic deductions returned for insufficient funds within the life of the loan. The additional SunTrust Bank account ACH interest rate reduction will be applied after the first automatic payment is successfully deducted from a SunTrust Bank checking, savings or money market account and will be removed for the reasons stated above or if you close your SunTrust account. In the event the benefit(s) is removed, the interest rate stated in the Credit Agreement shall be applied in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.
5 The 1% principal reduction is based on the net disbursed loan amount, which is the total dollar amount of all disbursements made, excluding the dollar amount of any reductions, cancellations, or returns, as applicable. To receive the reward, the benefit must be requested from the servicer, and the student borrower must have earned a bachelor's degree or higher and proof of such graduation (e.g. copy of diploma, final transcript or letter on school letterhead) must be provided to the servicer. This reward is available once during the life of the loan, regardless of whether the student borrower receives more than one degree.

Review Frequently Asked Questions about the Custom Choice Loan
Call a SunTrust representative at 866-232-3889



Step one - Apply Online:

Students and cosigners, if applicable, apply online (they may apply at the same time or during separate sessions)
An Application and Solicitation Disclosure outlining current interest rate ranges, loan cost examples, federal student loan alternatives, and other general loan information is presented electronically to the student borrower and cosigner, if applicable

Step two - Consider the Option to Refinance Existing Private Student Loans into the New Loan:

The process is easy  after approval this option will be presented  just list which loans you'd like to refinance
Learn more about the In-School Refinance Option

Step three - Loan Options:

Upon passing the initial credit review16, loan options (including interest rates, repayment plans and repayment terms) are presented online

Step four - Loan Documentation:

Once loan options are selected, a list of required documentation is presented
Required documentation must be submitted before the loan process will continue
Documentation can be uploaded online or submitted by fax or mail

Step five - Loan Packet (Approval Disclosure, Credit Agreement, etc):

After all required documentation has been received and approved, a Loan Packet will be sent outlining the terms of the loan based on the preliminary loan amount before school certification and, for applicants opting to refinance existing student loans1, the payoff amounts provided by the student
The Loan Packet, including the Approval Disclosure, must be accepted within 30 calendar days if the student and, if applicable, the cosigner, agree to the loan terms
Acceptance of this can be given through the applicant's online account, by fax or by mail

Step six - School Certification:

Certification of the loan is required by the student's school of attendance and will be requested by SunTrust
The school will certify the loan ensuring that the student is enrolled at least half time, that the loan amount is correct, and will confirm disbursement specifications

Step seven - Final Disclosure:

After school certification is received, the final loan terms will be outlined in a Final Disclosure which will be mailed to both the student borrower and cosigner, if applicable; for convenience, the Final Disclosure is also available online
3 Day rescission period  the student borrower and cosigner, if applicable, will have three business days to cancel or rescind the loan
					
SunTrust must wait until this three business day period has expired before disbursement of funds can take place
No action is required by the borrower and cosigner, if applicable, unless either desires to cancel or rescind the loan



Step eight - Loan Disbursement:

Funds for the upcoming semester/academic period

Amounts and timing of when a loan is disbursed is given to SunTrust by the school
A loan may have up to four disbursements and disbursement amounts do not have to be equal
Funds are sent to the school and applied to the student's account; any overage of funds above/beyond what is owed to the school is handled between the school and student


Payoffs for loans being refinanced

If a portion of the new loan is being used to refinance existing private student loans, payoffs are sent to the Servicer; more about this option
Payments should continue to be made on any loans being refinanced until they are paid off  time will elapse between when this option is requested and when the loans are actually paid off
If the payoff amount(s) sent by SunTrust do not cover the entire balance owed on the existing loan(s), the outstanding balance(s) will remain your responsibility





What is a cosigner?
A cosigner is an additional applicant besides the student, such as a parent, guardian, grandparent or other person, who will bear the same legal responsibility as the student.
Why is a cosigner important?
Many students don't have a substantial credit history or have other concerns about being approved for a private student loan, and adding a creditworthy cosigner may help them qualify and also obtain a lower interest rate.
What makes a good cosigner on a loan?

				A good cosigner:
					
Has a substantial credit history
Does not have any serious negative items on their credit report
Meets their credit obligations on time
Is not over burdened with debt
Has steady employment and/or income sufficient to meet debt obligations

Can a cosigner be released from the loan?
The cosigner can be released from liability after a specific number of consecutive monthly principal and interest payments (either 36 or 48 monthly payments, as set forth in your Credit Agreement) have been made on-time.13 The borrower must meet credit criteria on their own at that time. For more details, click here.
What if there is an unfortunate event, such as death or disability, of the student borrower?
In the event of the primary borrower's death or permanent disability, the loan will be forgiven. Proper documentation is required and the cosigner won't be responsible for repayment.15
How is a cosigner added to a Custom Choice loan?

				Applying as a cosigner takes about 15 minutes. Either the cosigner or the student can start the application  the EasyInviteSM tool, within the online application, allows the cosigner or the student to be invited to the application.





SunTrust recommends comparing all aid alternatives including grants, scholarships, and federal student loans, prior to applying for a private student loan. Before selecting a private student loan, compare options offered by SunTrust.

1 Private student loans that can be refinanced with a new SunTrust private student loan are private student loans and private consolidation loans that the student applicant used for, or to refinance loans used for, postsecondary Qualified Higher Education Expenses not currently in a past due status. Loans that cannot be refinanced into this loan are (1) private student loans for which the student applicant is not the primary borrower, (2) Federal student loans and (3) student loans made by an educational institution; learn more about the In-School Refinance Option.
2 Interest rate reductions offered for automatic payment from a bank 
	account: 0.25% interest rate reduction for ACH payment from any bank account and an extra 0.25% 
	interest rate reduction when ACH payments are made from a SunTrust Bank account. ACH interest rate reduction(s) 
	apply when full payments (including both principal and interest) are automatically drafted from a bank account. 
	Interest rate reduction(s) will remain on the account unless (1) the automatic deduction of payments is 
	stopped (including times during deferment or forbearance) or (2) there are three automatic deductions 
	returned for insufficient funds within the life of the loan. The additional SunTrust Bank account ACH interest rate reduction will be applied after the first automatic payment is successfully deducted from a SunTrust Bank checking, savings or money market account and will be removed for the reasons stated above or if you close your SunTrust Bank account.  In the event the benefit(s) is removed, the interest rate stated in the Credit Agreement shall be applied in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.
3 The 1% principal reduction is based on the net disbursed loan amount, which is the total dollar amount of all disbursements made, excluding the dollar amount of any reductions, cancellations, or returns, as applicable. To receive the reward, the benefit must be requested from the servicer, the student borrower must have earned a bachelor's degree or higher and proof of such graduation (e.g. copy of diploma, final transcript or letter on school letterhead) must be provided to the servicer. This reward is available once during the life of the loan, regardless of whether the student borrower receives more than one degree.
4 The variable interest rate for each calendar month is calculated by adding the 
	current One-month LIBOR index (captured on the 25th day of each month, or the next 
	business day thereafter, of the month immediately preceding such calendar month and 
	rounded up to the nearest 1/8th of one percent) to the margin. The current One-month LIBOR index is 
	1.250% on 07/01/17.  LIBOR stands for 
	London Interbank Offered Rate. The One-month LIBOR is the Current Index, as published 
	in the "Money Rates" section of the Wall Street Journal (Eastern Edition). The interest rate will be determined after you apply. The variable interest rate and Annual Percentage Rate (APR) depend upon (1) the student's and cosigner's (if applicable) credit histories, (2) the repayment option and loan term selected, and (3) the requested loan amount and other information provided on the online loan application. If approved, applicants will be notified of the rate qualified for within the stated range.  The variable interest rate will increase or decrease if the One-month LIBOR 
	index changes. Rates and terms effective for applications received on or after 07/01/17. 
5 Current fixed interest rates depend on (1) the student's and cosigner's, if applicable, credit histories, (2) the repayment option and loan term selected, and (3) the requested loan amount and other information provided on the online loan application. If approved, applicants will be notified of the rate qualified for within the stated range. The fixed rate assigned to a loan will never change except as required by law or if you request and qualify for the ACH reduction benefit(s). Rates and terms effective for applications received on or after 07/01/17.
6 Click here to see payment examples. Certain repayment terms are only available for loan amounts of $5,000 or more. Click here to find out more about available options.
7 Any applicant who applies for the loan the month of, the month prior to, or the month after their graduation date, as stated on the application or certified by the school, will only be offered the immediate repayment option. Partial Interest Repayment is available on loans of $5,000 or more.
8 Making interest only or partial interest payments while in school will not reduce the principal balance of the loan. Partial Interest Payment plan of $25 per month is available on loans of $5,000 or more; click here to see a payment example. For Partial Interest and Fully Deferred loans, any accrued and unpaid interest will be capitalized (added to your principal loan balance) when repayment of principal and interest begins. Payments may be deferred (a) while student is enrolled at least half-time at an approved school, and (b) during the 6 month grace period after graduation or dropping below half-time status, but the total initial deferment period, including the grace period, may not exceed 66 months from the first disbursement date. There are no prepayment penalties. For Immediate Repayment loans, repayment of principal and interest begins 30-60 days after the final disbursement. The minimum monthly payment is $50.00.
9 Typically the grace period is six months from (a) the date the student graduates, (b) the date the student drops below half-time status or (c) the date that is 60 months from the first disbursement date. The immediate repayment option does not have a grace period.
10 The minimum loan amount is $1,001 with exceptions based on the student's state of permanent residence, as follows: Alaska: $5,001, Colorado: $3,001, New Mexico: $2,501, Oklahoma: $5,001, Rhode Island: $5,001, South Carolina: $3,601. The Custom Choice Loan is available to applicants who are U.S. citizens or permanent resident aliens; it is not available to international students or students/cosigners whose permanent residency state is Iowa or Wisconsin.
11 The maximum annual loan amount for the upcoming semester/academic period is determined by the school's cost of attendance, minus other financial aid such as federal student loans, scholarships or grants, up to $65,000.
12 The aggregate maximum student loan debt allowed is $150,000 (includes all student loans and certain unsecured consumer debt).
13 A cosigner may be released from the loan upon request to the servicer provided that the student borrower is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident alien and has met credit criteria, and a specific number of consecutive monthly principal and interest payments have been made on-time (received within 10 calendar days after the due date), as set forth in the Credit Agreement. Cosigner release may not be available for loans in a forbearance status.
14 The legal age for entering into contracts is 18 years of age in every state except Alabama (19 years old), Nebraska (19 years old, only for wards of the state), and Mississippi and Puerto Rico (21 years old).
	
15 If the student borrower on a loan dies after disbursement of all or part of the loan and the loan has not previously become a charged off loan due to non-payment or bankruptcy, then the outstanding principal and accrued interest balance on such loan shall be forgiven if the servicer is informed of the student borrower's death and receives acceptable proof of death. If the student borrower on a loan becomes totally and permanently disabled and the loan has not previously become a charged off loan due to non-payment or bankruptcy, the student borrower may apply to have the loan balance discharged by completing a discharge application.
16 The initial credit review is based on all the information you and your cosigner (if applicable) provide during the application process and the information obtained from your credit report (and any cosigner's credit report). If you pass the initial credit review, documentation will be requested to verify your identity and annual income and, if applicable, payoff documentation for any private student loan you request to refinance. A signed Loan Packet, including the Credit Agreement, Approval Disclosure and Applicant Self-Certification Form is required before a final loan decision is made. Your school will be required to certify the loan amount for the upcoming academic year/semester prior to disbursement.

No action is required by the borrower and cosigner, if applicable, unless either desires to cancel or rescind the loan



Step eight - Loan Disbursement:

Funds for the upcoming semester/academic period

Amounts and timing of when a loan is disbursed is given to SunTrust by the school
A loan may have up to four disbursements and disbursement amounts do not have to be equal
Funds are sent to the school and applied to the student's account; any overage of funds above/beyond what is owed to the school is handled between the school and student


Payoffs for loans being refinanced

If a portion of the new loan is being used to refinance existing private student loans, payoffs are sent to the Servicer; more about this option
Payments should continue to be made on any loans being refinanced until they are paid off  time will elapse between when this option is requested and when the loans are actually paid off
If the payoff amount(s) sent by SunTrust do not cover the entire balance owed on the existing loan(s), the outstanding balance(s) will remain your responsibility





What is a cosigner?
A cosigner is an additional applicant besides the student, such as a parent, guardian, grandparent or other person, who will bear the same legal responsibility as the student.
Why is a cosigner important?
Many students don't have a substantial credit history or have other concerns about being approved for a private student loan, and adding a creditworthy cosigner may help them qualify and also obtain a lower interest rate.
What makes a good cosigner on a loan?

				A good cosigner:
					
Has a substantial credit history
Does not have any serious negative items on their credit report
Meets their credit obligations on time
Is not over burdened with debt
Has steady employment and/or income sufficient to meet debt obligations

Can a cosigner be released from the loan?
The cosigner can be released from liability after a specific number of consecutive monthly principal and interest payments (either 36 or 48 monthly payments, as set forth in your Credit Agreement) have been made on-time.13 The borrower must meet credit criteria on their own at that time. For more details, click here.
What if there is an unfortunate event, such as death or disability, of the student borrower?
In the event of the primary borrower's death or permanent disability, the loan will be forgiven. Proper documentation is required and the cosigner won't be responsible for repayment.15
How is a cosigner added to a Custom Choice loan?

				Applying as a cosigner takes about 15 minutes. Either the cosigner or the student can start the application  the EasyInviteSM tool, within the online application, allows the cosigner or the student to be invited to the application.





SunTrust recommends comparing all aid alternatives including grants, scholarships, and federal student loans, prior to applying for a private student loan. Before selecting a private student loan, compare options offered by SunTrust.

1 Private student loans that can be refinanced with a new SunTrust private student loan are private student loans and private consolidation loans that the student applicant used for, or to refinance loans used for, postsecondary Qualified Higher Education Expenses not currently in a past due status. Loans that cannot be refinanced into this loan are (1) private student loans for which the student applicant is not the primary borrower, (2) Federal student loans and (3) student loans made by an educational institution; learn more about the In-School Refinance Option.
2 Interest rate reductions offered for automatic payment from a bank 
	account: 0.25% interest rate reduction for ACH payment from any bank account and an extra 0.25% 
	interest rate reduction when ACH payments are made from a SunTrust Bank account. ACH interest rate reduction(s) 
	apply when full payments (including both principal and interest) are automatically drafted from a bank account. 
	Interest rate reduction(s) will remain on the account unless (1) the automatic deduction of payments is 
	stopped (including times during deferment or forbearance) or (2) there are three automatic deductions 
	returned for insufficient funds within the life of the loan. The additional SunTrust Bank account ACH interest rate reduction will be applied after the first automatic payment is successfully deducted from a SunTrust Bank checking, savings or money market account and will be removed for the reasons stated above or if you close your SunTrust Bank account.  In the event the benefit(s) is removed, the interest rate stated in the Credit Agreement shall be applied in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.
3 The 1% principal reduction is based on the net disbursed loan amount, which is the total dollar amount of all disbursements made, excluding the dollar amount of any reductions, cancellations, or returns, as applicable. To receive the reward, the benefit must be requested from the servicer, the student borrower must have earned a bachelor's degree or higher and proof of such graduation (e.g. copy of diploma, final transcript or letter on school letterhead) must be provided to the servicer. This reward is available once during the life of the loan, regardless of whether the student borrower receives more than one degree.
4 The variable interest rate for each calendar month is calculated by adding the 
	current One-month LIBOR index (captured on the 25th day of each month, or the next 
	business day thereafter, of the month immediately preceding such calendar month and 
	rounded up to the nearest 1/8th of one percent) to the margin. The current One-month LIBOR index is 
	1.250% on 07/01/17.  LIBOR stands for 
	London Interbank Offered Rate. The One-month LIBOR is the Current Index, as published 
	in the "Money Rates" section of the Wall Street Journal (Eastern Edition). The interest rate will be determined after you apply. The variable interest rate and Annual Percentage Rate (APR) depend upon (1) the student's and cosigner's (if applicable) credit histories, (2) the repayment option and loan term selected, and (3) the requested loan amount and other information provided on the online loan application. If approved, applicants will be notified of the rate qualified for within the stated range.  The variable interest rate will increase or decrease if the One-month LIBOR 
	index changes. Rates and terms effective for applications received on or after 07/01/17. 
5 Current fixed interest rates depend on (1) the student's and cosigner's, if applicable, credit histories, (2) the repayment option and loan term selected, and (3) the requested loan amount and other information provided on the online loan application. If approved, applicants will be notified of the rate qualified for within the stated range. The fixed rate assigned to a loan will never change except as required by law or if you request and qualify for the ACH reduction benefit(s). Rates and terms effective for applications received on or after 07/01/17.
6 Click here to see payment examples. Certain repayment terms are only available for loan amounts of $5,000 or more. Click here to find out more about available options.
7 Any applicant who applies for the loan the month of, the month prior to, or the month after their graduation date, as stated on the application or certified by the school, will only be offered the immediate repayment option. Partial Interest Repayment is available on loans of $5,000 or more.
8 Making interest only or partial interest payments while in school will not reduce the principal balance of the loan. Partial Interest Payment plan of $25 per month is available on loans of $5,000 or more; click here to see a payment example. For Partial Interest and Fully Deferred loans, any accrued and unpaid interest will be capitalized (added to your principal loan balance) when repayment of principal and interest begins. Payments may be deferred (a) while student is enrolled at least half-time at an approved school, and (b) during the 6 month grace period after graduation or dropping below half-time status, but the total initial deferment period, including the grace period, may not exceed 66 months from the first disbursement date. There are no prepayment penalties. For Immediate Repayment loans, repayment of principal and interest begins 30-60 days after the final disbursement. The minimum monthly payment is $50.00.
9 Typically the grace period is six months from (a) the date the student graduates, (b) the date the student drops below half-time status or (c) the date that is 60 months from the first disbursement date. The immediate repayment option does not have a grace period.
10 The minimum loan amount is $1,001 with exceptions based on the student's state of permanent residence, as follows: Alaska: $5,001, Colorado: $3,001, New Mexico: $2,501, Oklahoma: $5,001, Rhode Island: $5,001, South Carolina: $3,601. The Custom Choice Loan is available to applicants who are U.S. citizens or permanent resident aliens; it is not available to international students or students/cosigners whose permanent residency state is Iowa or Wisconsin.
11 The maximum annual loan amount for the upcoming semester/academic period is determined by the school's cost of attendance, minus other financial aid such as federal student loans, scholarships or grants, up to $65,000.
12 The aggregate maximum student loan debt allowed is $150,000 (includes all student loans and certain unsecured consumer debt).
13 A cosigner may be released from the loan upon request to the servicer provided that the student borrower is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident alien and has met credit criteria, and a specific number of consecutive monthly principal and interest payments have been made on-time (received within 10 calendar days after the due date), as set forth in the Credit Agreement. Cosigner release may not be available for loans in a forbearance status.
14 The legal age for entering into contracts is 18 years of age in every state except Alabama (19 years old), Nebraska (19 years old, only for wards of the state), and Mississippi and Puerto Rico (21 years old).
	
15 If the student borrower on a loan dies after disbursement of all or part of the loan and the loan has not previously become a charged off loan due to non-payment or bankruptcy, then the outstanding principal and accrued interest balance on such loan shall be forgiven if the servicer is informed of the student borrower's death and receives acceptable proof of death. If the student borrower on a loan becomes totally and permanently disabled and the loan has not previously become a charged off loan due to non-payment or bankruptcy, the student borrower may apply to have the loan balance discharged by completing a discharge application.
16 The initial credit review is based on all the information you and your cosigner (if applicable) provide during the application process and the information obtained from your credit report (and any cosigner's credit report). If you pass the initial credit review, documentation will be requested to verify your identity and annual income and, if applicable, payoff documentation for any private student loan you request to refinance. A signed Loan Packet, including the Credit Agreement, Approval Disclosure and Applicant Self-Certification Form is required before a final loan decision is made. Your school will be required to certify the loan amount for the upcoming academic year/semester prior to disbursement.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
