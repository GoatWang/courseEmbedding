IT & Digital Media Solutions

In fast‐moving cloud and mobile environments where development and delivery speed is everything, DevOps professionals and enterprises in the digital ecosystem need partners that can meet significant global demands and short timeframes.

Regardless of geography, today’s Internet users require a high-quality online experience on a variety of devices – from computers, to tablets and mobile phones. That means content providers, digital retailers and all digital media companies need to ensure consistent uptime and fast speeds around the clock; anything less jeopardizes revenue growth.

Security
Keeping a secure environment for IT infrastructure and applications is a top priority in today’s data-centric enterprises and federal agencies. Business requires immediate access to the latest data, and today’s networks must perform to deliver on demand. But easy access to data carries certain risks. With the recent number of high-profile data breaches making the news, challenges involving security and compliance are certain to keep you up at night.
IT Security Risk is Increasing


QTS integrates our security expertise with best-of-breed technology to provide you with the highest level of physical and logical security. Rest assured, over 900 customers trust QTS to keep their data safe and sound.












Multi-layered security safeguards your data:

Physical Security
With physical security being the most visible, our customers and visitors cannot help but notice the setbacks, fencing, active guard patrols, ID checks, visitor screening, active video monitoring, biometric access control (both iris scans and fingerprints), and other factors utilized by QTS. 


With our on-site security professionals, and site access and monitoring systems, you will be confident that QTS provides an uncompromising level of security 24x7x365, from the property perimeter to the data center floor. 
                                        


Logical Security
Other areas of expertise and focus include information security, operations security, internal security, and logical security, with the latter being supported by two-factor authentication, testing with intrusion detection, penetration tests, and other aspects of logical access. The company also utilizes a wide array of additional security protocols and procedures. 
Since most security attacks occur from the inside, access to your network must be impenetrable to outsiders. QTS enforces strict security policies and partners with the leading industry providers to offer cutting-edge technology and premium support to ensure your network is reinforced.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

OVERLAND PARK, Kan. (AP) _ QTS Realty Trust Inc. (QTS) on Tuesday reported a key measure of profitability in its second quarter. The results met Wall Street expectations.
The Overland Park, Kansas-based real estate investment trust said it had funds from operations of $35 million, or 63 cents per share, in the period.
The average estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for funds from operations of 63 cents per share.
Funds from operations is a closely watched measure in the REIT industry. It takes net income and adds back items such as depreciation and amortization.
The company said it had net income of $4 million, or 8 cents per share.
The data center real estate investment trust posted revenue of $107.9 million in the period, falling short of Street forecasts. Eight analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $108 million.
QTS Realty expects full-year funds from operations in the range of $2.66 to $2.78 per share.
The company's shares have risen roughly 8 percent since the beginning of the year. In the final minutes of trading on Tuesday, shares hit $53.46, a fall of slightly more than 4 percent in the last 12 months.
