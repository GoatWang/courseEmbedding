FileMaker In-Product Updates
FileMaker 15 introduced a much welcomed improvement to the updating process: you can now upgrade your FileMaker Pro directly in Pro itself, instead of needing to hunt for an updater on a separate web page. But that’s not all – the updaters are significantly smaller in size, making downloads faster. With these changes FileMaker has modernized the updating process, which should ultimately result in more users on the latest version, a goal that aligns with FMI’s continued focus on security.
How it works
If there’s a new minor version available, you will be asked when you open FileMaker Pro if you’d like to install the update. You can elect to either install it, be reminded later or skip the version entirely. Unlike the previous versions of Pro where you would be taken to the Updates web page, the new version will be downloaded all within Pro itself. Once downloaded, you will be prompted to install the update and relaunch Pro. Doing so will complete the update process by replacing the current version of Pro with the new one.
Some odds and ends

In-product updates are only available on Pro. Server updates will still require going to the Updates page.
You can check for a new version at any time via Help–>Check for Updates, just like you could in previous versions.

You can turn off new version alerts the same way you could in previous versions, via unchecking the “Notify me when an update is available” option under Preferences.

In-product updates only apply to minor versions (e.g. 15v1 to 15v2). Major versions (e.g. 15 to 16) will still require downloading and running an installer outside of Pro.

Conclusion
Like all great features, in-product updates will become so natural so quickly that people will assume upgrading always worked this way. And now that the process is nearly effortless for users, I hope to see more frequent releases from FMI. As the popular software development saying goes, release early, and release often!

 Client Testimonials




"We needed a new system and we risked losing some of our biggest clients if we couldn't get our new database running within days. DB Services immediately came to the rescue and managed the project that provided us the entire custom database in only 17 DAYS. This achievement made an immediate positive impact to our business." 
Steve Horst, Managing Partner Universal Marketing Group


“We have worked with DB Services since 2000 and have been extremely pleased. They currently manage 5 vertical software products for New Image and excel in understanding our needs and the needs of our clients. Database Development Services is a strategic partner in the growth and success of our business.” 
Rich Jordan, President New Image Software Inc.


“Thank you for our new database system. We transitioned from a carbon copy paper based system to a digital database. The software has saved us time and money. We used to archive all our jobs in cabinets, now we can look up a job in seconds from anywhere. The software allows us to easily email estimates to our customers in pdf format. In a year there was a return on investment just from eliminating the purchasing of our carbon forms.” 
Todd Cartmel, Owner The Painting Edge


“We needed a solution that would simplify the administration of our responsibilities under our contract with the State of Indiana. We have seen a dramatic increase across the state in the number of potential foster and adoptive parents that have begun the preparation and training process. This increase has resulted in a significant opportunity for children available for adoption. That’s a big win for everyone! And it’s all because we can refer potential parents to the proper state contacts efficiently and quickly." 
Chris Morrison, Executive Director Indiana Foster Care & Adoption Association


“The new system allows us to create and track jobs for customers along with inventory, something we had been doing with separate word and spreadsheet files. Because it’s now so intuitive, new staff members are able to begin using the database immediately without our usual training session and ‘cheat sheets’ for getting around within the file.” 
Tom Andrews, President Turning Star, Inc.


“We were actually able to add more features than we thought would be possible within our budget. We always experienced a ‘can do’ attitude and DB Services was incredibly patient and easy to work with.” 
Courtney Hartman, Art Director Drake University


“Thank you for all of your expertise and valuable help. I am so grateful to have found DB Services.” 
Linda Findlay, Owner Mourning Discoveries


“The new FileMaker custom website interface is very user-friendly and easy to follow for our clients. In addition, it is much faster than the old Instant Web Publishing (IWP) interface. Thank you and all the others who have helped us out at DB Services. I am very grateful for the excellent service you provide us. Its nice to know we can call you for help if we have an issue.” 
Wayne Capek, President Floodplain Consultants

By Facsimile (for Eligible Institutions only):
(615) 866-3889 For Information or Confirmation by
Telephone:
1-800-735-7777, option 1      
Questions concerning the terms of the consent solicitation
should be directed to Evercore Partners at the following
telephone number: (212) 822-7584.
     The solicitation is being made by
Trico Shipping AS (the "Company") pursuant to the consent
solicitation statement dated September 3, 2010 (the "consent
solicitation statement"), only to registered holders ("holders") of
the notes. For purposes of the solicitation, The Depository Trust
Company ("DTC") has authorized the DTC participants set forth in
the position listing of DTC as of the close of business on
September 2, 2010 (the "record date") to execute a letter of
consent as if they were holders of the notes held of record in the
name of DTC or the name of its nominee. Accordingly, consents will
be accepted from DTC participants as holders. Consents will also be
accepted from any other person who has obtained a proxy in a form
reasonably acceptable to the Company (a form of which is included
herewith) which authorizes such other person (or person claiming
title by or through such other person) to deliver a consent on
behalf of the holder. Any beneficial owner whose notes are held
through a 

  




 
 broker, dealer, commercial bank,
trust company or other nominee and who wishes to consent should
contact the holder of its notes promptly and instruct such holder
to consent on its behalf.      Holders
who wish to consent to the proposed amendments must deliver their
properly completed and executed letter of consent by facsimile
transmission, or by overnight courier, hand delivery or mail, to
the Tabulation Agent (and not to the Company) at its facsimile
number or address set forth above for receipt prior to the
expiration date. However, the Company reserves the right to accept
any consent received by it, the trustee or the Tabulation Agent.
The method of delivery of this letter of consent and all other
required documents to the Tabulation Agent is at the risk of the
holder, and the delivery will be deemed made only when actually
received by the Tabulation Agent. In all cases, sufficient time
should be allowed to assure timely delivery. No letter of consent
should be sent to any person other than the Tabulation Agent.


  




 
 CONSENT Ladies and Gentlemen:
     The undersigned acknowledges receipt
of the consent solicitation statement and that the terms and
conditions of the consent solicitation statement shall be
incorporated in, and form a part of, this letter of consent, which

warrants that (i) the undersigned is a holder of the notes
indicated in the Signature Annex and has full power and authority
to take the action indicated below in respect of such notes,
(ii) in evaluating the solicitation and the consent payment,
the undersigned has made its own independent appraisal of the
solicitation and the consent payment and is not relying on any
statement, representation or warranty, express or implied, made by
the trustee, the Tabulation Agent, the Information Agent or the
Solicitation Agent not contained in the consent solicitation
statement or this letter of consent, and (iii) the undersigned
is not a person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by
or under direct or indirect common control with the Company. The
representations of the undersigned shall be deemed to be repeated
and reconfirmed at the time the supplemental indenture is executed.
The undersigned will, upon request, execute and deliver any
additional documents deemed by the Company to be necessary or
desirable to properly deliver the undersigned’s consent.
     In addition, the undersigned
acknowledges that, (i) the undersigned must comply with the
provisions of this letter of consent, and complete the information
required herein, to validly consent to the proposed amendments set
forth in the consent solicitation statement and (ii) a letter
of consent delivered pursuant to any one of the procedures
described under the heading "The Consent Solicitation—How to
Consent" in the consent solicitation statement will constitute a
binding agreement between the undersigned and the Company subject
to the terms of the solicitation.
     Provided the requisite consents are
received, the undersigned acknowledges (x) that the Company
