History[edit]
The company was founded in 1984 by George "Doc" Lopez, MD who developed a product known as the ClickLock to better secure IV lines after he lost a patient due to an accidental disconnect.[6] The ClickLock consisted of a protected needle and locking housing that prevented health care workers from being accidentally stuck by the I.V. needles.[7] The ClickLock was the first of many products focused on enhancing safety at the point of care, including the Clave family of needle-free vascular access devices and the Neutron Catheter Patency Device.
In 2006, ICU Medical introduced its first products into the oncology marketplace. The ChemoClave system from ICU Medical is a closed system transfer device (CSTD) that allows pharmacists and nurses to safely mix and administer hazardous drugs used to treat cancer patients without exposing themselves to these drugs.[8]
ICU Medical acquired the former Abbott Laboratories Critical Care business from Hospira in 2009 following a four-year business arrangement in which ICU acted as the manufacturer of the Hospira critical care product line.[9] The acquisition allowed ICU to obtain new manufacturing space in Salt Lake City, Utah, while it also broadened the company's footprint in the hospital marketplace with products designed for use in high acuity clinical settings like the operating room and intensive care unit.




Infusion Therapy: ICU Medical provides a line of needle-free IV connectors including the Neutron Catheter Patency Device (above) as well as a line of custom and stock IV sets.






Oncology: The Diana Hazardous Drug Compounding System is the latest advance from ICU Medical for the safe handling of hazardous drugs used to treat many forms of cancer.






Critical Care: The SafeSet Closed Blood Sampling System from ICU Medical helps clinicians conserve blood in the operating room and intensive care unit.


[citation needed]
With the February 2017 acquisition of the Hospira Infusion Systems business from Pfizer, ICU Medical became one of the leading pure-play infusion companies.[10]

Products[edit]
Infusion therapy[edit]
Over 90% of hospitalized patients receive some form of IV therapy during their stay.[11] As a result, infusion devices must be safe, reliable, and cost-effective. ICU Medical's infusion therapy products include a line of needle-free IV connectors that provide significant clinical advantage over other devices, along with a range of custom and stock infusion sets and kits for adult, pediatric, and neonatal applications.[12][13]
ICU Medical's line of needle-free connectors are mechanically and microbiologically closed systems help protect the patient's catheter from contamination that can otherwise lead to bloodstream infections. They feature a unique passive technology that cannot accept a needle, ensuring compliance with needle-free policies. These connectors can be used on all peripheral, arterial, and central venous catheters for the administration of IV fluids or medication, and can be used with blood products. No additional components or adapters are required to access the device, and no end caps are required for sterility. Featuring a dedicated internal fluid path, at no time does the internal fluid path come into contact with the exterior or outer housing of the devices. In addition, the devices' unique design features may help reduce the risk of bacterial contamination:[14]
The company launched the Neutron catheter patency device, a needle-free infusion access device that is the first and only device the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared to claim the ability to eliminate all types of reflux into a catheter.[15] Blood reflux, or blood backing up into the catheter, has been shown to cause catheter occlusion. Blood reflux can lead to an intraluminal thrombus, which may result in an inability to infuse IV fluids/medications, an inability to withdraw blood, and an increased risk of infection [16] The Neutron device eliminates reflux caused by external factors such as connecting and disconnecting a luer, and is the only device that can eliminate reflux caused by changes to a patients vascular pressure changes caused by coughing, sneezing, crying or vomiting. In clinical use, Neutron has been shown to reduce the instance of catheter occlusion by 50%.[17]
In 2015, ICU Medical acquired Excelsior Medical Corporation, a manufacturer of healthcare devices used to disinfect and protect access into a patient's bloodstream. Acquired products included the SwabCap and SwabFlush, as well as pre-filled saline and heparin flush syringes. The total purchase price for Excelsior was $59.5 million, however ICU immediately sold the operating assets of SwabFlush and pre-filled syringe businesses to Medline Industries, Inc. for $27 million.[18]
Oncology[edit]
Cancer is the world’s leading cause of death, claiming the lives of an estimated 7.9 million people in 2007 alone.[19] Experts expect these numbers to double before 2030.[19] The unsafe handling of hazardous drugs used to treat many forms of cancer has been recognized since the 1970s as a significant health hazard to workers. Studies have shown that workers can be at risk of exposure to these drugs throughout their lifecycle—from manufacture to distribution to use in the clinical or home care environment and all the way through to waste disposal. Healthcare workers who handle these drugs may be exposed by inhaling aerosols or dust generated during pharmacy preparation and nursing administration, or by direct contact with the skin during accidental needlesticks, spills, or spill cleanup.
ICU Medical's oncology product line is designed specifically to keep healthcare workers and patients safe from exposure to hazardous drugs. The line includes the ChemoClave closed system transfer device (CSTD) that allows for the safe mixing and administration of hazardous drugs. Recent studies found that the ChemoClave system protects clinicians from exposure to hazardous drugs, increases clinician satisfaction rates, costs less and generates less biohazardous waste than other commercially available CSTDs.[19][20] In 2012, the company introduced the Diana Hazardous drug compounding system, a user-controlled automated system that helps protect clinicians from exposure to hazardous drugs and accidental needlesticks while protecting the patient preparation from exposure to environmental contaminants.[21]
Critical care[edit]
ICU Medical's line of critical care products provides real-time hemodynamic monitoring, blood conservation solutions, oximetry catheter technology that helps optimize oxygen supply and demand, critical care catheters with no natural rubber latex components, and accurate and reliable hemodynamic transducer kits. The critical care portfolio provides clinicians with accurate, reliable, and real-time access to their patients’ cardiovascular and hemodynamic status in surgical and intensive care settings. In addition, ICU Medical's line of advanced sensor catheters, having no natural rubber latex components, helps keep patients safe from potentially lethal allergic reactions. Formerly the Abbott critical care business unit, ICU Medical acquired the Critical Care business from Hospira (itself a spin-off from Abbott) in 2009. Since then, the company has been focusing on streamlininging and modernizing the manufacturing processes for these products and actively developing new solutions to bring to market.
In 2016, ICU Medical Critical Care received United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) clearance for its new Cogent 2-in-1 hemodynamic monitoring system, the first and only hemodynamic monitoring system to accept both minimally invasive and invasive inputs, letting clinicians use a single monitor regardless of fluctuations in patient acuity and monitoring requirements.

Cancer is the world’s leading cause of death, claiming the lives of an estimated 7.9 million people in 2007 alone.[19] Experts expect these numbers to double before 2030.[19] The unsafe handling of hazardous drugs used to treat many forms of cancer has been recognized since the 1970s as a significant health hazard to workers. Studies have shown that workers can be at risk of exposure to these drugs throughout their lifecycle—from manufacture to distribution to use in the clinical or home care environment and all the way through to waste disposal. Healthcare workers who handle these drugs may be exposed by inhaling aerosols or dust generated during pharmacy preparation and nursing administration, or by direct contact with the skin during accidental needlesticks, spills, or spill cleanup.
ICU Medical's oncology product line is designed specifically to keep healthcare workers and patients safe from exposure to hazardous drugs. The line includes the ChemoClave closed system transfer device (CSTD) that allows for the safe mixing and administration of hazardous drugs. Recent studies found that the ChemoClave system protects clinicians from exposure to hazardous drugs, increases clinician satisfaction rates, costs less and generates less biohazardous waste than other commercially available CSTDs.[19][20] In 2012, the company introduced the Diana Hazardous drug compounding system, a user-controlled automated system that helps protect clinicians from exposure to hazardous drugs and accidental needlesticks while protecting the patient preparation from exposure to environmental contaminants.[21]
Critical care[edit]
ICU Medical's line of critical care products provides real-time hemodynamic monitoring, blood conservation solutions, oximetry catheter technology that helps optimize oxygen supply and demand, critical care catheters with no natural rubber latex components, and accurate and reliable hemodynamic transducer kits. The critical care portfolio provides clinicians with accurate, reliable, and real-time access to their patients’ cardiovascular and hemodynamic status in surgical and intensive care settings. In addition, ICU Medical's line of advanced sensor catheters, having no natural rubber latex components, helps keep patients safe from potentially lethal allergic reactions. Formerly the Abbott critical care business unit, ICU Medical acquired the Critical Care business from Hospira (itself a spin-off from Abbott) in 2009. Since then, the company has been focusing on streamlininging and modernizing the manufacturing processes for these products and actively developing new solutions to bring to market.
In 2016, ICU Medical Critical Care received United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) clearance for its new Cogent 2-in-1 hemodynamic monitoring system, the first and only hemodynamic monitoring system to accept both minimally invasive and invasive inputs, letting clinicians use a single monitor regardless of fluctuations in patient acuity and monitoring requirements.

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1984 by George "Doc" Lopez, MD who developed a product known as the ClickLock to better secure IV lines after he lost a patient due to an accidental disconnect.[6] The ClickLock consisted of a protected needle and locking housing that prevented health care workers from being accidentally stuck by the I.V. needles.[7] The ClickLock was the first of many products focused on enhancing safety at the point of care, including the Clave family of needle-free vascular access devices and the Neutron Catheter Patency Device.
In 2006, ICU Medical introduced its first products into the oncology marketplace. The ChemoClave system from ICU Medical is a closed system transfer device (CSTD) that allows pharmacists and nurses to safely mix and administer hazardous drugs used to treat cancer patients without exposing themselves to these drugs.[8]
ICU Medical acquired the former Abbott Laboratories Critical Care business from Hospira in 2009 following a four-year business arrangement in which ICU acted as the manufacturer of the Hospira critical care product line.[9] The acquisition allowed ICU to obtain new manufacturing space in Salt Lake City, Utah, while it also broadened the company's footprint in the hospital marketplace with products designed for use in high acuity clinical settings like the operating room and intensive care unit.




Infusion Therapy: ICU Medical provides a line of needle-free IV connectors including the Neutron Catheter Patency Device (above) as well as a line of custom and stock IV sets.






Oncology: The Diana Hazardous Drug Compounding System is the latest advance from ICU Medical for the safe handling of hazardous drugs used to treat many forms of cancer.






Critical Care: The SafeSet Closed Blood Sampling System from ICU Medical helps clinicians conserve blood in the operating room and intensive care unit.


[citation needed]
With the February 2017 acquisition of the Hospira Infusion Systems business from Pfizer, ICU Medical became one of the leading pure-play infusion companies.[10]

Products[edit]
Infusion therapy[edit]
Over 90% of hospitalized patients receive some form of IV therapy during their stay.[11] As a result, infusion devices must be safe, reliable, and cost-effective. ICU Medical's infusion therapy products include a line of needle-free IV connectors that provide significant clinical advantage over other devices, along with a range of custom and stock infusion sets and kits for adult, pediatric, and neonatal applications.[12][13]
ICU Medical's line of needle-free connectors are mechanically and microbiologically closed systems help protect the patient's catheter from contamination that can otherwise lead to bloodstream infections. They feature a unique passive technology that cannot accept a needle, ensuring compliance with needle-free policies. These connectors can be used on all peripheral, arterial, and central venous catheters for the administration of IV fluids or medication, and can be used with blood products. No additional components or adapters are required to access the device, and no end caps are required for sterility. Featuring a dedicated internal fluid path, at no time does the internal fluid path come into contact with the exterior or outer housing of the devices. In addition, the devices' unique design features may help reduce the risk of bacterial contamination:[14]
The company launched the Neutron catheter patency device, a needle-free infusion access device that is the first and only device the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared to claim the ability to eliminate all types of reflux into a catheter.[15] Blood reflux, or blood backing up into the catheter, has been shown to cause catheter occlusion. Blood reflux can lead to an intraluminal thrombus, which may result in an inability to infuse IV fluids/medications, an inability to withdraw blood, and an increased risk of infection [16] The Neutron device eliminates reflux caused by external factors such as connecting and disconnecting a luer, and is the only device that can eliminate reflux caused by changes to a patients vascular pressure changes caused by coughing, sneezing, crying or vomiting. In clinical use, Neutron has been shown to reduce the instance of catheter occlusion by 50%.[17]
In 2015, ICU Medical acquired Excelsior Medical Corporation, a manufacturer of healthcare devices used to disinfect and protect access into a patient's bloodstream. Acquired products included the SwabCap and SwabFlush, as well as pre-filled saline and heparin flush syringes. The total purchase price for Excelsior was $59.5 million, however ICU immediately sold the operating assets of SwabFlush and pre-filled syringe businesses to Medline Industries, Inc. for $27 million.[18]
Oncology[edit]
Cancer is the world’s leading cause of death, claiming the lives of an estimated 7.9 million people in 2007 alone.[19] Experts expect these numbers to double before 2030.[19] The unsafe handling of hazardous drugs used to treat many forms of cancer has been recognized since the 1970s as a significant health hazard to workers.

Healthcare workers who handle these drugs may be exposed by inhaling aerosols or dust generated during pharmacy preparation and nursing administration, or by direct contact with the skin during accidental needlesticks, spills, or spill cleanup.
ICU Medical's oncology product line is designed specifically to keep healthcare workers and patients safe from exposure to hazardous drugs. The line includes the ChemoClave closed system transfer device (CSTD) that allows for the safe mixing and administration of hazardous drugs. Recent studies found that the ChemoClave system protects clinicians from exposure to hazardous drugs, increases clinician satisfaction rates, costs less and generates less biohazardous waste than other commercially available CSTDs.[19][20] In 2012, the company introduced the Diana Hazardous drug compounding system, a user-controlled automated system that helps protect clinicians from exposure to hazardous drugs and accidental needlesticks while protecting the patient preparation from exposure to environmental contaminants.[21]
Critical care[edit]
ICU Medical's line of critical care products provides real-time hemodynamic monitoring, blood conservation solutions, oximetry catheter technology that helps optimize oxygen supply and demand, critical care catheters with no natural rubber latex components, and accurate and reliable hemodynamic transducer kits. The critical care portfolio provides clinicians with accurate, reliable, and real-time access to their patients’ cardiovascular and hemodynamic status in surgical and intensive care settings. In addition, ICU Medical's line of advanced sensor catheters, having no natural rubber latex components, helps keep patients safe from potentially lethal allergic reactions.

Since then, the company has been focusing on streamlininging and modernizing the manufacturing processes for these products and actively developing new solutions to bring to market.

ICU Medical Issues a Voluntary Nationwide Recall of One Lot of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection Due to the Presence of Particulate Matter


ICU Medical, Inc. is voluntarily recalling one lot of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP 1000 mL to the hospital/user level due to a confirmed customer complaint of particulate matter identified as stainless steel within a single flexible container.
Injection of particulate matter could potentially lead to limited adverse events such as allergic reactions, local irritation and inflammation in organs or tissues, or other serious adverse health consequences. Prior to administration, healthcare professionals, as instructed in the product labeling, should visually examine the product for particulate matter and discoloration and should discard if a defect is identified.

ICU Medical, Inc., a San Clemente, California-based company, is one of the world's leading pure-play infusion therapy companies with global operations and a wide-ranging product portfolio that includes IV solutions, IV smart pumps, dedicated and non-dedicated IV sets and needlefree connectors, along with pain management and safety software technology designed to help meet clinical, safety and workflow goals. In addition, the company manufactures automated pharmacy IV compounding systems with workflow technology, closed systems transfer devices for hazardous IV drugs, and cardiac monitoring systems to optimize patient fluid levels. [2]
ICU Medical’s products are designed to assist clinicians in enhancing patient safety and improving outcomes by helping prevent bloodstream infections and protecting healthcare workers from exposure to infectious diseases or hazardous drugs.[3] In addition, the company's IV medication compounding and delivery products help improve medication and dosing accuracy while improving clinical workflows. [4] ICU Medical has been named one of the 100 Most Trustworthy Companies in America by Forbes Magazine.[5]

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1984 by George "Doc" Lopez, MD who developed a product known as the ClickLock to better secure IV lines after he lost a patient due to an accidental disconnect.[6] The ClickLock consisted of a protected needle and locking housing that prevented health care workers from being accidentally stuck by the I.V. needles.[7] The ClickLock was the first of many products focused on enhancing safety at the point of care, including the Clave family of needle-free vascular access devices and the Neutron Catheter Patency Device.
In 2006, ICU Medical introduced its first products into the oncology marketplace. The ChemoClave system from ICU Medical is a closed system transfer device (CSTD) that allows pharmacists and nurses to safely mix and administer hazardous drugs used to treat cancer patients without exposing themselves to these drugs.[8]
ICU Medical acquired the former Abbott Laboratories Critical Care business from Hospira in 2009 following a four-year business arrangement in which ICU acted as the manufacturer of the Hospira critical care product line.[9] The acquisition allowed ICU to obtain new manufacturing space in Salt Lake City, Utah, while it also broadened the company's footprint in the hospital marketplace with products designed for use in high acuity clinical settings like the operating room and intensive care unit.




Infusion Therapy: ICU Medical provides a line of needle-free IV connectors including the Neutron Catheter Patency Device (above) as well as a line of custom and stock IV sets.






Oncology: The Diana Hazardous Drug Compounding System is the latest advance from ICU Medical for the safe handling of hazardous drugs used to treat many forms of cancer.






Critical Care: The SafeSet Closed Blood Sampling System from ICU Medical helps clinicians conserve blood in the operating room and intensive care unit.


[citation needed]
With the February 2017 acquisition of the Hospira Infusion Systems business from Pfizer, ICU Medical became one of the leading pure-play infusion companies.[10]

Products[edit]
Infusion therapy[edit]
Over 90% of hospitalized patients receive some form of IV therapy during their stay.[11] As a result, infusion devices must be safe, reliable, and cost-effective. ICU Medical's infusion therapy products include a line of needle-free IV connectors that provide significant clinical advantage over other devices, along with a range of custom and stock infusion sets and kits for adult, pediatric, and neonatal applications.[12][13]
ICU Medical's line of needle-free connectors are mechanically and microbiologically closed systems help protect the patient's catheter from contamination that can otherwise lead to bloodstream infections. They feature a unique passive technology that cannot accept a needle, ensuring compliance with needle-free policies. These connectors can be used on all peripheral, arterial, and central venous catheters for the administration of IV fluids or medication, and can be used with blood products. No additional components or adapters are required to access the device, and no end caps are required for sterility. Featuring a dedicated internal fluid path, at no time does the internal fluid path come into contact with the exterior or outer housing of the devices. In addition, the devices' unique design features may help reduce the risk of bacterial contamination:[14]
The company launched the Neutron catheter patency device, a needle-free infusion access device that is the first and only device the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared to claim the ability to eliminate all types of reflux into a catheter.[15] Blood reflux, or blood backing up into the catheter, has been shown to cause catheter occlusion. Blood reflux can lead to an intraluminal thrombus, which may result in an inability to infuse IV fluids/medications, an inability to withdraw blood, and an increased risk of infection [16] The Neutron device eliminates reflux caused by external factors such as connecting and disconnecting a luer, and is the only device that can eliminate reflux caused by changes to a patients vascular pressure changes caused by coughing, sneezing, crying or vomiting. In clinical use, Neutron has been shown to reduce the instance of catheter occlusion by 50%.[17]
In 2015, ICU Medical acquired Excelsior Medical Corporation, a manufacturer of healthcare devices used to disinfect and protect access into a patient's bloodstream. Acquired products included the SwabCap and SwabFlush, as well as pre-filled saline and heparin flush syringes. The total purchase price for Excelsior was $59.5 million, however ICU immediately sold the operating assets of SwabFlush and pre-filled syringe businesses to Medline Industries, Inc. for $27 million.[18]
Oncology[edit]
Cancer is the world’s leading cause of death, claiming the lives of an estimated 7.9 million people in 2007 alone.[19] Experts expect these numbers to double before 2030.[19] The unsafe handling of hazardous drugs used to treat many forms of cancer has been recognized since the 1970s as a significant health hazard to workers. Studies have shown that workers can be at risk of exposure to these drugs throughout their lifecycle—from manufacture to distribution to use in the clinical or home care environment and all the way through to waste disposal. Healthcare workers who handle these drugs may be exposed by inhaling aerosols or dust generated during pharmacy preparation and nursing administration, or by direct contact with the skin during accidental needlesticks, spills, or spill cleanup.
ICU Medical's oncology product line is designed specifically to keep healthcare workers and patients safe from exposure to hazardous drugs. The line includes the ChemoClave closed system transfer device (CSTD) that allows for the safe mixing and administration of hazardous drugs. Recent studies found that the ChemoClave system protects clinicians from exposure to hazardous drugs, increases clinician satisfaction rates, costs less and generates less biohazardous waste than other commercially available CSTDs.[19][20] In 2012, the company introduced the Diana Hazardous drug compounding system, a user-controlled automated system that helps protect clinicians from exposure to hazardous drugs and accidental needlesticks while protecting the patient preparation from exposure to environmental contaminants.[21]
Critical care[edit]
ICU Medical's line of critical care products provides real-time hemodynamic monitoring, blood conservation solutions, oximetry catheter technology that helps optimize oxygen supply and demand, critical care catheters with no natural rubber latex components, and accurate and reliable hemodynamic transducer kits. The critical care portfolio provides clinicians with accurate, reliable, and real-time access to their patients’ cardiovascular and hemodynamic status in surgical and intensive care settings. In addition, ICU Medical's line of advanced sensor catheters, having no natural rubber latex components, helps keep patients safe from potentially lethal allergic reactions. Formerly the Abbott critical care business unit, ICU Medical acquired the Critical Care business from Hospira (itself a spin-off from Abbott) in 2009. Since then, the company has been focusing on streamlininging and modernizing the manufacturing processes for these products and actively developing new solutions to bring to market.
In 2016, ICU Medical Critical Care received United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) clearance for its new Cogent 2-in-1 hemodynamic monitoring system, the first and only hemodynamic monitoring system to accept both minimally invasive and invasive inputs, letting clinicians use a single monitor regardless of fluctuations in patient acuity and monitoring requirements.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1984 by George "Doc" Lopez, MD who developed a product known as the ClickLock to better secure IV lines after he lost a patient due to an accidental disconnect.[6] The ClickLock consisted of a protected needle and locking housing that prevented health care workers from being accidentally stuck by the I.V. needles.[7] The ClickLock was the first of many products focused on enhancing safety at the point of care, including the Clave family of needle-free vascular access devices and the Neutron Catheter Patency Device.
In 2006, ICU Medical introduced its first products into the oncology marketplace. The ChemoClave system from ICU Medical is a closed system transfer device (CSTD) that allows pharmacists and nurses to safely mix and administer hazardous drugs used to treat cancer patients without exposing themselves to these drugs.[8]
ICU Medical acquired the former Abbott Laboratories Critical Care business from Hospira in 2009 following a four-year business arrangement in which ICU acted as the manufacturer of the Hospira critical care product line.[9] The acquisition allowed ICU to obtain new manufacturing space in Salt Lake City, Utah, while it also broadened the company's footprint in the hospital marketplace with products designed for use in high acuity clinical settings like the operating room and intensive care unit.




Infusion Therapy: ICU Medical provides a line of needle-free IV connectors including the Neutron Catheter Patency Device (above) as well as a line of custom and stock IV sets.






Oncology: The Diana Hazardous Drug Compounding System is the latest advance from ICU Medical for the safe handling of hazardous drugs used to treat many forms of cancer.






Critical Care: The SafeSet Closed Blood Sampling System from ICU Medical helps clinicians conserve blood in the operating room and intensive care unit.


[citation needed]
With the February 2017 acquisition of the Hospira Infusion Systems business from Pfizer, ICU Medical became one of the leading pure-play infusion companies.[10]

Products[edit]
Infusion therapy[edit]
Over 90% of hospitalized patients receive some form of IV therapy during their stay.[11] As a result, infusion devices must be safe, reliable, and cost-effective. ICU Medical's infusion therapy products include a line of needle-free IV connectors that provide significant clinical advantage over other devices, along with a range of custom and stock infusion sets and kits for adult, pediatric, and neonatal applications.[12][13]
ICU Medical's line of needle-free connectors are mechanically and microbiologically closed systems help protect the patient's catheter from contamination that can otherwise lead to bloodstream infections. They feature a unique passive technology that cannot accept a needle, ensuring compliance with needle-free policies. These connectors can be used on all peripheral, arterial, and central venous catheters for the administration of IV fluids or medication, and can be used with blood products. No additional components or adapters are required to access the device, and no end caps are required for sterility. Featuring a dedicated internal fluid path, at no time does the internal fluid path come into contact with the exterior or outer housing of the devices. In addition, the devices' unique design features may help reduce the risk of bacterial contamination:[14]
The company launched the Neutron catheter patency device, a needle-free infusion access device that is the first and only device the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared to claim the ability to eliminate all types of reflux into a catheter.[15] Blood reflux, or blood backing up into the catheter, has been shown to cause catheter occlusion. Blood reflux can lead to an intraluminal thrombus, which may result in an inability to infuse IV fluids/medications, an inability to withdraw blood, and an increased risk of infection [16] The Neutron device eliminates reflux caused by external factors such as connecting and disconnecting a luer, and is the only device that can eliminate reflux caused by changes to a patients vascular pressure changes caused by coughing, sneezing, crying or vomiting. In clinical use, Neutron has been shown to reduce the instance of catheter occlusion by 50%.[17]
In 2015, ICU Medical acquired Excelsior Medical Corporation, a manufacturer of healthcare devices used to disinfect and protect access into a patient's bloodstream. Acquired products included the SwabCap and SwabFlush, as well as pre-filled saline and heparin flush syringes. The total purchase price for Excelsior was $59.5 million, however ICU immediately sold the operating assets of SwabFlush and pre-filled syringe businesses to Medline Industries, Inc. for $27 million.[18]
Oncology[edit]
Cancer is the world’s leading cause of death, claiming the lives of an estimated 7.9 million people in 2007 alone.[19] Experts expect these numbers to double before 2030.[19] The unsafe handling of hazardous drugs used to treat many forms of cancer has been recognized since the 1970s as a significant health hazard to workers. Studies have shown that workers can be at risk of exposure to these drugs throughout their lifecycle—from manufacture to distribution to use in the clinical or home care environment and all the way through to waste disposal. Healthcare workers who handle these drugs may be exposed by inhaling aerosols or dust generated during pharmacy preparation and nursing administration, or by direct contact with the skin during accidental needlesticks, spills, or spill cleanup.
ICU Medical's oncology product line is designed specifically to keep healthcare workers and patients safe from exposure to hazardous drugs. The line includes the ChemoClave closed system transfer device (CSTD) that allows for the safe mixing and administration of hazardous drugs. Recent studies found that the ChemoClave system protects clinicians from exposure to hazardous drugs, increases clinician satisfaction rates, costs less and generates less biohazardous waste than other commercially available CSTDs.[19][20] In 2012, the company introduced the Diana Hazardous drug compounding system, a user-controlled automated system that helps protect clinicians from exposure to hazardous drugs and accidental needlesticks while protecting the patient preparation from exposure to environmental contaminants.[21]
Critical care[edit]
ICU Medical's line of critical care products provides real-time hemodynamic monitoring, blood conservation solutions, oximetry catheter technology that helps optimize oxygen supply and demand, critical care catheters with no natural rubber latex components, and accurate and reliable hemodynamic transducer kits. The critical care portfolio provides clinicians with accurate, reliable, and real-time access to their patients’ cardiovascular and hemodynamic status in surgical and intensive care settings. In addition, ICU Medical's line of advanced sensor catheters, having no natural rubber latex components, helps keep patients safe from potentially lethal allergic reactions. Formerly the Abbott critical care business unit, ICU Medical acquired the Critical Care business from Hospira (itself a spin-off from Abbott) in 2009. Since then, the company has been focusing on streamlininging and modernizing the manufacturing processes for these products and actively developing new solutions to bring to market.
In 2016, ICU Medical Critical Care received United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) clearance for its new Cogent 2-in-1 hemodynamic monitoring system, the first and only hemodynamic monitoring system to accept both minimally invasive and invasive inputs, letting clinicians use a single monitor regardless of fluctuations in patient acuity and monitoring requirements.

Company Overview
ICU Medical connects patients and caregivers through safe, life saving, life enhancing medical devices.
 
We are one of the world’s leading pure-play infusion therapy companies, with global operations and a wide-ranging product portfolio that includes IV solutions, IV smart pumps, dedicated and non-dedicated IV sets and needlefree connectors, along with pain management and safety software technology designed to help meet clinical, safety and workflow goals. In addition, we manufacture automated pharmacy IV compounding systems with workflow technology, closed systems transfer devices for hazardous IV drugs, and cardiac monitoring systems to optimize patient fluid levels.
With the acquisition of the Hospira Infusion Systems business from Pfizer in February 2017, we are building an entirely new organization—one that is wholly focused on infusion therapy and committed to delivering quality, innovation, and value to our customers worldwide.
