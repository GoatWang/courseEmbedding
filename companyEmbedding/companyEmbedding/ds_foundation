Powder foundation makeup
A popular part of makeup routines, foundation can set your face up for lasting application of other cosmetics, reduce shine and keep skin looking fresh. Powder foundation can give you the coverage and color you want with the soft texture of powder that's lightweight and non-greasy. CoverGirl, Maybelline and Neutrogena offer foundation in a variety of shades, formulas and application methods here at Walgreens.com.
A powder foundation for you
Choose from pressed powder foundation and loose mineral foundation in a wide range of shades to give you the coverage you desire. There are even powder foundations that are formulated to not irritate sensitive skin. In addition to powder foundation makeup, you also can find other makeup products here such as liquid foundation, concealer, and even tinted moisturizer. Have your beauty routine at the ready with cosmetics found here at Walgreens.com.
Applicators for your favorite cosmetics
Help make your foundation and other makeup looks its best with an applicator that fits your needs. Choose from sponges, wedges or a variety of cosmetic brushes in multiple sizes for different areas of the face. You'll also find cotton balls and swabs for use with many cosmetics, from cover-up to eyeshadow.

✔ Oily

Finish:
✔ Natural

What it is:
A 12-hour wear, creamy clay foundation stick that delivers weightless, natural-looking coverage and nutrients.

What it does:
 Clay Stick Foundation is a buildable, powder-to-liquid formula that melts into your skin for medium-to-full coverage, leaving a natural finish that looks and feels just like your own skin. Micro-encapsulated powders then burst with your body heat to keep you shine- and cake-free. The vegan formula features antioxidant vitamins C, E, and Amazonian clay, a skin-balancing powerhouse that hydrates or mattifies, depending on your skin type. The guilt-free blend is free of any harsh chemicals, including talc, gluten, sulfates, and parabens, and it provides buildable, creamy coverage. Use it on-the-go, as a spot concealer, or in lighter or darker shades to highlight and contourjust swipe, blend, and go.

What it is formulated WITHOUT:
- Parabens
- Sulfates
- Phthalates

What else you need to know:
 This product is vegan, hypoallergenic, dermatologist tested, and free of gluten, talc, and artificial fragrance.





Suggested Usage:
-For medium coverage, apply with the smoothie blender foundation brush. For fuller coverage, apply with a blending sponge.
-Twist-up foundation and swipe directly onto skin, concentrating coverage at the center of the face to cover redness, uneven skintone, hyperpigmentation, pores, and other imperfections. 
-Blend outward in small circular motions toward the jaw and hairline using tarte’s Smoothie Blender Foundation Brush or a blending sponge.
-Tip: Dot and blend foundation directly over acne, spots, or scars to conceal, or wear it a few shades lighter or darker as a creamy highlighting and contouring stick.

VOLTEX® 
The world’s leading Bentonite-Geotextile Waterproofing System.
More than 50 years of proven performance. Designed for both vertical and horizontal foundation surfaces, VOLTEX incorporates the high-swelling and self-sealing properties of VOLCLAY® sodium bentonite to form a monolithic, low permeable membrane to protect the structure from water ingress. VOLTEX contains zero VOCs and can be installed on green concrete in almost any weather condition.

Durable Construction 
VOLTEX is ideal for waterproofing under slabs and property line applications. Under slabs, VOLTEX can be installed directly over a properly prepared substrate without the need of a concrete mud slab. Its durable composite construction resists damage from tradesman installing reinforcing steel over it and inclement weather. With the durability of the needle-punched composite and the ability to self-heal, VOLTEX offers major construction advantages over adhered sheet membrane and fluid applied waterproofing.
For property line applications, VOLTEX is simply installed directly to the retention wall and then the concrete is poured directly against it using a single sided form. Other applications include backfilled concrete foundation walls and cut-and-cover tunnels.
Exceptional Waterproofing Performance:

Protection from Water Ingress:

More than 50 years of proven performance has made VOLTEX the world’s leading Bentonite-Geotextile Waterproofing System.
Can self-seal small cracks while forming watertight laps at the seams. 
Provides a strong mechanical bond to poured concrete.
Proven effective in structures under continuous or intermittent hydrostatic pressure—up to 70m (231 ft). 


Installation Benefits and Features:

Fast and Easy:

Overlapping seams with mechanical fasteners eliminates installation variables in the field.
Its durable composite construction eliminates the need for a mud slab.

Versatility:

Can be installed in virtually any weather condition, including freezing temperatures and damp conditions.
Can be installed on green concrete without primers or adhesives.
Proven effective in both vertical and horizontal applications—i.e., backfilled and property-line walls.

COREFLEX®

Thermoplastic waterproofing membrane with active polymer core (APC).
Setting the standard for waterproofing membrane strength, durability and performance for more then 50 years.
COREFLEX consists of a thermoplastic membrane integrally bonded to a proprietary Active Polymer Core (APC) layer. Combined with fully welded seams, this provides the ultimate waterproofing protection. Whether your project requires foundation waterproofing, plaza deck restoration, or green roof construction, COREFLEX provides superior waterproofing performance.

The COREFLEX reinforced thermoplastic membrane is engineered to resist high hydrostatic pressure and groundwater contaminants typical of foundation conditions. In addition to waterproofing performance,
the membrane has an extremely low water vapor transmission that qualifies it as a Class “A” Vapor Retarder per ASTM E1745.

ORDER SAMPLES 



Dual membrane protection
If COREFLEX’s thermoplastic membrane component is ever punctured or damaged, the superior water barrier performance continues with an APC technology layer that is engineered to actively control water ingress by swelling to produce a reliable seal at the breach. To maximize the performance of the APC Technology, the layer is installed in direct contact with the concrete to be waterproofed, thus preventing water ingress into the structure.
With COREFLEX, each membrane overlap seam utilizes both a conventional weld and an overlap assembly of the APC Technology to assure water-tightness. This combination of passive and active barrier technologies provides enhanced seam performance and eliminates the reliance of seam integrity strictly on installation labor.

Exceptional waterproofing performance:

Protection from water Ingress:

All seams are heat welded together to form a strong, monolithic waterproofing membrane.
Incorporating a high molecular weight plasticizer, the PVC membrane properties will remain intact through the life of the product. 

Protection from contaminants:

 The APC and PVC resists harsh contaminants, including brownfield sites and remedial plaza decks over existing membranes.
COREFLEX can solve both water and gas barrier concerns as a Class “A” Vapor Barrier and Certified Methane Barrier (City of Los Angeles).


Installation benefits and features:

Fast and easy:

With remedial plaza-deck construction COREFLEX can be installed over most existing membranes, dramatically reducing exposure time of finished space.  
No kettles, solvents, fumes or open flames necessary. 
Faster dry-in time than traditional systems.

Versatility:

A true dual-membrane waterproofing system in a single application. The PVC layer of COREFLEX also serves as a root barrier, reducing the number of assembly components for green roof applications.
