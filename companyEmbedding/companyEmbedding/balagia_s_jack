 Jack Balagia, Exxon Mobil Assistant General Counsel, is expected to be promoted to General Counsel March 1. 


Jack Balagia, assistant general counsel of Exxon Mobil, is expected to be elected general counsel, effective March 1, according to an internal company memo.

											Randall Ebner






	Jack Balagia, vice president and general counsel, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), has announced his intention to retire effective Nov. 1, 2016, after more than 18 years of service.

	It is anticipated that the board of directors will elect Randall Ebner as vice president and general counsel, Exxon Mobil Corporation. Ebner is currently assistant general counsel, Exxon Mobil Corporation.

	A native of Austin, Texas, Balagia joined the Exxon Company, USA Law Department in May 1998 in Houston as counsel in the litigation group. He became coordinator for Upstream litigation in 1999 and assistant general counsel in 2004. He was named to his current position in March 2010.

	Balagia, who will reach the mandatory retirement age of 65 in October, is a member of numerous professional associations, including a member of the Board of Directors of the National Center for State Courts, co-chair of the Civil Justice Reform Group, and vice chair of the University of Texas Law School Foundation Board of Trustees.

	Balagia earned his J.D. degree from the University of Texas at Austin School of Law and a bachelor’s degree at the University of Texas at Austin.

	Ebner joined the Exxon Company, USA Law Department in May 1980 in New Orleans, where he was an attorney in the litigation group. He became coordinator of Upstream litigation in Houston in 1998 and undertook several special assignments before being named chief attorney of ExxonMobil Chemical Company in 2000 and chief attorney of ExxonMobil Gas & Power Marketing Company in 2003.

	Ebner was named assistant general counsel for the corporation in 2009.

	Born in Jersey City, New Jersey, Ebner earned a J.D. degree from Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana, and a bachelor’s degree from Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine.

Maryann, New Jersey
