Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Avon Products (NYSE:AVP) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 3 Hold Ratings, 2 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.40)Consensus Price Target: $5.90 (61.64% upside)

Diversification does not assure a profit nor does it protect against loss of principal.





Certificates of deposit (CDs) offered through American Century Brokerage are issued by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-insured institutions, and are subject to change and availability. There is a $55 early termination fee and possible market value adjustments. Brokered CDs will fluctuate in market value between purchase date and maturity date due to their ability to be sold on the secondary market. Because the secondary market for CDs is generally illiquid, a significant loss of principal could result if your CD is sold prior to maturity. American Century Brokerage makes no judgment as to the creditworthiness of the issuing institution and does not endorse or recommend the CDs in any way.

Judge Beth Phillips of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri Tosses Former Exec's Retaliation Case Against American Century Cos. Inc
Nov 24 15
Judge Beth Phillips of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri once again threw a lawsuit out of court that was filed against American Century Cos. Inc. by Tom Kmak, former CEO of its Retirement Plan Services subsidiary. Kmak argued that the company retaliated against him for testifying against it in an arbitration case. American Century was embroiled in a dispute with JPMorgan Chase & Co., and Kmak was called to testify. The case ended in 2011 with American Century winning a $373 million judgment. After the winning the arbitration against JPMorgan Chase, American Century used its call rights on company stock Kmak bought while he was employed there from 1990 to 2003. He argued that the move cost him about $3.25 million in lost value and was done in retaliation. American Century argued that it regularly called in the stock of former employees to repurchase it and put it back into the company. The company had no written policy related to the timing of calling in shares, but typically waited about 18 months. However, in this case it actually waited longer because the company was embroiled in the legal battle with JPMorgan and didn't want the call of Kmak's shares to become an issue in that case. A decision was made to wait until after the case was over and then call the stock, which the company did. The judge ruled in favor of American Century, saying the company proved that calling in stock was a regular practice and Kmak didn't provide proof that the call was being done to punish him for participating in the arbitration with JP Morgan. This is the second time a court issued a summary judgment throwing out Kmak's lawsuit against American Century. The first time was in February 2013, but the court allowed Kmak to file an amended complaint to keep the suit going. This time, however, Phillips denied Kmak's request to file another amended complaint.

CA Inc. (NASDAQ:CA) was downgraded by Zacks Investment Research from a “buy” rating to a “hold” rating in a report released on Monday. 
According to Zacks, “CA is a leading information technology (IT) management software company. We are optimistic about CA’s acquisition strategy, which has enhanced its IT management, software and services portfolio. Moreover, we believe that the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by them will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model. Additionally, CA’s “go to market” sales strategy integrates the commercial functions of sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight, which helps it in lowering costs, thereby improving the bottom line. Nonetheless, intensifying competition from peers, an uncertain economic environment, currency headwinds and the weak IT spending forecast by Gartner are other concerns. Notably, shares of the company has underperformed the broader market over the last one year period.”
Several other equities analysts have also recently weighed in on CA. Citigroup Inc.  reissued a “neutral” rating and set a $34.00 price objective (up previously from $33.00) on shares of CA in a research report on Sunday, May 14th. DA Davidson  reissued a “neutral” rating and set a $12.00 price objective on shares of CA in a research report on Friday, May 19th. BidaskClub cut CA from a “hold” rating to a “sell” rating in a research report on Saturday, July 1st. Raymond James Financial, Inc.  reissued a “market perform” rating on shares of CA in a research report on Thursday, June 22nd. Finally, Sanford C. Bernstein  reissued an “underperform” rating and set a $28.00 price objective on shares of CA in a research report on Wednesday, June 28th. Four equities research analysts have rated the stock with a sell rating, eight have assigned  a hold rating and five have given a buy rating to the stock. CA currently has an average rating of “Hold” and an average price target of $35.10.




Shares of CA (NASDAQ CA) opened at 34.06 on Monday. The company’s 50 day moving average price is $33.34 and its 200 day moving average price is $32.43. The stock has a market capitalization of $14.23 billion, a P/E ratio of 18.41 and a beta of 0.87. CA has a one year low of $30.01 and a one year high of $36.54. 
CA (NASDAQ:CA) last released its quarterly earnings results on Thursday, May 11th. The technology company reported $0.54 earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter, topping the consensus estimate of $0.49 by $0.05. The company had revenue of $1.01 billion during the quarter, compared to the consensus estimate of $996.59 million. CA had a return on equity of 17.15% and a net margin of 19.20%.
