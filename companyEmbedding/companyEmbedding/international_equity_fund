2017 Investment Outlook


































The Long Cycle Continues





We expect the long post-crisis economic recovery to continue in 2017. As a base case, we think growth is poised to broaden out to more countries, with the global economy drawing on more sources of strength than at any point since 2010.
From an investment perspective, our base case view is broadly supportive for risk assets. We prefer equities over credit and credit over rates, but we expect low returns from these traditional exposures given 1) elevated valuations, 2) limited upside for corporate earnings from current levels and 3) limits to economic growth potential. Broadening exposure beyond conventional stocks and bonds, identifying opportunities in emerging markets and deploying more dynamic asset allocation strategies are some ways to adapt.
In some respects, our outlook represents an extension of the same long cycle we envisioned heading into 2016. The key difference for 2017 revolves around four emerging transitions. Populism is challenging globalism and creating new tail risks. Concerns about low growth are giving way to concerns about inflation. Years of focus on monetary policy are giving way to a close watch over fiscal policy. And concerns about new regulation are acceding to hopes for de-regulation.
Transition will be an evolving theme in 2017, and we will be re-visiting it in our publications throughout the year. In this Investment Outlook, we highlight specific signposts we will be watching, both to gauge the pace of transition and to test our base case view on the key investment questions.









Three Key Questions







Is it time to de-risk?
Is it time to de-risk?
No. We think de-risking would be premature, at
least from a purely return-generating standpoint. We
expect the macro environment to remain supportive
of risk assets during 2017 amid a slow-but-steady
expansion in developed markets and an acceleration
of growth in some emerging markets.

What’s driving the expansion?
What’s driving the expansion?
We believe this is a slow-growth recovery best
explained by cyclical economic drivers. We believe
the concerns about the developed world being mired
in a pattern of underinvestment and stalled growth—
so-called secular stagnation—are overdone.

Where do we see opportunities?
Where do we see opportunities?
In a low-return world, we look for sources of
return beyond conventional stock and bond market
approaches. We also think range-bound or volatile
markets create opportunities for more dynamic
investment strategies.

Transitions We’re Watching in 2017


















												Globalism to Populism
											



The biggest transition in the current environment is a shift away from globalism to a rising populist trend.















												Stagnation to Inflation
											



We expect concerns around potential secular stagnation to give way to a more inflationary paradigm in the US.















												Monetary to Fiscal Policy
											



The focus for stimulus is shifting toward fiscal spending, as central banks are stretching toward the limits of their easing ability.
















												Regulation to De-Regulation
											



We see the potential for greater regulatory divergence globally and the potential for competitive de-regulation.

The performance information quoted above represent past performance, which is not a guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted.



Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund: As with all mutual funds, an investment in the Fund is subject to investment risks, including, without limitation, market risk, investment style risk, investment advisor risk, market sector risk, equity securities risk, portfolio turnover risk, foreign securities risk, and other risks as set forth in the Fund’s prospectus. Foreign investing involves special risks such as risk of loss from currency fluctuation or political or economic uncertainty.
*“Net Operating Expenses” are based upon actual expenses incurred by the Fund’s Investor Shares for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. The Advisor has entered into an Expense Limitation Agreement with the International Equity Fund under which it has agreed to reduce the amount of the investment advisory fees to be paid to the Advisor by the International Equity Fund and to assume other expenses of the International Equity Fund, if necessary, in an amount that limits the International Equity Fund’s annual operating expenses (other than interest, taxes, brokerage commissions, acquired fund fees and expenses, other expenditures which are capitalized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, other extraordinary expenses not incurred in the ordinary course of the International Equity Fund’s business, and amounts, if any, payable under a Rule 12b-1 distribution plan) to not more than 1.00% until July 31, 2017. The Expense Limitation Agreement may not be terminated by either party prior to that date. Subject to certain conditions such as Fund asset levels being at certain thresholds and operating expenses for the International Equity Fund being less than the operating expense limit for the International Equity Fund, the Mid- Cap Fund may at a later date reimburse the Advisor for fees waived or limited and other expenses assumed by the Advisor pursuant to the Expense Limitation Agreement. Reimbursement for fees previously waived are subject to Board approval and are only applicable to fees waived or limited and other expenses assumed by the Advisor in the three (3) fiscal years. See the “Management of the Funds-Expense Limitation Agreements” section in the prospectus for more detailed information.
EAFE-The MCSI EAFE Index (Europe, Australia, Far East) is a free float-adjusted market capitalization index that is designed to measure the equity market performance of developed markets excluding the U.S. and Canada. AC World (ex US)-The MSCI All Country World Index excluding the U.S. is a free-float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index that is designed to measure the equity market performance of developed and emerging markets. Morningstar Foreign Large Growth portfolios focus on high-priced growth stocks, mainly outside of the United States. Most of these portfolios divide their assets among a dozen or more developed markets, including Japan, Britain, France, and Germany. These portfolios primarily invest in stocks that have market caps in the top 70% of each economically integrated market (such as Europe or Asia ex-Japan). Growth is defined based on fast growth (high growth rates for earnings, sales, book value, and cash flow) and high valuations (high price ratios and low dividend yields). These portfolios typically will have less than 20% of assets invested in U.S. stocks.  Morningstar Foreign Large Blend portfolios invest in a variety of big international stocks. Most of these divide their assets among a dozen or more developed markets, including Japan, Britain, France, and Germany. These portfolios primarily invest in stocks that have market caps in the top 70% of each economically integrated market (such as Europe or Asia ex-Japan). The blend style is assigned to portfolios where neither growth nor value characteristics predominate.  Annualized Total Return

SUB-ADVISER        


TSW has been cultivating a rich tradition of value investing since 1969. The firm manages long-term investment assets for corporations, public funds, insurance companies, endowments, foundations, Taft-Hartley organizations and individuals. TSW's disciplined investment process is based on a deeply held value investing philosophy that has been honed through decades of experience to identify attractive risk/return opportunities. The keys to TSW's long-term investment track record is a consistently applied philosophy, the quality and consistency of the decision-making process and an experienced team of high-caliber individuals.













30-DAY SEC YIELD

The 30-Day SEC Yield is computed in accordance with a standardized method prescribed by rules of the SEC. The 30-day SEC Yield is computed by dividing the fund's investment income per share earned during a particular 30-day base period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the base period, and then annualizing the result. The 30-day SEC Yield is calculated at each month end and updated within the first ten business days of the following month. These yields reflect the reimbursements or waivers of certain expense. Had fees not been waived and/or expenses reimbursed, the yields would have been lower.            

12-MONTH DISTRIBUTION YIELD

The 12-Month distribution yield is calculated by taking the sum of all distributions occurring over the previous twelve calendar months and dividing the result by the Fund's Net Asset Value (NAV) as of the date of the previous month-end. The distribution yield represents a 12-month historical distribution and does not represent the total return of the Fund and is not necessarily an indication of future distributions or yield. For Funds that have been in operation for less than one year, an annualized distribution yield is calculated by annualizing the Fund's historical distributions to date and dividing the result by the Fund's Net Asset Value (NAV) as of the date of the previous month-end. The annualized distribution yield represents an estimated 12-month distribution from the Fund based on the limited distribution history of the Fund to date and does not represent the total return of the Fund and is not necessarily an indication of future distributions or yield. Past performance does not guarantee future results.

RISK MEASURES

Standard Deviation is a statistical measurement that helps to gauge the fund's historical volatility. Historical Beta illustrates a fund's sensitivity to price movements in relation to a benchmark index. Alpha is a coefficient measuring the portion of a fund's return arising from specific (non-market) risk. Tracking Error is the difference between the price behavior of a fund and the price behavior of a benchmark. R-Squared is a statistical measure that represents the percentage of a fund's movements that can be explained by movements in a benchmark index. Sharpe Ratio is a risk-adjusted measure calculated by using standard deviation and excess return to determine reward per unit of risk. Information Ratio is a ratio of portfolio returns above those of a benchmark compared to the volatility of those returns.U.S. allocations may include U.S. territories and possessions.The Net Other Assets (Liabilities) category may include, but is not limited to, repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, security lending collateral, forward foreign currency contracts, and cash collateral. 



The MSCI Europe, Australasia, Far East Index (MSCI EAFE Index) is an unmanaged index used as a general measure of market performance. It is not possible to invest directly into an index. Calculations assume dividends and capital gains are reinvested and do not include any managerial expenses.The price of equity securities fluctuates based on changes in a company’s financial condition and overall market and economic conditions. If the market prices of the equity securities owned by the fund fall, the value of the fund will decline. The prices of securities the sub-adviser believes are undervalued may not appreciate as anticipated or may go down. Investments in global/international markets involve risks not associated with U.S. markets, such as currency fluctuations, adverse social and political developments and relatively small size and lesser liquidity of the markets.Shares may be sold (or “redeemed”) on any day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Proceeds from the redemption of shares will usually be sent to the redeeming shareholder within three business days after receipt in good order of a request for redemption. However, Transamerica Funds has the right to take up to seven days to pay redemption proceeds, and may postpone payment under certain circumstances, as authorized by law.Due to rounding, not all of the percentages will equal 100%.Mutual funds are subject to market risk, including the loss of principal. Past performance is not indicative of future results.Shares of the funds may only be sold by offering the funds’ prospectus.

PRODUCT PROFILE

SUB-ADVISER        


TSW has been cultivating a rich tradition of value investing since 1969. The firm manages long-term investment assets for corporations, public funds, insurance companies, endowments, foundations, Taft-Hartley organizations and individuals. TSW's disciplined investment process is based on a deeply held value investing philosophy that has been honed through decades of experience to identify attractive risk/return opportunities. The keys to TSW's long-term investment track record is a consistently applied philosophy, the quality and consistency of the decision-making process and an experienced team of high-caliber individuals.













30-DAY SEC YIELD

The 30-Day SEC Yield is computed in accordance with a standardized method prescribed by rules of the SEC. The 30-day SEC Yield is computed by dividing the fund's investment income per share earned during a particular 30-day base period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the base period, and then annualizing the result. The 30-day SEC Yield is calculated at each month end and updated within the first ten business days of the following month. These yields reflect the reimbursements or waivers of certain expense. Had fees not been waived and/or expenses reimbursed, the yields would have been lower.            

12-MONTH DISTRIBUTION YIELD

The 12-Month distribution yield is calculated by taking the sum of all distributions occurring over the previous twelve calendar months and dividing the result by the Fund's Net Asset Value (NAV) as of the date of the previous month-end. The distribution yield represents a 12-month historical distribution and does not represent the total return of the Fund and is not necessarily an indication of future distributions or yield. For Funds that have been in operation for less than one year, an annualized distribution yield is calculated by annualizing the Fund's historical distributions to date and dividing the result by the Fund's Net Asset Value (NAV) as of the date of the previous month-end. The annualized distribution yield represents an estimated 12-month distribution from the Fund based on the limited distribution history of the Fund to date and does not represent the total return of the Fund and is not necessarily an indication of future distributions or yield. Past performance does not guarantee future results.            

FUND PERFORMANCE

*Expense ratios are as-of the most recent prospectus. Contractual arrangements have been made with the fund’s investment manager, Transamerica Asset Management, Inc. (“TAM”), through March 1, 2017. **Reflects average annual returns.

The Class I shares are using performance history from the TS&W International Equity Portfolio which commenced operations December 18, 1992. Total Returns and Average Annual Returns are shown for Class A shares calculated from December 18, 1992, the commencement of the fund.The performance data presented here represents past performance; Past performance is not indicative of future results.

The investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Performance may not be available for all periods indicated. Net Asset Value (NAV) returns include reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, but do not reflect any sales charges. If a sales charge had been deducted, the results would have been lower. Public Offering Price (POP) returns include reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, and reflect the maximum sales charge.Maximum sales charge for Class A shares is 5.50%.Purchases of Class C Shares are subject to a 1.00% contingent deferred sales charge if redeemed during the first 12 months of purchase.There are no sales charges on Class I shares.

RISK MEASURES

Standard Deviation is a statistical measurement that helps to gauge the fund's historical volatility. Historical Beta illustrates a fund's sensitivity to price movements in relation to a benchmark index. Alpha is a coefficient measuring the portion of a fund's return arising from specific (non-market) risk. Tracking Error is the difference between the price behavior of a fund and the price behavior of a benchmark. R-Squared is a statistical measure that represents the percentage of a fund's movements that can be explained by movements in a benchmark index. Sharpe Ratio is a risk-adjusted measure calculated by using standard deviation and excess return to determine reward per unit of risk. Information Ratio is a ratio of portfolio returns above those of a benchmark compared to the volatility of those returns.U.S. allocations may include U.S. territories and possessions.The Net Other Assets (Liabilities) category may include, but is not limited to, repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, security lending collateral, forward foreign currency contracts, and cash collateral. 



The MSCI Europe, Australasia, Far East Index (MSCI EAFE Index) is an unmanaged index used as a general measure of market performance. It is not possible to invest directly into an index. Calculations assume dividends and capital gains are reinvested and do not include any managerial expenses.The price of equity securities fluctuates based on changes in a company’s financial condition and overall market and economic conditions. If the market prices of the equity securities owned by the fund fall, the value of the fund will decline. The prices of securities the sub-adviser believes are undervalued may not appreciate as anticipated or may go down. Investments in global/international markets involve risks not associated with U.S. markets, such as currency fluctuations, adverse social and political developments and relatively small size and lesser liquidity of the markets.Shares may be sold (or “redeemed”) on any day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Proceeds from the redemption of shares will usually be sent to the redeeming shareholder within three business days after receipt in good order of a request for redemption. However, Transamerica Funds has the right to take up to seven days to pay redemption proceeds, and may postpone payment under certain circumstances, as authorized by law.Due to rounding, not all of the percentages will equal 100%.Mutual funds are subject to market risk, including the loss of principal. Past performance is not indicative of future results.Shares of the funds may only be sold by offering the funds’ prospectus. You should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the funds carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and additional important information regarding the fund. To obtain the prospectus and/or summary prospectus, please contact your financial professional or click here.

                    (Out of 268 funds) The fund received a Morning star Rating of 4 stars for the three-year period (Out of 268) and  4 stars for the five-year period (Out of 218) and 5 stars for the ten-year period (Out of 133) in the Foreign Large Value category.
                



 Source: Morningstar.  For each fund with at least a 3-year history, Morningstar calculates a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance (including the effects of all sales charges), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receives a Morningstar Rating™ of 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund and rated separately.) A fund’s overall rating is derived from a weighted average of the 3-, 5- and 10- year (if applicable) rating metrics. Morningstar Rating™ is for class shown only; other classes may have different performance characteristics.

Risk Measures are in comparison to the fund's primary benchmark unless otherwise indicated. Based on share class shown for both the 3-year period and since inception of the fund.    













30-DAY SEC YIELD

The 30-Day SEC Yield is computed in accordance with a standardized method prescribed by rules of the SEC. The 30-day SEC Yield is computed by dividing the fund's investment income per share earned during a particular 30-day base period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the base period, and then annualizing the result. The 30-day SEC Yield is calculated at each month end and updated within the first ten business days of the following month. These yields reflect the reimbursements or waivers of certain expense. Had fees not been waived and/or expenses reimbursed, the yields would have been lower.            

12-MONTH DISTRIBUTION YIELD

The 12-Month distribution yield is calculated by taking the sum of all distributions occurring over the previous twelve calendar months and dividing the result by the Fund's Net Asset Value (NAV) as of the date of the previous month-end. The distribution yield represents a 12-month historical distribution and does not represent the total return of the Fund and is not necessarily an indication of future distributions or yield. For Funds that have been in operation for less than one year, an annualized distribution yield is calculated by annualizing the Fund's historical distributions to date and dividing the result by the Fund's Net Asset Value (NAV) as of the date of the previous month-end. The annualized distribution yield represents an estimated 12-month distribution from the Fund based on the limited distribution history of the Fund to date and does not represent the total return of the Fund and is not necessarily an indication of future distributions or yield. Past performance does not guarantee future results.            

FUND PERFORMANCE

*Expense ratios are as-of the most recent prospectus. Contractual arrangements have been made with the fund’s investment manager, Transamerica Asset Management, Inc. (“TAM”), through March 1, 2017. **Reflects average annual returns. Returns for funds that are less than one year old are not annualized.***Calendar year performance for 2007-2011 represents synthetic returns.Synthetic returns: Class A shares commenced operations on March 1, 2011. The performance of the Class A shares prior to March 1, 2011 reflects the performance of the Class I shares of the fund, restated to reflect the fees and expenses of Class A shares, without the effect of any fee or expense limitations. The Class I shares are using performance history from the TS&W International Equity Portfolio which commenced operations December 18, 1992. Total Returns and Average Annual Returns are shown for Class A shares calculated from December 18, 1992, the commencement of the fund.The performance data presented here represents past performance; Past performance is not indicative of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. The investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Performance may not be available for all periods indicated. Net Asset Value (NAV) returns include reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, but do not reflect any sales charges. If a sales charge had been deducted, the results would have been lower. Public Offering Price (POP) returns include reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, and reflect the maximum sales charge.Maximum sales charge for Class A shares is 5.50%.Purchases of Class C Shares are subject to a 1.00% contingent deferred sales charge if redeemed during the first 12 months of purchase.There are no sales charges on Class I shares. Class I shares are currently primarily offered for investment to institutional investors including, but not limited to, fee-based programs, pension plans, and certain endowment plans and foundations.There are no sales charges on Class I2 shares. Class I2 shares are currently primarily offered for investment by certain funds of funds.There are no sales charges for Class R6 shares. Class R shares are available only to eligible retirement plans.Advisor Class shares are intended for purchase through self-directed accounts on transaction-based platforms that may or may not charge a transaction fee, broker-dealer sponsored fee-based wrap programs, fee-based advisory platforms and bank/trust products where fees are being charged.Performance figures reflect any fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements by the Investment Manager. Without such waivers and/or reimbursements, the performance would be lower. Future waivers and/or reimbursements are at the discretion of the Investment Manager.1 Year returns reflect total return. 

RISK MEASURES

Standard Deviation is a statistical measurement that helps to gauge the fund's historical volatility. Historical Beta illustrates a fund's sensitivity to price movements in relation to a benchmark index. Alpha is a coefficient measuring the portion of a fund's return arising from specific (non-market) risk. Tracking Error is the difference between the price behavior of a fund and the price behavior of a benchmark. R-Squared is a statistical measure that represents the percentage of a fund's movements that can be explained by movements in a benchmark index. Sharpe Ratio is a risk-adjusted measure calculated by using standard deviation and excess return to determine reward per unit of risk. Information Ratio is a ratio of portfolio returns above those of a benchmark compared to the volatility of those returns.U.S. allocations may include U.S. territories and possessions.The Net Other Assets (Liabilities) category may include, but is not limited to, repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, security lending collateral, forward foreign currency contracts, and cash collateral. 



The MSCI Europe, Australasia, Far East Index (MSCI EAFE Index) is an unmanaged index used as a general measure of market performance. It is not possible to invest directly into an index. Calculations assume dividends and capital gains are reinvested and do not include any managerial expenses.The price of equity securities fluctuates based on changes in a company’s financial condition and overall market and economic conditions. If the market prices of the equity securities owned by the fund fall, the value of the fund will decline. The prices of securities the sub-adviser believes are undervalued may not appreciate as anticipated or may go down. Investments in global/international markets involve risks not associated with U.S. markets, such as currency fluctuations, adverse social and political developments and relatively small size and lesser liquidity of the markets.Shares may be sold (or “redeemed”) on any day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Proceeds from the redemption of shares will usually be sent to the redeeming shareholder within three business days after receipt in good order of a request for redemption. However, Transamerica Funds has the right to take up to seven days to pay redemption proceeds, and may postpone payment under certain circumstances, as authorized by law.Due to rounding, not all of the percentages will equal 100%.Mutual funds are subject to market risk, including the loss of principal. Past performance is not indicative of future results.Shares of the funds may only be sold by offering the funds’ prospectus.

Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund: As with all mutual funds, an investment in the Fund is subject to investment risks, including, without limitation, market risk, investment style risk, investment advisor risk, market sector risk, equity securities risk, portfolio turnover risk, foreign securities risk, and other risks as set forth in the Fund’s prospectus. Foreign investing involves special risks such as risk of loss from currency fluctuation or political or economic uncertainty.
*“Net Operating Expenses” are based upon actual expenses incurred by the Fund’s Investor Shares for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. The Advisor has entered into an Expense Limitation Agreement with the International Equity Fund under which it has agreed to reduce the amount of the investment advisory fees to be paid to the Advisor by the International Equity Fund and to assume other expenses of the International Equity Fund, if necessary, in an amount that limits the International Equity Fund’s annual operating expenses (other than interest, taxes, brokerage commissions, acquired fund fees and expenses, other expenditures which are capitalized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, other extraordinary expenses not incurred in the ordinary course of the International Equity Fund’s business, and amounts, if any, payable under a Rule 12b-1 distribution plan) to not more than 1.00% until July 31, 2017. The Expense Limitation Agreement may not be terminated by either party prior to that date. Subject to certain conditions such as Fund asset levels being at certain thresholds and operating expenses for the International Equity Fund being less than the operating expense limit for the International Equity Fund, the Mid- Company Fund may at a later date reimburse the Advisor for fees waived or limited and other expenses assumed by the Advisor pursuant to the Expense Limitation Agreement. Reimbursement for fees previously waived are subject to Board approval and are only applicable to fees waived or limited and other expenses assumed by the Advisor in the three (3) fiscal years. See the “Management of the Funds-Expense Limitation Agreements” section in the prospectus for more detailed information.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
