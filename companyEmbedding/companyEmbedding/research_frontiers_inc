					Full Description



Research Frontiers Incorporated (Research Frontiers), incorporated on May 5, 1989, is engaged in the development and marketing of technology and devices to control the flow of light. The Company develops and licenses its suspended particle device (SPD-Smart) light-control technology to other companies that manufacture and/or market the SPD-Smart chemical emulsion, light-control film made from the chemical emulsion, the light-control panels made by laminating the film, electronics to power end-products incorporating the film, and lamination services for, and the end-products themselves such as smart windows, skylights and sunroofs. Research Frontiers has approximately 40 companies that, in the aggregate, are licensed to serve over four SPD-Smart application areas, including aerospace, architectural, automotive and marine products. Its VariGuard business unit markets and sells SPD-Smart products directly to customers for specialty uses, such as the protection of artwork and light-sensitive documents in museums and private collections.The Company's SPD-Smart products use microscopic light-absorbing nanoparticles that are suspended in a film. These particles align when an electrical voltage is applied, thus permitting light to pass through the film. Adjustment of the voltage to the SPD film gives users the ability to regulate the amount of light, glare and heat passing through the window, skylight, sunroof, window shade or other SPD-Smart end-product. This SPD film can be incorporated between two layers of glass or plastic, or combinations of both, to produce a laminate that has enhanced energy efficiency, light-control and security performance properties. The Company's SPD light-control technology product applications for SPD-Smart glass or plastic include, Automotive, including sunroofs, sunvisors, side windows and rear windows; Aerospace and marine, including windows, doors, partitions, sunvisors, and skylights, and Architectural, including commercial and residential windows, doors, skylights and partitions for construction, replacement and retrofit applications.The Company's SPD-Smart emulsion, film and end-product brands include SPD-Smart, SPD-SmartGlass, VaryFast, SPD-CleanTech, SPD Clean Technology, SmartGlass, The View of the Future-Everywhere you Look, Powered by SPD, Powered by SPD-CleanTech, Powered by SPD Clean Technology, SG Enabled, SPD Green and Clean, SPD On-Board, Speed Matters, VariGuard and Visit SmartGlass.com. The Company's licensees are categorized in over four areas, such as materials for making films (emulsions), film, lamination of film to glass or plastic and end-products. Emulsion makers produce and combine the necessary materials (that is SPD particles and various liquids and special polymers) from which SPD-Smart films are made. The film makers coat a thin layer of emulsion between two sheets of plastic film, each of which has a transparent conductive coating. This emulsion is then partly solidified to form an SPD film that allows users to control the amount of light, glare and heat passing through this film. The end-product licensees then integrate this film into a range of SPD-Smart products, or make electronic systems to control such SPD-Smart products. Some of these end-product licensees do their own lamination of the SPD light-control film to glass or plastic, and some outsource this lamination to other companies.The Company competes with Pleotint, Suntek, Ravenbrick, 3M, Gentex Corp., Pilkington, PPG Industries, Saint-Gobain, View and Sage Electrochromics.

Company











Overview Research Frontiers is the developer of SPD-SmartGlass, electronically tintable window technology. Electronically tintable glass developed by Research Frontiers changes the tint of any window, sunroof or skylight by electrically aligning tiny particles in a thin film within the glass or plastic. With the touch of a button, users can instantly change or tune the tint of their glass to help keep out harsh sunlight and 95% of the heat in its tinted (power off) state. Patented SPD-SmartGlass technology effectively blocks UV and infrared rays regardless of whether the glass is in its clear or tinted state, helping keep cars, planes, yachts, homes, offices and artwork cooler and protected.
SPD-SmartGlass is versatile and can be controlled in many ways. For example SPD-SmartGlass can be operated from a wall switch, dimmer, motion detector, light or temperature sensor, Zuli or other smartplug and can be easily integrated into any building control system.

ONE Aviation Selects PPG's Alteos Interactive Window System With Research Frontiers' SPD-Smart Technology for the New Eclipse 700 Aircraft


/EINPresswire.com/ -- WOODBURY, NY --(Marketwired - July 27, 2017) - Research Frontiers Inc. (NASDAQ: REFR) - Global aircraft manufacturer ONE Aviation has announced the selection of the ALTEOS electronically dimmable window (EDW) by PPG for its new Eclipse 700 aircraft. The Eclipse 700 aircraft, being developed under the name "Project Canada," is an upgraded version of their Eclipse 500/550. ONE Aviation debuted a mock-up of the Eclipse 700 cabin at this week's EAA AirVenture aviation show in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.
ONE Aviation's announcement revealed that PPG will provide EDWs that incorporate Alteos interactive window systems. The Alteos EDW utilizes the NUANCE V2 shading product by Vision Systems that uses SPD-Smart light-control technology from Research Frontiers. As noted in the announcement: "The dimmable windows will enable passengers to independently tune a window's tint from clear to dark to regulate daylight, glare and heat ingress while preserving or blocking the view. Vision Systems' latest generation product offers unprecedented optical quality while enhancing visual, thermal and acoustic comfort."
To learn more, we invite you to read the release from ONE Aviation: ONE Aviation Selects Alteos Interactive Window Systems by PPG
Vision Systems, a licensee of Research Frontiers, uses SPD-Smart technology in their EDW shading solutions, including their NUANCE V2 product. In a joint press release two months ago, PPG and Vision Systems announced that they reached a commercial agreement to work together on developing new applications utilizing Vision Systems' EDW solutions -- combining the considerable experience that both PPG and Vision Systems have in supplying the aircraft industry with EDW systems. ONE Aviation's selection of the Alteos interactive window system, for the Eclipse 700, represents the first announced program under the PPG and Vision Systems agreement.
EDWs using SPD-Smart technology deliver unprecedented passenger benefits. By enabling users to precisely control the amount of daylight and glare coming through windows, passengers can instantly tune the tint to a comfortable level while continuing to enjoy views, rather than blocking their view with a shade. The system delivers many other practical benefits including a cooler cabin due to remarkable thermal insulation properties, and a quieter cabin due to acoustic insulation properties.
About Research Frontiers Inc.
Research Frontiers (NASDAQ: REFR) is the developer of SPD-Smart light-control technology which allows users to instantly, precisely and uniformly control the shading of glass or plastic, either manually or automatically. Research Frontiers has an infrastructure of over 40 licensed companies that collectively are capable of serving the growing global demand for smart glass products in automobiles, homes, buildings, museums, aircraft and boats. For more information, please visit our website at www.SmartGlass.com, and on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and YouTube.

Actual results could differ and are not guaranteed. Any forward-looking statements should be considered accordingly. "SPD-Smart" is a trademark of Research Frontiers Inc.

Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure
WOODBURY, NEW YORK, JULY 27, 2017 - Global aircraft manufacturer ONE Aviation
has announced the selection of the ALTEOS electronically dimmable window (EDW)
by PPG for its new Eclipse 700 aircraft. The Eclipse 700 aircraft, being
developed under the name "Project Canada," is an upgraded version of their
Eclipse 500/550. ONE Aviation debuted a mock-up of the Eclipse 700 cabin at this
week's EAA AirVenture aviation show in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.
ONE Aviation's announcement revealed that PPG will provide EDWs that incorporate
Alteos interactive window systems. The Alteos EDW utilizes the NUANCE V2 shading
product by Vision Systems that uses SPD-Smart light-control technology from
Research Frontiers. As noted in the announcement: "The dimmable windows will
enable passengers to independently tune a window's tint from clear to dark to
regulate daylight, glare and heat ingress while preserving or blocking the view.
Vision Systems' latest generation product offers unprecedented optical quality
while enhancing visual, thermal and acoustic comfort."
Vision Systems, a licensee of Research Frontiers, uses SPD-Smart technology in
their EDW shading solutions, including their NUANCE V2 product. In a joint press
release two months ago, PPG and Vision Systems announced that they reached a
commercial agreement to work together on developing new applications utilizing
Vision Systems' EDW solutions - combining the considerable experience that both
PPG and Vision Systems have in supplying the aircraft industry with EDW systems.
ONE Aviation's selection of the Alteos interactive window system, for the
Eclipse 700, represents the first announced program under the PPG and Vision
Systems agreement.
EDWs using SPD-Smart technology deliver unprecedented passenger benefits. By
enabling users to precisely control the amount of daylight and glare coming
through windows, passengers can instantly tune the tint to a comfortable level
while continuing to enjoy views, rather than blocking their view with a shade.
The system delivers many other practical benefits including a cooler cabin due
to remarkable thermal insulation properties, and a quieter cabin due to acoustic
insulation properties.
Details are noted in the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current
Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference. The Research Frontiers
press release is also available on the Company's website at www.SmartGlass.com
and at various other places on the internet.
This report and the press releases referred to herein may include statements
that may constitute "forward-looking" statements as referenced in the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements usually contain words
such as "believe", "estimate", "project", "intend", "expect", or similar
expressions. Any forward-looking statements are made by the Company in good
faith, pursuant to the safe-harbor provisions of the Act. These forward-looking
statements reflect management's current views and projections regarding economic
conditions, industry environments and Company performance. Factors, which could
significantly change results, include but are not limited to: sales performance,
expense levels, competitive activity, interest rates, changes in the Company's
financial condition and several business factors. Additional information
regarding these and other factors may be included in the Company's quarterly
10-Q and 10K filings and other public documents, copies of which are available
from the Company on request. By making these forward-looking statements, the
Company undertakes no obligation to update these statements for revisions or
changes after the date of this report.
The information in this Form 8-K or the press release reproduced herein shall
not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, nor shall they be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under
the Securities Act of 1933, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific
reference in such filing.© Edgar Online, source Glimpses

Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure
WOODBURY, NEW YORK, JULY 27, 2017 - Global aircraft manufacturer ONE Aviation
has announced the selection of the ALTEOS electronically dimmable window (EDW)
by PPG for its new Eclipse 700 aircraft. The Eclipse 700 aircraft, being
developed under the name "Project Canada," is an upgraded version of their
Eclipse 500/550. ONE Aviation debuted a mock-up of the Eclipse 700 cabin at this
week's EAA AirVenture aviation show in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.
ONE Aviation's announcement revealed that PPG will provide EDWs that incorporate
Alteos interactive window systems. The Alteos EDW utilizes the NUANCE V2 shading
product by Vision Systems that uses SPD-Smart light-control technology from
Research Frontiers. As noted in the announcement: "The dimmable windows will
enable passengers to independently tune a window's tint from clear to dark to
regulate daylight, glare and heat ingress while preserving or blocking the view.
Vision Systems' latest generation product offers unprecedented optical quality
while enhancing visual, thermal and acoustic comfort."
Vision Systems, a licensee of Research Frontiers, uses SPD-Smart technology in
their EDW shading solutions, including their NUANCE V2 product. In a joint press
release two months ago, PPG and Vision Systems announced that they reached a
commercial agreement to work together on developing new applications utilizing
Vision Systems' EDW solutions - combining the considerable experience that both
PPG and Vision Systems have in supplying the aircraft industry with EDW systems.
ONE Aviation's selection of the Alteos interactive window system, for the
Eclipse 700, represents the first announced program under the PPG and Vision
Systems agreement.
EDWs using SPD-Smart technology deliver unprecedented passenger benefits. By
enabling users to precisely control the amount of daylight and glare coming
through windows, passengers can instantly tune the tint to a comfortable level
while continuing to enjoy views, rather than blocking their view with a shade.
The system delivers many other practical benefits including a cooler cabin due
to remarkable thermal insulation properties, and a quieter cabin due to acoustic
insulation properties.
Details are noted in the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current
Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference. The Research Frontiers
press release is also available on the Company's website at www.SmartGlass.com
and at various other places on the internet.
This report and the press releases referred to herein may include statements
that may constitute "forward-looking" statements as referenced in the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements usually contain words
such as "believe", "estimate", "project", "intend", "expect", or similar
expressions. Any forward-looking statements are made by the Company in good
faith, pursuant to the safe-harbor provisions of the Act. These forward-looking
statements reflect management's current views and projections regarding economic
conditions, industry environments and Company performance. Factors, which could
significantly change results, include but are not limited to: sales performance,
expense levels, competitive activity, interest rates, changes in the Company's
financial condition and several business factors. Additional information
regarding these and other factors may be included in the Company's quarterly
10-Q and 10K filings and other public documents, copies of which are available
from the Company on request. By making these forward-looking statements, the
Company undertakes no obligation to update these statements for revisions or
changes after the date of this report.
The information in this Form 8-K or the press release reproduced herein shall
not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, nor shall they be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under
the Securities Act of 1933, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific
reference in such filing.© Edgar Online, source Glimpses
