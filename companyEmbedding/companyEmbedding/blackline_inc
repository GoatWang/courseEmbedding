Finance Controls and Automation Platform for Accounting Operations | BlackLine




































Finance Controls and Automation Platform








Designed entirely in the cloud from the ground up, BlackLine is the only unified technology solution built specifically for accounting and finance. No messy acquisitions, no disparate hybrid software-hardware combinations, and no expensive middleware or upgrade costs, just the world’s most trusted solution for Finance Controls and Automation.





The Unified Cloud for Accounting and Finance
The simplicity and usability of BlackLine solutions are unique. Unlike some systems on the market today, BlackLine is not a Frankenstein patchwork of old software and hardware. Rather, it’s a comprehensive Finance Controls and Automation platform built on a single codebase and delivered securely via the cloud. Users enjoy a consistent experience with single sign-on and avoid constantly switching between multiple systems. Data is available between products within the platform as well, without having to be transferred between or through other systems. Organizations can manage the entire accounting and finance lifecycle and gain a global view into tasks and processes, all in one centralized, secure, and reliable system: the only unified cloud platform built specifically for finance and accounting. When clients purchase BlackLine, they focus on adopting the technology for process improvement rather than supporting its infrastructure.







BlackLine Platform Integrity
DOWNLOAD BRIEF







BlackLine Platform Solutions
BlackLine helps organizations modernize processes, embed controls, and obtain unprecedented visibility into accounting and finance by centralizing key accounting functions within a single platform. In addition to automating period-end processes, BlackLine solutions enable companies to move beyond the antiquated record-to-report process to a new approach known as Continuous Accounting. This evolution of process optimization and technical automation facilitates continuous monitoring for fraud and inaccuracies, delivering greater visibility to the organization and unleashing accountants to contribute greater value to the broader business. Advance critical accounting operations and centralize account reconciliations, journal entries, variance analysis, intercompany transactions and processing, task assignments, checklists, and the financial close with BlackLine.





Finance Transformation Solution
BlackLine Finance Transformation solution centralizes the management of all period-end close activity and streamlines accounting workflows, general ledger reconciliations, journal entry management, and other period-end processes. It enables the timely completion of financial and regulatory reporting and ensures simplified auditability. Trust in the accuracy of your financial reports with a controlled and transparent close process.
LEARN MORE


Accounting Process Automation
BlackLine Accounting Process Automation solution is designed for organizations looking to innovate and optimize their record-to-report process. It covers the full reconciliation to adjustment process, allowing for transactional process automation through configurable matching rules with automated clearing of items. This enables organizations to take their operations to the next level and focus resources on strategic analysis, not transactional monotony. 
LEARN MORE


Close Process Management
Specifically designed to orchestrate and accelerate the close, BlackLine Close Process Management provides tools that work in unison to help manage and execute the “last mile of finance”. By embedding controls and standardization in reconciliation and period-end close processes, BlackLine becomes a configurable, web-based command center from which you can manage accounting and finance tasks and monitor the end-to-end close process. 
LEARN MORE


Balance Sheet Integrity
A critical internal control over financial reporting, the account reconciliation process creates a foundation for organizations to evaluate business performance and support strategic decision making. The BlackLine Balance Sheet Integrity solution standardizes and automates your general ledger, bank, credit card, cash, and other operational reconciliations to streamline and control close cycles and ensure the integrity of your financial statements. 
LEARN MORE


Intercompany Hub
The BlackLine Intercompany Hub provides a clearinghouse for intercompany transactions that eliminates after-the-fact manual intercompany reconciliations and settlements. It interfaces with a company’s core ERP systems and manages all of the global complexity inherent to intercompany accounting. Stop sacrificing control and wasting time and resources on these challenges and centralize the process from end-to-end.
LEARN MORE


Smart Close for SAP
BlackLine Smart Close for SAP enables modern finance organizations to make the best use of their resources and be more strategic by automating, simplifying, and standardizing the financial close, directly within SAP. Your organization gains the confidence of improved balance sheet integrity and automated, audited processes that improve productivity and controls. It’s Robotic Process Automation for the Financial close built directly in SAP.

The BlackLine Difference:
                The Unified Cloud for Finance and Accounting
DOWNLOAD








The difference is clear
Many companies offer products to support accounting and finance functions, but most solutions are cobbled together from hardware and different software systems not originally engineered to integrate with each other. Not all systems are created equal. There are complex issues with customization, service packs, version control. Stop fighting with poorly integrated software. There’s a better way.

BlackLine is an entirely cloud-based, comprehensive accounting system that is a single solution. Whether users are preparing account reconciliations, adding journal lines, executing tasks, or running reports, their experience is consistent. BlackLine was built organically on a single codebase, meaning every component of the platform is naturally integrated and designed to work with the rest of the platform. With multiple major feature additions a year, high-availability up-time, and a highly secure data model, BlackLine’s unified model delivers consistency and reliability, and enables accounting teams to focus on process improvement and best practices.  The difference is clear.

BlackLine’s vision is to modernize the finance and accounting function to empower greater productivity and detect accounting errors before they blow up into a devastating financial restatement. BlackLine is the leader in Enhanced Finance Controls and Automation (EFCA) software and the only provider that offers a unified cloud platform supporting the entire close-to-disclose process. BlackLine enables clients to move beyond outdated accounting processes and point solutions that help accountants and finance professionals work smarter and more efficiently. The accounting and finance departments of more than 1,800 worldwide clients currently leverage the unified BlackLine platform to perform mission-critical processes in near real time — including financial close, reconciliation management, journal entry management, intercompany transaction management, and controls assurance. The BlackLine Finance Controls and Automation platform helps midsize companies and large enterprises by filling in the gaps left by ERP and CPM systems and thereby strengthening controls, lowering compliance risks, and introducing greater efficiencies and visibility into every step of the accounting process.
BlackLine’s Modern Finance platform delivers a fresh approach that increases the quality, accuracy, and efficiency of the financial close process and other period-end activity. This new approach, known as Continuous Accounting, embeds automation, control, and tasks typically not performed until the period-end directly within day-to-day activities, allowing the rigid accounting calendar to more closely mirror the dynamic nature of actual business cycles. This not only more evenly distributes workloads over time, but also enables continual monitoring for errors, fraud, and unusual fluctuations. BlackLine’s unified cloud platform empowers accounting and finance teams to automate period-end activities and to drive continuous accounting processes across their organization. BlackLine is the only technology available that enables an efficient and accurate process and provides real-time reporting and analysis.

Account Reconciliation Software | BlackLine




































BlackLine Account Reconciliations
Standardize, control, and streamline reconciliations
















Standardize, control, and streamline reconciliations
BlackLine Account Reconciliations automates and standardizes the reconciliation process. It drives accuracy in the financial close by providing accountants with a streamlined method to verify the correctness and appropriateness of their balance sheets. Accountants can quickly compare general ledger, bank, and other data, investigate discrepancies, attach supporting documentation, and take required actions from an intuitive, unified workspace.







Quick Demo: BlackLine Account Reconciliations


















Streamline the Reconciliation Process




BlackLine provides accountants with an intuitive interface for performing account reconciliations that includes standardized templates, workflows for preparation, approval and review, linkage to policies and procedures, and integrated storage of supporting documentation.









Dramatically Enhance Internal Controls




Account Reconciliations software removes the risk of the old world of paper-based, manual spreadsheets by maintaining proper segregation of duties, creating post-certification view-only records, automatically adding new ERP accounts, and gaining unprecedented visibility into accounting processes. 









Standardize and Optimize Process




Enforce standardization across the reconciliation process to improve quality and accuracy of financial data. Modernizing the approach to defining the account reconciliation process reduces errors and inaccuracies so accountants focus on analysis, risk mitigation, and exception handling.










“BlackLine has been a true partner for us over the years.”

- Tammie Coley, Executive Director, Enterprise Accounting, Financial Systems & Compliance, Cox Communications

Account Reconciliation Software | BlackLine




































BlackLine Account Reconciliations
Standardize, control, and streamline reconciliations
















Standardize, control, and streamline reconciliations
BlackLine Account Reconciliations automates and standardizes the reconciliation process. It drives accuracy in the financial close by providing accountants with a streamlined method to verify the correctness and appropriateness of their balance sheets. Accountants can quickly compare general ledger, bank, and other data, investigate discrepancies, attach supporting documentation, and take required actions from an intuitive, unified workspace.







Quick Demo: BlackLine Account Reconciliations


















Streamline the Reconciliation Process




BlackLine provides accountants with an intuitive interface for performing account reconciliations that includes standardized templates, workflows for preparation, approval and review, linkage to policies and procedures, and integrated storage of supporting documentation.









Dramatically Enhance Internal Controls




Account Reconciliations software removes the risk of the old world of paper-based, manual spreadsheets by maintaining proper segregation of duties, creating post-certification view-only records, automatically adding new ERP accounts, and gaining unprecedented visibility into accounting processes. 









Standardize and Optimize Process




Enforce standardization across the reconciliation process to improve quality and accuracy of financial data. Modernizing the approach to defining the account reconciliation process reduces errors and inaccuracies so accountants focus on analysis, risk mitigation, and exception handling.










“BlackLine has been a true partner for us over the years.”

- Tammie Coley, Executive Director, Enterprise Accounting, Financial Systems & Compliance, Cox Communications

I was an admin that implemented this reconciliation software at a previous company to prepare reconciliations. It really helped organize our closing process. Highly recommend.




Pros
Great way to organize monthly reconciliations




Cons
There is a learning curve, like everything.

What Is the FrontRunners Quadrant?
A Graphic of the Top-Performing Accounting Products
FrontRunners quadrants highlight the top software products for North American small businesses. All products in the quadrant are top performers. Small businesses can use FrontRunners to make more informed decisions about what software is right for them.
To create this quadrant, we evaluated over 190 accounting products. Those with the top scores for their capability and value made the quadrant.
Scores are based largely on reviews from real software users, along with other product performance details (e.g., what features they offer, how many customers they have).
Is One Quadrant Better Than the Others?
Nope, Products in Any Quadrant May Fit Your Needs
Every product in this quadrant offers a balance of capability (how much the products can do) and value (whether they’re worth their price/cost) that makes them stand out in the race for small business software success.
FrontRunners has four sub-quadrants:

Upper Right = Leaders: Leaders are all-around strong products. They offer a wide range of functionality to a wide range of customers. These products are considered highly valuable by customers.
 
Upper Left = Masters: Masters may focus more heavily on certain key features or market segments than Leaders do. If you need a more specialized set of functionality without bells and whistles, then a product in the Masters quadrant might be right for you.
 
Lower Right = Pacesetters: Pacesetters may offer a strong set of features, but are not rated as highly on value. For example, a Pacesetter might offer greater functionality, but cost more.
 
Lower Left = Contenders: Contenders may focus on a more specialized set of capabilities that are priced at a higher point. This makes them ideal for companies willing to pay more for specific features that meet their unique needs.

Depending on the specific needs of a software buyer, a product in any of these sub-quadrants could be a good fit.
Why? To even be considered for this FrontRunners, a product had to meet a minimum user rating score of 3.2 for capability and 3.4 for value. This means that all products that qualify as FrontRunners are top-performing products in their market. They appear in the quadrant in relation to how their peers performed.
For some buyers, a specific FrontRunners sub-quadrant might be best. This is because products in the Pacesetters and Leaders sub-quadrants are going to have a more extensive feature set than products in the Contenders or Masters.
What this means is that while all the products on the quadrant meet our minimum market criteria (in this case, core accounting and financial reporting and at least one of the following: fixed asset management and expense management), products in the Pacesetters and Leaders are going to offer additional features as well, such as budgeting and forecasting, inventory or payroll. Conversely, products in the Contenders and Masters sub-quadrants are going to focus more exclusively on the core functionality.
You can download the full FrontRunners for Accounting report here. It contains individual scorecards for each product on the Frontrunners quadrant.
How Are FrontRunners Products Selected?
Products Are Scored Based on User Reviews and Other Data
You can find the full FrontRunners methodology here, but the gist is that products are scored in two areas, Capability and Value.
To be considered at all, products must have at least 10 reviews and meet minimum user rating scores. They also have to offer a core set of functionality—for example, core accounting and financial reporting as well as at least one of the following: fixed asset management and expense management.
From there, user reviews and other product performance details, such as the product's customer base and the features it offers, dictate the Capability and Value scores. Capability is plotted on the x-axis, and Value is plotted on the y-axis.

One Last Thing—How Do I Reference FrontRunners?
Just Follow Our External Usage Guidelines
Check out the FrontRunners External Usage Guidelines when referencing FrontRunners content. Except in digital media with character limitations, the following disclaimer MUST appear with any/all FrontRunners reference(s) and graphic use:
FrontRunners scores and graphics are derived from individual end-user reviews based on their own experiences, vendor-supplied information and publicly available product information; they do not represent the views of Gartner or its affiliates.







Runners Up
Providers listed as Runners Up were considered for inclusion in the quadrant, but were
                                ultimately not included for one or more reasons: they did not have enough reviews; they did
                                not meet the reviews score minimum; they did not meet the ultimate Value and Capability minimum
                                scores; or they did not meet our functionality requirements for the market.

Buyer's Guide







 by Lisa Hedges,
Content Analyst
Last Updated: July 25, 2017 







There is a vast array of accounting softwares and financial management solutions on the market today, with specialized functionality for almost any industry or size of organization. Moreover, the specific type of accounting can differ between programs—project, fund and fixed asset are examples.
Add to this variety the constant change of standards, compliance requirements and technology platforms, and the process of selecting enterprise accounting software gets tricky. This buyer's guide is intended to make the process much more bearable.  
Here's what we'll cover:
What Is Accounting System Software? Application Categories What Type of Buyer Are You?Market Trends You Should Understand Benefits & Potential IssuesRecent Events You Should Know About
What Is Accounting System Software? 
Business accounting software keeps track of the financial transactions within an organization. A core package includes the following modules:

General ledger
Accounts receivable
Accounts payable
Payroll
Reporting


Spending statistics in Quicken
These systems occasionally come with specialized functionality for particular types of businesses or companies. An example is fund accounting for nonprofit organizations and government entities. Because it's a critical business process, it's often a central component of an organization's enterprise resource planning (ERP) system.

Application Categories



Core accounting
Core systems assist with the basic functions necessary to balance a business' books, including general ledger functionality, the ability to track accounts payable (A/P) and accounts receivable (A/R), fixed assets and bank reconciliation. Every business requires these core functions to manage its finances.


Project accounting
This type of system helps project-oriented businesses maximize job profitability and efficiency by tracking detailed project costs. Businesses can examine past job costs and estimate future costs to choose the jobs that will achieve adequate profit. It tracks by project factors like labor, overhead, materials and equipment to improve decision-making.


Fund accounting
These solutions support nonprofit and governmental entities in tracking their development and spending of funds. Nonprofit organizations can track their expenditures of donations or grants to make sure they meet fund provider requirements. These systems also allow government entities to make sure they meet unique Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) regulations.


Inventory management
This type of solution helps companies keep the correct inventory levels to maximize profit, avoid overspending and minimize the costs associated with inventory depreciation. The right system keeps inventory information up-to-date by tracking product levels as well as orders, sales and deliveries. The Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) stipulate specific ways to account for inventory to ensure proper reporting of value for inventory that has depreciated or undergone other changes. Software with inventory management capabilities ensures this is done correctly.


Billing & invoicing
These systems automate the collection of payments from customers to enable timely and consistent collection with minimal human error. There are many different types of billing and invoice systems designed to support the wide range of industries, business models, payment methods and operational scales.


Budgeting & forecasting
Users can leverage budgeting and forecasting solutions to project a company's financial outlook from historical data and estimate future conditions. These systems are typically used in businesses that must consolidate multiple departmental forecasts and budgets, and are most helpful where multiple variables drive the ultimate forecast.


Fixed asset accounting
This type of system tracks fixed assets by providing a central database of important asset information, including location, check-in and check-out, due date for return, maintenance scheduling, audit history, cost and depreciation. Depreciation schedules are a core element of this specialty.


Payroll management
Payroll systems help businesses track and process employee payrolls. They also compose and print paychecks, automatically withhold and pay government taxes and generate the necessary legal and tax reports on a regular basis. Automated reminders to pay required fees help businesses avoid legal penalties.




What Type of Buyer Are You?
Before evaluating your options, you must determine what type of buyer you are. Over 90 percent of buyers fall into one of these three categories:
Growing small-business buyers. These businesses are on the verge of upgrading basic systems, such as QuickBooks, to more robust small-business accounting systems that will support sophisticated functions (such as demand forecasting, intercompany accounts, increased data storage and others). Growing businesses upgrade their systems for a range of reasons. Industry-specific functionality will become important when a small company reaches a certain size threshold.
Enterprise buyers. These buyers represent businesses and organizations that need the functionality of a full enterprise resource planning (ERP) suite. Usually, these systems will include functionality for multi-company consolidation, international operations and foreign currency and other concerns relevant to large entities. Seamless integration is usually more important than specific features; however, there is considerable differentiation in both of these areas, and buyers should examine both. SAP and Oracle, two of the largest vendors, have some of the most feature-rich systems on the market.
Best-of-breed buyers. These buyers are focused on specific functions. For example, nonprofit organizations need to look specifically for accounting software for business that can perform fund accounting. This method tracks funds in such a way that different grant providers can see the right report on how each fund amount has been used. Meanwhile, in education, universities and colleges often need software specific to higher ed, for example to track the disbursement of financial aid. Construction companies or engineering firms, on the other hand, usually need a system that can break down costs by each project, location and other characteristics. For best-of-breed buyers like these, functionality is often more important than integration.

Benefits & Potential Issues
The key benefits of financial management systems are clear: better visibility of costs and expenditures, which leads to more financially responsible decision-making. In addition, systems can generate reports in a variety of ways to summarize this information cleanly for the right audience.
For example, nonprofits can generate reports specific to a particular grant provider, detailing exactly where every cent of the funding ended up. This allows an organization to be accountable to investors, donors and lenders, maintaining trust and avoiding financial damage. These systems also allow companies to ensure compliance with reporting standards and federal requirements.
There are a number of issues that should be avoided when selecting a solution. Buyers in certain vertical industries must make sure the appropriate modules are included in the system they purchase. For example, engineering firms and construction companies should choose a system with a project accounting module.
Another issue is a company's rate of growth; the buyer should consider how fast the company is growing at the time of purchase. This way, the company will not grow out of a system immediately after investing considerable time and funds in the selection and implementation processes.

Market Trends You Should Understand
As you evaluate accounting software packages, consider these current market trends:
Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). SaaS is picking up speed as buyers realize the advantages of lower upfront costs and quicker implementation time. NetSuite is a prominent example of a SaaS system: In fact, it is available only as a SaaS offering.
Mobile apps. Mobile applications are gaining popularity across the board, and accounting is no exception. Check to see how each vendor is innovating on this front.
Increased specialization by industry. Increasingly, consumers are demanding more industry-specific features, and vendors are listening. Products that were once “horizontal”—such as Sage MAS 90/200, QuickBooks and Microsoft Dynamics—are increasingly adding new vertical features to cater to buyers’ specific industries. Make sure to keep a lookout for features that fit your particular industry when investigating tools and solutions.
Business intelligence. Interest in business intelligence is on the rise. Business intelligence takes the massive amount of data collected and organizes it into reports designed to support business improvement. Many vendors are now integrating business intelligence into their ERP accounting and financial management systems.

Recent Events You Should Know About
Oracle acquires Netsuite. In July 2016, Oracle purchased Netsuite, further expanding the already impressive reach of its cloud platform. Netsuite’s financial management solution has become a key player in the small and midsize business (SMBs) accounting market, while Oracle is well-known in the enterprise space. It will be interesting to see how this merger will impact customers in the long term—in the interim, users should expect more integrations between NetSuite and Oracle products.
Sage adds chatbot and AI to cloud accounting software. Initially launched at the Sage Summit conference in 2016, Sage officially released its chatbot with its Sage One software in January 2017. The chatbot, Pegg, uses artificial intelligence (AI) technology to provide businesses with a “virtual accounting assistant.” With Pegg, users can track receipts, submit expenses, see which customers are behind on invoices and more.
Zoho launches customized payment solution: Zoho Checkout. Zoho’s newest addition to their financial suite is a customizable online payments solution designed for businesses of all size. Users can build and brand a secure payment page, connect with a payment gateway and collect one-time and recurring payments from customers. Zoho Checkout is available in both free and paid plans, with capabilities increasing as plans scale.

Introduction:  Blackline Vinyl Products has developed one of the most advanced building products available in the market today. Blackline is guaranteed to stand the test of time. Blackline is developed by a strategic alliance of scientists and engineers from 4 of the largest companies in Asia, Europe, and North America.

						Five years of intensive research and development has revealed the ideal blend of engineered materials from the organic and inorganic PVC matrix. A major ingredient is PVC (polyvinyl chloride) homopolymer compound with 100% virgin vinyl. This blend provides the only black, mono-extruded PVC product on the market with superior UV protection, superb workability, excellent weather resistance, and high impact strength.

						Blackline compound is blended with ACM (acryl rubber), the use of calcium zinc, UV stabilizers and anti-oxidants, thus creating optimal UV protection and enhancing impact strength. This, in turn achieves overall product stability. Along with our advanced biochemical engineering, we have revolutionized the extruding process with our twin screw, self-monitoring galling optimization system. This now allows our extruders to accept this new blend of PVC compound.

Why Blackline: Ultraviolet Rays Protection

						Using Carbon Black and extensive UV stabilizers our product is field proven to maintain it's over all appearance. This process results in a lasting deep, rich even color. Most white vinyl products use titanium dioxide (Tio2) as its main stabilizer to retain color; however Blackline Vinyl products do not contain titanium dioxide. Blackline's chemical make-up lies in technology used from the automobile industry and advanced biochemical engineering.

Why Blackline: Superior Against Heat Distortion

						Blackline is able to resists UV rays and heat distortion up to 180 degrees F. Thus absorbing and dissipating heat while keeping its set design without melting or distortion.

Why Blackline: Strength & Flexibility

						Our product memory retains flexibility in warm and cold temperatures. It will not crack or splinter, and is designed to accommodate normal temperature swings.

Why Blackline: Superior to Wood, Wrought Iron, Steel or Painted Aluminum Products

Blackline Vinyl's products are safe, since they're constructed without sharp edges, and won?t rust, corrode, or require painting. As you can see, Blackline, thru chemical and mechanical engineering has created a product that is virtually maintenance free. Our products have been tested extensively with a zenon accelerated weather machine to the requirements of ASTM J160. After 2,000 hours of testing, equivalent to 20 years, our fade ratio is Delta 3.5. This is lower then any other colored vinyl product on the market to date. Our products are also ?field proven? at test sites in Arizona, Florida and Nebraska. They continue to retain a deep, rich black color.

Why Blackline: Lifetime Warranty

						Blackline offers a Lifetime Warranty on all material cost. See warranty for more details.

History[edit]




BlackLine IPO


BlackLine was founded in 2001 by Therese Tucker, a former CTO at SunGard Treasury Systems.[8][9][10] The company functioned with no outside funding until 2013 when the private equity firm, Silver Lake Partners invested more than $200 million in the company.[1][11] BlackLine reached an agreement to form a strategic alliance with the financial consulting firm McGladrey, in 2015. As part of the alliance, the companies began offering a business process as a service (BPaaS) solution.[12]
In September 2016, the company acquired its European competitor, Runbook for $34 million.[10][13] On September 30, 2016, the company filed for an initial public offering with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission.[14] On October 28, 2016, BlackLine began trading on the Nasdaq market under the BL ticker symbol.[15]

BlackLine's software manages financial data, reconciles balances from sub-systems, ensures accurate and complete closings, and monitors regulatory controls through a system known as continuous auditing. The company's software is cloud-based, primarily running on the Microsoft cloud stack, and meets ISO 27001 standards.[16]
