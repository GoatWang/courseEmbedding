Heli-One Poland: Work Begins on Customised Facility
News Staff posted on August 07, 2013 16:49

Rzeszow, Poland - The world's largest independent provider of helicopter maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) services began work on its new facilities in Rzeszow, its fourth major location around the globe.Leaders from Heli-One had an official ceremony to mark the beginning of building work on the new facility, from which the Rzeszow team will provide customers with an extensive range of Base Maintenance services.In its current temporary facility, the Heli-One team has already begun work on its first project - overhaul, modification and painting of a Super Puma AS 332L aircraft for CHC Helicopter - with others to follow soon.Lars Landsnes, (Heli-One) VP Operations Europe; Sebastian Folta, (Heli-One) Heli-One Poland GM; Roman Holzer, VP City Rzeszow; Janusz Magon, VP of Podkarpackie Assembly; Marek Krejszeff, Consbud Sp. z o.o. (construction company) GMLars Landsnes, VP, Operations Heli-One, recognized the importance of the event to Heli-One and its customers: "The Heli-One team in Rzeszow is already delivering for customers and will keep doing so while our customised facility is built," said Landsnes. "Our team of highly skilled and certified mechanics, working with the latest equipment and technology from our newly renovated facility, will significantly extend the reach of industry-leading MRO services for which Heli-One is known globally."More than 60 people have been hired so far for the Heli-One Poland operation, which is adding expertise and access to current and new customers in Central Europe."Rzeszow is at the heart of Poland's Aviation Valley, near major Central European operators and is a solid base for strong talent and education resources," he said. Heli-One is also partnering with local technical schools to create a stream of talented, qualified employees for the growing business. "With this operation, we are building on our existing world-class operations and satisfying the growing demand for helicopter MRO services around the globe."Heli-One Poland is expected to grow to more than 120 employees by 2014, creating new, high-skill jobs and providing extensive development opportunities for local area professionals. The company expects to invest significantly, above $15 million, on building costs, purchasing, training and other expenses related to the operation. That investment is likely to increase based on future business potential in the region.About Heli-OneHeli-One is based in Delta, British Columbia, Canada, and has MRO operations in Delta; Stavanger, Norway; Fort Collins, Colorado.; and now Rzeszow. Heli-One is part of CHC Helicopter, the world's largest helicopter services company, which, in addition to MRO services, provides transportation to offshore oil and gas platforms and ships and search-and-rescue agencies. CHC is headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and operates more than 250 aircraft in some 30 countries around the world.
