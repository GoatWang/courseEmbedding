Our Approach Pipeline Dermatology Women's Health 

Products
Our Approach
BioPharmX Corporation was created to fulfill the unmet medical needs of people worldwide. To achieve that, we take a disciplined approach to research and product development. Our scientists, researchers, marketers and other team members are mission driven, committed to producing novel treatments to cure intractable medical conditions.

We focus exclusively on dermatological issues and women’s health. We seek to develop therapeutic products that provide unique solutions to common medical problems in these areas. Our approach is to create novel mechanisms to deliver effective treatments for persistent and often debilitating conditions.
In dermatology, for example, we are developing a unique way to deliver acne-fighting medicine topically. Today’s most effective acne medications must be ingested, risking undesirable side-effects. Topical treatments tend to be ineffective because their formulations do not deliver medication to the layer of skin where acne forms. Our developmental topical, called BPX-01, effectively delivers small amounts of antibiotic to the acne source, maximizing treatment effectiveness and reducing side-effects.
In women’s health, we are currently focused on improving breast health by treating fibrocystic breast condition, a medical problem that affects half the world’s women. The condition, which often produces breast tenderness and tissue density, can be treated with molecular iodine, which is effective but rarely found in a stable form. Our solution is Violet® iodine, a daily supplement that produces molecular iodine within the body – exactly where it can be most effective.
Both of these solutions demonstrate the power of BioPharmX’s unique combination of innovation and determination.
Caution: BPX-01 is a New Drug-Limited by Federal (or United States) law to investigational use.

Dermatology
BioPharmX aims to be a leader in its understanding of the science of the skin. Healthy skin is the first thing the world notices about an individual, young or old. As a result, BioPharmX focuses on the importance of healthy skin at all ages.


BPX-01
Currently in phase 2 of clinical development, BPX-01 may offer a breakthrough in acne treatment because it can deliver the antibiotic to the area of the skin where acne develops. The novel hydrophilic (non oil-based) formulation of minocycline may be more effective than other topical alternatives because they either use less effective antibiotics to penetrate the top layer of the skin or rely on higher concentrations of minocycline, which could lead to unpleasant side effects.
BPX-01 is the first and only stable hydrophilic topical gel with fully solubilized minocycline. Minocycline, an antibacterial and anti-inflammatory medicine, is the most commonly prescribed acne treatment because it has a lower resistance rate than other antibiotics. No stable form of hydrophilic topical minocycline is currently commercially available.


Preliminary animal studies indicate that minocycline delivered by the BPX-01 formulation is efficiently absorbed into the skin, reaching the epidermis and the pilosebaceous region where acne develops. The results suggest that lower doses of the antibiotic may be used to provide a treatment that is superior to higher-dose topical formulations and oral therapies.
Topical targeted formulations are preferable to oral dosing that can have, side effects such as diarrhea, nausea, and dizziness that can discourage compliance. Lipophilic (oil-based) topical antibiotic products are occlusive and can compromise drug delivery. To compensate for the inefficiency, some products use less effective antibiotics while others rely on significantly higher concentrations of antibiotics. The BioPharmX research found that the hydrophilic BPX-01 formulation distributes evenly, is not sticky and does not occlude or irritate the skin, an advantage in the treatment of acne.

Caution: BPX-01 is a New Drug-Limited by Federal (or United States) law to investigational use.

Products
Women's Health
From gynecology to breast health, women have unique and unmet health needs. BioPharmX is positioned at the forefront of addressing those needs on a global scale.

Violet®
The company’s initial direct-to-consumer product, Violet iodine, is the first and only molecular iodine supplement that has been demonstrated to help alleviate the common symptoms associated with premenstrual breast discomfort and fibrocystic breast condition and promote optimal breast health. Visit www.VioletDaily.com to learn more.
Fibrocystic breast condition (FBC) is the generally accepted term to describe a common, benign condition that is associated with varying levels of monthly breast discomfort, including breast tenderness, aches, swelling, and heaviness. FBC is thought to be caused by hormonal imbalances, which can cause breast tissue growth to exceed its natural cell turnover and affects an estimated 50 percent of women between the ages of 15-49, or over 35 million women in America.
Daily use of Violet iodine can help normalize these imbalances and address the underlying causes of fibrocystic breast condition, thereby alleviating symptoms that vary in severity from general soreness to clinically diagnosed FBC.
BioPharmX is currently evaluating partnerships for the international commercialization of Violet iodine. Please contact info@biopharmx.com should you have interest in the distribution of Violet iodine outside of the United States.


BPX-03
BPX-03 is an oral molecular iodine (I2) treatment for moderate to severe breast pain associated with FBC and cyclic mastalgia. It is currently phase 3-ready, with regulatory filings in progress.

Dispute Resolution
GOVERNING LAW
These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.
Agreement to Arbitrate 
You and BioPharmX agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services or Content (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right: (i) to bring an individual action in small claims court and (ii) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (the action described in the foregoing clause (ii), an “IP Protection Action”). The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action will be the state and federal courts located in the Northern District of California and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. You acknowledge and agree that you and BioPharmX are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and BioPharmX otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution” section will survive any termination of these Terms.
Arbitration Rules
The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section. (The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org/arb_med or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.
Arbitration Process
A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015820 and a separate form for California residents at http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015822.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.
Arbitration Location and Procedure
Unless you and BioPharmX otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and BioPharmX submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.
Arbitrator’s Decision
The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. BioPharmX will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.
Fees
Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, BioPharmX will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).
Changes
Notwithstanding the provisions of the “Changes to Terms or Services” section above, if BioPharmX changes this “Dispute Resolution” section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to info@biopharmx.com ) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated” date above or in the date of BioPharmX’s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and BioPharmX in accordance with the provisions of this “Dispute Resolution” section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).
General Terms
These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between BioPharmX and you regarding the Services and Content, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between BioPharmX and you regarding the Services and Content. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.
You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without BioPharmX’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null and of no effect. BioPharmX may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
Any notices or other communications provided by BioPharmX under these Terms, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be given by BioPharmX: (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to the Site. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.
BioPharmX’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of BioPharmX. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.

Company


BioPharmX is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the dermatology market. The company is focused on development of proprietary drug delivery platform technologies to allow for development and commercialization of novel products for the therapeutic, aesthetic and cosmetic dermatology market segments. The company’s focus is to develop products that treat health or age-related conditions that are not being adequately addressed or those where current therapies and approaches are suboptimal.
Our strategy is to bring new products to market by identifying optimal delivery mechanisms and/or alternative applications for FDA-approved or well characterized active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and biological materials. We aim to reduce the time, cost, and risk profile typically associated with new product development by utilizing active ingredients with demonstrated safety profiles and taking advantage of the expedited regulatory pathways, such as Section 505(b)(2) or 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. This approach may also reduce drug development risk as well as the time and resources required to support regulatory approval for commercialization.
We deploy a market-driven approach to identify the limitations of current treatment options and work to develop products that may address these limitations in areas of efficacy, safety, and/or patient experience.
DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEMS
At BioPharmX our core focus is to create unique drug delivery systems and ultimately products for Intellectual Property (IP) licensing or direct commercialization. As we seek to develop the most efficient delivery method for underserved indications within the dermatology market, we do not invest in manufacturing infrastructure nor do we restrict ourselves with core focus on therapeutics or aesthetics. We believe our drug delivery platforms could have applications in all segments of the dermatology market and therefore expect our source of future revenues to come from both reimbursed therapies and cash-based products and procedures. Learn more about our delivery system technologies and the underlying products.
BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
BioPharmX recognizes the importance of partnering with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, researchers and inventors to create unique drug delivery products. If you have interest in collaborating with the company, please contact our corporate development team at partnering@biopharmx.com.

Our Approach Pipeline Dermatology Women's Health 

Products
Our Approach
BioPharmX Corporation was created to fulfill the unmet medical needs of people worldwide. To achieve that, we take a disciplined approach to research and product development. Our scientists, researchers, marketers and other team members are mission driven, committed to producing novel treatments to cure intractable medical conditions.

We focus exclusively on dermatological issues and women’s health. We seek to develop therapeutic products that provide unique solutions to common medical problems in these areas. Our approach is to create novel mechanisms to deliver effective treatments for persistent and often debilitating conditions.
In dermatology, for example, we are developing a unique way to deliver acne-fighting medicine topically. Today’s most effective acne medications must be ingested, risking undesirable side-effects. Topical treatments tend to be ineffective because their formulations do not deliver medication to the layer of skin where acne forms. Our developmental topical, called BPX-01, effectively delivers small amounts of antibiotic to the acne source, maximizing treatment effectiveness and reducing side-effects.
In women’s health, we are currently focused on improving breast health by treating fibrocystic breast condition, a medical problem that affects half the world’s women. The condition, which often produces breast tenderness and tissue density, can be treated with molecular iodine, which is effective but rarely found in a stable form. Our solution is Violet® iodine, a daily supplement that produces molecular iodine within the body – exactly where it can be most effective.
Both of these solutions demonstrate the power of BioPharmX’s unique combination of innovation and determination.
Caution: BPX-01 is a New Drug-Limited by Federal (or United States) law to investigational use.

Dermatology
BioPharmX aims to be a leader in its understanding of the science of the skin. Healthy skin is the first thing the world notices about an individual, young or old. As a result, BioPharmX focuses on the importance of healthy skin at all ages.


BPX-01
Currently in phase 2 of clinical development, BPX-01 may offer a breakthrough in acne treatment because it can deliver the antibiotic to the area of the skin where acne develops. The novel hydrophilic (non oil-based) formulation of minocycline may be more effective than other topical alternatives because they either use less effective antibiotics to penetrate the top layer of the skin or rely on higher concentrations of minocycline, which could lead to unpleasant side effects.
BPX-01 is the first and only stable hydrophilic topical gel with fully solubilized minocycline. Minocycline, an antibacterial and anti-inflammatory medicine, is the most commonly prescribed acne treatment because it has a lower resistance rate than other antibiotics. No stable form of hydrophilic topical minocycline is currently commercially available.


Preliminary animal studies indicate that minocycline delivered by the BPX-01 formulation is efficiently absorbed into the skin, reaching the epidermis and the pilosebaceous region where acne develops. The results suggest that lower doses of the antibiotic may be used to provide a treatment that is superior to higher-dose topical formulations and oral therapies.
Topical targeted formulations are preferable to oral dosing that can have, side effects such as diarrhea, nausea, and dizziness that can discourage compliance. Lipophilic (oil-based) topical antibiotic products are occlusive and can compromise drug delivery. To compensate for the inefficiency, some products use less effective antibiotics while others rely on significantly higher concentrations of antibiotics. The BioPharmX research found that the hydrophilic BPX-01 formulation distributes evenly, is not sticky and does not occlude or irritate the skin, an advantage in the treatment of acne.

Caution: BPX-01 is a New Drug-Limited by Federal (or United States) law to investigational use.

Products
Women's Health
From gynecology to breast health, women have unique and unmet health needs. BioPharmX is positioned at the forefront of addressing those needs on a global scale.

Violet®
The company’s initial direct-to-consumer product, Violet iodine, is the first and only molecular iodine supplement that has been demonstrated to help alleviate the common symptoms associated with premenstrual breast discomfort and fibrocystic breast condition and promote optimal breast health. Visit www.VioletDaily.com to learn more.
Fibrocystic breast condition (FBC) is the generally accepted term to describe a common, benign condition that is associated with varying levels of monthly breast discomfort, including breast tenderness, aches, swelling, and heaviness. FBC is thought to be caused by hormonal imbalances, which can cause breast tissue growth to exceed its natural cell turnover and affects an estimated 50 percent of women between the ages of 15-49, or over 35 million women in America.
Daily use of Violet iodine can help normalize these imbalances and address the underlying causes of fibrocystic breast condition, thereby alleviating symptoms that vary in severity from general soreness to clinically diagnosed FBC.
BioPharmX is currently evaluating partnerships for the international commercialization of Violet iodine. Please contact info@biopharmx.com should you have interest in the distribution of Violet iodine outside of the United States.


BPX-03
BPX-03 is an oral molecular iodine (I2) treatment for moderate to severe breast pain associated with FBC and cyclic mastalgia. It is currently phase 3-ready, with regulatory filings in progress.

BioPharmX Corporation to Present Phase 2b Clinical Trial Acne Data
Jun 22 17
BioPharmX Corporation will present results of its phase 2b of BPX-01, a unique topical hydrophilic gel formulation of minocycline, at the Alabama Dermatology Society's Summer Symposium being held June 22-25 in Sandestin, Fla. Phase 2b data showed the 2% formulation of BPX-01 reduced acne lesions in subjects by 59% (compared to 44% for vehicle) and delivered at least a two-grade reduction in investigator global assessment (IGA) and clear to almost clear for 25% of subjects. The Phase 2b research was not powered to measure IGA statistical significance. The study found BPX-01 was generally well tolerated, without any serious drug-related adverse events experienced, no photosensitivity, staining or skin discoloration. BPX-01 is the first topical gel formulation of minocycline that can penetrate the skin to deliver the antibiotic to the pilosebaceous unit, where acne develops. It is also the first and only stable hydrophilic and non-oil-based topical gel with fully solubilized minocycline. The company's studies are designed to confirm whether BPX-01 will effectively treat acne with lower dosages of the antibiotic with no or fewer adverse side effects.

   Biodelivery that makes a difference!     BioPharmX Corporation was created to fulfill the unmet medical needs of people worldwide. To achieve that, we take a disciplined approach to research and product development. Our scientists, researchers, marketers and other team members are mission driven, committed to producing novel treatments to cure intractable medical conditions.  We focus exclusively on dermatological issues and women’s health. We seek to develop therapeutic products that provide unique solutions to common medical problems in these areas. Our approach is to create novel mechanisms to deliver effective treatments for persistent and often debilitating conditions. In dermatology, for example, we are developing a unique way to deliver acne-fighting medicine topically. Today’s most effective acne medications must be ingested, risking undesirable side-effects. Topical treatments tend to be ineffective because their formulations do not deliver medication to the layer of skin where acne forms. Our developmental topical, called BPX-01, effectively delivers small amounts of antibiotic to the acne source, maximizing treatment effectiveness and reducing side-effects. In women’s health, we are currently focused on improving breast health by treating fibrocystic breast condition, a medical problem that affects half the world’s women. The condition, which often produces breast tenderness and tissue density, can be treated with molecular iodine, which is effective but rarely found in a stable form. Our solution is Violet® iodine, a daily supplement that produces molecular iodine within the body – exactly where it can be most effective. Both of these solutions demonstrate the power of BioPharmX’s unique combination of innovation and determination.     We develop unique health and wellness products for licensing and commercialization in pharmaceutical and over-the-counter use.          PRODUCTS By design, BioPharmX's innovative drug delivery products, with their unique patented platform technologies, are formulated to address the needs of well-defined, fast-growing, multi-billion dollar markets, including dermatology, aesthetics, otolaryngology (ears, nose & throat), and women’s health.   Violet Iodine A revolution in women’s breast health. It’s a daily regimen that alleviates the symptoms you experience with your monthly cycle – like breast tenderness, aches, heaviness and swelling*. Violet iodine doesn’t just mask the discomfort temporarily; it actually promotes better breast health*. When you take a simple pill every day the result is true relief and reassurance that you’re proactively taking care of your breasts. http://www.violetdaily.com/   BPX-01 BioPharmX aims to be a leader in its understanding of the science of the skin. Currently in phase 2 of clinical development, BPX-01 may offer a breakthrough in acne treatment because it can deliver the antibiotic to the area of the skin where acne develops. The novel hydrophilic (non oil-based) formulation of minocycline may be more effective than other topical alternatives because they either use less effective antibiotics to penetrate the top layer of the skin or rely on higher concentrations of minocycline, which could lead to unpleasant side effects. BPX-01 is the first and only stable hydrophilic topical gel with fully solubilized minocycline. Minocycline, an antibacterial and anti-inflammatory medicine, is the most commonly prescribed acne treatment because it has a lower resistance rate than other antibiotics. No stable form of hydrophilic topical minocycline is currently commercially available. http://www.biopharmx.com/products/#dermatology    Delivery Pathways   BioPharmX creates unique drug delivery products for IP licensing or direct commercialization for pharmaceutical, over-the-counter, and supplement distribution and sales.      Product Types Our unique health and wellness products (for licensing and commercialization in pharmaceutical and over-the-counter (OTC) use) leverage our extensive experience in pharmacological and biological sciences and drug delivery product development. Our team is experienced in performing pre-clinical studies focused on analytics, pharmacokinetics and toxicology, experimental design, and investigational protocols. We do this through product research and development and through strategic partnerships with leading worldwide pharmaceutical companies. Our commitment to providing customers with products that improve the quality of their lives can only be met through unrivaled innovation and a dedication to quality—both of which are integral parts of BioPharmX's company culture.                   Over the Counter Products                                With significant investments in R&D and a deep background in pharmaceutical and medical device development, BioPharmX is uniquely positioned to bring leading-edge, over-the-counter (OTC) products to the retail marketplace.

This is the most exciting time in the history of medicine. Millions of people around the world are benefiting from breakthrough treatments that save, extend and improve life.
Research, technology and genomics are coming together to create a platform that allows researchers to decipher the cause of disease as never before. Each advance opens new doors, new cures, new treatments.
And yet, it’s not enough.
"Today's breakthroughs become tomorrow's medicines." Tweet
Cures don’t appear on a schedule. In search of the unknowable, in search of curing the incurable, there is no one map, no singular template, no predictable milestones.
Finding lifesaving medicines is a life’s work – the work of thousands of researchers who never say never. It's also the work of millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life, against whatever odds they face together.
Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like groundbreaking advances in immunotherapy and personalized medicine – where the once impossible is now reality.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.
Dylan Thomas penned "Do not go gentle into that good night" in 1947, but the sentiment is as timely today as it ever was. Millions of Americans are battling serious illnesses, but they’re not alone in the fight. They have the support of thousands of biopharmaceutical researchers whose lives are dedicated to helping patients go boldly into longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients.
