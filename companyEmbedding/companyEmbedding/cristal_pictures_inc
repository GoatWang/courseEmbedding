The Democratsâ Better Way: Positive Messaging or Pandering to Trump Voters Who Are Never Coming Back?



George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the partyâs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.

About Us

Page Content About Cristal


            By increasing our global presence, staying in the forefront of new titanium technologies,
            protecting the environment, and giving back to the communities where we work, Cristal strives to be a model corporate citizen and a name synonymous with the benefits
            of titanium products.
        

            In May 2007, Cristal acquired Millennium Inorganic Chemicals, combining the two
            companies’ diverse manufacturing platforms to become one unified global producer.
            The acquisition propelled Cristal to be the world's second largest producer
            of titanium dioxide (TiO2).
        

            Cristal now directs the operation of eight TiO2 manufacturing
            plants on five continents, with locations in Ashtabula, Ohio; Baltimore, Maryland;
            Salvador, Bahia; Stallingborough, UK; Thann, France; Yanbu, Saudi Arabia; Bunbury,
            Australia; and a mine site in Paraiba, Brazil.
        
Strengthening the Titanium Value Chain

            In 2008, Cristal further expanded its titanium value chain through the acquisitions
            of Bemax and International Titanium Powder. Now known as Cristal Mining, it is one of Australia’s premier mineral sands companies and is headquartered in Perth,
            Western Australia. Cristal Mining is the largest producer of leucoxene, the sixth largest
            producer of rutile and the seventh largest producer of zircon globally. 
ITP International Titanium Provider (ITP) was formed in 1997, now known as Cristal Metals, it was formed in 1997, now  to develop and commercialize Armstrong Process™
            patented and proprietary technology to produce high-purity metal and alloy powders
            with specific emphasis on titanium.
        

            By broadening the titanium product line and extending the company’s reach, Cristal is positioned perfectly to deliver the diversity, R&D, innovation, specialization
            and support our customers demand.
