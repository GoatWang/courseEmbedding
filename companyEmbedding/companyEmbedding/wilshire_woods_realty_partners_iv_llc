                those of our other group companies. We give you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving marketing communications and will in certain circumstances 
                need to obtain your consent before sending such communications to you. Further detail can be found on the applicable Site and in each marketing communication

Cookies and similar technologies

                All our Sites use cookies and similar technical tools to collect information about your access to the Site and the services we provide.
            

                Cookies are pieces of information which include a unique reference code that a website transfers to your device to store and 
                sometimes track information about you. A number of cookies we use last only for the duration of your web session and expire when 
                you close your browser. Other cookies are used to remember you when you return to the Site and will last for longer. Cookies cannot 
                be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. They are uniquely assigned to you and can only be read by a Web server in 
                the domain that issued the cookie.
            

                We may use cookies to:
            

remember that you have used the Site before; this means we can identify the number of unique visitors we receive to different parts of the Site. 
                    This allows us to make sure we have enough capacity for the number of users that we get and make sure that the Site runs fast enough;
                
remember your login session so you can move from one page to another within the Site;
store your preferences or your user name and password so that you do not need to input these every time you visit the Site;
customise elements of the layout and/or content of the pages of Site for you;
record activity on our Sites so that we understand how you use our Sites enabling us to better tailor our content, services and marketing to your needs;
collect statistical information about how you use the Site so that we can improve the Site; and
gather information about the pages on the Site that you visit, and also other information about other websites that you visit, so as to place you in a 
                    “market segment”. This information is only collected by reference to the IP address that you are using, but does include information about the county 
                    and city you are in, together with the name of your internet service provider. This information is then used to place interest-based advertisements 
                    on the Site which it is believed will be relevant to your market segment. For more information about this type of interest based advertising, and 
                    about how to turn this feature off please visit www.youronlinechoices.co.uk. 
                    (Please email us at cookies@euromoneyplc.com if you have any queries about cookies)


                Some of the cookies used by our Sites are set by us, and some are set by third parties who are delivering services (such as interest based advertising 
                directed at your market segment) on our behalf. To see a list of the cookies and similar technologies used on this Site and instructions on how to

                turning off cookies used on the Site you may not be able to take full advantage of the Site.
            

Email tracking: So that we can better understand our users' needs, we track responses to our emails - for example, to see which links are the 
                most popular in newsletters, and to log and follow up responses to our marketing messages. To do this, we use pixel GIFs, also known as "pixel tags" - these are 
                small image files that are placed within the body of our email messages. They enable us to tell if a message has been opened and to track click-throughs on links 
                within the message. Any other purposes for which Euromoney wishes to use your personal data will be notified to you and your personal data will not be used 
                for any such purpose without obtaining your prior consent.
            

Consents and opt-outs


                You can give your consent to or opt out of particular uses of your data as indicated above by:

Disclosures


                Information collected at one Site may be shared between Euromoney Institutional Investor plc, Institutional Investor Inc. and other group companies for the 
                purposes listed above. Your personal data may also be sold to other companies in the form of lists and directories, but only after permission from 
                you in accordance with the provisions above. We may also disclose your personal data to other third parties, including, without limitation, professional 
                advisers, or governmental or State institutions or regulatory authorities, where necessary in order to exercise or defend legal rights or where required by law.
            

                We may transfer, sell or assign any of the information described in this policy to third parties as a result of a sale, merger, consolidation, change of control, 
                transfer of assets or reorganisation of our business.
            

Public forums, message boards and blogs


                Some of our Sites make message boards, blogs or other facilities for user generated content available and users can participate in these facilities. 
                Any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should always be careful when deciding to disclose your personal information.
            

Transfers outside the EEA


                Services on the Internet are accessible globally so collection and transmission of personal data is not always limited to one country. 
                Euromoney Institutional Investor plc may transfer your personal data, for the purposes listed above, to other group companies, service providers or other 
                third parties which may be located in countries outside the European Economic Area, whose laws may not give the level of protection to personal data as within the UK. 
                This will include transfers to Institutional Investor Inc. in the US (and Institutional Investor Inc. will collect some data directly from you, in relation to the 
                Sites which it operates) and to third parties who provide us with email and marketing services. Where we conduct any transfers we will take all steps reasonably 
                necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Statement.
            
Confidentiality and Security of Your Personal Data
We are committed to keeping the data you provide us secure and will take reasonable precautions to protect your personal data from loss, misuse or alteration.
The transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the 
                security of your data transmitted to our Site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and 
                security features described above to try to prevent unauthorised access. We have implemented information security policies, rules and technical measures to 
                protect the personal data that we have under our control from:

unauthorised access
improper use or disclosure
unauthorised modification
unlawful destruction or accidental loss

All our employees, contractors and data processors (i.e. those who process your personal data on our behalf, for the purposes listed above), who have access to, and 
                are associated with the processing of your personal data, are obliged to keep the information confidential and not use it for any other purpose than to carry out 
                the services they are performing for us. We also give you the option of using a secure transmission method to send us personal data identifiers, such as 
                credit card details and bank account number. How to Access, Update and Erase your Personal Information
