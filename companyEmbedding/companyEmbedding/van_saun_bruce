An Interview With Bruce Van Saun, Chairman and CEO of Citizens Financial Group
The CEO of the country’s newest standalone big bank discusses the progress it’s made since going public in 2014.











                John Maxfield
            

                (JohnMaxfield37)



            
            May 16, 2017 at 8:18AM
            
            





As the chairman and CEO of Citizens Financial Group (NYSE:CFG), Bruce Van Saun is overseeing a comprehensive turnaround at one of the nation's biggest banks. It's still too soon for Van Saun to declare victory, but if the Providence, Rhode Island-based bank continues on its current path, it could soon emerge as one of the country's top-performing regional banks.
I had the opportunity to discuss Citizens' progress with Van Saun. What follows is the transcript of our conversation, edited for organization and flow.
John Maxfield: Is Citizens a turnaround story?
Bruce Van Saun: The description of Citizens as a turnaround story is valid. We were owned by a foreign parent, Royal Bank of Scotland, that ran into some difficulties in the financial crisis. As a result, we were playing defense for an extended period of time in terms of shrinking the balance sheet and raising capital levels.

When I came over to Citizens [from RBS] in October 2013, our goal was to benchmark our performance against peers, start playing offense, and turn the company around. It has a good foundation in place, with a strong regional focus in an affluent part of the country, as well as a good balance between consumer and commercial. But it had been undermanaged.





We built a very clear plan. We had a high capital ratio after being birthed by RBS. So one of the early initiatives was to put the capital back to work and start leveraging up the balance sheet by finding attractive areas to grow loans. Then it was about investing in our fee-based businesses and improving our capabilities broadly in terms of what we could deliver to customers.
The plan was fairly straightforward and we've executed on it well. Our performance was initially behind our peers, but now we've pretty much caught up with them. We like to say now that we're turning the corner. We're moving out of our turnaround phase.
Maxfield: How is it that Citizens' loan book is growing twice as fast as other leading regional banks?
Van Saun: It's a number of things. We've been underpenetrated relative to our potential on the commercial banking side. So we went out and recruited experienced commercial bankers, many of whom have relationships with companies that are above the middle market -- ones with more than $500 million in annual revenue.





To serve these companies you need industry expertise. So we set up a healthcare group, a technology group, an energy group. And we've been bringing over bankers who have strong relationships in these industries. When there's an opportunity to enter into a credit relationship with these companies, we're there to do so. Then we hopefully move over and become a more important bank for them.
The other side is the commercial real estate business. As part of RBS's efforts to reduce its exposure to commercial real estate, Citizens became underweight in it, even telling long-standing customers that we weren't open for that kind of business. So when I came over, we flipped the sign around to say "shop open." A lot of those customers liked working with Citizens in the past and have rotated us back in.
On the consumer side, there wasn't initially a lot of loan demand. The only game in town was auto lending. So we revved that up a bit, entering into a relationship with Santander USA to gain experience and exposure to prime auto paper. We viewed that as a bridge. Once demand picked up in other areas, we would rotate out of that auto exposure, which is exactly what's happening.
We saw opportunities to jump into education refinance loans, too. We're one of the bigger players there. That's given us a bit of momentum and growth. We've also hired 200 new mortgage officers, bringing the total to 550. We've entered into strategic partnerships with companies like Apple and HP as well, to help them deliver installment credit to some of their customers. And we've grown in the personal unsecured market by having a debt consolidation product for people with high-interest credit card loans.





You have to be selective. You have to be judicious about where you're playing, and be innovative on the consumer side, but that's what's allowed us to grow. The yield on our loans is up, the return on capital employed in our loan book is up, but our projected loan losses in stress tests are down. So we're achieving better risk-adjusted returns while reducing risk.
The one thing we have to focus on is that, while we have plenty of capital, our loan-to-deposit ratio ended the first quarter at 97%. So if we're going to grow loans at a good clip, we need to continue growing deposits as well, because we fund each dollar in loan growth with a dollar of deposit growth. And we want to find those deposits in a cost-effective manner.
Maxfield: How does a newly independent bank ensure that it maintains discipline in future cycles?
Van Saun: That comes from having years of experience and the wisdom you gain from that. My team have all been around the block and in the industry for many years, most of us for 25 or 30 years, so we've seen the cycles.
The key is to maintain your underwriting standards and to back away from the market when things are too frothy. Stress-testing has been really good in this regard, in terms of making decisions about loan exposure. So the combination of having experience, undergoing annual stress tests, and then marrying these to sophisticated tools for identifying risk gives us a fair amount of confidence that we should perform in line with our peer group if not better in future cycles.
We have good granularity in our portfolios. You don't want to get too overweight in any particular industry or geography. That's an important aspect of it. Another is just not chasing growth for growth sake.
Maxfield: What role does technology play in Citizens' plans?
Van Saun: The real frontier in banking is around digitization. The objective is to make sure consumers and companies can bank however they want to bank with you -- be it in a branch, on a smartphone or personal computer, whatever.
Whether it's checking balances, making deposits, making payments, digital is really where the next frontier is. So we have to pivot from some of the large mainframe and more central approach to serving customers, to being able to move digitally and really focus on the customer experience. That's the area we're moving aggressively into.
Another area we're looking at is cloud computing. Do we need to have such a big investment in mainframes? And servers. Can we move some of that to the cloud? This gives a bank more flexibility and shortens your development time, meaning that you can get products to market faster. That's really exciting if we can be responsive to customers and it doesn't take us a year and a day to satisfy their needs.
Maxfield: Open application programming interfaces, or open APIs, are a big deal right now. What are your thoughts on them?
Van Saun: I think they're very helpful. You want your core systems to be open so we can take in APIs and then use the best minds that are developing great products to wrap those into our offerings. So I think that's a real positive.
We're not of the size and scale to invent everything here. But if we're nimble and flexible and have an open infrastructure that can accept APIs to plug in some of these great fintech products and services, then we can keep up with the big guys and maybe even get a little ahead in some instances.
I do worry that if the developers don't have great security against hacking and cyber threats, that the liability will go back to the deep pockets -- the bank. So you have to have very clear rules of the road in terms of who has access to the information and how they use it.
Maxfield: Your latest shareholder letter mentions that Citizens recently invested in advanced analytics, or big data. What have you seen so far?
Van Saun: The increased use of data analytics is really about having a repository of data on households, be it households that we serve today or households that could be our customers in the future.
A popular product for the mass affluent, for example, is a home equity line of credit. Most of those folks own their own homes and have some appreciation in them that they can tap into as a relatively inexpensive means of securing credit. So we can use data analytics to identify and prioritize effective offers to these customers.
It's still early, but we've seen powerful results. In some of our direct mail campaigns, the conversion rate has been two to three times greater than the conversion rate of past campaigns. It's similar to approaches that many consumer products companies already use. Banks have just been behind the curve in understanding the profiles of their customers and that they can use that data to better serve customers.
Ultimately, big data will become table stakes to compete in the bank industry. Fast-forward five years from now and everyone will be doing this. But right now banks that are using big data effectively have an edge, and may be able to grow and solidify their customer base before other banks get in on it.
Maxfield: To be a top-performing regional bank, Citizens' credit rating will need to improve. Are there specific plans in place to address this?
Van Saun: We've been in active dialogue with the ratings agencies about making sure they understand our plan and the progress we've made. They've taken comfort in our fortress balance sheet and I think the reason our rating isn't where we'd like it at this point is that our earnings levels have been lower than peers. That gap is rapidly diminishing, but the ratings agencies tend to look more out of the rearview mirror than the front windshield. So we'll need to have a more sustained level of improved operations at the current level to get us a better rating.
We're just trying to make sure they understand our plan and are comfortable that we're not taking undue risk. Our capital position is strong and our earnings are improving, so they can look at us in a new light and have confidence in terms of where we are.
Maxfield: Is there any reason to believe that the recent news about the Citizens Checkup initiative will have a material impact on the bank's performance?
Van Saun: No. And we said that from the get-go when the story first ran.
This is a good program for customers. What we're doing is inviting them in for a free consultation to understand where they are on their life's journey, and then trying to figure out if they have the right set of products and services to help them achieve their goals.
The customers who have gone through the program love it. Survey results show that 95% of customers enjoy the experience, and 91% would recommend it to someone else. So I think the program is aligned with knowing your customers, making sure you're offering suitable products.
If The Wall Street Journal found a few people who claimed that there's pressure to set appointments or that they didn't always file the proper submissions around calling efforts, we have a full review going on to see if there's ways to sharpen how we've implemented the program. But it's a great program and it's here to stay. It's not scandalous. It's actually something that I think is very admirable and it's a great way to up our game in terms of knowing our customers and having more interaction with them.

How Bruce Van Saun Is Leading a Turnaround at Citizens Financial Group
The country's newest big bank is in the late stages of a turnaround.











                Motley Fool Staff 
            

                (the_motley_fool)



            
            Jun 10, 2017 at 2:46PM
            
            





When Bruce Van Saun took the helm at Citizens Financial Group (NYSE:CFG) in 2013, things looked bleak. Its parent company at the time, Royal Bank of Scotland (NYSE:RBS), had spent years trying to shrink and de-risk its balance sheet, leaving Citizens Financial well behind its peers in areas like commercial real estate loans and mortgages.
Things started to improve after Citizens was spun off from RBS in a 2014 initial public offering. Since then, the Rhode Island-based bank's prospects have improved meaningfully, thanks in no small part to Van Saun.
In this segment of Industry Focus: Financials, The Motley Fool's Gaby Lapera and contributor John Maxfield dive into Citizens Financial's turnaround story.
A full transcript follows the video.



This video was recorded on May 26, 2017.





Gaby Lapera: The other thing that you mentioned earlier was Van Saun, the CEO. He's kind of been an angel for Citizens Financial. He's really the person who seems to be driving this new culture and new ideas that are helping the bank in their turnaround story.
John Maxfield: Bruce Van Saun has been an executive at a lot of different major institutions. I talked to Richard Bove, one of the most respected banks analysts in the country. He's a veteran bank analyst, he's been around, he's on CNBC all the time talking about banks, he writes notes to his clients every day and I consider them to be pretty good commentary. When I talked to Richard about this -- he goes by Dick -- when I talked to Dick about this, I asked him what do you think about Bruce Van Saun, and he told me literally that Bruce Van Saun is an excellent banker. Mind you, Dick Bove is someone who doesn't mince words when he doesn't like a bank CEO. So, I consider that to be pretty high praise, and it really did corroborate my thinking, and help to crystallize my thinking on Citizens, and back up what the numbers were saying to me in terms of Citizens' performance.
Lapera: Yeah. So, why don't you talk a little bit about some of the stuff that Van Saun has done to improve Citizens' position? Like their recruitment efforts or their tech investments, or stuff like that.
Maxfield: OK. So, let me paint a picture with some numbers for you. Last year, Citizens grew its loan book by 7.7%, about 8%. Its peer group average, these are other banks that are a few hundred billion in assets, grew their loans last year by 5.4%. So, it outperformed on loan growth. So, that's an important thing to keep in mind. Another is that the revenue, it makes sense that the revenue would grow fast, because the main product that a bank sells is loans, and if you're selling more loans, your revenue is going to go up. Their revenue last year rose by 8.9% versus 5.4% for the average competitor. Then, the efficiency ratio, which we talk about all the time in the context of banking on this show, which tells you the percent of revenue that a bank spends on operating expenses, it fell by 376 basis points, so by 3.76%. I think it's now starting to close in on that 60% threshold that banks strive for. So, if you look at those three metrics, which are probably the most important metrics when you're analyzing a bank's performance, it had a really, really good year. So, the question is, as a general rule, and I think this is a good way to think about things as an investor, and to think about things in general, to think about general rules and exceptions -- this is actually how lawyers are taught to think. The general rule in the case of loan growth is you want loan growth to be robust. But, any time that loan growth outperforms the peer group average, you have to look at that askance. Because the general rule is that loan growth that is too fast is concerning, because it means that you're going out and making loans maybe to people who shouldn't be getting them.





Lapera: And, for listeners who are a little bit newer to banking, every time a bank makes a loan, you have underwriters who check to see, how risky is this person, are they likely to pay back their debt? During the financial crisis of 2008, banks were not very strict at underwriting, and you saw what happened. So, that's the concern when you see super rapid loan growth. Do you think that's what's happening here with Citizens?
Maxfield: To your question, Gaby, your original question was, talk about the things they're doing and investments they've made. I think its rapid loan growth is more a function of not necessarily reducing the underwriting standards, which is what you're referring to, and I was referring to in that general rule. It's more about the fact that it was so under-concentrated in these loan groups relative to other banks that it had a ton of upward momentum that was just waiting for it to take advantage of.
Lapera: Real quick, the loan groups that you're talking about are the commercial real estate and regular home loans, right?
Maxfield: Right. Commercial real estate is one of the main ones, home loans is another one. Basically, what Citizens did is, once it spun off from the Royal Bank of Scotland, and it had more operational flexibility to make investments in the business, and to grow as opposed to contract, what they did is went out and almost doubled their staff of mortgage officers. If you're going to double your staff, the number of people who are your loan officers, then you should expect to grow a lot faster. And, they're going out and recruiting loan officers that deal with larger companies from other banks. And those loan officers from these other banks that have these large accounts are bringing those accounts over. So, when you start to put all those pieces together, you start to say, "Oh, OK, it makes sense now, that its loan book is growing faster than its other book." And it makes sense for reasons other than the fact that whether a bank is or is not manipulating the underwriting standards.

Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we'll conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this event is being recorded.
Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Ellen Taylor, Head of Investor Relations. Ellen, you may begin.
Ellen Taylor

Of course, I have to remind everyone that in addition to today's press release we have also provided presentation and financial supplement and you could find those at investor.citizensbank.com. And our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. And we provide information about the factors that may cause those results to differ materially from the expectations in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today. We also provide non-GAAP financial measures and information and reconciliation of those measures to GAAP in our SEC filings and in our earnings material.
And with that, I will hand it over to you Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun
Good morning everyone and thanks for joining our call today. We are pleased to report another quarter of strong results, picking up where we left off in Q4 and well positioned to continue our momentum going forward. We are doing an excellent job of executing on our strategic initiatives, taking care of our customers and demonstrating a mindset of continuous improvement in how we are running the bank.
The highlights of the quarter from my perspective includes strong loan and deposit growth, good net interest margin expansion, excellent results in our fee based businesses, and good control of expenses.
Revenue growth was 12% year-on-year, positive operating leverage was 7%. This drove ROTCE higher reaching 9% after excluding a non-recurring tax benefit. Our efficiency ratio is now at 61.7% and NIM is at 2.96%.
I’d like to recognize our commercial bankers for an exceptionally strong quarter. We’ve built great platform in capital markets and in our FX and interest rate management businesses and attracted first class talent. We also continued to up our game through an ongoing investment program in treasury solutions. Added great coverage bankers and our team approach to how we cover clients and provide tailored solution is really paying off.
This quarter showed quality strength, and potential of each of these businesses. I am also pleased that our continuing ability to innovate. Our Apple partnership is going well and we’ve added two more partners and have a nice pipeline as well.
We continue to access Fintech capabilities trough partnerships and we will roll out our robo advisory product to clients this quarter. And our ed refi loan products continue to address a real market need. We’ve stayed nimble on how and where we deploy our capital, with balanced and attractive loan growth in both consumer and commercial. Growth in consumer is expected to continue in mortgage, personal unsecured and student lending.

We have ended our flow agreement with SCUSA on auto loans, part of an overall strategy to strengthen our auto loan book. We continue with our SoFi flow agreement on education refinance loans. We've been pleased with the results to date. And we remain focused in commercial on both borrowers and industry segments where we see growth and an ability to develop a meaningful relationship.
At the risk of stealing John’s thunder, we working through a top 4 program and hope to have it ready by our Q2 earnings call to provide you with some details. I believe that this ability to consistently find ways to run to bank better and tap the potential of our franchise is a key differentiator of Citizens relative to our peers.
So with that, let me turn it over to our new CFO, John Woods, to offer his first impressions and then take you through the numbers. John?
John Woods
Thanks, Bruce. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to first say that I'm extremely pleased to have the opportunity to join Bruce and the Citizens team on the journey to build the top-performing bank. Since the IPO, Bruce and the team have made tremendous progress with great momentum coming in to 2017.
Since my early days here at Citizens, I am taking on the leadership in three high-priority areas. First, balance sheet funding optimization; second, continuation of our top initiatives to grow the bottom line and self-fund strategic initiatives; and third, partnering with Don and Brad in driving fee revenue growth.
We had some success in these areas and I hope to contribute to further enhancements going forward. I'm impressed by the quality of our leadership team and their clear understanding of our direction and what we're trying to achieve. In short, I'm excited about the opportunities that lie before us. So with that, let's jump into our first quarter financials which start on Slide 4.
We’ve generated record net income of $320 million and diluted EPS of $0.61 per share. These results were up 13% and 11% linked quarter and up 43% and 49%, respectively, year-over-year. I’d like to remind you that we did benefit from approximately $23 million related to the settlement of certain state tax matters that lowered the tax rate by 5.2 percentage points and added $0.04 to EPS.
Excluding the tax settlement impact, net income was up 33%, EPS was up 39% and the tax rate would have been 31.6%. Note also that under new accounting rules for equity compensation, we had a modest benefit in tax expense. This has been included in our first quarter and full year guidance.
Operating leverage was positive linked quarter and year-over- year we generated positive operating leverage of 7% driven by revenue growth of 12%. Our net interest margin increased six basis points linked quarter and 10 basis points year-over-year. And we improved our efficiency ration 50 basis points from fourth quarter and roughly 4% year on year to 61.7%.
These strong results reflect good execution of our strategic initiatives and our commitment to drive revenue growth while maintaining operating expense discipline. Our ROTCE of 9.7% improved 1.3% in the fourth quarter and 3.1% year-over-year. On an underlying basis, ROTCE of 9% was up 55 basis points linked quarter and 2.4 percentage points year-over-year.
Taking a deeper look into NII and NIM on Slides 5 and 6, we continue to deliver strong balance sheet growth, which helped us to deliver a record $1 billion in NII. We grew average loans 1.5% linked quarter and 8% year-over-year and I will provide some additional color on the growth in a few minutes.
Margin improved six basis points linked quarter and 10 basis points year-over-year, which reflects improving loan yields thanks for the pick-up in interest rates and the impact our balance sheet optimization efforts. These benefits were partially offset by higher deposit and funding costs.

The deposit costs increase reflects growth in commercial deposits over the quarter, the impact of higher interest rates and mix shift in consumer to more term and time. Note that we grew period-end deposits by over 2% in Q1, which reduced the spot LDR to 97%.
Turning to fees on Slide 7, linked quarter fees were up slightly as strong results in capital markets and card fees helped overcome some seasonal impact. Linked quarter service charges were slightly down, reflecting seasonality in day count. Card fees increased from revised contract terms commencing this quarter for core processing fees and a reduction in rewards expense.
We had another record quarter in capital markets driven by loan syndications, bond underwriting and advisory fees. We saw $5 million increase in trust and investment services fees, thanks to higher investment sales volumes, as we've added wealth advisors and continue to invest significantly in our wealth platform. 
Foreign exchange and interest rate product fees were down modestly from strong fourth quarter levels, while mortgage banking fees were down from fourth quarter levels that included higher MSR valuations and higher origination volumes. 
On a year-over-year basis, we delivered outstanding non-interest income growth, which is up $49 million or 15%. The story is much the same as the biggest drivers of improvement came from capital markets, card fees and foreign exchange and interest rates products and income.
Turning to expenses on Slide 8. We saw a slight increase in linked quarter expenses largely as a seasonal increase in salaries and benefits and occupancy was partially offset by lower insurance fraud and regulatory costs, Outside services and Equipment expenses.
Compared to first quarter 2016, expenses increased 5%, but there is some noise in those numbers that I want to call out for you that elevates the growth in salaries and benefits and other expense lines. The biggest driver was an increase in salaries and benefits of $19 million but that includes a change in the timing of incentive payments. Last year, the payment was made in second quarter and we pulled this forward this year into the first quarter impacting payroll taxes and 401k expense.
Other expense increased $11 million, which includes the impact of the FDIC insurance surcharge, which was not a factor in 1Q 2016. When we exclude those items, the year-over-year expense growth rate was closer to 3%.
Let’s move on and discuss the balance sheet. On Slide 9, you can see the continued benefit of our efforts to grow our balance sheet and expand our NIM. We grew average loans 1.5% linked quarter and 8% year-over-year reflecting growth across most of our commercial business lines and in education mortgage and unsecured retail on the consumer side.
NIM was up six basis points in the quarter and 10 basis points year-over-year reflecting improved loan yields partially offset by higher deposit costs. We’ve done a nice job of improving our loan yields giving our balance sheet optimization efforts along with greater discipline on pricing. We've also benefited from higher LIBOR during the quarter as the market anticipated the tightening by the Fed.
We remain well positioned to capitalize on the rising rate environment with asset sensitivity to a gradual rise in rates, at 6% at the quarter end. On Pages 10 and 11 we provide more detail on the loan growth in consumer and commercial. In consumer 6% average growth was led by continued expansion in education, residential mortgages and other unsecured retail loans, which was driven by our partnership with Apple and our new personal unsecured product.
We, continue to improve and enhance our portfolio mix by driving growth in higher-return categories. We are slowing growth in auto and that will likely accelerate in the back half of the year as our partnership with SCUSA comes to a close in April and we further reduce volumes in select geographic areas. As a result of these efforts in addition to higher rates, we’ve expanded portfolio yields by 10 basis points in the quarter and 22 basis points year-over-year.

We also saw nice growth in commercial where we continue to execute well in commercial real estate, mid-corporate and middle-market, industry verticals and franchise finance. The increase in rates and enhanced rigor around the acquired portfolio of returns have helped drive a 23 basis point improvement in yields linked quarter and a 41 basis point increase year-over-year.
On Page 12, looking at the funding side, we saw a five basis point increase in our total funding cost with a 4 basis point increase in deposit costs mostly tied to growth in commercial deposits. Year-over-year, our cost of funds were up nine basis points reflecting substantial growth in higher cost commercial deposits to fund robust loan growth as well as the impact of higher rates in terming out some of our borrowed funds.
Next let’s move to Slide 13 and cover credit. Overall credit quality continues to be strong, reflecting the continued mix shift towards high-quality lower risk retail loans compared with growth in the larger company segments of our commercial book. The non-performing loan ratio remained flat to fourth quarter levels at 97 basis points of loans and improved from 107 basis points a year ago.
The net charge-off rate decreased to 33 basis points from more elevated in 4Q levels that included a $7 million increase in the auto portfolio related to a onetime methodology change. Retail net charge-offs decreased $20 million, while our commercial net charge offs were up slightly.
Provision for credit losses of $96 million, decreased $6 million from relatively high fourth quarter levels. As we continue to grow higher quality retail portfolios, our allowance for total loans and leases ratio has moved down modestly to 1.13%.
On Slide 14, you can see that we continue to maintain strong capital and liquidity positions. This quarter, as part of our 2016 CCAR plan, we’ve repurchased 3.4 million shares and returned over $200 million to share holders including dividend. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 11.2%.
As a reminder our CCAR capital plan targets the repurchase of up to $130 million in shares in the second quarter of 2017. It's also worth noting that the total and not returned to shareholders to date is 3 quarters of the 2016 CCAR window at $756 million including dividends.
On Slide 15, we show an update on progress against our strategic initiatives. I’d like to highlight that we continue to drive attractive loan growth across a number of areas. In consumer, we continued with strength in our mortgage loan officer recruitment efforts reaching 560 at quarter end, which should help provide an offset to industry wide origination headwinds. 
We continue to reduce the auto program to enhance return and we've seen really strong growth in our education refinance loan products, which has attractive risk-adjusted returns. In wealth, we saw nice plus in fees this quarter with the total investment sales up 13% linked quarter and 25% year-over-year. We continue to make progress in a year-over-year basis in shifting the mix of our sales towards more fee-based business, which came in at 36% compared to 14% in 1Q 2016.
In addition our FB headcount is up 9%, which is contributing towards the scale in the business. Commercial continues to deliver impressive results with a strong quarter and capital and global markets demonstrating the potential of these businesses given our expanded capabilities. The build out of Treasury Solutions is also on the right track with higher fee income growth linked quarter and year-over-year along with strong momentum in our commercial card program.
Moving on to Slide 16, the top programs have successfully delivered efficiencies that have allowed us to self-fund investments to improve our platforms and product offerings. In 2016, our top 2 program delivered $105 million in annual pre-tax benefits across our revenue and expense initiatives.

Our top 3 program, which launched in mid-2016, is on track to deliver targeted run rate benefit of $100 million to $115 million by the end of 2017. We have been working on a top 4 program and we expect to provide additional details on this on our second quarter call.
On Slide 17, you can see the steady progress we are making against our financial targets. Since 3Q 2013 our ROTCE has improved from 4.3% to 9.7%, which equates to 9% on an underlying basis. Our efficiency ratio has improved by 6% over that same time frame from 68% to 62%, and EPS continues on a very strong trajectory as well. More than doubling from $0.26 to $0.57 on an underlying basis.
Let's turn to our second quarter outlook on Slide 18, we expect a pretty linked quarter loan growth of around 1.5% on a period-end basis and 1% on an average basis. We continue to project full-year loan growth to be within the 5.5% to 7% full-year guidance range. We also expect net interest margin to continue to expand by about three basis points to four basis points linked quarter given the forward curve benefit.
In non-interest income, we are expecting to see a sequential decrease given the strong first quarter results in capital markets. The commercial activity pipelines have moderated somewhat as the market reassesses the political and economic outlook. 
We expect to keep expenses broadly stable in the second quarter with positive operating leverage and efficiency improving. We expect stable to slightly higher provision reflecting loan growth with relatively stable net charge-off levels. And finally, we expect to manage our CET1 ratio to around 11.1% and we will manage the average LDR to around 97% to 98%.
With regard to the full year 2017, outlook we broadly reaffirm on the balance sheet. And expense guidance that we previously provided but expect to come in at or above the high end of the range for NII and operating leverage.
To sum up on Slide 19, our strong results this quarter demonstrated our ability to continue to improve how we run the bank. We have delivered well against our strategic initiatives that help us drive underlying revenue growth and carefully manage our expense base. We remain committed to being prudent capital allocators and enhancing our returns for shareholders.
In the second half of the year, we will continue to focus on execution and making further progress for all stake holders. With that let me turn it back to Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun
Thanks John before we start the Q&A, let me turn it over to Brad for some brief words on a media article on our Checkup program. Brad.
Brad Conner
Thanks, Bruce. We have confidence in the Checkup program as an important part of our strategy to serve customers well and ultimately be better positioned to deepen relationships. We believe it's important to note that recent media coverage did not suggest customer harm nor have we identified any.
Nevertheless we have commenced a through review to determine whether there are any issues in the delivery of the program. My current expectation is that we are in a good position based on feedback and survey results we already have. Our surveys show that customers who go through the review are highly satisfied and most would recommend a Checkup to someone else.
An engagement and organizational health index at our braches is up, customer alignment is up and the [indiscernible] is down since we moved to this mode of interaction that our branch based customers. However we're open to things we learn from review that we can adjust to become even better. So back to you Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun
Okay, thanks Brad and with that operator we're ready to open it up for Q&A.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank Mr. Van Saun. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead. 

John Pancari
Good morning.
Bruce Van Saun
Hi.
John Pancari
Could you update us on your – your updated thoughts on the ROTC expectation at this point. I know you had a target of 10% medium term. You're certainly close to that now, so can you talk about where you expect that could go over the course of the next year and how soon you could be, up towards your original targets, when you spun off. Thanks.
Bruce Van Saun
John I have repeatedly not want to be drawn in on putting a pin in the exact timing that we get to the 10%, what I would say is that we've made nice progress, kind of consistently last year and now in the first quarter and we are getting closer, a lot will depend on first the environment and continued movement in the interest rates, which provide some tailwind and then our continued ability to execute on our strategic initiatives. 
So I think we have momentum, I think we’re as you say getting relatively close. So hopefully it won't be too long but what I would ultimately say is that once we get to that 10% we won't be satisfied. We will look out, we will be doing our strategic planning effort this summer and we'll consider whether at the appropriate time it is appropriate to raise that target even higher. 
John Pancari
Okay, all right thanks and then separately or just around the auto business, I know you indicated outside of the of the SCUSA purchases, ending that you are shrinking that that portfolio, so if you can talk about the rationale behind it and the magnitude of the shrinking we could expect and then separately any update on credit there. Is that influencing that decision?
Bruce Van Saun
Now it's really John, you can add to what I say or Brad, but I think that the real reason is that we grew the auto book when there wasn't much happening on the consumer side. So there side. So there was very little demand for credit from consumers except in the auto arena. So we ramped up our own self originations and we supplemented that with the SCUSA flow agreement, which got us into the prime space in the super prime space and delivering quite returns. 
Our view is always that the runoff in auto was a bridge to hold us and deploy some capital until ultimately the consumer can back and if you will got his/her mojo back and so we've seen that now. We've seen increase in demand for personal unsecured and revolving credit, student lending, mortgages. And so as those other portfolios grow, there's less need to have the auto and frankly the auto now that our returns have lifted is dilutive to our overall ROTCE and overall returns. 
So I think you'll see us we probably peaked at maybe $14 billion in total loan balance. I think that will probably be lower by about $1 billion and I would expect that trend to continue into next year. I do know, John or Brad?
John Woods
The only thing I would add in the specific question around in any way related to credit performance, the answer is no. Our credit performance has been strong, right in line with our pricing expectation and our expectation is, to your point, it's all about the return on the business. It's not in any way related to the credit performance. 
Bruce Van Saun
Okay, anything from you.
Brad Conner
Yes, just getting back to the point about reallocating that capital to hire a better use. I may have mentioned in my remarks that this generates higher risk-adjusted returns for us when we rotate that capital into those other consumer businesses, so we're excited about that. 
Bruce Van Saun
Yes
John Pancari
Okay great thank you.
Operator
And our next question will come from David Eads with UBS. Please go ahead.
David Eads
Hi, good morning, and welcome John. Maybe starting with you, I think when you talked about kind of the strategic priorities, you started with opportunities for to optimize and improve on the funding side. See if you can kind of drill into more detail of where you think opportunities might be there, whether it is on the consumer side or the commercial side – how you think that’s going end, what opportunities are going to be shaking out given the changes to the dynamics for deposit given higher rates? 

John Woods
Yes, thanks. And I think I've just talked about it on both sides and partnering with Don and Brad on this. In early days, there's been nice momentum in both of those businesses on funding. I'd say that we're entering into an environment here, which we'll all talk about rising rates and how we all operate in that environment. But looking forward, when you look at overall balance sheet, we're looking to remix and as we just talked about on the asset side and better use of that capital, we're constantly looking for better ways to fund that portfolio and that's part of our franchise.
And we have some momentum there in terms of getting the right mix of commercial and consumer, so I think you'll see a bit more on the commercial side and getting a better representation of commercial deposits in our footprint. And there's also – we've seen good control of deposit cost in the consumer side. So like everybody, we're going to constantly look at that and look for ways to better fund the balance sheet.
Bruce Van Saun
Brad, we want to add some of the initiatives may be that you have going on in consumer, targeting of that segmentation of the customer base, mining products and having data analytics to really tease out the products from with good offers to different segments of the base?
Brad Conner
Yes, you bet. A couple of things we've got. I think we talked about this a little bit on last quarter's call. We have redesigned our value proposition for our massive and affluent consumers. I think you’d get a much better value proposition to serve the needs of those customers. And then we invested very heavily in analytics and really understanding our customer segments and how to reach them with very specific and targeted offers so that our offers are much less about putting broad offers out, if you will, across the entire branch base that’s targeting the specific customers and specific customers sets. And we think that will really allow us to be much more efficient in driving lower-cost deposits.
Bruce Van Saun
Yes. And Brad, you're also looking to focus on where the opportunities are for deposits?
Brad Conner
Yes. I mean, I think we’ve got materially more sophisticated in our deposit strategies over the last couple of quarters and added staff and added specific programs and added industry base focus to where we work with those deposits that are attractive and attractively priced, so we’re very confident there.
Bruce Van Saun
And we will start to emphasize some of the industry segments that have that are cash rich as supposed to on a credit needy. I think it's part of the rotation that we're looking at as well.
Brad Conner
Correct.
David Eads
Great. Thanks, guys. That’s very helpful. And may be second question, obviously a really good quarter on the fee side, you talked about may be a little bit of pullback on the capital markets. I'm curious, is the equitation that this step up in the card fee line should be sustainable and kind of a may be fluctuating, but broadly sustainable at this higher level?
Bruce Van Saun
Yes. Let me take that and then I’ll ask my partners to color. But first off, with respect to capital markets, it really was an exceptionally strong quarter and I think it really shows that we built some great capabilities. We had to move off of being a partner with RBS for many of these products, and we've now stood them up on our own. We've got really good teamwork going between coverage bankers and our product specialists, and we're making great traction and the market conditions were very favorable and I think we hit the ball out of the park.
I think what we're cautioning is that we were at record levels when the capital markets fees were in the mid-$30s very recently, we just hit a $48. I still think the numbers this year, the outlook is strong but it's kind of capturing lightning in the bottle at this point for $48. But like I used to kid with Don and his team, when we were in the $20s, $30s, the new $20 and then we were in the $30s, $40s, the new $30, so I think we will continue to see as we built up our book of customers and continue to expand our capabilities that will push that number at over time.

On the card side, what I would say is that, look, the renegotiations that we had with our core processing vendors creates a sustainable lift. There was some of rewards expense adjustment in the quarter which would not repeat, but that will be partially offset by seasonality in Q2. So I think we'll see a good percentage of this lift stick but not all. So, Don, I don’t know if you want to add any color?
Don McCree
No, I think you’re exactly right on capital markets. I mean, the only thing I'd add is it is incredibly competitive out there right now and aggressive, so we're trying to maintain a level of discipline on the transactions we do. Highly encouraged by the quality of the franchise and the transactions that we are doing, we're winning in disproportionate share of what we're seeing. So as you said it is the function of activity in the market, discipline, and then quality of franchise. I think we will continue to have strong quarters going forward. 
Our treasury services business, just to mention that, my other fee line has got tremendous momentum and it's really led by card which is growing at 30% to 40% a year. So that's the way for the future in terms of our treasury business, so on both …
Bruce Van Saun
Yes.
Don McCree
Really nothing to add, Bruce. I think you said it right.
Bruce Van Saun
Okay.
David Eads
Great. Thanks so much.
Bruce Van Saun
Thanks Eads.
Operator 
And our next question will come from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
Matt Burnell
Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just focusing for a minute on commercial lending. What are the trends you're seeing there in terms of demand by size or maybe industry verticals? A couple of your competitors over the last few days have mentioned a growing demand in mid-market and maybe below mid-market relative to where it's been the last few quarters. Can you give us a little more color in terms of those trends and the utilization rates?
Bruce Van Saun
Don, you want to take that?
Don McCree
I'd say utilization just to start with that, it's up slightly not in a material way. So we're seeing pretty standard utilization. Our pipelines in our mid-market business are actually quite strong. And the question is what closes and when does it close and how does the demand continue to materialize? We saw quite robust kind of conversations in demands early, early in the year off the back of the changes in administration. And I would say, given some of the uncertainty of delivery of some of those programs and potential delay into the back end of the year, it's moderated a little bit.
But we're encouraged by what we're seeing in terms of pipeline growth and activity in conversations. I will say that it's been offset by two other factors. One is there has been very tremendous capital markets activity and in our mid-corporate and some of our industry vertical businesses, we've seen a lot of refinancings into the capital markets given the strength of the capital markets. You can see that in our fee lines as we capture some of that opportunity. And at the margin we've got more disciplined on returns, so we are turning certain parts of the book to try to build better returning portfolios.
So we've seen shrink in places like our leasing business, which has been offset by growth in other parts of our business. So I guess I'd summarize it by saying client activity is strong. We think the franchise is strong. We're adding a lot of new clients. So we're optimistic as we look out through the next several quarters, whether it materializes in the second quarter or third quarter is the timing question get's in the back of my mind.
Matt Burnell
Okay. And just staying on the idea of commercial, you’ve mentioned a couple of times so far this call about growing commercial deposits prudently. And I'm curious, John, if you think that that's going to add to pressure in terms of deposit beta over your relative to what your prior expectations have been.

John Woods
I think we are going to talk a little bit about how those funds are being deployed as well. You have heard a little bit earlier. We're putting that money to good use. We're making prudent decisions on the pricing side. And we have – we're doing better on the loan yield side. So you've got to look at those sides of the balance sheet there when you talk about what we're doing with those funds. Sure, commercial deposits have bit higher beta than a consumer deposits. But as you heard earlier from Don, we are under-penetrated on that side. We've got some very interesting things going on in the products front that will help to create some momentum on raising commercial deposits. And we feel good about where that will go in terms of from a mix standpoint and how we will put that capital and liquidity to work.
Matt Burnell
Thank you.
Operator
And our next question will come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Ricky Dodds
Hey guys, this is actually Ricky Dodds from Matt's team. Just a quick question on the buildout and wealth in mortgage. It seems to be going pretty well and appreciate the update and the press release. Just wondering if you could give a little more color on sort of what's left to do there? And how you think you guys are doing on the build versus maybe your initial expectations? Thanks.
Bruce Van Saun
Brad, you want to take that? 
Brad Conner
Sure. I would say we're feeling pretty good about both of those areas. I will start with mortgage. We were up 22 this quarter, up 125 year-on-year. I think the key for us has been we feel really good about the progress we're making in turning our operations around. So we've really seen improvement in our customer satisfaction operations, which has allowed us to recruit loan officers and retain loan officers. Obviously the entire industry is seeing a little bit of slowdown in terms of demand.
But all in all, we feel good and the progress that we're making with hiring our loan officers have been in our conforming geographies as well, which will help drive fee income. So we feel very good about that. I'd say on the wealth side, good quarter for us and we feel good about the progress we're making. We continue to see improved growth. We talked about it last quarter. One of the things that slowed our trajectory a little bit in growing fee income was a movement from to more managed money, fee-based products and we're seeing that trend continue but we feel like we've sort of crossed over that threshold where not yet that sustainable source of fee income and so continuing to have good success and good progress. And I would say yes, maybe to your question about how do we feel against our original projection, we feel like we're pretty much on track there guys.
John Woods
Well, I'd say it's probably taken us longer…
Brad Conner
Taken us longer.
John Woods
…to get here, but we have made some I'd say slight adjustments in the mortgages to make sure we are focusing on the conforming geographies to make sure we get fulfillment on servicing where it needs to be. And in wealth, I think we're just building it the right way, putting the right products in place, we're putting the right customer segmentation and delivery mechanisms in place. We've got the robo advisory now up and running this quarter, and so I am really excited about really where both businesses are today and the outlook although I'd say to be fair, it's taken us a little longer to get there.
Ricky Dodds
Okay, great. Thanks. And just a quick one on occupancy cost this quarter. It looks like you called out about $5 million and branch rationalization or upgrade cost. Wondering if you can give a little color on that and then is that something we should expect going forward as you continue to sort of make improvements to your footprint?

Bruce Van Saun
Yes, there's probably of that increase. I think it was maybe 3 or 4 was related to the branch charges. But what we're focused on here is what we call refer to as branch transformation, which is to take a look at all our branches and try to figure out how to reconfigure them. So in most instances, we don't need as much space as we have, so we want to reduce the overall square footage in the branches and we want to take what was space dedicated to transactions and the remaining space should have more private rooms for conversation. So we can deliver advice to our customers, and we can also use the foyer , the entrance room for putting in some very sophisticated machines that people can do a lot of the banking that require tellers right on those machines.
We're probably looking at a 10-year timeline based on our lease expiries to get to all our branches and we're kind of in the early stages of that. So initially, you'll see the charges for the refurbs exceed what we get in terms of the back book of lower rent from the restructured branches. But as time goes by, that becomes a nice driver because ultimately, we'll be driving the occupancy expense, lower and because of the less square footage, and that will swamp the cost of a handful of branches each quarter getting refurbished. So anyway, that's what you saw in Q1.
Ricky Dodds
Okay. Thank you.
Operator 
[Operator Instructions] And we'll go to the line of Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan.
Vivek Juneja
Hi, Bruce. Hi, John.
Bruce Van Saun
Hi, Vivek.
Vivek Juneja
I wanted to talk a little bit about reserves, reserve levels for your loan portfolio, obviously crisp and very good, but how you're thinking about reserves to loans have come down a little further to 113% and where do you see that leveling out?
John Woods
Look, we're comfortable with where that is Vivek and I think it partly reflects the shift in some of the portfolio that you've seen, you've seen someone runoff of – some of the legacy poor assets that service by other home equity portfolio being replaced with very high prime and super prime consumer assets, which has been an upgrade. And I think in the commercial side, you're seeing growth in the kind of mid-corporate space, which tend to be higher rated credit. So I think it's really just overall function of the decisions we're making in terms of how we plan where we play. If you look at the coverage ratios of things like NPLs, that continues to go up. And I think we're up to 118% on that basis. 
So overall, I think we're probably getting to a point where you won't see significant further reductions from that 1013%. But hopefully if we keep working down the book of NPLs, you might see that number continue to improve somewhat.
The other thing I'd say that's quite interesting is while we’re focused on getting higher yields and we're also improving the risk-adjusted returns on our loan book, we're seeing that our stress test losses are actually reducing because of some of the impacts that I described that's running off these legacy portfolios and putting really good quality back on the book. So you kind of have the hatch wrecking effects, better yields, better risk adjusted returns and lower stress losses, which is really great to see.
Vivek Juneja
Okay, great. You basically [indiscernible] into my next question, which was CCAR. Can you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about that and given your continued very strong capital levels, your plans for how you're thinking about capital return and capital deployment?
Bruce Van Saun
Sure. And again, we've been, I think very consistent and predictable that we've been on a glide path that we want to have strong returns of capital to shareholders and strong loan growth. The fact that we were birth from RBS with a high capital ratio has allowed us that flexibility. We're coming closer and closer to where peers are but we still have, I think, relatively high rates. I think you could expect more of the same in terms of our approach this year.

When I think about what we want to do with capital, certainly, increasing the dividend you saw us raise the dividend and the payout ratio is going up. We'd like that to continue, and we'll also want to continue to fund loan growth as a high priority. And then when we have excess, we'll use that to repurchase the shares. So that's it in a nutshell.
Vivek Juneja
And are you still targeting, Bruce, as you look out what kind of target capital ratios rather than me putting words in your mouth let me just give that too. What are you thinking? Where you would like to run with that?
Bruce Van Saun
Well, we haven't really freshened that view. As you recall when we did the IPO roadshow, we said we wanted to bring it down to around 11%. I think last year, we came from 11.7% to 11.2%-ish. So the glide path in the past couple of years has been down 50 basis points or so. I think it’ll cross over 11% this year and still have a differential to peers. So I think this continued glide path can continue not only this year but into next year, and so we'll stay tuned on that. We'll probably post you on that sometime in the middle of the year.
Vivek Juneja
Thanks, Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun
Okay.
Operator
And our next question will come from Scott Valentin with Compass Point. Please go ahead.
Scott Valentin
Good morning, thanks for taking my question. Just on the unsecured portion of loan origination, just wondering, I know you guys used combination of partnerships and I guess internal initiatives. Just wondering over time if you plan to internalize all of that, will partnerships remain a key component into driving that unsecured loan growth, consumer loan growth? 
Bruce Van Saun
Let me start and Brad can add some color on this. But clearly, we've had – I think we've taken the view that to grow our card portfolio is challenging because the payback period for actually growing that book takes some time and so there were better uses of expense dollars to grow other portfolios.
One of the things when we looked at the unsecured space and struck up the partnership with Apple, was that the returns are accretive much faster, so we were able to make an investment to build the capabilities to support Apple, but then as the balances come on the books, we're not paying for zero balance transfers and heavy marketing expenses. So we like that aspect about the program and the risk-adjusted returns on that portfolio are very good from our standpoint.
We have – because of that, being partnered with an iconic company like Apple, we've had other reverse inquiries and we've actually gone out and solicited some, so we've got two new partnerships set up that will gain some traction as the year goes by. One is with Vivint, a smart alarm company and the other is with HP, and stay tuned because there could be more in the works. So we like that capability that we have developed and partnering with real class companies and so that I think will be a growth feature going forward.
We've also determined that there is an opportunity, much in the way with add refi lending products that we can offer attractive propositions to borrowers who are carrying high-cost debt. There is other customers of ours who maybe carrying multiple revolving credit balances who can consolidate that into an unsecured line of credit, and so we introduced our pearl product last year and that has real traction too. So I think you'll probably see a combination of it too. You will see some direct mailing and branch offers to our customers on the pearl product and then married to an overall trust on the partnership side. So, Brad, you want to add to that?
Brad Conner
[indiscernible] I think you said it right, I mean, we have a very high quality list of other potential partners that have reached out to us. I think we have new capability and we think we can continue to expand with a very attractive set of customers. I’d just point out to that Vivint is a very good commercial bank customer of Don and I think it’s also related to build rate synergy between the consumer and the commercial bank and we will continue to look at those opportunities as well.

Bruce Van Saun
Great 
Scott Valentin
Thanks very much.
Bruce Van Saun
Okay.
Operator
And there are no further questions in queue at this time. I'll turn it back over to Mr. Van Saun for closing remarks.
Bruce Van Saun
Okay. Well, thanks again everyone for dialing in today. We really appreciate your interest. As I said in the press release, I think we're really firing well on all cylinders. I remain very confident in our full-year outlook. Thanks again, and have a good day.

Citizens Bank CEO Bruce Van Saun visits Father Bill’s Shelter in Quincy, one of the nonprofits the bank supports.



By Deirdre Fernandes
	Globe Staff 
	July 12, 2015







A washing machine spun loudly at a homeless shelter as workers mopped floors to prepare for the men and women who would line up for a hot meal and safe cot. Nearby, in a dimly lit room crammed with bunk beds, Bruce Van Saun stood in his impeccably tailored suit and silk tie, looking as if he may have wandered into the wrong place. Father Bill’s Place, a Quincy shelter, isn’t normally where you would find the chief executive of one of the nation’s largest banks. And it is miles away from the London and New York boardrooms where Van Saun crafted a decades-long career in investment and global banking.

But almost two years after taking the helm of Providence-based Citizens Financial Group Inc., stops at homeless shelters and food banks are an increasing part of Van Saun’s packed schedule as he tries to rejuvenate the bank’s sluggish performance as well as its community image. The 58-year-old Van Saun spent years behind the scenes digging through financial data and pitching investors; now he is the public face of Citizens, reaching out to a broader audience of customers, employees, politicians, and community leaders.

“We need to make sure we are dominant in our home area,” Van Saun said in a recent interview. “What we want to do is grow.”

 RBS’s influence in Citizens recedes
Royal Bank of Scotland sold 135 million shares of Citizens, reducing its stake in the bank to below 50 percent.






Van Saun is leading Citizens through a crucial time as it makes the transition from a foreign-owned subsidiary to an independent, publicly traded US corporation. Royal Bank of Scotland PLC, which owned Citizens for more than a quarter-century, has sold its majority stake in two rounds of stock offerings since the end of last year and plans to divest its remaining 41 percent by the end of 2016.Van Saun, who previously worked as Royal Bank of Scotland’s finance director, was sent to Citizens to get the bank ready for sale by trimming costs and boosting profits. He has since launched Citizens into several new markets, such as student loans, and expanded auto and mortgage lending.

He sold off 100 poorly performing Chicago area branches of Charter One, a Midwestern franchise that Citizens bought in 2004, an acquisition analysts have said was ill-advised and dragged down earnings. Van Saun also rebranded the remaining Charter One operations under the Citizens name. And he has hired executives from some of the nation’s biggest banks, including Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co., for his leadership team.“There’s still a significant amount of work to do,” Van Saun said at a recent investor conference in New York.But colleagues and former bosses say Van Saun is the man for the job. Milton Berlinski, an investment banker and co-founder of Reverence Capital Partners in New York, has worked with Van Saun for more than a decade. He described Van Saun as a strategic, no-nonsense executive who understands his business and knows how to succeed.“He’s a roll-up-his-sleeves type,” Berlinski said. “He identifies the dollars, the nickels and the dimes, and the pennies. He is good at analyzing where the bank’s making money and where it’s not.”Van Saun, a New Jersey native, traces his family roots in the state to Dutch immigrants who settled there in the 1700s. George Washington is believed to have slept in the house his grandfather owned.

His grandfather was also a banker, and Van Saun studied business at Bucknell University in Pennsylvania and the University of North Carolina, where he earned his MBA. His first job was as financial planner and analyst for food maker General Mills Inc. of Minneapolis. He then worked for the securities firm Kidder, Peabody & Co. and investment bank Wasserstein Perella & Co., which took part in many of the biggest mergers and acquisitions of the 1990s. From there, he became chief financial officer at Deutsche Bank North America, a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank AG of Germany, then the Bank of New York, where he helped guide its 2007 merger with Mellon Financial Corp. 


‘We need to make sure we are dominant in our home area. What we want to do is grow.’

Bruce Van Saun, Citizens Bank CEO 



He was known for doing his homework on any deal in which he was involved and insisting that others on the team be just as well  schooled. Gunnar Overstrom, a managing partner of Three Corner Global, an New York investment firm, was an adviser for Bank of New York when Van Saun was chief financial officer. If people showed up unprepared, Overstrom said, Van Saun would let them know it was unacceptable.“He’s pretty direct,” Overstrom said. “Typically, you got on board with how he did things, or you left.”Van Saun joined Royal Bank of Scotland in 2009, the year after the global financial crisis pushed the company to the brink of failure and drove the British government to take control of the bank in a $70 billion taxpayer bailout. His job: help turn around the bank.As the economy and the bank’s finances stabilized, the British government pressured RBS to sell Citizens and repay taxpayers. RBS turned to Van Saun to get Citizens in shape for a public stock offering. No easy task. Citizens, with $136.5 billion in assets, is the nation’s 13th-largest retail bank, but has underperformed in recent years and lost top managers to competitors. Its returns on equity averaged below 5 percent from 2010 to 2013, compared with many other large regional banks that earned closer to 10 percent. Citizens was hurt by its portfolio of subprime mortgages, a chunk held by Charter One, and by neglect from its parent, RBS, which had its own problems in the United Kingdom.  The bank’s shares were priced in September 2014 at $21.50, below initial projections. It has since risen by more than 25 percent, and closed Friday at $27.20, a sign that Citizens is on the right path, bank officials said. Its return on equity was 6.7 percent last year, according to financial filings.

“I want Citizens to be regarded as a top performing regional bank,” said Van Saun, who took over as chief executive in 2013.

Pat Rohan, a managing director of FinPro Inc., a bank consultant in New Jersey, said Van Saun’s plan to increase mortgage lending and move into riskier, but potentially more profitable segments of auto lending is a sound approach to boosting returns.But banking is not just about offering the right products, analysts said. Bankers also must build relationships where they operate, so consumers and businesses think of them when they want to borrow or invest.“The success for any bank to grow is to establish ties to the communities,” Rohan said. “That requires boots on the ground.”Before the financial crisis, Citizens was a high-profile player in Greater Boston and other communities, despite its British ownership. Executives sat on nonprofit boards ranging from the United Way to the Boston Symphony and were on annual lists of the city’s power players.But Boston banker Lawrence Fish, who had built the bank into a  regional presence and was at one point paid more than his boss in the UK, stepped down as chief executive in 2007, the financial crisis followed, and Citizens pulled back. The bank’s charitable giving, for example, dropped 36 percent from $25 million in 2007 to $16 million in 2012. 
Local charities and civic groups haven’t known whom to approach at Citizens for support on  community initiatives, said Paul S. Grogan, president of The Boston Foundation, a major charitable group in the city. “It was hard to define what they were up to,” Grogan said. Van Saun said he is working to get the right people in leadership positions to make sure the bank meets the needs of its customers and communities. He still lives with his wife in New Jersey, but works out of the bank’s main offices in Providence and Stamford, Conn.Van Saun said Citizens’ success will ultimately be about execution, and he has shifted his focus from separating from RBS to improving service and products at Citizens. “I think the main switch was going from defense to offense,” Van Saun said. “I want Citizens to be regarded as a top performing regional bank.”

Van Saun’s career includes stints at General Mills Inc., Kidder, Peabody & Co., Wasserstein Perella & Co., Deutsche Bank North America, and Bank of New York.
