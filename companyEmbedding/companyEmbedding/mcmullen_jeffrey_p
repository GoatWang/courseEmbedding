24/7 Wall St. Most Overpaid CEO Of The Day: PharmaNet Development (PGDI) CEO Jeffrey P. McMullen

PharmaNet Development (PDGI), a clinical services company, lowered its 2008 forecast for the second time, projecting a loss of 25 cents to 58 cents per share on $358 million to $366 million in revenue.
Investors were unusually upset and sent the stock down 52% to $10.07, a new 52-week low. The period high was $43.05. 


The company’s CEO Jeffrey P. McMullen does not have to worry much.

McMullen had a base salary of $695,000 last year. He even got a raise to $740,000 for 2008. In 2007, Mullen picked up a bonus check for $886,000.
According to the PDGI proxy, Mr. McMullen’s employment agreement awards him perquisites up to the amount of $32,500. If there is change of control at the company he gets 36 months of his base pay.
That’s a very good deal for a company which has wiped out $600 million of its market cap.
Douglas A. McIntyre
