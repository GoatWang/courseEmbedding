History[edit]
Harris Associates was founded in 1976 by Victor Morgenstern,[2] Myron Szold, Roger Brown, Ralph Wanger,[3] Joe Braucher, Peter Foreman, Ed Neisser and Earl Rusnak, who had previously worked in the private investment office of Chicago entrepreneur Irving Harris. Irving Harris was not directly related to the Norman Harris who established Harris Bank.[citation needed].
Investment philosophy[edit]
Harris Associates is considered to be a value investor. The investment process entails investing in businesses that are trading at a discount to instrinsic value. The instrinsic value is based on a discounted cash flow analysis that takes into account the quality of management and the company's ability to grow.[4] According to research by Morningstar in April 2013 which analyzed the performance of the seven Oakmark funds over a five-year period, four were ranked in at least the top 2% in their relevant categories.[5]
Supreme Court case[edit]
In 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear Jones v. Harris Associates, a suit brought in federal court by a group of mutual fund investors against the firm. The mutual fund investors, who are investors in the Oakmark funds, claimed that the funds have overpaid their advisor (Harris Associates), and that the fees that Harris Associates charges Oakmark investors are higher than the fees that Harris charges institutional clients.[6]
The suit previously had been thrown out by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in 2008, with a judge who is a noted free-market backer, Richard Posner arguing that sometimes marketplaces need to be reined in.[7][8]
In March 2010, the Supreme Court unanimously vacated the Seventh Circuit's ruling and remanded the case.[9]

Discipline is the Harris Associates way. Our long, consistent record of excellence is built on our fundamental belief in value investing, which goes beyond short-term performance, focusing on long-term quality and returns.  In constructing portfolios for our clients, we seek out companies that we believe are trading at significant discounts to their underlying value. We view every stock purchase as if we were buying a piece of a business, not just a stock certificate. We look for managers who seek to maximize the long-term value of the business for its owners by running efficient operations, concentrating on cash flow and allocating capital wisely. Our belief in our process helps us to stand firm in our philosophy through the natural ebbs and flows of the markets, striving to exceed our clients’ high expectations.

                            About Us



Harris Associates L.P. was founded in 1976 by dedicated investment professionals who believed that delivering successful investment results for clients requires a consistent investment philosophy, a commitment to superior investment research, and a high level of customer service. Our roster of clients has grown over the years, but these basic beliefs remain unchanged.
Assets under management at Harris Associates totaled approximately $124 billion as of June 30, 2017. Our team in Chicago includes 39 investment professionals and 198 total employees.
Value Investing
We are value investors. In constructing portfolios for our clients, we seek out companies that we believe are trading in the market at significant discounts to their underlying value. These businesses must offer significant profit potential and be run by managers who think and act as owners. We frame the investment process as owning a piece of a business for the long term.
Research
We believe in the importance of intensive, fundamental research. We are independent thinkers who do not look to Wall Street for our answers. Our experienced investment analysts evaluate each company on the basis of its fundamental characteristics. Our research process is based on a disciplined quantitative and qualitative screening process.
Client Service
Just as investment performance is important, so too is the care and attention each client receives. We recognize that each of our clients has unique goals and needs; therefore, portfolios are separately crafted to meet those objectives. We are as proud of our client service as we are of our outstanding long-term investment results.

History[edit]
Harris Associates was founded in 1976 by Victor Morgenstern,[2] Myron Szold, Roger Brown, Ralph Wanger,[3] Joe Braucher, Peter Foreman, Ed Neisser and Earl Rusnak, who had previously worked in the private investment office of Chicago entrepreneur Irving Harris. Irving Harris was not directly related to the Norman Harris who established Harris Bank.[citation needed].
Investment philosophy[edit]
Harris Associates is considered to be a value investor. The investment process entails investing in businesses that are trading at a discount to instrinsic value. The instrinsic value is based on a discounted cash flow analysis that takes into account the quality of management and the company's ability to grow.[4] According to research by Morningstar in April 2013 which analyzed the performance of the seven Oakmark funds over a five-year period, four were ranked in at least the top 2% in their relevant categories.[5]
Supreme Court case[edit]
In 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear Jones v. Harris Associates, a suit brought in federal court by a group of mutual fund investors against the firm. The mutual fund investors, who are investors in the Oakmark funds, claimed that the funds have overpaid their advisor (Harris Associates), and that the fees that Harris Associates charges Oakmark investors are higher than the fees that Harris charges institutional clients.[6]
The suit previously had been thrown out by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in 2008, with a judge who is a noted free-market backer, Richard Posner arguing that sometimes marketplaces need to be reined in.[7][8]
In March 2010, the Supreme Court unanimously vacated the Seventh Circuit's ruling and remanded the case.[9]

Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo
