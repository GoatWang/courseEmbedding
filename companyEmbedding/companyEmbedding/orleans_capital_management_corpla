Energy - Orleans Capital Management 



































Energy and Alternative Energy Opportunities Investment Strategies
Early in 2000, Orleans Capital Management Corporation (OCM) in conjunction with Simmons & Company International (SCI) identified a unique, opportunistic investment theme focusing on the developing global energy supply and demand dynamics. That fall OCM launched its Energy Opportunities investment strategy, which is a long only, equity investment strategy designed to capitalize on increasing energy expenditures necessary to supply the energy required by a growing global economy. In executing this strategy, OCM teamed with SCI, the only independent investment bank specializing in the entire spectrum of the energy industry. Founded in 1974, SCI has acted as financial advisor in over $134 billion of transactions, including 535 merger and acquisitions worth over $93 billion. Pursuant to a Research and Sub-Advisory Agreement, SCI provided OCM with energy research and sub-advisory services used by OCM in the execution of the Energy Opportunities strategy. During 2008, OCM and SCI formed Energy Opportunities Capital Management, L.L.C. (EOCM) as a separate entity to manage the Energy Opportunities and the related Alternative Energy investment strategies. EOCM is a Delaware limited liability company, formed on May 9, 2008. EOCM became a SEC registered investment adviser on October 6, 2008. EOCM was formed to act as successor to the original Energy Opportunities and Alternative Energy Opportunities investment strategies developed by OCM. The Energy Opportunities strategy is designed to capitalize on existing and developing energy supply and demand fundamentals and their impact on various companies within the universe of publicly traded equity securities. Investment decisions are the product of the combined investment expertise of EOCM's portfolio managers coupled with input from OCM and the world renowned energy industry insight and knowledge of SCI. The primary thrust of the strategy is to capitalize on the ongoing positive supply and demand fundamentals that exist in energy markets. Among other things, we emphasize those sectors and companies that are beneficiaries of the necessary capital expenditures that will be required to generate the supply required to maintain and support increasing global energy demand and global economic growth. The fundamental investment objective is to produce returns superior to energy related benchmarks and broad market equity indices by investing in a diversified portfolio of energy company equities designed to capitalize on existing energy supply and demand fundamentals. EOCM believes that the current and developing global energy supply and demand fundamentals provide an investment opportunity given the increased levels of capital spending that will be required to produce supply sufficient to meet growing global energy needs. EOCM is specifically equipped to understand and capitalize upon this opportunity given the individuals involved in day to day portfolio management as well as the world renowned energy insight and research provided by SCI. More specifically, EOCM believes that companies within the oil service sector are most likely to benefit from the market environment. SCI has been throughout its history the premier provider of investment banking and research services related to the oil service sector in particular. For more information regarding EOCM and the Energy Opportunities and Alternative Energy Opportunities strategies, please contact OCM or visit EOCM's website at www.energyocm.com.

Insurance Funds - Orleans Capital Management



































Insurance Funds
Our approach begins with a thorough understanding of the unique operating characteristics of your fund which influence investment strategy. We assist you in establishing appropriate investment guidelines and performance benchmarks to measure the value added provided by our investment management. Orleans Capital's investment philosophy is to ensure the achievement of your fund's goals from your investment portfolio with minimal, understandable, and quantifiable risk. We carefully manage cashflow, considering both maturities and income, to ensure that your cash needs will be met even in the event of extreme underwriting results.

This enables you to effectively meet your fund’s underwriting obligations as well as to provide for the payment of dividends. Also, by gaining confidence that your liquidity requirements are met, we can be more productive with the remaining assets of the portfolio. Orleans Capital's investment process combines strength in fundamental credit analysis with state-of-the-art portfolio modeling techniques and broad-based trading capabilities.

In the long run they will charge you plenty and the support is virtually non-existent. They don't even have a working answering system. They are disorganized  and a nightmare to work with.

Making simple transfers or even looking at accounts is harder and more confusing. bring back the old version.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year
