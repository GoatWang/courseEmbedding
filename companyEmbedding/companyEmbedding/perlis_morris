 Educational Background



 


Concordia University

                  Those who want options in their higher learning experience might find
Concordia University (CU) in Portland, Oregon a great choice for college.
CU students are given the flexibility to learn in a campus classroom
environment, on the internet, or in study abroad programs.

The school presents credit for short (two weeks) and long-term (one year)
academic experiences on most continents around the world. This is a great
way for students to become worldly and gain knowledge of different
cultures.

CU is a smaller, private, Christian university. They offer students
access to bible review groups, campus church services, and religious
retreats. The school has undergraduate and graduate programs in Exercise
and Sport Science, Nursing, and Social Work. They also have the same type
of academic degree programs online for those who want to pursue degrees
in areas such as Theological Studies, Teaching, and Business
Administration.

The university can provide monetary assistance to those who qualify, and
they extend a special offer to students. Those who completely fill out
the FAFSA forms can earn $1,000 or some other type of financial aid from
the school just for applying. Most of the population at CU is receiving
some type of financial support.

If you are looking for variety in your academic experience in a Christian
college environment, Concordia University might be the right place for
you.
