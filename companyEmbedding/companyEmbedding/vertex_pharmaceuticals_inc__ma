Vertex Pharmaceuticals is an American Pharmaceutical company based in Boston, Massachusetts.
Vertex was founded in 1989 by Joshua Boger[2] and Kevin J. Kinsella.[3] Vertex was one of the first biotech firms to use an explicit strategy of rational drug design rather than combinatorial chemistry.
By 2004, its product pipeline focused on viral infections, inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, and cancer. It maintains headquarters in South Boston, Massachusetts, and two research facilities, in San Diego, California, and Oxford, England. The company's beginnings were profiled by Barry Werth in the 1994 book The Billion-Dollar Molecule[3] and its further development in his 2014 book, The Antidote: Inside the World of New Pharma.[4] In 2009, the company had about 1,800 employees, including 1,200 in the Boston area.[2]
In January 2014, Vertex completed its move from Cambridge, Massachusetts to Boston, Massachusetts, and took residence in a new, $800 million complex. Located on the South Boston waterfront, it will mark the first time in the company's history that all of the roughly 1,200 Vertex employees in the Greater Boston area will be working together.
Since late 2011, when Jeffrey M. Leiden joined Vertex as CEO, Vertex has ranked among the top 15 best performing companies on the Standard & Poor’s 500. Vertex shares increased 250 percent in the same period.[5] Vertex posted only one annual profit since it was founded in 1989.[5]

Telaprevir[edit]
In May 2011, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the drug telaprevir (Incivek), an oral treatment for hepatitis C marketed by Vertex. Development and commercialization of telaprevir is shared with Johnson & Johnson for European distribution and Mitsubishi for Asia. Telaprevir is a protease inhibitor.[6]
Cystic fibrosis[edit]
Ivacaftor[edit]
In 2012 ivacaftor, was designated as an orphan drug, identifying cystic fibrosis as affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. On January 31, 2012, Vertex gained FDA approval [7] of the first drug, Kalydeco,[8] to treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis rather than the symptoms, in patients 6 years or older who have the G551D gene mutation. In the US, 30,000 people have cystic fibrosis. About 4% of those, or 1,200, have the G551D gene mutation. Vertex is marketing the drug at $307,000 a year per patient.[9] Vertex also is studying ivacaftor in combination with another drug (lumacaftor[10]) for the most common mutation in CF, known as F508del, and expects the first set of results in 2012. Vertex worked for 13 years with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation to develop the drug.[11]
In the UK, the company provided the drug free for a limited time for certain patients, then left the hospitals to decide whether to continue to pay for it for those patients. UK agencies estimated the cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) at between £335,000 and £1,274,000—far above the NICE thresholds[12] of £20,000-£30,000.
On November 5, 2014 Vertex announced the submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA for a fully co-formulated combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor for people with cystic fibrosis ages 12 and older who have two copies of the F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene.[13] In 2015, FDA approved Orkambi lumacaftor/ivacaftor to treat cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients 12 years and older, who have the F508del mutation.[14]
mRNA therapeutics[edit]
In 2016, the company entered into a collaboration with Moderna, in fact taking an ownership stake in the company, to develop new mRNA-based therapeutics to treat CF.[15]
Venture philanthropy[edit]
In the late 1990s the Bethesda-based Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, encouraged by then-President Robert Beall, began investing in Vertex— when it was a small start-up biotechnology company— to help fund the development of Kalydeco in the form of venture philanthropy. The total investment amounted to $150 million.[16] In 2014, the CF Foundation sold the rights to the royalties of the drugs for $3.3 billion, twenty times the Foundation’s 2013 budget.[16][17]
By 2015 the annual cost of Kalydeco had risen to more than $300,000 per patient.[18]
According to an article published in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Vertex executives "grossed more than $100 million by cashing in stocks and stock options" and at "one point, the value of company's stock increased more $6 billion in a single day."[19]
Twenty-nine physicians and scientists working with people with cystic fibrosis (CF) wrote to Jeff Leiden, CEO of Vertex Pharmaceuticals to plead for lower prices.[20]

"We are aware of the financial complexities of the huge expenses for R & D with respect to the small number of patients or the market system that enables these advances to become reality. Yet -- notwithstanding all your patient support programs -- it is at best unseemly for Vertex to charge our patients’ insurance plans (including strapped state medical assistance plans), $294,000 annually for two pills a day (a 10-fold increase in a typical patient's total drug costs). This action could appear to be leveraging pain and suffering into huge financial gain for speculators, some of whom were your top executives who reportedly made millions of dollars in a single day (Boston Globe, May 29)."
— David M. Orenstein, MD et al.

The company responded in an email that "while publicly funded academic research provided important early understanding of the cause of cystic fibrosis, it took Vertex scientists 14 years of their own research, funded mostly by the company, before the drug won approval."[19]
On April 15, 2015 in Cambridge, MA, Joan Finnegan Brooks of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, spoke about the role of Vertex and venture philanthropy to a panel of biotech leaders hosted by Life Sciences Foundation on the topic of patient advocacy in the biotech industry.[21] While Brooks, who has Cystic Fibrosis, expressed gratitude for Vertex' development of Kalydeco, she observed that 25% of Cystic Fibrosis patients are not getting the medical care they need because of the prohibitive cost of the drug.[21]

Telaprevir[edit]
In May 2011, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the drug telaprevir (Incivek), an oral treatment for hepatitis C marketed by Vertex. Development and commercialization of telaprevir is shared with Johnson & Johnson for European distribution and Mitsubishi for Asia. Telaprevir is a protease inhibitor.[6]
Cystic fibrosis[edit]
Ivacaftor[edit]
In 2012 ivacaftor, was designated as an orphan drug, identifying cystic fibrosis as affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. On January 31, 2012, Vertex gained FDA approval [7] of the first drug, Kalydeco,[8] to treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis rather than the symptoms, in patients 6 years or older who have the G551D gene mutation. In the US, 30,000 people have cystic fibrosis. About 4% of those, or 1,200, have the G551D gene mutation. Vertex is marketing the drug at $307,000 a year per patient.[9] Vertex also is studying ivacaftor in combination with another drug (lumacaftor[10]) for the most common mutation in CF, known as F508del, and expects the first set of results in 2012. Vertex worked for 13 years with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation to develop the drug.[11]
In the UK, the company provided the drug free for a limited time for certain patients, then left the hospitals to decide whether to continue to pay for it for those patients. UK agencies estimated the cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) at between £335,000 and £1,274,000—far above the NICE thresholds[12] of £20,000-£30,000.

mRNA therapeutics[edit]
In 2016, the company entered into a collaboration with Moderna, in fact taking an ownership stake in the company, to develop new mRNA-based therapeutics to treat CF.[15]
Venture philanthropy[edit]
In the late 1990s the Bethesda-based Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, encouraged by then-President Robert Beall, began investing in Vertex— when it was a small start-up biotechnology company— to help fund the development of Kalydeco in the form of venture philanthropy. The total investment amounted to $150 million.[16] In 2014, the CF Foundation sold the rights to the royalties of the drugs for $3.3 billion, twenty times the Foundation’s 2013 budget.[16][17]
By 2015 the annual cost of Kalydeco had risen to more than $300,000 per patient.[18]

Vertex Pharmaceuticals is an American Pharmaceutical company based in Boston, Massachusetts.
Vertex was founded in 1989 by Joshua Boger[2] and Kevin J. Kinsella.[3] Vertex was one of the first biotech firms to use an explicit strategy of rational drug design rather than combinatorial chemistry.
By 2004, its product pipeline focused on viral infections, inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, and cancer. It maintains headquarters in South Boston, Massachusetts, and two research facilities, in San Diego, California, and Oxford, England. The company's beginnings were profiled by Barry Werth in the 1994 book The Billion-Dollar Molecule[3] and its further development in his 2014 book, The Antidote: Inside the World of New Pharma.[4] In 2009, the company had about 1,800 employees, including 1,200 in the Boston area.[2]
In January 2014, Vertex completed its move from Cambridge, Massachusetts to Boston, Massachusetts, and took residence in a new, $800 million complex. Located on the South Boston waterfront, it will mark the first time in the company's history that all of the roughly 1,200 Vertex employees in the Greater Boston area will be working together.
Since late 2011, when Jeffrey M. Leiden joined Vertex as CEO, Vertex has ranked among the top 15 best performing companies on the Standard & Poor’s 500. Vertex shares increased 250 percent in the same period.[5] Vertex posted only one annual profit since it was founded in 1989.[5]

Telaprevir[edit]
In May 2011, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the drug telaprevir (Incivek), an oral treatment for hepatitis C marketed by Vertex. Development and commercialization of telaprevir is shared with Johnson & Johnson for European distribution and Mitsubishi for Asia. Telaprevir is a protease inhibitor.[6]
Cystic fibrosis[edit]
Ivacaftor[edit]
In 2012 ivacaftor, was designated as an orphan drug, identifying cystic fibrosis as affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. On January 31, 2012, Vertex gained FDA approval [7] of the first drug, Kalydeco,[8] to treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis rather than the symptoms, in patients 6 years or older who have the G551D gene mutation. In the US, 30,000 people have cystic fibrosis. About 4% of those, or 1,200, have the G551D gene mutation. Vertex is marketing the drug at $307,000 a year per patient.[9] Vertex also is studying ivacaftor in combination with another drug (lumacaftor[10]) for the most common mutation in CF, known as F508del, and expects the first set of results in 2012. Vertex worked for 13 years with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation to develop the drug.[11]
In the UK, the company provided the drug free for a limited time for certain patients, then left the hospitals to decide whether to continue to pay for it for those patients. UK agencies estimated the cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) at between £335,000 and £1,274,000—far above the NICE thresholds[12] of £20,000-£30,000.
On November 5, 2014 Vertex announced the submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA for a fully co-formulated combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor for people with cystic fibrosis ages 12 and older who have two copies of the F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene.[13] In 2015, FDA approved Orkambi lumacaftor/ivacaftor to treat cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients 12 years and older, who have the F508del mutation.[14]
mRNA therapeutics[edit]
In 2016, the company entered into a collaboration with Moderna, in fact taking an ownership stake in the company, to develop new mRNA-based therapeutics to treat CF.[15]
Venture philanthropy[edit]
In the late 1990s the Bethesda-based Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, encouraged by then-President Robert Beall, began investing in Vertex— when it was a small start-up biotechnology company— to help fund the development of Kalydeco in the form of venture philanthropy. The total investment amounted to $150 million.[16] In 2014, the CF Foundation sold the rights to the royalties of the drugs for $3.3 billion, twenty times the Foundation’s 2013 budget.[16][17]
By 2015 the annual cost of Kalydeco had risen to more than $300,000 per patient.[18]
According to an article published in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Vertex executives "grossed more than $100 million by cashing in stocks and stock options" and at "one point, the value of company's stock increased more $6 billion in a single day."[19]
Twenty-nine physicians and scientists working with people with cystic fibrosis (CF) wrote to Jeff Leiden, CEO of Vertex Pharmaceuticals to plead for lower prices.[20]

"We are aware of the financial complexities of the huge expenses for R & D with respect to the small number of patients or the market system that enables these advances to become reality. Yet -- notwithstanding all your patient support programs -- it is at best unseemly for Vertex to charge our patients’ insurance plans (including strapped state medical assistance plans), $294,000 annually for two pills a day (a 10-fold increase in a typical patient's total drug costs). This action could appear to be leveraging pain and suffering into huge financial gain for speculators, some of whom were your top executives who reportedly made millions of dollars in a single day (Boston Globe, May 29)."

The company responded in an email that "while publicly funded academic research provided important early understanding of the cause of cystic fibrosis, it took Vertex scientists 14 years of their own research, funded mostly by the company, before the drug won approval."[19]
On April 15, 2015 in Cambridge, MA, Joan Finnegan Brooks of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, spoke about the role of Vertex and venture philanthropy to a panel of biotech leaders hosted by Life Sciences Foundation on the topic of patient advocacy in the biotech industry.[21] While Brooks, who has Cystic Fibrosis, expressed gratitude for Vertex' development of Kalydeco, she observed that 25% of Cystic Fibrosis patients are not getting the medical care they need because of the prohibitive cost of the drug.[21]

Vertex Pharmaceuticals is an American Pharmaceutical company based in Boston, Massachusetts.
Vertex was founded in 1989 by Joshua Boger[2] and Kevin J. Kinsella.[3] Vertex was one of the first biotech firms to use an explicit strategy of rational drug design rather than combinatorial chemistry.
By 2004, its product pipeline focused on viral infections, inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, and cancer. It maintains headquarters in South Boston, Massachusetts, and two research facilities, in San Diego, California, and Oxford, England. The company's beginnings were profiled by Barry Werth in the 1994 book The Billion-Dollar Molecule[3] and its further development in his 2014 book, The Antidote: Inside the World of New Pharma.[4] In 2009, the company had about 1,800 employees, including 1,200 in the Boston area.[2]
In January 2014, Vertex completed its move from Cambridge, Massachusetts to Boston, Massachusetts, and took residence in a new, $800 million complex. Located on the South Boston waterfront, it will mark the first time in the company's history that all of the roughly 1,200 Vertex employees in the Greater Boston area will be working together.
Since late 2011, when Jeffrey M. Leiden joined Vertex as CEO, Vertex has ranked among the top 15 best performing companies on the Standard & Poor’s 500. Vertex shares increased 250 percent in the same period.[5] Vertex posted only one annual profit since it was founded in 1989.[5]

Telaprevir[edit]
In May 2011, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the drug telaprevir (Incivek), an oral treatment for hepatitis C marketed by Vertex. Development and commercialization of telaprevir is shared with Johnson & Johnson for European distribution and Mitsubishi for Asia. Telaprevir is a protease inhibitor.[6]
Cystic fibrosis[edit]
Ivacaftor[edit]
In 2012 ivacaftor, was designated as an orphan drug, identifying cystic fibrosis as affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. On January 31, 2012, Vertex gained FDA approval [7] of the first drug, Kalydeco,[8] to treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis rather than the symptoms, in patients 6 years or older who have the G551D gene mutation. In the US, 30,000 people have cystic fibrosis. About 4% of those, or 1,200, have the G551D gene mutation. Vertex is marketing the drug at $307,000 a year per patient.[9] Vertex also is studying ivacaftor in combination with another drug (lumacaftor[10]) for the most common mutation in CF, known as F508del, and expects the first set of results in 2012. Vertex worked for 13 years with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation to develop the drug.[11]
In the UK, the company provided the drug free for a limited time for certain patients, then left the hospitals to decide whether to continue to pay for it for those patients. UK agencies estimated the cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) at between £335,000 and £1,274,000—far above the NICE thresholds[12] of £20,000-£30,000.
On November 5, 2014 Vertex announced the submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA for a fully co-formulated combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor for people with cystic fibrosis ages 12 and older who have two copies of the F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene.[13] In 2015, FDA approved Orkambi lumacaftor/ivacaftor to treat cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients 12 years and older, who have the F508del mutation.[14]
mRNA therapeutics[edit]
In 2016, the company entered into a collaboration with Moderna, in fact taking an ownership stake in the company, to develop new mRNA-based therapeutics to treat CF.[15]
Venture philanthropy[edit]
In the late 1990s the Bethesda-based Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, encouraged by then-President Robert Beall, began investing in Vertex— when it was a small start-up biotechnology company— to help fund the development of Kalydeco in the form of venture philanthropy. The total investment amounted to $150 million.[16] In 2014, the CF Foundation sold the rights to the royalties of the drugs for $3.3 billion, twenty times the Foundation’s 2013 budget.[16][17]
By 2015 the annual cost of Kalydeco had risen to more than $300,000 per patient.[18]
According to an article published in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Vertex executives "grossed more than $100 million by cashing in stocks and stock options" and at "one point, the value of company's stock increased more $6 billion in a single day."[19]
Twenty-nine physicians and scientists working with people with cystic fibrosis (CF) wrote to Jeff Leiden, CEO of Vertex Pharmaceuticals to plead for lower prices.[20]

"We are aware of the financial complexities of the huge expenses for R & D with respect to the small number of patients or the market system that enables these advances to become reality. Yet -- notwithstanding all your patient support programs -- it is at best unseemly for Vertex to charge our patients’ insurance plans (including strapped state medical assistance plans), $294,000 annually for two pills a day (a 10-fold increase in a typical patient's total drug costs). This action could appear to be leveraging pain and suffering into huge financial gain for speculators, some of whom were your top executives who reportedly made millions of dollars in a single day (Boston Globe, May 29)."
— David M. Orenstein, MD et al.

The company responded in an email that "while publicly funded academic research provided important early understanding of the cause of cystic fibrosis, it took Vertex scientists 14 years of their own research, funded mostly by the company, before the drug won approval."[19]
On April 15, 2015 in Cambridge, MA, Joan Finnegan Brooks of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, spoke about the role of Vertex and venture philanthropy to a panel of biotech leaders hosted by Life Sciences Foundation on the topic of patient advocacy in the biotech industry.[21] While Brooks, who has Cystic Fibrosis, expressed gratitude for Vertex' development of Kalydeco, she observed that 25% of Cystic Fibrosis patients are not getting the medical care they need because of the prohibitive cost of the drug.[21]

Vertex Pharmaceuticals is an American Pharmaceutical company based in Boston, Massachusetts.
Vertex was founded in 1989 by Joshua Boger[2] and Kevin J. Kinsella.[3] Vertex was one of the first biotech firms to use an explicit strategy of rational drug design rather than combinatorial chemistry.
By 2004, its product pipeline focused on viral infections, inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, and cancer. It maintains headquarters in South Boston, Massachusetts, and two research facilities, in San Diego, California, and Oxford, England. The company's beginnings were profiled by Barry Werth in the 1994 book The Billion-Dollar Molecule[3] and its further development in his 2014 book, The Antidote: Inside the World of New Pharma.[4] In 2009, the company had about 1,800 employees, including 1,200 in the Boston area.[2]
In January 2014, Vertex completed its move from Cambridge, Massachusetts to Boston, Massachusetts, and took residence in a new, $800 million complex. Located on the South Boston waterfront, it will mark the first time in the company's history that all of the roughly 1,200 Vertex employees in the Greater Boston area will be working together.
Since late 2011, when Jeffrey M. Leiden joined Vertex as CEO, Vertex has ranked among the top 15 best performing companies on the Standard & Poor’s 500. Vertex shares increased 250 percent in the same period.[5] Vertex posted only one annual profit since it was founded in 1989.[5]

Telaprevir[edit]
In May 2011, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the drug telaprevir (Incivek), an oral treatment for hepatitis C marketed by Vertex. Development and commercialization of telaprevir is shared with Johnson & Johnson for European distribution and Mitsubishi for Asia. Telaprevir is a protease inhibitor.[6]
Cystic fibrosis[edit]
Ivacaftor[edit]
In 2012 ivacaftor, was designated as an orphan drug, identifying cystic fibrosis as affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. On January 31, 2012, Vertex gained FDA approval [7] of the first drug, Kalydeco,[8] to treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis rather than the symptoms, in patients 6 years or older who have the G551D gene mutation. In the US, 30,000 people have cystic fibrosis. About 4% of those, or 1,200, have the G551D gene mutation. Vertex is marketing the drug at $307,000 a year per patient.[9] Vertex also is studying ivacaftor in combination with another drug (lumacaftor[10]) for the most common mutation in CF, known as F508del, and expects the first set of results in 2012. Vertex worked for 13 years with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation to develop the drug.[11]
In the UK, the company provided the drug free for a limited time for certain patients, then left the hospitals to decide whether to continue to pay for it for those patients. UK agencies estimated the cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) at between £335,000 and £1,274,000—far above the NICE thresholds[12] of £20,000-£30,000.
On November 5, 2014 Vertex announced the submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA for a fully co-formulated combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor for people with cystic fibrosis ages 12 and older who have two copies of the F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene.[13] In 2015, FDA approved Orkambi lumacaftor/ivacaftor to treat cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients 12 years and older, who have the F508del mutation.[14]
mRNA therapeutics[edit]
In 2016, the company entered into a collaboration with Moderna, in fact taking an ownership stake in the company, to develop new mRNA-based therapeutics to treat CF.[15]
Venture philanthropy[edit]
In the late 1990s the Bethesda-based Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, encouraged by then-President Robert Beall, began investing in Vertex— when it was a small start-up biotechnology company— to help fund the development of Kalydeco in the form of venture philanthropy. The total investment amounted to $150 million.[16] In 2014, the CF Foundation sold the rights to the royalties of the drugs for $3.3 billion, twenty times the Foundation’s 2013 budget.[16][17]
By 2015 the annual cost of Kalydeco had risen to more than $300,000 per patient.[18]
According to an article published in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Vertex executives "grossed more than $100 million by cashing in stocks and stock options" and at "one point, the value of company's stock increased more $6 billion in a single day."[19]
Twenty-nine physicians and scientists working with people with cystic fibrosis (CF) wrote to Jeff Leiden, CEO of Vertex Pharmaceuticals to plead for lower prices.[20]

"We are aware of the financial complexities of the huge expenses for R & D with respect to the small number of patients or the market system that enables these advances to become reality. Yet -- notwithstanding all your patient support programs -- it is at best unseemly for Vertex to charge our patients’ insurance plans (including strapped state medical assistance plans), $294,000 annually for two pills a day (a 10-fold increase in a typical patient's total drug costs). This action could appear to be leveraging pain and suffering into huge financial gain for speculators, some of whom were your top executives who reportedly made millions of dollars in a single day (Boston Globe, May 29)."
— David M. Orenstein, MD et al.

The company responded in an email that "while publicly funded academic research provided important early understanding of the cause of cystic fibrosis, it took Vertex scientists 14 years of their own research, funded mostly by the company, before the drug won approval."[19]
On April 15, 2015 in Cambridge, MA, Joan Finnegan Brooks of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, spoke about the role of Vertex and venture philanthropy to a panel of biotech leaders hosted by Life Sciences Foundation on the topic of patient advocacy in the biotech industry.[21] While Brooks, who has Cystic Fibrosis, expressed gratitude for Vertex' development of Kalydeco, she observed that 25% of Cystic Fibrosis patients are not getting the medical care they need because of the prohibitive cost of the drug.[21]

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW We are in the business of discovering, developing, manufacturing and commercializing medicines for serious diseases. We use precision medicine approaches with the goal of creating transformative medicines for patients in specialty markets. Our business is focused on developing and commercializing therapies for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, or CF, and advancing our research and development programs in other indications. Our two marketed products are ORKAMBI (lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor) and KALYDECO (ivacaftor) and we are currently seeking approval for tezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor, which is a two-drug combination regimen for patients with CF. In addition, we are evaluating multiple triple combination regimens in patients with CF that include one or more next-generation CFTR corrector compounds in Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials. Cystic Fibrosis ORKAMBI and KALYDECO are approved to treat approximately 40% of the 75,000 CF patients in North America, Europe and Australia. ORKAMBI is approved as a treatment for approximately 25,000 patients who have two copies of the F508del mutation, or F508del homozygous, in their cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, or CFTR, gene. KALYDECO is approved for the treatment of approximately 5,000 CF patients who have the G551D mutation or other specified mutations in their CFTR gene. Our goal is to develop treatment regimens that will provide benefits to as many patients with CF as possible and will enhance the benefits that currently are being provided to patients taking our medicines. If tezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor is approved, we expect that it would provide an additional treatment option primarily to CF patients who are currently eligible for either ORKAMBI or KALYDECO. If we are able to successfully develop a triple combination regimen that includes a next-generation CFTR corrector compound, including VX-440, VX-152, VX-659 or VX-445, we believe such regimen could potentially provide benefit to all CF patients who have at least one F508del mutation in their CFTR gene (approximately 90% of all CF patients). This would include (i) the first treatment option that treats the underlying cause of CF for patients who have one copy of the F508del mutation in their CFTR gene and a second mutation in their CFTR gene that results in minimal CFTR function, or F508del/Min patients, and (ii) an additional treatment option to CF patients who are eligible for either ORKAMBI, KALYDECO or, if approved, tezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor. Tezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor In the first quarter of 2017, we obtained positive results from two Phase 3 clinical trials of tezacaftor, a corrector compound, in combination with ivacaftor. The clinical trials demonstrated that the tezacaftor/ivacaftor combination provided statistically significant improvements in lung function (percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second, or ppFEV1) in patients with CF 12 years of age and older who have certain mutations in their CFTR gene. The 24-week EVOLVE clinical trial evaluated tezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in F508del homozygous patients with CF. This clinical trial met its primary endpoint with a mean absolute improvement in ppFEV1 through 24 weeks of 4.0 percentage points from baseline compared to placebo (p < 0.0001). The second clinical trial, EXPAND, was an 8-week crossover clinical trial that evaluated the combination treatment in patients with CF who have one mutation that results in residual CFTR function and one F508del mutation. This clinical trial met the primary endpoints of absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline to the average of the Week 4 and Week 8 measurements, with the tezacaftor/ivacaftor combination treatment demonstrating a mean absolute improvement of 6.8 percentage points compared to placebo (p < 0.0001) and the ivacaftor monotherapy group demonstrating a mean absolute improvement of 4.7 percentage points compared to placebo (p < 0.0001). Across both clinical trials, the tezacaftor/ivacaftor combination treatment was generally well tolerated. Based on these results, we submitted a New Drug Application, or NDA, to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, for tezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in patients with CF 12 years of age and older who are F508del homozygous or who have one copy of the F508del mutation in their CFTR gene and a second mutation in their CFTR gene that results in residual CFTR function. In addition, we have completed enrollment in a Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating tezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in patients 12 years of age or older who have one copy of the F508del mutation in their CFTR gene and a second mutation that results in a gating mutation in the CFTR gene that has been shown to be responsive to ivacaftor alone. We expect to receive data from this clinical trial in the second half of 2017. We also are conducting a Phase 3 clinical trial of the tezacaftor/ivacaftor combination in patients with CF six to eleven years of age in the U.S. The clinical trial is evaluating the safety and tolerability of the tezacaftor/ivacaftor combination in children who are homozygous for the F508del mutation and in children who have one copy of the F508del mutation and a gating or residual function mutation.  Table of Contents  Next-generation CFTR corrector compounds In July 2017, we obtained positive results from Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials of three different triple combination regimens in patients with CF who have one copy of the F508del mutation in their CFTR gene and a second mutation that results in minimal CFTR function. Initial data from the Phase 2 clinical trials showed mean absolute improvements in ppFEV1 of 9.7 and 12.0 percentage points for VX-152 (200mg q12h) and VX-440 (600mg q12h), respectively, in triple combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor. Initial data from the Phase 1 clinical trial showed mean absolute improvement in ppFEV1 of 9.6 percentage points for VX-659 in triple combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor. Additional data on VX-152 and VX-440, as well as data from ongoing or planned Phase 2 clinical trials of VX-445 and VX-659 are expected in late 2017 or early 2018. Pending additional data from these ongoing and planned clinical trials and discussions with regulatory agencies and a steering committee of global CF experts, we plan to initiate pivotal development of one or more triple combination regimens in the first half of 2018.  Table of Contents   CRISPR Therapeutics AG, or CRISPR, pursuant to which we are collaborating on the discovery and development of potential new treatments aimed at the underlying genetic causes of human diseases using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology; Parion, pursuant to which we are developing ENaC inhibitors for the treatment of pulmonary diseases; Moderna Therapeutics, Inc., or Moderna, pursuant to which we are   BioAxone Biosciences, Inc., or BioAxone, pursuant to which we are evaluating VX-210 as a potential treatment for patients who have spinal cord injuries.  Generally, when we in-license a technology or drug candidate, we make upfront payments to the collaborator, assume the costs of the program and agree to make contingent payments, which could consist of milestone, royalty and option payments. Depending on many factors, including the structure of the collaboration, the significance of the drug candidate that we license to the collaborator's operations and the other activities in which our collaborators are engaged, the accounting for these transactions can vary significantly. For example, the upfront payments and expenses incurred in connection with our CRISPR and Moderna collaborations are being expensed as research expenses because the collaboration represents a small portion of these collaborators overall business. CRISPR's and Moderna's activities unrelated to our collaborations have no effect on our consolidated financial statements. Parion and BioAxone are being accounted for as variable interest entities, or VIEs, and are included in our consolidated financial statements due to (i) the significance of the respective licensed programs to Parion and BioAxone as a whole, (ii) our power to control the significant activities under each collaboration and (iii) our obligation to absorb losses and right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant. Each of our consolidated VIEs is engaging in activities unrelated to our collaboration, including in the case of Parion, seeking to develop novel treatments for pulmonary and ocular diseases. The revenues and expenses unrelated to the programs we in-license from our VIEs are immaterial to our consolidated financial statements. In each case, the activities unrelated to our collaboration represent approximately 1% of our total revenues and total expenses on an annual basis. Because we consolidate our VIEs, we evaluate the fair value of the contingent payments payable by us on a quarterly basis. Changes in the fair value of these contingent future payments affect net income attributable to Vertex on a dollar-for-dollar basis, with increases in the fair value of contingent payments payable by us to a VIE resulting in a decrease in net income attributable to Vertex (or an increase in net loss attributable to Vertex) and decreases in the fair value of contingent payments payable by us to a VIE resulting in an increase in net income attributable to Vertex (or decrease in net loss attributable to Vertex). We have also out-licensed internally developed programs to collaborators who are leading the development of these programs. These outlicense arrangements include our collaboration agreements with:   Merck KGaA, which is advancing four oncology research and development programs; and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which is developing JNJ-3872 (formerly VX-787) for the treatment of influenza.  Pursuant to these out-licensing arrangements, our collaborators are responsible for the research, development and commercialization costs associated with these programs and we are entitled to receive contingent milestone and/or royalty payments. As a result, we do not expect to incur significant expenses in connection with these programs and have the potential for future collaborative and/or royalty revenues resulting from these programs.  Regulatory Compliance  Table of Contents  management and other resources in order to obtain and maintain appropriate levels of reimbursement for our products from third-party payors, including governmental organizations in the United States and ex-U.S. markets. In the United States, we continue to engage in discussions with numerous commercial insurers and managed health care organizations, along with government health programs that are typically managed by authorities in the individual states. In Europe and other ex-U.S. markets, we are working to obtain government reimbursement for ORKAMBI on a country-by-country basis, because in many foreign countries patients are unable to access prescription pharmaceutical products that are not reimbursed by their governments. To date, we have reached a pricing and reimbursement agreement for ORKAMBI with several European countries, including Germany, Ireland and Italy, and remain in negotiations with several others. Consistent with our experience with KALYDECO when it was first approved, we expect reimbursement discussions in ex-U.S. markets may take a significant period of time.  Table of Contents  4-Week Efficacy Data in F508del/Min Patients: The first part of the clinical trial evaluated the triple combination for four weeks in 47 F508del/Min patients (11 in placebo, 18 in VX-440 200mg and 18 in VX-440 600mg). A summary of the within-group lung function and sweat chloride data is provided below:  A secondary endpoint in the clinical trial measured mean absolute change in the Respiratory Domain of CFQ-R, a validated patient-reported outcome tool at Day   Mean Absolute Mean Absolute Mean Absolute Within-Group Within-Group Change in Within-Group Change in Change From Baseline Through Day ppFEV1 (percentage Sweat Chloride 29* points) (mmol/L) Placebo + tezacaftor (100mg QD) -2.5 +2.1 + ivacaftor (150mg q12h) (p=0.2755) (p=0.7385) VX-440 (600mg q12h) + tezacaftor +9.5 -31.3 (50mg q12h) + ivacaftor (300mg (p<0.0001) (p<0.0001) q12h)  The safety follow-up portion of the clinical trial in F508del homozygous patients is ongoing.  Table of Contents  2-Week Initial Efficacy Data in F508del/Min Patients: In the first part of the clinical trial, the triple combination was evaluated for two weeks in 21 F508del/Min patients 18 years of age and older (5 in combined placebo, 6 in VX-152 100mg and 10 in VX-152 200mg). A summary of the initial within-group lung function and sweat chloride data (secondary endpoints) from the VX-152 100mg and 200mg dose groups is provided below.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals is an American Pharmaceutical company based in Boston, Massachusetts.
Vertex was founded in 1989 by Joshua Boger[2] and Kevin J. Kinsella.[3] Vertex was one of the first biotech firms to use an explicit strategy of rational drug design rather than combinatorial chemistry.
By 2004, its product pipeline focused on viral infections, inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, and cancer. It maintains headquarters in South Boston, Massachusetts, and two research facilities, in San Diego, California, and Oxford, England. The company's beginnings were profiled by Barry Werth in the 1994 book The Billion-Dollar Molecule[3] and its further development in his 2014 book, The Antidote: Inside the World of New Pharma.[4] In 2009, the company had about 1,800 employees, including 1,200 in the Boston area.[2]
In January 2014, Vertex completed its move from Cambridge, Massachusetts to Boston, Massachusetts, and took residence in a new, $800 million complex. Located on the South Boston waterfront, it will mark the first time in the company's history that all of the roughly 1,200 Vertex employees in the Greater Boston area will be working together.
Since late 2011, when Jeffrey M. Leiden joined Vertex as CEO, Vertex has ranked among the top 15 best performing companies on the Standard & Poor’s 500. Vertex shares increased 250 percent in the same period.[5] Vertex posted only one annual profit since it was founded in 1989.[5]

Telaprevir[edit]
In May 2011, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the drug telaprevir (Incivek), an oral treatment for hepatitis C marketed by Vertex. Development and commercialization of telaprevir is shared with Johnson & Johnson for European distribution and Mitsubishi for Asia. Telaprevir is a protease inhibitor.[6]
Cystic fibrosis[edit]
Ivacaftor[edit]
In 2012 ivacaftor, was designated as an orphan drug, identifying cystic fibrosis as affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. On January 31, 2012, Vertex gained FDA approval [7] of the first drug, Kalydeco,[8] to treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis rather than the symptoms, in patients 6 years or older who have the G551D gene mutation. In the US, 30,000 people have cystic fibrosis. About 4% of those, or 1,200, have the G551D gene mutation. Vertex is marketing the drug at $307,000 a year per patient.[9] Vertex also is studying ivacaftor in combination with another drug (lumacaftor[10]) for the most common mutation in CF, known as F508del, and expects the first set of results in 2012. Vertex worked for 13 years with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation to develop the drug.[11]
In the UK, the company provided the drug free for a limited time for certain patients, then left the hospitals to decide whether to continue to pay for it for those patients. UK agencies estimated the cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) at between £335,000 and £1,274,000—far above the NICE thresholds[12] of £20,000-£30,000.
On November 5, 2014 Vertex announced the submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA for a fully co-formulated combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor for people with cystic fibrosis ages 12 and older who have two copies of the F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene.[13] In 2015, FDA approved Orkambi lumacaftor/ivacaftor to treat cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients 12 years and older, who have the F508del mutation.[14]
mRNA therapeutics[edit]
In 2016, the company entered into a collaboration with Moderna, in fact taking an ownership stake in the company, to develop new mRNA-based therapeutics to treat CF.[15]
Venture philanthropy[edit]
In the late 1990s the Bethesda-based Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, encouraged by then-President Robert Beall, began investing in Vertex— when it was a small start-up biotechnology company— to help fund the development of Kalydeco in the form of venture philanthropy. The total investment amounted to $150 million.[16] In 2014, the CF Foundation sold the rights to the royalties of the drugs for $3.3 billion, twenty times the Foundation’s 2013 budget.[16][17]
By 2015 the annual cost of Kalydeco had risen to more than $300,000 per patient.[18]
According to an article published in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Vertex executives "grossed more than $100 million by cashing in stocks and stock options" and at "one point, the value of company's stock increased more $6 billion in a single day."[19]
Twenty-nine physicians and scientists working with people with cystic fibrosis (CF) wrote to Jeff Leiden, CEO of Vertex Pharmaceuticals to plead for lower prices.[20]

"We are aware of the financial complexities of the huge expenses for R & D with respect to the small number of patients or the market system that enables these advances to become reality. Yet -- notwithstanding all your patient support programs -- it is at best unseemly for Vertex to charge our patients’ insurance plans (including strapped state medical assistance plans), $294,000 annually for two pills a day (a 10-fold increase in a typical patient's total drug costs). This action could appear to be leveraging pain and suffering into huge financial gain for speculators, some of whom were your top executives who reportedly made millions of dollars in a single day (Boston Globe, May 29)."
— David M. Orenstein, MD et al.

The company responded in an email that "while publicly funded academic research provided important early understanding of the cause of cystic fibrosis, it took Vertex scientists 14 years of their own research, funded mostly by the company, before the drug won approval."[19]
On April 15, 2015 in Cambridge, MA, Joan Finnegan Brooks of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, spoke about the role of Vertex and venture philanthropy to a panel of biotech leaders hosted by Life Sciences Foundation on the topic of patient advocacy in the biotech industry.[21] While Brooks, who has Cystic Fibrosis, expressed gratitude for Vertex' development of Kalydeco, she observed that 25% of Cystic Fibrosis patients are not getting the medical care they need because of the prohibitive cost of the drug.[21]

Good evening. This is Michael Partridge, Vice President of Investor Relations for Vertex. Welcome to our Second Quarter 2017 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will open the lines for questions. This call is recorded and a replay will be available later on our website.
Dr. Jeff Leiden, Chairman and CEO, and Ian Smith, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, will provide prepared remarks this evening. Stuart Arbuckle, Chief Commercial Officer, will join us for Q&A.
We will make forward-looking statements on this conference call. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in detail in today's press release, our 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These statements, including those regarding the ongoing development and commercialization of KALYDECO and ORKAMBI, Vertex's other cystic fibrosis programs and Vertex's future financial performance, are based on management's current assumptions. Actual outcomes and events could differ materially.
Information regarding our use of GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is available in the financial results press release. I would also refer you to slide 3 of tonight's webcast.
I will now turn the call over to Dr. Jeff Leiden.
Jeffrey M. Leiden, M.D., Ph.D. - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Thanks, Michael. Good evening (01:26). 2017 is an important year for Vertex and we've made significant progress towards achieving our long-term vision of treating all people with CF. As we enter this year, we were focused on continuing to increase the number of people eligible for and being treated with our approved medicines, as well as generating important data from multiple combination medicines across our CF pipeline. Let me briefly review our recent progress in meeting these objectives.
First, the FDA recently approved KALYDECO for more than 900 people with CF, ages 2 and older who have 1 of 23 residual function mutations. And we continue to work closely with the FDA to obtain approval for more than 600 additional people who have other residual function mutations responsive to KALYDECO. KALYDECO continues to be a transformative medicine and has now labeled to treat approximately 5,000 people with CF globally. Tonight, we are reiterating our KALYDECO revenue guidance.
Second, we've now reached reimbursement agreements in Ireland and Italy for ORKAMBI in people ages 12 and older with two copies of the F508del mutation. We continue to discuss reimbursement with other countries, including France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom and remain committed to expanding the eligibility for and access to ORKAMBI globally. Tonight, we also reiterated our guidance for ORKAMBI.
Third, based on the positive Phase 3 data we announced earlier this year, we recently submitted an NDA to the FDA and an MAA to the European Medicines Agency for the tezacaftor/ivacaftor combination in people with CF ages 12 and older. We anticipate acceptance of the NDA and the MAA later this year.

Fourth, we recently shared positive Phase 1 and Phase 2 results from three of our triple combination regimens in people with CF who have at least one F508del mutation. These results included the first data to demonstrate the potential to treat the underlying cause of CF and had many patients who have a severe and difficult to treat type of this disease. We also demonstrated that the addition of a next-generation corrector to tezacaftor and ivacaftor significantly increases FEV1 and F508del homozygous patients.
Throughout the rest of this year, we will be evaluating additional data from these and other studies and I look forward to updating you on our plans for pivotal development of our triple combination regimens that may have the potential to treat up to 90% of CF patients. We expect to begin pivotal development in the first half of 2018 for one or two of our four next-generation correctors.
And lastly, earlier this week we added CTP-656 to our pipeline of CF medicines through completing our asset purchase agreement with Concert Pharmaceuticals. CTP-656 has the potential to be used as part of future once-daily combination regimens that treat the underlying cause of CF and we are already working to integrate the potentiator into one of our triple combination regimens.
Based on our significant progress this year, we are well-positioned to achieve our longstanding goal to create medicines that fundamentally alter the progression of CF for all patients, and in doing so, meet our financial goal of delivering sustainable long-term revenue and earnings growth for Vertex.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ian to discuss our financials.
Ian F. Smith - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Thanks, Jeff, and good evening to everyone. Tonight, I will discuss the key aspects of our second quarter 2017 financials and I will also review our 2017 full-year financial guidance, revenues first. Total CF product revenues of $514 million in the second quarter of 2017 represent a 21% increase compared to the $426 million we recorded in the second quarter of 2016 and a $33 million increase compared to the $481 million we recorded in the first quarter of 2017. We continue to see revenue growth as we treat more patients with our approved medicines.
For ORKAMBI, we reported second quarter 2017 product revenues of approximately $324 million, an increase of $29 million compared to the first quarter of 2017. This increase was driven by continued uptake of the medicine globally as well as the timing of both patients and pharmacy orders of approximately $10 million in advance of the 4th of July holiday. These shipments will likely impact revenues in the third quarter of 2017.
Second quarter KALYDECO sales were $190 million compared to $186 million for the first quarter of 2017. We estimate there was approximately $5 million of inventory stocking at quarter end in advance of July 4 holiday.
Our second quarter 2017 non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses were $333 million, compared to $306 million in the second quarter of 2016 and compared to $313 million in the first quarter of 2017. These increases are primarily due to the continued acceleration and broad advancement of our CF medicines in development, and in particular, our portfolio of triple combination regimens.
This revenue expense profile resulted in a non-GAAP net profit for the second quarter of 2017 of $99 million or $0.39 per diluted share, compared to non-GAAP net profit of $58 million or $0.24 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2016, and compared to a $101 million or $0.41 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2017. The significant growth year-over-year in net profit was largely driven by the strong growth in the total CF product revenues.
During the second quarter of 2017, the company generated significant cash flow and ended the quarter with approximately $1.67 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.

Now, turning to our full-year financial guidance. We continue to expect total CF product revenues of $1.84 billion to $2.07 billion in 2017. For ORKAMBI, we continue to expect $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion in net product revenues. Our actual revenues will be determined by the continued uptake of ORKAMBI in the markets where it's reimbursed, as well as the completion of additional reimbursement agreements throughout Europe. If we are successful in gaining reimbursements in France by the end of 2017, it would be a large contributor to our revenue growth. There continues to be uncertainty after the timing on when these discussions will be completed.
As to KALYDECO, we continue to expect $740 million to $770 million in net product revenues, which includes the recent approval in patients with residual function mutations. We continue to have productive discussions with the FDA to obtain approval for more than 600 people who have other residual function mutations responsive to KALYDECO.
Now, to operating expenses. We have made significant investments and generated compelling data across our CF pipeline this year, and we now expect combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses of $1.33 billion to $1.36 billion for 2017. This updated guidance reflects the progression of our CF portfolio, including the acceleration of Phase 2 studies for VX-659 and VX-445. Preparation for pivotal studies for our portfolio of triple combination regimens and investment to develop CTP-656 as part of future triple combination regimens.
With our continued revenue growth, the management of our operating expenses, we are well on track to deliver a financial profile that includes high operating margins and sustainable earnings growth.
With that, I will open up the line to questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
And our first question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks very much for taking the question. I guess I'd just like to ask about the progression of pricing and reimbursement in Europe. You've obviously made some progress with some countries and yet, some of the large ones, including France, seem to be taking longer. Can you just talk about to the extent you are willing – what items are still needing to be discussed and I guess what we should think about in terms of that and broadly, I guess the nature of the question here is, you've obviously got ORKAMBI now but there's visibility towards tez/iva and then triple combos, and does that influence any of the conversation and perhaps, take longer to complete? Thanks.
Stuart A. Arbuckle - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Great. Thanks, Matt. It's Stu here. I'll try and address your question. It's got a number of different elements to it. As you said, we have made good progress in the first half of this year reaching pricing and reimbursement agreements in Germany, Ireland, Italy, Austria, Luxemburg and Denmark. And as you said, we're in active negotiations with other countries, including France, the UK and the Netherlands. And where we are in those discussions, I'll refer you back to the comments we've made previously, these discussions tend to have three phases. There's a clinical benefit assessment, the pharmacoeconomic assessment, and then, you're into the pricing discussions, and we're through those first two. There's really no debate in those markets in Europe about the clinical benefits of ORKAMBI. We're really in the pricing and reimbursement discussions. And as Ian mentioned in his prepared remarks, unfortunately, the exact timing of when those are going to conclude is uncertain just because they're not directly within our control.
As to the potential impact of newer agents in development on those discussions, what I'd say to you is that we're very pleased that in Ireland and Italy, where we reached agreements in May after the tez/iva data was available, those countries still saw fit to do what we think is the right thing, make a transformative medicine like ORKAMBI available to patients as soon as possible because it treats the underlying cause of the disease, and we know, therefore, that it's important for patients to be treated as early as possible. And we're certainly going to be continuing to make that case to the existing authorities who are still not providing access for patients in their countries.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Geoffrey Meacham, Ph.D. - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hey, guys. A couple of questions for you. Obviously, with the data thus far in the triple, you can expand the addressable population, but I wanted to ask you about the nonsense mutation and some of the splicing mutations. I know clearly, you guys have the alliance here with CRISPR and to look at some of those, but maybe just talk a little bit about what the strategy is there. Do you have technologies in-house to look at more nonsense mutation patients or is it just going to focus on delta-F single and double. And then, I have a follow-up.
Jeffrey M. Leiden, M.D., Ph.D. - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks, Geoff. This is Jeff Leiden. I'll take two parts for your questions. We actually view splice and nonsense quite differently. So as you know, and as Ian said, I think we're in very productive discussions with the FDA around the splice mutations. Most of those produce normal fee of care (13:11) but much lower amounts. And our in vitro data and our clinical data has clearly shown that they respond to KALYDECO, and by the way, also to tez/iva. And so, the imperative there is to get KALYDECO monotherapy approved for those patients as soon as possible, and then, follow that with tez/iva and we're confident that we will be able to that. So, that's splice.
Nonsense mutations, as you point out, are quite different. They are obviously not going to respond to CFTR modulators because there is no protein there. And we have several approaches there, the first of which is the ENaC inhibitor. So, one of the reasons we're interested in studying the ENaC inhibitors, that's VX-371, is because they, as you know, function by a different mechanism that doesn't require functional CFTR protein. And so, we'll have a look at the first data, as you know, in the second half of this year but that's sort of mechanism number one, to get at the nonsense mutations.
And as you point out, mechanisms two are genetic approaches, such as CRISPR and Moderna, we're making some nice progress in cell lines. We do have cell assays that allow us to look at those in both HBE cells and other cells, and the key issue there is going to be delivery. I actually think the gene editing and the ability for RNA to make CFTR is a relatively straightforward problem. The tough problem here is delivery and we're working on that in parallel and as we've said, we do think that's going to take a number of years to bring forward into the clinic.
Geoffrey Meacham, Ph.D. - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. And a follow-up question more on the commercial side, and I have asked you guys this a couple of times before but I just want to see if there's any update. Clearly, the market is U.S., Western Europe and Australia but I wanted to see, I think at one point, you guys have talked about opening an office down in Latin America or other countries that maybe have a founder effect, where you have populations that are well beyond the 70,000 that everyone puts up as the number. So, is there – maybe just help us with kind of where you are with that kind of more of the global piece.
Stuart A. Arbuckle - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Yeah, Geoff. You're correct. We have established an office in São Paulo in Brazil as a potential sort of regional hub for Latin America, and you're right, there are numbers of patients in there. The level of newborn screening and the maturity of registries there is perhaps, as you might expect, not quite as advanced than it is here in the U.S. and in parts of Western Europe.
And so, the exact numbers of patients, and indeed, their specific genotypes which we would anticipate being different in terms of distribution than it is in the U.S. and Europe, is not as well defined. And so, much of our efforts over the last year or so has been working with the various CF societies and physicians in those markets to try and better understand the size of the potential patient population there and the specific genotypes that they have so that we can work out which of our medicines is best placed to help those patients out. So, that's kind of the phase that we're at there and I would say stay posted. We'll kind of update you as we make more progress from a commercial point of view there.

Jeffrey M. Leiden, M.D., Ph.D. - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
And from a regulatory point of view, Geoff, it is our intention to go ahead and get these products registered there. There's a very formal way to do that and we're well into that process.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Terence Flynn, Ph.D. - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hi, thanks for taking the question. I was just wondering if you guys could comment on thoughts on uptake of tez/iva into the F508del homozygous patients with low baseline function. I know that is been an area where there are some concern around use of ORKAMBI. Do you think tez/iva will be used there or do you think those patients would most likely wait until the triple combo is available? Thanks a lot.
Stuart A. Arbuckle - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Terence, hi. It's Stu here. Thanks for the question. Let me first talk a little bit more broadly about how we see tez/iva fitting in. We think tez/iva, because of the benefit risk profile that it has, really has a great opportunity to allow us and physicians to treat more patients with CF, and that's because we think given the benefit risk profile where we know the efficacy is very good but also the safety and tolerability are also very good, we think it will be applicable to a number of populations. Firstly, those who have discontinued ORKAMBI, many of whom discontinued for adverse events. We think that's a population that physicians and the patients themselves will be very keen to be retreated with a CFTR modulator.
We also know those patients who have never been treated with ORKAMBI, some of whom because the patient and/or physician were concerned about the benefit risk profile of ORKAMBI. And then, thirdly, outside the U.S., in particular, the residual function population where we don't have KALYDECO monotherapy approved is another population where based on the Phase 3 data that we showed in March with tezacaftor/ivacaftor, we believe we'll also be able to get additional patients on a CFTR modulator. So overall, for tez/iva, we see the biggest benefit for patients and physicians, is being able to offer CFTR modulator to more people with the disease.
In terms of exactly how it might be considered for those with low FEV1s, clearly, one of the major concerns physicians and patients have there was the bronchoconstriction side effect that we see from lumacaftor. We've known about that with lumacaftor for a while and the result we've been very diligently and looking at whether tezacaftor has that same property. We know from all of our Phase 2 data, from our Phase 3 data from looking at both adverse events post-dose spirometry, the tez/iva does not have that same adverse events, and therefore, I think it's going to be a very popular option for patients with a low FEV1.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Geoff Porges with Leerink Partners. Your line is now open.
Geoffrey C. Porges, Ph.D. - Leerink Partners LLC
Thanks very much and thanks for the questions. A couple of strategy questions. First, Stuart, could you just talk about what success you're having with the full portfolio contracts and more or less fixed pricing? As you look ahead to now multiple generations potentially five different product offerings over time, is that a model that you think that you can deploy globally or is it just in very selected markets and what sort of reaction are we getting?
And then, secondly, Ian, your balance sheet is shaping up nicely and we expect it to continue to improve, and you are diversifying your portfolio across products. Is there a possibility that you might be able to take on some leverage and sort of free up additional capital from your balance sheet in that way? Thanks.

Stuart A. Arbuckle - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
So Geoff, I'll take your first question. So just for everybody's clarity on the call, the approach that Geoff's referring to is an agreement that we reached earlier this year in Ireland where essentially we have an agreement which is a long-term agreement covers populations of patients, in this case, those who are homozygous for the F508del mutation, all those who are one of the approved KALYDECO mutations and essentially looks at that patient population all the way down to the age zero, and essentially includes in the agreement both the currently approved medicines, KALYDECO and ORKAMBI, will include patients for ORKAMBI when the indications extended the lower age groups but will also include new Vertex medicines in those specific patient population.
I would say to you, Geoff, that since that agreement was put in place, and in particular, since both the tez/iva data, and now, the next-gen data which makes it very clear to everybody how close we are to being able to develop medicines that treat the underlying cause of disease in 90% of patients, there's been a lot of interest in discussing similar type of patient and/or portfolio contracts.
So, we're certainly very keen to be flexible, if that's what countries want to do. We're certainly, as we've demonstrated in Ireland, very open to doing that. I personally believe it's a real win, win, win, that arrangement. It's a win for the Irish government. It's a win for Vertex. And most importantly, it's a win for patients in Ireland. And so, we're certainly very open to doing that kind of agreement in any country. We're in, obviously, early stages of discussions with newer countries along those lines and certainly that there's a lot of interest there, whether we'll actually be able to get turn that interest into an agreement, time will tell.
And I think Ian will handle the question on balance sheet.
Geoffrey C. Porges, Ph.D. - Leerink Partners LLC
Thank you.
Ian F. Smith - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Yeah. So hi, Geoff. How you doing? So first of all, to the cash, just to give you a couple of points of where we are currently on our financial position. We have cash of close to $1.7 billion and we are cash flow positive each quarter now, and so, that balance continues to increase. I'd also point out that we actually do already have a revolver facility, and so, we have access to up to $800 million. It currently stands at $500 million but we can expand it to $800 million. So, when you have the $800 million debt capacity at the moment on the balance sheet that we have not yet drawn down on, plus the $1.7 billion of cash and a positive cash flow, we're in a very nice position to think about how we allocate that cash and how we apply it.
Obviously, we're already making choices of our revenue stream as it grows to allocate internally and that is going into R&D and it goes beyond to CF these days. It goes into other disease areas, and I'm sure before we finish this call, there will be a number of questions about how are we progressing beyond CF.
And then, as I've said on call previously, that cash can now – that's on the balance sheet and also the leverage and the increasing leverage and the increasing availability of cash, we can apply outside the company and we have three basic strategies there and we're very active, as shown actually by the announcement yesterday. So, one of those strategies and the priority is still, let's take a look at everything that's complementary in cystic fibrosis to our approach and we actually just closed on the acquisition of CTP-656 yesterday.
Another strategy is for us to look at other scientific footprints or scientific platforms or modalities and how they may allow us to treat diseases in different ways than just through small molecule approaches, and we've done both Moderna and the CRISPR collaboration in the last year or so that have advanced our approaches in those areas.

And then, what is also emerging is how we may just broaden our pipeline beyond CF with earlier stage type deals that relate to asset acquisitions or targets in IP acquisitions and knowledge and assays and small M&A-type ideas that we look at as well. We're very sensitive to looking at the capital structure of the company. We're still progressing and I think our focus is on earlier stage assets of high science in disease areas that are consistent with cystic fibrosis.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC
Great. Thanks for the question. My question was on the Concert molecule which, of course, you just closed on yesterday. What are the next steps? How are you thinking about developing that? Could that be ready for one of the triples to start next year or what are the things you need to do there in discussions with the FDA?
And the other question was in terms of your ongoing triples you have now in Phase 2, how good you feel about the therapeutic window in terms of going up and seeing higher efficacy without the risk of any undue side effects? Thanks.
Jeffrey M. Leiden, M.D., Ph.D. - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Yeah. Hi, Michael. It's Jeff. Welcome back by the way.
Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC
Thanks.
Jeffrey M. Leiden, M.D., Ph.D. - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Nice to hear your voice again on the call. So, I'll take both of those questions. So CTP-656, as you'll remember, is deuterated ivacaftor and the rationale there was to potentially get to a once-a-day regimen – triple regimen because both VX-659 and VX-445 are consistent with once-daily dosing from what we know now about their PK. And of course, tezacaftor is consistent with once-daily dosing. Whereas ivacaftor, KALYDECO, is not. It's a twice-a-day regimen.
And so, we're very pleased to have closed the transaction. We've already been actually working very hard on incorporating this molecule into a triple. It's a little early for me to give you a precise date but if you ask me, could we come up with a triple regimen containing CTP-656 that was once a day and begin a pivotal trial in 2018, I'd say the answer from what I know today is likely yes.
I want to emphasize that we're not going to wait for that certainly. It is our intention to get the best regimen to patients as quickly as possible, and so, the first regimen almost certainly will use ivacaftor, KALYDECO, and be a twice-a-day regimen and we'll follow that likely with a once-a-day regimen, and we also have the opportunity to bridge back later to substitute in the ivacaftor.
All of that as you say requires some discussion with regulators and it also requires a little more data on our part. We're certainly not going to jump into a Phase 3 trial of the ivacaftor until we have enough efficacy, safety, tolerability and PK data to make sure that we know the dose and we know how to put it together with the other agents. But again, we think that's a relatively short journey and that we could have such a regimen in pivotals next year.
And then, your second question...
Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC
And then, the triple – yeah.
Jeffrey M. Leiden, M.D., Ph.D. - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Yeah, the triple. And really, your question was about therapeutic window, and as we said last week, one of the things that was the most important for us to see in all four regimens actually was the very favorable safety and tolerability profile, and what that meant to us is that we could begin to expand dosing upwards, and so, we're doing that, as you know, in at least three of the regimens.
So in VX-152, the initial data was at a 100 milligram and 200 milligram dose. We are already expanding that up to 300 milligrams and those patients are being dosed. And so, we'll see whether we can essentially wring more efficacy out of VX-152 with that same safety and tolerability profile. Some suggestion we may be able to because if you look back at that data, there does seem to be a clear dose response in FEV1 between 100 milligrams and 200 milligrams.

With VX-659, you'll remember we're at 120 BID, and so, the Phase 2 trial of VX-659, which is just beginning, will incorporate higher doses up to 400 milligrams a day, and the VX-445 dosing will also go up. So with those three molecules, we are going to try to increase dose looking for maximum benefit with a very favorable safety and tolerability profile. And as we said last week, we hope to have all that data converge towards the end of this year and early next year and that will allow us to pick not only the best regimen or regimens but the best doses.

Phil Nadeau, Ph.D. - Cowen & Co. LLC
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. And it's actually kind of a follow-up to the last one that's on data disclosure. I think Concert had guided to you getting a monotherapy data for CTP-656 out by the end of this year. Is that still likely now that's in your hands?
And then, second, Jeff, your answer to the question that you just gave, it sounds like there'll be more disclosures on VX-152, VX-659 and VX-445 either late this year or early next. Is that a correct interpretation? Is that when we'll see the next data or are there interim releases that are possible?
Jeffrey M. Leiden, M.D., Ph.D. - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks, Phil. I'll take the first part and Ian, I think, can take the disclosure question. So with respect to CTP-656 for monotherapy, we're actually not planning to develop CTP-656 for monotherapy, given that we believe that 90% of the patients will go on to a triple regimen. So, we're really interested in as part of a once-a-day triple regimen. We will get some interesting, I think, PK data potentially from that study but for us now, it's all about incorporating it into triple therapy and figuring out how to do that, which dose, making sure there's efficacy in the safety tolerability profile. It doesn't require a lot of patients but we will be doing that before we jump into pivotal trials. So, I wouldn't focus on the monotherapy trial because I don't think that's where we're headed.
Ian, may be you talk about the disclosure?
Ian F. Smith - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
And Phil, as we disclosed a couple of weeks ago, we're looking at our next-generation triple combination as a portfolio of medicines and given we are choosing to complete each one of the Phase 2 studies of each molecule, we see our next disclosure is when we've completed that – all the studies in Phase 2. So when we completed the Phase 2 for VX-440, VX-152, VX-659 and VX-445, we anticipate that being early 2018. We'll be able to not only give you the data, we'll be also – also be able to tell you how we're thinking about which molecule we're taking into Phase 3 in the first half of 2018. So, we continue to view it as a portfolio so we'd like to keep it to a portfolio disclosure and we anticipate that being early 2018.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So Ian, you alluded to more questions on BD and I do, in fact, want to follow-up now the bigger picture question on this front. So recognizing this is all still quite fresh but there's the recent progress in substantial de-risking on the triple front, impact how the company thinks about business development going forward in terms of investing outside of CF. In other words, do you have more confidence or perhaps change the approach to building outside of your core franchise, given what's likely more predictable future – the future track of CF revenues or these kind of topics that are mutually exclusive? Thanks.

Jeffrey M. Leiden, M.D., Ph.D. - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Yeah. Cory, this is Jeff. It's a great question. I'd certainly give you two different types of responses. Let me step back. We've actually been working on what's next after CF, which is one part of your question, for quite hard now for a couple of years and we sort of view it as a two-part approach. First of all, what's beyond CF in terms of trying to find disease areas really is, we've been consistent with what we've learned in CF. That is we're really only interested in transformative medicines and serious diseases that we can sell into the specialty areas with relatively low SG&A, which will then allow us to recycle most of our OpEx back into R&D. That's the model and we're going to stick to that model as we move beyond CF.
And then, we view internal research and BD as essentially complementary, often even looking at the same diseases using some internal programs and some external programs. And so, for instance, we've talked about sickle cell disease as a program that we're interested in because it does fit that profile. We have an internal small molecule program or several of them, actually, in sickle cell disease. We have our collaboration with CRISPR in sickle cell disease and we may even look at additional outside programs. So, this hybrid combination of inside investment and outside investment is the way we're going to go at this for the majority of diseases.
Now, with respect to your question about the strengthening financial position and how does that change our perspective, I think the key word that you said, which is the word we use, is confidence. As this financial position strengthens, we have more confidence not only in our balance sheet today but importantly, in our balance sheet tomorrow, and so, that's going to let us, I do believe, give us a lot more financial firepower, let us do more deals and potentially larger.
As Ian said, we're not in the business of buying revenue in 2019 or 2020. We're not going to go out and buy marketed products but we are very interested in diversifying our earlier stage pipeline with these kinds of transformative medicines and I think you can expect more of that as our confidence is growing significantly.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Carter Gould with UBS. Your line is now open.
Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC
Hi, guys, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question and congrats again on all the progress. I guess, the segue to beyond CF – a question for Jeff or David. ClinicalTrials.gov says the VX-150 Phase 2 study supposed to read out in 4Q. I guess, one, is that the right timeline, and two, how should we be thinking about what you want to see to advance into a Phase 3 in acute pain? Thank you.
Jeffrey M. Leiden, M.D., Ph.D. - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Yeah. So, thanks for asking. Let me again just take a step back for those who aren't familiar with VX-150. This is our NaV 1.8 inhibitor. This a novel mechanism – pain mechanism, as you know. We recently reported positive Phase 2 data in osteoarthritis which was really the first proof-of-concept for this mechanism, frankly, in pain. And what's important here and what we said before is we don't view pain as one disease mechanistically. We actually view it as several different diseases. So, there is the inflammatory pain that we saw in osteoarthritis, there's acute pain, there's neuropathic pain, in particular. And what we'd like to – what we are doing at this point, I think, we'd like to do is to explore this molecule in all three of those.
So, we have the positive readout in OA. We're currently involved in an acute pain study which is a bunionectomy study, and we do hope that'll readout later this year, next year. And then, the third study will be a neuropathic pain study, which will start I hope later this year. That takes a little longer so it'll likely be 12 months to 14 months more once it starts before we read that out, again, depending on enrollment. Once we have the profile of molecule, then I think we're in a position to really decide, A, how do we best bring it to patients, which patients, do we need a partner for some of these. Obviously, community acquired pain is not something we're going to do and how to best monetize it as well for Vertex. And so, as we accumulate the profile of the compound, we'll keep you informed with each of these trails and that'll lead to the decision about how to take it forward, which is really your question.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Citi. Your line is now open.
Robyn Karnauskas, Ph.D. - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Hi, guys. Thank you. So given that you've spend almost a $1 billion on R&D and I know you said a majority of that is CF, can you quantify right now what percentage is non-CF? And if you're thinking about – you're starting to think about expanding beyond CF, when do you think the CF spend might begin to taper, given that even clinical trials are running are a little smaller than before? So, can you help us understand how you expect the R&D spend to evolve a little bit and could you see an expansion in the non-CF sooner than what we anticipate? Thanks.
Ian F. Smith - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks for the question, Robyn. Some of the – let's say, the number that I'm about to give you might surprise you a little. So first of all, if you take R&D, let's split it up into R and let's split it up into D. So firstly, R, we have three research sites. One of those sites is focused on cystic fibrosis there. It is focused on other targets as well but it is primarily our cystic fibrosis site and they've done excellent work, as you know, out in San Diego.
There are two others sites that are not focused on CF. So already, we're spending well beyond 50% of our research investment beyond CF and on disease areas that, again, we've touched down on this call, that are similar to CF but we have a research strategy that goes beyond CF already and we've been doing that now for a couple of years and we hope to start seeing some productive results in taking molecules into the clinics of diseases that you may be familiar with, and they should start to see that maybe later this year and certainly, into early part of next year coming out of research. So, we're already – if you wanted me to put a percentage on it because it's fungible but it's probably around 60% that's beyond CF, given how we carve up our research activities.
For development, it is a little bit of a different story. Oh, and by the way on the research, we're committed to maintaining that kind of approach. I don't think that's going to change in the near term, given we continue to invest in CF. And I'd also say in research, we start to supplement it with external relationships such as CRISPR and Moderna and we have an investment there as well.
When we look at development, development is principally an investment in cystic fibrosis right now. As you may imagine, we have a full pipeline ranging from Phase 2s all the way through to Phase 3s. And so, the principal investment in development is actually towards CF and it goes well beyond just clinical trials as well. There is a heavy support in terms of formulation, manufacturing, medical affairs and regulatory.
And so, I would say probably 80% of our development spend is towards cystic fibrosis. And again, I don't see that the investment in cystic fibrosis tailing off significantly for another three, four, maybe five years. You have to understand as we get approval for medicines in 12 and older, we immediately are thinking about how we get approval for medicines in 6 through 11, we're thinking about 2 through 5, we're thinking about how we gather longer term data and build our registry data to support the long-term outcome of our medicines of treating this disease long term.
So, we need to maintain that support for the medicines we're creating to treat CF. I do see the investment starting to increase beyond CF but that would be a function of those creating opportunity. And Jeff just talked you through the pain opportunity. We have to see how that plays out, but you will start to see new ideas coming to the clinic and we'll start investing in those. But it'll be earlier stage so it won't be a significant spend in the next two or three years. It would grow if they progress down the pipeline.

Certainly. And our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Ying Huang, Ph.D. - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hi (40:41). Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a follow-up on the QD KALYDECO you got from Concert. It doesn't sound like it's ready for Phase 3 when you start the triple combo next year, but once that compound is ready, do you think you have to run a head-to-head study versus the BID KALYDECO? You have to show the comparability. And also, do you think FDA would want to see that data or you think it's just completely different separate study just to get that QD of KALYDECO through?
And then, secondly, maybe for Ian, if I add the Q1 ORKAMBI and then Q2 ORKAMBI revenue, just flat line for the rest of the year. We're already at high end of your guidance. Does that mean this is still very conservative for the $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion guidance for ORKAMBI? Thank you.
Jeffrey M. Leiden, M.D., Ph.D. - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Yeah. Maybe I'll take the first one and Ian will take the second one. Yeah, with respect to CTP-656, I would think about it as two stages. Stage 1 is really more us accumulating sufficient internal data to be confident both about the efficacy, tolerability, safety and dose. That's a small set of studies that supplements what Concert has already provided so that we can feel comfortable before we go into Phase 3 that we know the profile of the drug and we know the appropriate dose as part of a triple. So, we're planning to do those kinds of studies over the next months, as I said, and once we accumulate that data, we'll make a decision about taking that triple with the – with CTP-656 forward. And as I said, I think it's doable. Well, I'm not promising it because we're just learning about the compound to get that done to be in pivotals next year.
Then, your question about the FDA is a different question. So, I would think about that quite simply as are we going to need a Phase 3 trial there with the iva and is it our intention to do that. If we incorporate it into a new triple, we would then run pivotal trials there to get that approved by the FDA. If we already have a triple approved and later on, we want to substitute it back, that's a different story. That's probably more of a bioequivalent story. But regardless, we're going to need data, both efficacy and some safety tolerability data, dosing data before we dive into Phase 3.
Ian F. Smith - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
And Ying, thanks for the question. So as you saw, we are continuing to reiterate our guidance at $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion for ORKAMBI. But you're correct, if you do the math, we've had a strong first half of the year and if you double up that revenue rate without growth, it does put you in the mid to slightly in the upper part of our range. And so, I can confirm that we do not anticipate being in the low part of our range. But where we fall in the mid up to higher part of the range is a function of a number of things.
I would point out that firstly more acutely in short term, we did note in the prepared remarks that Q2 was benefited by some inventory stocking pre-July for holiday. And on ORKAMBI, in particular, it was $10 million and I know you know how that works but that means you're taking $10 million out of Q3 adding it to Q2, but that does mean a $20 million difference between Q2 and Q3. And so, these things do matter when you're trying to pro rata quarters to try and get a full-year run rate.
And one of the other things that we need to see how it plays out. We did see a little bit of a summer slowdown last year and it was more around compliance of medicines, and there was lower compliance which resulted in less revenues. So, we need to see how that plays out. We have a number of programs in place that we're trying to help patients be more compliant this year and – but we do need to see how that plays out. And obviously, something that's really important in terms of where we fall in the range is our launches in the new markets of Ireland and Italy, but also whether we gain reimbursement in countries like France. So where we fall in the range, yeah, we don't anticipate being in the low end. Be in the mid end and how we climb up from the mid end is really a function of performance, and that's why we're maintaining our guidance.

Ying Huang, Ph.D. - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Adam Walsh with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Adam Walsh, Ph.D. - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Hi, thanks so much for fitting me in. I got a couple of quick ones. First for Ian, just for our modeling purposes, can you breakout the ORKAMBI U.S. and EU revenues? And then, one quickly for Jeff on slide – I believe, it's 5, you talked about obtaining worldwide rights to CTP-656, but then you also mentioned other assets related to the treatment of CF. If you could just elaborate on the other assets part. If you are referring to something specifically, let us know. Thank you.
Stuart A. Arbuckle - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Adam, it's Stuart here. On the ORKAMBI geographic split, it's approximately 90/10. So of the $324 million globally, we recognized $288 million of that within the U.S. The balance, $36 million, was international.
Jeffrey M. Leiden, M.D., Ph.D. - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
And then, on the CTP-656 on the slide, what we're really about is there was some additional IP, and of course, knowledge about CTP-656, some additional IP around CF and we acquired all of it as part of this transaction.
Adam Walsh, Ph.D. - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Excellent. Thanks so much.
Jeffrey M. Leiden, M.D., Ph.D. - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Thanks.
Michael Partridge - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Okay.
Operator
Thank you. And I would now like to turn the call back to Michael Partridge, Vice President of Investor Relations, for any closing remarks.
Michael Partridge - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Thank you for joining us on the call. Second time in eight days, we've spoken to you. We appreciate it. The Investor Relations team is in the office tonight, if you have any additional questions. Thank you and have a good night.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals is an American Pharmaceutical company based in Boston, Massachusetts.
Vertex was founded in 1989 by Joshua Boger[2] and Kevin J. Kinsella.[3] Vertex was one of the first biotech firms to use an explicit strategy of rational drug design rather than combinatorial chemistry.
By 2004, its product pipeline focused on viral infections, inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, and cancer. It maintains headquarters in South Boston, Massachusetts, and two research facilities, in San Diego, California, and Oxford, England. The company's beginnings were profiled by Barry Werth in the 1994 book The Billion-Dollar Molecule[3] and its further development in his 2014 book, The Antidote: Inside the World of New Pharma.[4] In 2009, the company had about 1,800 employees, including 1,200 in the Boston area.[2]
In January 2014, Vertex completed its move from Cambridge, Massachusetts to Boston, Massachusetts, and took residence in a new, $800 million complex. Located on the South Boston waterfront, it will mark the first time in the company's history that all of the roughly 1,200 Vertex employees in the Greater Boston area will be working together.
Since late 2011, when Jeffrey M. Leiden joined Vertex as CEO, Vertex has ranked among the top 15 best performing companies on the Standard & Poor’s 500. Vertex shares increased 250 percent in the same period.[5] Vertex posted only one annual profit since it was founded in 1989.[5]

Telaprevir[edit]
In May 2011, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the drug telaprevir (Incivek), an oral treatment for hepatitis C marketed by Vertex. Development and commercialization of telaprevir is shared with Johnson & Johnson for European distribution and Mitsubishi for Asia. Telaprevir is a protease inhibitor.[6]
Cystic fibrosis[edit]
Ivacaftor[edit]
In 2012 ivacaftor, was designated as an orphan drug, identifying cystic fibrosis as affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. On January 31, 2012, Vertex gained FDA approval [7] of the first drug, Kalydeco,[8] to treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis rather than the symptoms, in patients 6 years or older who have the G551D gene mutation. In the US, 30,000 people have cystic fibrosis. About 4% of those, or 1,200, have the G551D gene mutation. Vertex is marketing the drug at $307,000 a year per patient.[9] Vertex also is studying ivacaftor in combination with another drug (lumacaftor[10]) for the most common mutation in CF, known as F508del, and expects the first set of results in 2012. Vertex worked for 13 years with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation to develop the drug.[11]
In the UK, the company provided the drug free for a limited time for certain patients, then left the hospitals to decide whether to continue to pay for it for those patients. UK agencies estimated the cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) at between £335,000 and £1,274,000—far above the NICE thresholds[12] of £20,000-£30,000.
On November 5, 2014 Vertex announced the submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA for a fully co-formulated combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor for people with cystic fibrosis ages 12 and older who have two copies of the F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene.[13] In 2015, FDA approved Orkambi lumacaftor/ivacaftor to treat cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients 12 years and older, who have the F508del mutation.[14]
mRNA therapeutics[edit]
In 2016, the company entered into a collaboration with Moderna, in fact taking an ownership stake in the company, to develop new mRNA-based therapeutics to treat CF.[15]
Venture philanthropy[edit]
In the late 1990s the Bethesda-based Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, encouraged by then-President Robert Beall, began investing in Vertex— when it was a small start-up biotechnology company— to help fund the development of Kalydeco in the form of venture philanthropy. The total investment amounted to $150 million.[16] In 2014, the CF Foundation sold the rights to the royalties of the drugs for $3.3 billion, twenty times the Foundation’s 2013 budget.[16][17]
By 2015 the annual cost of Kalydeco had risen to more than $300,000 per patient.[18]
According to an article published in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Vertex executives "grossed more than $100 million by cashing in stocks and stock options" and at "one point, the value of company's stock increased more $6 billion in a single day."[19]
Twenty-nine physicians and scientists working with people with cystic fibrosis (CF) wrote to Jeff Leiden, CEO of Vertex Pharmaceuticals to plead for lower prices.[20]

"We are aware of the financial complexities of the huge expenses for R & D with respect to the small number of patients or the market system that enables these advances to become reality. Yet -- notwithstanding all your patient support programs -- it is at best unseemly for Vertex to charge our patients’ insurance plans (including strapped state medical assistance plans), $294,000 annually for two pills a day (a 10-fold increase in a typical patient's total drug costs). This action could appear to be leveraging pain and suffering into huge financial gain for speculators, some of whom were your top executives who reportedly made millions of dollars in a single day (Boston Globe, May 29)."
— David M. Orenstein, MD et al.

The company responded in an email that "while publicly funded academic research provided important early understanding of the cause of cystic fibrosis, it took Vertex scientists 14 years of their own research, funded mostly by the company, before the drug won approval."[19]
On April 15, 2015 in Cambridge, MA, Joan Finnegan Brooks of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, spoke about the role of Vertex and venture philanthropy to a panel of biotech leaders hosted by Life Sciences Foundation on the topic of patient advocacy in the biotech industry.[21] While Brooks, who has Cystic Fibrosis, expressed gratitude for Vertex' development of Kalydeco, she observed that 25% of Cystic Fibrosis patients are not getting the medical care they need because of the prohibitive cost of the drug.[21]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Research and Pipeline 
Vertex is focused on discovering, developing and commercializing innovative medicines so people with serious diseases can lead better lives. Our scientists don’t see the impossible as an obstacle; they see it as a good place to start.
These studies are investigating treatments or outcomes that have not received approval from a Health Authority. The information presented is not intended to convey conclusions of safety or efficacy. There is no guarantee that the outcome of these studies will result in approval by a Health Authority.

Research & Investigation
 



Cystic FibrosisCystic FibrosisIn 1998 Vertex scientists set out to do what was considered impossible—treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis (CF) with small molecule medicines. Our scientists discovered and developed the first two medicines called CFTR modulators that were approved to treat the underlying cause of CF in patients with certain mutations. Vertex has the most expansive pipeline of CF medicines in development and, in addition to advancing research in the next CFTR modulators, we are investigating other approaches. Learn more about our CF research program in this section.






Ivacaftor
Cystic Fibrosis Investigational studies in currently marketed product 

Two Phase 3 clinical investigational studies are underway in children under 2 years of age, and children ages 3 through 5, with one of the following mutations in the cystic fibrosis conductance regulator (CFTR) gene: G551D, G178R, S549N, S549R, G551S, G1244E, S1251N, S1255P, or G1349D.
 






Investigational studies in currently marketed product

              Ivacaftor              FULL PRESCRIBING INFORMATION 

How It Works
Ivacaftor is designed to keep CFTR proteins at the cell surface open longer to improve the flow of salt and water across the cell membrane, which helps hydrate and clear mucus from the airways.
 
Our Studies
Two Phase 3 clinical investigational studies are underway in children under 2 years of age, and children ages 3 through 5, who have one of the following mutations in the cystic fibrosis conductance regulator (CFTR) gene: G551D, G178R, S549N, S549R, G551S, G1244E, S1251N, S1255P, or G1349D.
To learn more about the clinical investigational study in children under 2 years of age, visit clinicaltrials.gov.
To learn more about the clinical investigational study in children ages 3 through 5 measuring lung clearance index (LCI), a sensitive measure to assess lung function early on in the disease, visit clinicaltrials.gov.
About Cystic Fibrosis
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a rare, life-threatening genetic disease affecting approximately 75,000 people in North America, Europe and Australia.
CF is caused by a defective or missing CFTR protein resulting from mutations in the CFTR gene. Children must inherit two defective CFTR genes — one from each parent — to have CF. There are approximately 2,000 known mutations in the CFTR gene. Some of these mutations, which can be determined by a genetic test, lead to CF by creating defective or too few CFTR proteins at the cell surface. The defective or missing CFTR protein results in poor flow of salt and water into or out of the cell in a number of organs, including the lungs. This leads to the buildup of abnormally thick, sticky mucus that can cause chronic lung infections and progressive lung damage.
 







Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor
Cystic Fibrosis Investigational studies in currently marketed product 

A Phase 3 clinical investigational study is underway in children ages 2 through 5 who have two copies of the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene. 
 






Investigational studies in currently marketed product

              Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor              FULL PRESCRIBING INFORMATION 

How It Works
In people with certain types of mutations to the CFTR gene, the CFTR protein is not processed and moved through the cell normally, resulting in little to no protein at the cell surface. Lumacaftor is designed to increase the amount of mature protein at the cell surface by targeting the processing and trafficking defect of the F508del CFTR protein, and ivacaftor is designed to enhance the function of the CFTR protein once it reaches the cell surface. This helps improve the flow of salt and water in to and out of cells.
 
Our Studies
Vertex is conducting a Phase 3 clinical investigational study of lumacaftor/ivacaftor in children ages 2 through 5 who have two copies of the F508del mutation. To learn more, visit clinicaltrials.gov.

Tezacaftor (VX-661) + Ivacaftor
Cystic Fibrosis Phase 3 

A Phase 3 clinical investigational study is underway in people ages 12 and older who have one copy of the F508del mutation and a second mutation that has been shown to be clinically responsive to ivacaftor.
We also announced data for two other Phase 3 investigational clinical studies in people ages 12 and older.
 






Phase 3

              Tezacaftor (VX-661) + Ivacaftor

VX-440 + Tezacaftor + Ivacaftor
Cystic Fibrosis Phase 2 

A Phase 2 clinical investigational study is underway in people ages 12 and older who have two copies of the F508del mutation or one copy of the F508del mutation and a minimal function CFTR mutation not likely to respond to tezacaftor and/or ivacaftor therapy.
 






Phase 2

              VX-440 + Tezacaftor + Ivacaftor                          

How It Works

VX-371 + lumacaftor + ivacaftor
Cystic Fibrosis Phase 2 

A Phase 2a clinical investigational study is underway in people ages 12 and older who have two copies of the F508del mutation who are also being treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor.
There is also a Phase 2 clinical investigational study of VX-371 in people ages 12 and older who have primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD).
 
 






Phase 2

              VX-371 + lumacaftor + ivacaftor                          

How It Works
In partnership with Parion Sciences, our VX-371 program is investigating the role of sodium epithelial channel (ENaC) inhibitors in people with CF. Learn more here.
 
Our Studies
Vertex is conducting a Phase 2a clinical investigational study of VX-371 in people ages 12 and older who have two copies of the F508del mutation who are also being treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor. To learn more, visit clinicaltrials.gov.
There is also a Phase 2 clinical investigational study of VX-371 in people ages 12 and older who have primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a rare genetic disease that results in a loss of function in key ciliary proteins. The defective proteins lead to dysfunctional beating of cilia on the surface of cells, especially in the lungs, where the accumulation of mucus can lead to chronic lung infections, bronchiectasis and progressive lung function decline.

Cystic Fibrosis Phase 2 

A Phase 1/2 study of VX-445 alone, and in triple combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor, is underway in healthy volunteers, people with CF ages 18 and older who have one copy of the F508del mutation and one minimal function mutation and people with CF ages 18 and older who have two copies of the F508del mutation. 
 






Phase 2

              VX-445 + Tezacaftor + Ivacaftor                          

How It Works
In people with some types of mutations to the CFTR gene, the CFTR protein is not processed and moved through the cell normally, resulting in little to no CFTR protein at the cell surface. VX-445 and tezacaftor (VX-661) are designed to increase the amount of mature protein at the cell surface by targeting the processing and trafficking defect of the F508del CFTR protein. Ivacaftor is designed to enhance the function of the CFTR protein once it reaches the cell surface. The goal is to improve the flow of salt and water into and out of cells.
 
Our Studies
A Phase 1/2 study of VX-445 alone, and in triple combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor, is underway in healthy volunteers, people with CF ages 18 and older who have one copy of the F508del mutation and one minimal function mutation and people with CF ages 18 and older who have two copies of the F508del mutation.

About Cystic Fibrosis
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a rare, life-threatening genetic disease affecting approximately 75,000 people in North America, Europe and Australia.
CF is caused by a defective or missing CFTR protein resulting from mutations in the CFTR gene. Children must inherit two defective CFTR genes — one from each parent — to have CF. There are approximately 2,000 known mutations in the CFTR gene. Some of these mutations, which can be determined by a genetic test, lead to CF by creating defective or too few CFTR proteins at the cell surface. The defective or missing CFTR protein results in poor flow of salt and water into or out of the cell in a number of organs, including the lungs. This leads to the buildup of abnormally thick, sticky mucus that can cause chronic lung infections and progressive lung damage.

Cystic Fibrosis Research & Investigation 








Research & Investigation

              Gene Editing                          

Gene Editing
Vertex is collaborating with CRISPR Therapeutics to investigate the use of CRISPR's gene editing technology, known as CRISPR-Cas9, to discover and develop potential new treatments aimed at the underlying genetic causes of human disease. As part of the collaboration, Vertex and CRISPR will evaluate the use of CRISPR-Cas9 to potentially correct the mutations in the CFTR gene known to result in the defective protein that causes CF and to edit other genes that contribute to the disease. Check back for future updates.

              Messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) Therapies                           

Messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) Therapies
Vertex is collaborating with Moderna Therapeutics in an exclusive research collaboration and licensing agreement aimed at the discovery and development of messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) Therapeutics™ for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF). The research collaboration focuses on the use of mRNA therapies to treat the underlying cause of CF by enabling cells in the lungs to produce functional copies of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, which is known to be defective in people with CF. Through the collaboration, the companies will explore the potential utilization of pulmonary mRNA delivery. Check back for future updates.

Acute Spinal Cord Injury





VX-210
Acute Spinal Cord Injury Phase 2 

A Phase 2b/3 clinical investigational study is underway in people with certain types of acute cervical spinal cord injuries.
 






Phase 2

              VX-210                          

How it Works
 
Vertex is investigating VX-210 as a potential medicine for acute spinal cord injury. VX-210 is designed to promote neurologic recovery by inhibiting a protein known as Rho, which blocks neural regeneration after injury.  
 
Our Studies
In 2016, Vertex initiated the SPRING Trial: a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled Phase 2b/3 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of VX-210 in patients with certain types of acute cervical spinal cord injuries. Learn more about the VX-210 SPRING trial at www.vertexscitrial.com or at clinicaltrials.gov.
About Acute Spinal Cord Injury
Spinal Cord Injury, Severity, and Treatment
The spinal cord is a bundle of nerves that connects the body to the brain. These nerves carry signals to every part of the body. A spinal cord injury disrupts the signals.
Spine injuries are fractures or compressions of the vertebrae, the bone disks that make up the spine. Most injuries don't cut through the spinal cord. Spinal cord injury can occur when pieces of vertebrae tear spinal cord tissue or create pressure on the nerves.
Cervical spinal cord injury refers to a type of injury in the neck area of the spine.
An acute spinal cord injury is a medical emergency. Treatments may include surgery to stabilize the spine and relieve pressure on the spinal cord.
The SPRING Trial is evaluating an investigational therapy, VX-210, which is applied to the spinal cord during initial decompression/stabilization surgery. Learn more at www.vertexscitrial.com.
 





Pain





VX-150
Pain Phase 2 

Vertex completed a Phase 2 proof-of-concept study in osteoarthritis and plans to initiate two additional proof-of concept studies in 2017, in acute pain and neuropathic pain.
 






Phase 2

              VX-150                          

How it Works
Vertex is investigating VX-150 as a potential medicine for the treatment of acute and neuropathic pain. VX-150 is designed to block pain sensation through inhibition of NaV1.8, a voltage-gated sodium channel expressed in peripheral neurons that transmit pain.
Our Studies
In 2016, Vertex completed a Phase 2 proof-of-concept study in osteoarthritis and plans to initiate two additional proof-of concept studies in 2017, in acute pain and neuropathic pain. To learn more, visit clinicaltrials.gov.

vrtx_10k_2017-02-23_33_69Financial - ExpenseOur operating costs and expenses increased in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to increases in research and development expenses, sales, general and administrative expenses and cost of product revenues, partially offset by decreased restructuring expenses and royalty expenses.
vrtx_10k_2017-02-23_87_182Other - OtherThe above table assumes the repayment of the $300.0 million in 2017 because we repaid the outstanding amounts under the credit agreement in February 2017.
vrtx_10k_2017-02-23_87_181Other - OtherThe table above reflects the $300.0 million outstanding as of December 31, 2016.

vrtx_10k_2017-02-23_63_131Financial - ExpenseThe increase in interest expense, net in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to the interest expense we incurred for the full fiscal year in 2015 on the $300.0 million that we borrowed in mid-2014 pursuant to our prior credit agreement.
vrtx_10k_2017-02-23_129_268Other - OtherThe discount rates used in the valuation model represent a measure of credit risk and market risk associated with settling the liabilities.

vrtx_10k_2017-02-23_133_284Other - OtherIn future periods, if we determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized, i the valuation allowance would be decreased, ii the deferred tax asset would be reflected on our consolidated balance sheet and iii we would record non-cash benefits in our consolidated statements of operations related to the reflection of the deferred tax asset on our consolidated balance sheet.
vrtx_10k_2017-02-23_122_253Other - OtherThe increase in fair value of the contingent payments in 2016 primarily related to a Phase 2 clinical trial of VX-371, a compound in-licensed from Parion, achieving its primary safety endpoint in the second quarter of 2016.
vrtx_10k_2017-02-23_51_112Financial - ExpenseTherefore, accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate costs to bring our drug candidates to market are not available.

vrtx_10k_2017-02-23_34_337Other - OtherOur other items, net in 2015 and 2014, included $4.5 million and $0.5 million increases in the fair value of contingent payments related to our consolidated VIEs, which resulted in corresponding increases in net loss attributable to Vertex.
vrtx_10k_2017-02-23_109_213Revenue - ProductFor example, we are distributing ORKAMBI in France pursuant to early access programs but have not recognized any product revenues based on these sales because the price was not fixed or determinable due to the ongoing negotiations regarding the reimbursement rate for ORKAMBI in France.
vrtx_10k_2017-02-23_140_314Financial - ExpenseFor awards with performance conditions in which the award does not vest unless the performance condition is met, we recognize expense only if we estimate that achievement of the performance condition is probable.
