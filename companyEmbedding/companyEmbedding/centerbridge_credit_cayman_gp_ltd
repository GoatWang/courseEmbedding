SHARE REPURCHASE
AGREEMENT

THIS SHARE REPURCHASE AGREEMENT
(this “ Agreement ”) is made and entered
into as of September 26, 2016, by and among Extended Stay America,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “ Corporation
”), ESH Hospitality, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“
ESH REIT ” and, together with the Corporation,
the “ Companies ”), and each of the
entities identified on Schedule 1 hereto (each, a
“ Seller ,” and collectively, the “
Sellers ”).

WHEREAS, the Sellers own in
aggregate 127,960,388 shares of paired common stock, each comprised
of one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Corporation (the “ Corporation Common Stock
”) and one share of Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of ESH REIT (the “ Class B Common Stock
”), which are attached and trade together. These paired
shares are collectively referred to as the “
Shares ” in this Agreement;

WHEREAS, the Companies and the
Sellers propose to enter into a transaction (the “
Repurchase Transaction ”) whereby the Sellers
shall sell to the Companies and the Companies shall purchase from
the Sellers a number of Shares (the “ Repurchase
Shares ”) at the Per Share Purchase Price (as defined
below) as shall be equal to the lesser of (i) 15% of the total
number of Shares to be sold in the Secondary Offering (as defined
below) and (ii) three million (3,000,000) Shares (rounded down to
the nearest whole Share), as set forth in this
Agreement;

WHEREAS, the Corporation will
purchase shares of Corporation Common Stock (its portion of the
Repurchase Shares) and pay its portion (the “
Corporation Proportion ”) of the Per Share
Purchase Price, with such portion being determined by reference to
the proportionate amount of the aggregate valuation of the Shares
that was attributable to the Corporation Common Stock in connection
with the most recent third party valuation of the fair market value
of the Shares performed before the Secondary Offering;

WHEREAS, ESH REIT will purchase
shares of Class B Common Stock (its portion of the Repurchase
Shares) and pay its portion (the “ ESH REIT
Proportion ”) of the Per Share Purchase Price, with
such portion being determined by reference to the proportionate
amount of the aggregate valuation of the Shares that was
attributable to the Class B Common Stock in connection with the
most recent third party valuation of the fair market value of the
Shares performed before the Secondary Offering;

WHEREAS, the Sellers propose to sell
through an underwritten public offering (the “
Secondary Offering ”) registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the “ SEC
”) certain other Shares owned by the Sellers (the “
Secondary Shares ”);

WHEREAS, the Audit Committees of the
Boards of Directors of the Companies have reviewed and approved the
related party transactions involving the Repurchase Transaction and
related transactions that may be required in connection with the
Repurchase Transaction pursuant to the requirements of the Related
Party Transaction Policies of the Companies;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of

When purchasing a property, particularly with a cash payment, a real estate investor may provide earnest money as a deposit. This information will be present in the contract and will include details on the amount and how it shall be paid to the seller. If a loan is being used to purchase the property, details of the lender and the amount will be included in the document.There may be clauses regarding property taxes and disclosures of potential issues of the property.  If the seller agrees to perform certain repairs before transfer of ownership to the buyer, the repairs may be contained within the agreement. Some buyers may request fixtures or furnishings along with the sale of the property, and these will be listed within the document.  A purchase and sale agreement may also contain warranties, waiver of claims, and information about the title insurance policy.
