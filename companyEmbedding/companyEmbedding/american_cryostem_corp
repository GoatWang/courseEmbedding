Enhance Your Natural Beauty With Your Own Stored Tissue
Autologous fat transfer is an increasingly preferred procedure by patients looking for natural cosmetic augmentation and correction procedures.
Patients are enjoying the ability to have their stored adipose tissue available after the initial collection procedure for multiple augmentations to gain the desired results, in procedures such as: natural augmentation of the breast and buttocks or volume corrections in the hands, face,  and neck, etc.
Storing your adipose tissue for cosmetic enhancements provides you with numerous benefits not available during a one-time fat grafting procedures. You can now have one liposuction and simply visit your treating physician for multiple fat injections using your stored tissue anytime in the future. When you and your physician decide on a follow up cosmetic use, simply let us know and we will deliver your cryopreserved tissue to your treating physician for immediate use.

CRYOPRESERVATION








Maintaining Optimal Cell Viability during Cryopreservation


		  Our proprietary cryopreservation methods and procedures ensure reliable, consistent cryopreservation results for your tissue and cellular samples.
		




The ability to properly cryopreserve adipose tissue and cellular samples is a key component in providing usable tissue and cellular samples after thawing from cryo-storage for current and future Regenerative Medicine applications.
Our cutting-edge cryopresevation protocols include using proprietary DMSO free, storage media for adipose tissue and adult stem cells. All samples are store at liquid nitrogen temperatures of -190⁰ Celsius in state-of-the-art vapor phase tanks. Vapor phase tanks are designed so that there is no liquid nitrogen touching surrounding samples which greatly deceases risks of contamination of the sample.
CRYO developed and utilizes a proprietary cryoprotectant that allows for the shipment of thawed tissue samples at ambient temperature (room temperature), which eliminates physician preparation upon receipt. Our proprietary products and R&D methodology reinforce our commitment to delivering easy to use, contaminant free samples.

Patient Specific Adipose Derived Stem Cells (animal product free)

The Highest Quality Stem Cell Processing
Mesenchymal Stem Cells (ADSCs) (ATCELL™) are isolated from adipose tissue collected using our patented Cellect collection system. ATCELLs that require expansion are cultured using our proprietary ASCelerate SF-M serum free (animal product free) media.
As the science allows the use of patient-specifc ADSCs for the creation of therapeutic strategies for alleviating degenerative conditions, there is a clear need for laboratory processed patient-specific stem cells. Using our proprietary process for isolating and expanding stem cells derived from patient lipoaspirate, CRYO is able to process, culture and cryopreserve multiple stem cell samples of patient’s ADSCs for current and future use. Moreover, ATCELLs maintain their cellular identities as ADSCs throughout the culture process, creating the ability to culture multiple patient-specific cell samples which are cryogenically banked until needed.
ATCELL Differentiation Ability
ATCELLs are human mesenchymal stem cells capable of developing into a defined subset of mature cells; adipocytes, osteocytes, and chondrocytes.


ATCELL Purity and Expansion
ATCELLs are validated hADSCs through surface marker flow cytometry and differentiation analysis. Validation studies conducted with multiple cell lines over multiple passages ensure that ATCELL lines maintain their cellular identity during the culture process, assuring purity and reliably in clinical applications.

Differentiation Capabilities of ADSCs


		  Our proprietary ATCELLs combined with our differentiation medium technology creates defined cell types:		



Differentiation is the term used to describe the ability to transition a stem cell into another cell type such as cartilage or bone cells. ADSC’s have a natural tendency to change into bone, cartilage, muscle, fat and to other types of cells. As part of our commitment to continually improve our stem cell differentiation capabilities our internal R&D development program is focused on optimizing the full capabilities of clients adipose derived stem cells. American CryoStem has created a line of patented medium products, ACSelerate CY (cartilage), ACSelerate OB (bone) and ACSelerate AD (fat) that can successfully transform an ADSC into cartilage, bone and fat cells. CRYO is currently designing and testing new formulations for muscle and nerve cells.
All interested parties should email info@americancryostem.com to learn more about our stem cell expansion and differentiation capabilities.
ACSelerate™ AD is a defined, animal product-free patented medium intended to drive the differentiation of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) to adipocyte (fat cell)  lineage. This cellular change may be ascertained by the visible formation of intracellular oil droplets which become larger and more numerous (Below Left).  The identity of the droplets has been positively verified by staining with Oil Red (Below Right):

ACSelerate™ CY is a defined, animal product-free patented medium intended to drive the differentiation of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) to the chondrocytes (cartilage)  lineage.  Early differentiation may be identified by changes in characteristics from elongated, fibroblast like cells to rounded “cobblestone” clumping of cells into chondrogenic foci  (Below Left).  Later stage chondrogenic differentiation has been confirmed by staining with Alcian Blue (Below Right):

ACSelerate™ OB is a defined, animal product-free patented medium intended to drive the differentiation of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) to osteocyte (bone) lineage.  Commitment to this lineage is identified by pronounced, visible mineralization (Below Left) which becomes more pronounced over time.  Positive confirmation has been obtained by staining with Alizarin Red (Below Right).

Words such as "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "believe," "seek," "estimate," "project," "forecast," "may," "should," variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions which are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in or suggested by such forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this quarterly report to conform forward-looking statements to actual results. Important factors on which such statements are based on assumptions concerning uncertainties, including but not limited to, uncertainties associated with the following:  � Inadequate capital and barriers to raising the additional capital or to obtaining the financing needed to implement our business plans;  � Our failure to earn revenues or profits;  � Inadequate capital to continue business;  � Volatility or decline of our stock price;  � Potential fluctuation in quarterly results;  � Rapid and significant changes in markets;  � Litigation with or legal claims and allegations by outside parties; and  � Insufficient revenues to cover operating costs.  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto which are included in this quarterly report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ substantially from those anticipated in any forward-looking statements included in this discussion as a result of various factors.  Background  American CryoStem Corporation was incorporated in the state of Nevada on March 13, 2009. On April 20, 2011, we acquired, through our wholly owned subsidiary American CryoStem Acquisition Corporation, substantially all of the assets from, and assumed substantially all of the liabilities of, ACS Global, Inc. ("ACS") in exchange for our issuance of 21,000,000 shares of Common Stock to ACS (the "Asset Purchase"). We filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on April 27, 2011 disclosing the Asset Purchase and certain related matters.  Overview  American CryoStem Corporation is a biotechnology pioneer in the field of Regenerative and Personalized Medicine and operates a state-of-the-art, FDA-registered, clinical laboratory dedicated to our standardized processing, bio-banking and development of cellular tools and applications using autologous adipose (fat) tissue and adipose derived stem cells ("ADSCs"). The Company has built a strong, strategic portfolio of intellectual property, patent applications, and proprietary operating processes that form its core standardized cellular platform which we believe supports and promotes a growing pipeline of biologic products and processes, clinical services and international licensing opportunities. Our FDA registered clinical laboratory which we believe to be in compliance with FDA regulations for human tissue processing, cryo-storage and cell culture and differentiation media development is located in Monmouth Junction, New Jersey.  The Company believes the reproducibility of scientific studies has become a substantial issue in life science research from drug discovery and development through clinical trials as researchers throughout the world continue to use different protocols for processes associated with sample preparation, cryopreservation and cold chain management. We believe the scientific community is becoming more aware of factors that affect sample integrity and experimental variability. By standardizing handling, storage, and transportation protocols we can substantially improve the quality and reproducibility of preclinical and clinical data to help accelerate the transition from lab research to product development and market launch.  Our business strategy is centered on marketing our standardized platform products as a complete adipose stem cell solution and expanding our international footprint, research and development through scientific collaborations. We intend to generate revenue through the sale and licensing of our patented products, laboratory tools, and services to attempt to capitalize on: (1) ADSC technologies; (2) scientific breakthroughs incorporating ADSCs that have been developing in the fast growing Regenerative and Personalized Medicine industries; (3) providing these growth industries with a standardized ADSC cell processing platform; (4) enhancing the delivery of healthcare through cellular-based therapies and applications which address disease treatment, wound and burn healing, joint repair and personalized health and beauty care; and (5) building a global network of physicians and affiliated laboratory facilities for the delivery of our products and services.  Our proprietary, patent pending clinical processing platform allows for the collection, preparation and cryo-preservation of adipose tissue without manipulation, bio-generation or the addition of animal-derived products or other chemical materials which require removal from the tissue sample upon retrieval or prior to use. Management believes this core process makes each tissue sample suitable for use in cosmetic grafting procedures or for further processing to adult stem cells for other types of stem cell therapies. Currently, we believe there are numerous therapeutic and orthopedic applications for adipose tissue and adult stem cell treatments identified or in use globally. As of February 1, 2017, a review of clinicaltrials.gov, operated by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) indicates that there is a significant number of clinical trials registered or completed that are focused on adipose tissue (2136)stem cells  Products and Services  American CryoStem is focused on multiple high margin business lines capable of generating sustainable, recurring revenue streams from each of our developed products and services. The Company also incorporates its proprietary and patented or patent pending laboratory products, such as our ACSelerate(TM) cell culture media, into our processing product production and contract manufacturing services. Additionally, the Company requires licensees of our tissue and cell processing technologies to purchase our consumable products including our CELLECT� collection kit and ACSelerate - CP for the collection, processing, expansion and storage of tissue/stem cells.  We have generated initial revenues from our licensee's in Japan and Hong Kong and subject to, obtaining the requisite financing, management believes that we are well positioned to leverage our developed products and services as the basis for expansion of international distribution through licensees of our technologies for a host of Regenerative Medicine uses and future applications.  Our branded product and service offerings include:  CELLECT(R) Validated Collection, Transportation, and Storage System - An unbreakable "chain of custody" clinical solution for physicians to collect and deliver tissue samples utilizing proprietary and patent pending methods and materials. The CELLECT(R) service is monitored in real-time and assures the highest cell viability upon laboratory receipt. The CELLECT(R) system incorporates our ACSelerate-TR(TM) transport medium into all collection bags which supports the health of the tissue during transport. The CELLECT(R) kit is an integral part of our validated ATGRAFT(TM) and ATCELL(TM) technology platform to be used by all licensees of our technologies. The CELLECT(R) service is included in our patent application U.S. Serial No. 13/702,304.  American CryoStem is the first tissue bank to globally incorporate through its CELLECT(R) service the International Blood Banking identification and labeling and product identification coding system. The coding was developed in conjunction with the American Association of Blood Banks (AABB), the American Red Cross and the International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT). These groups form the International Council for Commonality in Blood Banking Automation (ICCBBA) and developed the ISBT 128 Standard for machine readable labeling. This labeling system is an acceptable machine readable labeling standard, product description, and bar coding system for FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research under 21 CFR 606.12(c) 13. American CryoStem conforms to this standard in its laboratory facility and all cellular and tissue products produced at the facility carry our W3750 ICCBBA facility identifier allowing any hospital, clinic, laboratory and regulator worldwide to identify the origin and obtain additional information on any sample produced at an American CryoStem facility. The Company will promote this standard in all laboratories that license or utilize our technology.  ATGRAFT(TM) Adipose Tissue Storage Service - A clinical fat storage solution allowing physicians to provide their patients with multiple tissue and cell storage options. The ATGRAFT(TM) service, through one liposuction procedure allows individuals to prepare for future cosmetic or regenerative procedures by using their own stored adipose tissue as a natural biocompatible filler or the components for cellular therapy application without the trauma of further liposuctions. ATGRAFT(TM) procedures may include breast reconstruction, layered augmentation, buttocks enhancement or volume corrections of the hands, feet, face and neck areas that experience significant adipose tissue (fat) volume reduction as we age. ATGRAFT(TM) is processed and stored utilizing our standards so that any stored fat tissue sample may be retrieved in the future and re-processed to create stem cells ATCELL(TM), our clinical grade cell product for use in Regenerative Medicine applications. The ATGRAFT(TM) service is included in our pending patent application U.S. Serial No. 13/646,647.  The Company charges standardized fees for ATGRAFT(TM) tissue processing and minimum annual storage fees depending on the volume of tissue processed. These processing and storage fees may be paid by the collecting/treating physician or the consumer. The Company earns additional fees upon sample retrieval, for the thawing, packaging and shipment of the stored samples to the physician or clinic for immediate use upon receipt. Additionally, physicians may request that any stored ATGRAFT(TM) tissue sample of 25ml or greater be reprocessed utilizing the Company's ATCELL(TM) and Autokine-CM(TM) processing. The Company charges fees for the reprocessing of a 25ml stored ATGRAFT(TM) sample and may charge additional fee's if expansion of the newly created ATCELL(TM) sample is also requested.  The Company believes the ATGRAFT(TM) service may create patient retention, and significant revenue opportunities for the participating physician. The ATGRAFT(TM) service lowers physician overall costs by eliminating additional liposuction procedures for each scheduled fat transfer or therapy procedure. Physician cost savings may include: materials, supplies, equipment, and the expenses of utilizing a surgical center, hospital operating room or an in-office aseptic procedure room. The ATGRAFT(TM) service is designed to operate under the minimally manipulated regulations contained in both 21 CFR 1271.10 and PHS 361.  ATCELL(TM) Adipose Derived Stem Cells (ADSCs) - Clinically processed and characterized adipose derived regenerative cells (ADRCs) created using the Company's proprietary Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and ACSelerate(TM) patented cell culture media. ATCELL(TM) is the Company's trademarked name for its ADRCs and differentiated cell products and processing methodology. The Company maintains multiple master and differentiated cell lines and labels them according to their characterization. (i.e. ATCELL(TM) (adipose derived stem cells) ATCELL-SVF(TM) (stromal vascular fraction), ATCELL - CH(TM) (differentiated chondrocytes) , etc. Cell lines are custom created for patients desiring to store their cells for their own use in future Regenerative Medicine procedures. The Company charges its customers fees to process a previously stored ATGRAFT(TM) sample and for newly collected client tissue samples to be processed. Customer samples submitted for processing must utilize the CELLECT(R) collection system and ACSelerate(TM) mediums to conform to our internal SOPs and quality control standards.  The Company believes it will earn additional fees based upon the proposed storage configuration of the final ATCELL(TM) sample and for future culturing in the ACSelerate(TM) cell culture and differentiation media. Cell culturing and differentiation can be performed upon receipt of the raw tissue sample or at any time on a previously processed and cryopreserved ATGRAFT(TM) or ATCELL(TM) sample. ATCELL(TM) has shown that it is ideally suited for expansion and differentiation into additional cell types utilizing the ACSelerate(TM) line of culture and differentiation mediums. The ATCELL(TM) products and services are incorporated into our pending patent filing US Serial No. 13/646,647.  The Company's ATCELL(TM) cell lines are processed and cultured in our patented ACSelerate(TM) cell culture media. All tissue, cells, and research materials made available for sale to research institutions are tested for sterility, disease, lifespan, and population doubling rate (PDL). Additionally, we believe these cells are suited for any type of cellular therapy or regenerative medicine research. Cell morphology is confirmed by (i) flow cytometry and (ii) differentiation analysis using ACSelerate(TM) differentiation media. Each ATCELL(TM) line can be further cultured and differentiated allowing the Company to provide genetically matched clinical grade cell types. We believe this research methodology may provide opportunities for the Company's ATCELL(TM) and ACSelerate(TM) products to become the building blocks of final developed commercial applications.  The Company intends to support its cell therapy application research, development and collaborative efforts by making ATCELL(TM) and ATGRAFT(TM) samples available for research and product development purposes through joint ventures, and university and commercial collaborations. These adipose tissue and cell line samples, we believe will be highly sought after by private researchers and universities for use in pre-clinical trial studies and in-vitro research due to our clinical processing methodology, donor sample data and the ability to create multiple cell types that have identical genetic profiles. We believe the clinical processing methods, data collection and testing of our ATCELL(TM) and the ability to make multiple cell types from the same donor line allows research teams to focus on application development and avoid bench to commercialization delays. The Company is preparing to distribute its ATCELL(TM) cell products to users of its ACSelerate(TM) cell culture media during 2017. The Company is investigating new sources of human mesenchymal cell lines for production and distribution to the cellular therapy research market.  ACSelerate(TM) Cell Culture Media Products - Manufactured patented cell culture media products for growing human stromal cells (including all cells found in human skin, fat and other connective tissue). Certain ACSelerate(TM) cell culture media lines are available in animal serum free, which is suitable for human clinical and therapeutic uses or a low serum version for application development and research purposes. The patented ACSelerate(TM) cell culture media line was specifically developed to address increasing industry demand for animal serum-free cell culture products and for the acceleration of products from the laboratory to the patient.  The Company recently entered into a licensing and manufacturing agreement with PeproTech a life sciences company formed in 1988. PeproTech is the trusted source for the development and manufacturing of high quality cytokine products for the life-science and cell therapy markets. Over the past 26 years the company has grown into a global enterprise with state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities in the US, and offices around the world. With over 2,000 products PeproTech has developed and refined innovative protocols to ensure quality, reliability and consistency. During 2016 the Company and PeproTech completed the optimization and scale up manufacturing studies and expect the licensed medium marketed under both PeproTech's PeproGrow(TM)and the Company's ACSelerate-Max(TM) brands in 2017. In January 2017 the first medium line ACSelerate Max(TM) was manufactured and released for sale globally through PeproTech's global sales force under their PeproGrow(TM) brand and for sale by the Company under our ACSelerate-Max(TM) brand. Additionally, the company will fill orders for its ATCELL(TM) research grade adipose derived stem cells to purchasers of either the PeproGrow(TM) or ACSelerate Max(TM) branded cell culture mediums.  On August 2, 2011, the Company was issued US patent number 7,989,205 for "Cell Culture Media, Kits and Methods of Use." The granted claims include media variations for cellular differentiation of ADSCs into osteoblasts (bone), chondrocytes (cartilage), adipocytes (fat), neural cells, and smooth muscles cells in both HSA medium (clinical) grade and FBS (research) grade. This patent covers both non-GMP research grades and GMP clinical grades suitable for cell culture of adipose-derived stem cells intended for use in humans. Additionally, in 2014 the Company filed a continuation of this granted patent with additional claims and improvements, U.S. Serial No. 13/194,900. On November 8, 2016 the Company was granted additional claims from the continuation U.S. Serial No. 13/194,900 issued as a new Patent Serial No. 9,487,755. Prior to the issuance the Company filed a continuation in part (CIP) containing additional claims related to our ongoing media development.  Published cell culture research indicates the most widely used cell culture medium today for growing and differentiating stem cell cultures for in vitro diagnostics and research contains fetal bovine serum (FBS) and other animal derived products. The use of FBS and other animal products in clinical cellular therapy application development and manufacture raises concerns and generates debates within the scientific and regulatory community relating to potential human/animal cross-contamination. These same concerns may lead to additional expensive and expansive testing and documentation requirements with the FDA during the application and approval process for new cellular therapies manufactured with or containing animal or animal derived products. FDA concerns are evidenced in their Guidance's and Guidelines regarding cellular therapy involving human cells, tissues and products (HCT/Ps) published and maintained by the FDA. Management believes that eliminating or greatly reducing FBS in cellular manufacturing, applications and products can eliminate or ease these scientific and regulatory concerns and may prove to be a winning strategy for cellular therapy application developers seeking FDA approval.  Our media products are being utilized by our research partners engaged in developing novel new cellular applications and treatments. The Company supports these efforts by also making ATCELL(TM) samples available for research purposes and for internal product development through our research programs. We believe these cell lines are highly sought after by private researchers and universities for use in pre-clinical trial studies and in-vitro research. We also believe that the Company's ability to provide clinical grade materials for these research and development collaborators, partners and other third parties extends the Company's ability to become a primary source of clinical grade materials and services necessary to support approved applications and treatments.  The Company has created several versions of its ACSelerate(TM) cell culture media including:  � ACSelerate-MAX(TM) - xeno serum free cell culture media,  � ACSelerate-SFM(TM) - animal serum free cell culture media,;  � ACSelerate-LSM(TM) - low FBS (0.05%) cell culture media,  � ACSelerate-CY(TM)- for differentiation of ATCELL(TM) into chondrocytes (ATCELL-CY(TM)),  � ACSelerate-OB(TM)- for differentiation of ATCELL(TM) into osteoblasts (ATCELL-OB(TM))  � ACSelerate-AD(TM) - for differentiation of ATCELL(TM) into adipocytes (ATCELL-AD(TM))  � ACSelerate-MY(TM)- for differentiation of ATCELL(TM) into myocytes (ATCELL-MY(TM))  � ACSelerate-CP(TM)- non-DMSO (Dimethyl Sulfoxide) cellular cryopreservation media  � ACSelerate- TR(TM) - sterile transportation medium designed to maintain the viability of the tissue during the shipment of adipose tissue to our processing facility.  The Company continues to optimize additional versions of ACSelerate(TM) media through further research and testing to develop versions for differentiation of ATCELL(TM) ADSCs into neural, lung and other specific cell types that may be necessary for use in future clinical applications. On December 31, 2014 the Company filed a patent application for an advanced medium formulation titled Human Albumin Serum for Cell Culture Medium for Clinical Growth of Human Adipose Stromal Cells. (US Serial No. 62/098799) representing the most recent results of this ongoing optimization program. On December 31, 2015, the Company converted the provisional application to an international PCT filing (PCT/US/68350) under the title Human Serum for Cell Culture for Clinical Growth of Human Adipose Stromal Cells.  ACS Laboratories(TM): Laboratory Product Sales, Contract Manufacturing and Professional Services - ACS Laboratories is a division of American CryoStem Corporation, responsible for the manufacturing and sale of all the Company's patented and patent pending cellular, cell culture, processing and testing products to professional, institutional and commercial clients. The Company operates a separate website (acslaboratories.com) to distinguish the sale of commercial and research products from its consumer products and services, which are marketed on its main website (americancryostem.com). ACS Laboratories manufactures a full line of ACSelerate(TM) cell culture media and ATCELL(TM) products; and provides these products to our collaborative partners and international licensees as further discussed below.  Contract Manufacturing, Autokine-CM(R) Anti-Aging, Autologous Skin Care Product Line - Under agreement with Personal Cell Sciences Corp. (PCS), we manufacture the key ingredient Autokine-CM(R) (autologous adipose derived stem cell conditioned medium) for PCS' U-Autologous(TM) anti-aging topical formulation. Each product is genetically unique to the patient and custom blended, deriving its key ingredients from the individual client's own stem cells. The Company provides its CELLECT(R) Tissue Collection service to collect the required tissue to manufacture the U-Autologous(TM) product and processes it under the same Standard Operating Procedures that it developed for the ATGRAFT(TM) and ATCELL(TM) cell processing services utilizing ACSelerate(TM) cell culture media. The Company receives collection, processing and long term storage fees and earns a royalty on all U-Autologous product sales. The utilization of the Company's core services in its contract manufacturing relationships provides opportunities for the Company to promote ATGRAFT(TM) and ATCELL(TM) products.  Our Company's contract manufacturing services can be extended to develop custom and/or white label products and services for both local and global cosmetic and regenerative medicine companies, physicians, wellness clinics and medical spas. The Company intends to expand its relationships and contract manufacturing regionally through its physician networks and globally through its International Licensing Program.  International Licensing Program - The Company believes that globally, many jurisdictions outside the US currently permit use of cellular therapies and regenerative medicine applications. The Company has received numerous international inquiries concerning the sale or licensing of our SOPs, products and services in the Regenerative Medicine and Medical Tourism Markets. The Company believes that the inquiries to date are a result of the global boom in Medical Tourism, Regenerative Medicine and the slow pace of approval of cellular therapies and regenerative medicine applications in the US. To address the Company's sales, marketing and branding opportunities globally, the Company has created its international licensing program. To date we have licensed our technologies in Hong Kong, Shenzhen, China and, Tokyo, Japan.  The Company believes it can take advantage of the significant growth of the global cellular therapy market through its international licensing and marketing efforts. A recently published study by Transparency Market Research predicts that the Stem Cell market will grow at a CAGR of 24.2% upon its value of US $26.23 billion in 2013 and will reach an approximate value of US $119.52 billion by 2019. The report, titled "Stem Cells Market - Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends and Forecast, 2012 - 2018"; which can be found at:  In June of 2015, The Company entered into an initial agreement with CellSource, LTD. ("CellSource") located in Shibuya, Tokyo Japan for the licensing of our AGRAFT(TM) tissue processing and storage technology and the purchase of our CELLECT(R) collection products which include our ACSelerate-TR(TM) transport medium. The Company also assisted TCCS in upgrading its facility in Japan and provided training in the ATGRAFT(TM) processing and recordkeeping procedures. CellSource began marketing the new services initially within its existing network of 5 clinics throughout Japan and begin purchasing its CELLECT(TM) and ACSelerate-CP(TM) cryoprotectant from the Company in the third quarter of 2015. Upon execution of the Agreement the Company received an upfront payment and will receive additional minimum annual payments, and consumable product sales revenue in future years. The Agreement also provided CellSource with a two year (2) opportunity to exercise a right of first refusal for the licensing and distribution of other products marketed by the Company in Japan.  Product Development  Our strategic approach to product development is to design, develop and launch new products and services that utilize our existing products and services, i.e. the use of the CELLECT(R) collection materials in providing ATGRAFT(TM)tissue storage services. Management believes that this approach will provide the Company with opportunities to produce near term cash flow, strong recurring revenue streams, strong international licensing partners and complementary scientific data. We focus on developing products, services and applications that require tissue collection and processing as the initial requirement to produce cellular therapies and products. These products and services may include adipose tissue and stem cell sample processing and storage as a form of personal "bio-insurance", adipose tissue (fat) storage for cosmetic fat engraftment procedures, and the creation and production of topical applications and ingredients used by other companies in the wound care and cosmetic industries as well as cellular applications and bio-materials development.  We intend to focus our efforts on expanding our product and services pipelines based upon our intellectual property portfolio, collaborative development relationships, product sales and distribution, and international licensing and partnering opportunities. Our current activities include supporting our university and industry collaborations by providing our products and services with the expectation that our products and services become the basis for new adipose tissue and stem cell based Regenerative Medicine and cellular therapy . . .
