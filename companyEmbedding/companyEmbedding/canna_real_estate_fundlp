Workers Compensation 


State Fund and All Workers Compensation Carriers


Who needs Workers Compensation Coverage?
California law requires employers to have Workers’ Compensation Insurance. Even out-of-state employers may need Workers’ Compensation Insurance coverage if an employee is regularly employed in California or a contract of employment is entered into here. All California employers must provide Workers’ Compensation Insurance benefits to their employees under California Labor Code Section 3700. There are five basic types of Workers’ Compensation Insurance benefits – medical care, temporary disability benefits, permanent disability benefits, vocational rehabilitation services, and death benefits. In California, all employers, whether large or small, are required to have coverage for their employees with Workers’ Compensation Insurance. An employee does not have to be full-time, or employed by only one employer for any number of months or days. In addition, there is no need for a written employment contract and employees can include legal and illegal aliens, minors and prisoners. Under certain circumstances; i.e., a home owner, you may be required to have workers’ compensation if you hire someone to perform gardening, maintenance, house cleaning, etc.


What does a Workers Compensation Policy Cover?
Workers’ Compensation coverage is offered under Part One of a Workers’ Compensation Insurance policy. In Part one, the insurance company agrees to promptly pay all benefits and compensation due to an injured worker. Employers Liability insurance can provide important coverage in addition to Workers’ Compensation Insurance. Employers Liability is offered under Part Two of a Workers’ Compensation and Employers Liability Insurance policy. Employers Liability Part Two protects the employer against instances where an employee’s injury or disease is not considered work related.


Who’s exempt from Workers Compensation Insurance?
Only corporate officers or limited liability company (LLC) owners in the construction industry with at least a 10 percent stock ownership in the corporation or LLC can elect to exempt themselves from Workers’ Compensation coverage. No more than three per corporation or LLC are allowed to be exempt. This new law will curb the tide of costly and dangerous practices by those construction employers looking to make a fast buck, while exposing employees and consumers to financial and physical harm.


Can a sole proprietor or individual exempt themselves from Workers Compensation Insurance?
Sole Proprietors and partners are not required to cover themselves, but can elect to be covered. Corporate officers are covered but those who own at least 10% of the corporation’s stock may elect to be exempted from coverage. If you work for yourself or own a business, you may not be required to carry Workers’ Compensation Insurance coverage. Sole proprietors, partners, and officers of closely held corporations are generally not considered employees unless specifically listed under a policy. If, the employer hires employees, the employees must be covered even if the owner is not. Sole proprietors, partners, and officers of closely held corporations are generally not considered employees unless specifically listed under the business Workers’ Compensation Insurance policy.


What do you consider a Sub-Contractor or Independent Contractor vs. an employee?
Independent contractors and subcontractors are considered employees of their clients unless they meet certain very specific criteria for independence and both parties have their own Work Comp Policies.

Workers Compensation 


State Fund and All Workers Compensation Carriers


Who needs Workers Compensation Coverage?
California law requires employers to have Workers’ Compensation Insurance. Even out-of-state employers may need Workers’ Compensation Insurance coverage if an employee is regularly employed in California or a contract of employment is entered into here. All California employers must provide Workers’ Compensation Insurance benefits to their employees under California Labor Code Section 3700. There are five basic types of Workers’ Compensation Insurance benefits – medical care, temporary disability benefits, permanent disability benefits, vocational rehabilitation services, and death benefits. In California, all employers, whether large or small, are required to have coverage for their employees with Workers’ Compensation Insurance. An employee does not have to be full-time, or employed by only one employer for any number of months or days. In addition, there is no need for a written employment contract and employees can include legal and illegal aliens, minors and prisoners. Under certain circumstances; i.e., a home owner, you may be required to have workers’ compensation if you hire someone to perform gardening, maintenance, house cleaning, etc.


What does a Workers Compensation Policy Cover?
Workers’ Compensation coverage is offered under Part One of a Workers’ Compensation Insurance policy. In Part one, the insurance company agrees to promptly pay all benefits and compensation due to an injured worker. Employers Liability insurance can provide important coverage in addition to Workers’ Compensation Insurance. Employers Liability is offered under Part Two of a Workers’ Compensation and Employers Liability Insurance policy. Employers Liability Part Two protects the employer against instances where an employee’s injury or disease is not considered work related.


Who’s exempt from Workers Compensation Insurance?
Only corporate officers or limited liability company (LLC) owners in the construction industry with at least a 10 percent stock ownership in the corporation or LLC can elect to exempt themselves from Workers’ Compensation coverage. No more than three per corporation or LLC are allowed to be exempt. This new law will curb the tide of costly and dangerous practices by those construction employers looking to make a fast buck, while exposing employees and consumers to financial and physical harm.


Can a sole proprietor or individual exempt themselves from Workers Compensation Insurance?
Sole Proprietors and partners are not required to cover themselves, but can elect to be covered. Corporate officers are covered but those who own at least 10% of the corporation’s stock may elect to be exempted from coverage. If you work for yourself or own a business, you may not be required to carry Workers’ Compensation Insurance coverage. Sole proprietors, partners, and officers of closely held corporations are generally not considered employees unless specifically listed under a policy. If, the employer hires employees, the employees must be covered even if the owner is not. Sole proprietors, partners, and officers of closely held corporations are generally not considered employees unless specifically listed under the business Workers’ Compensation Insurance policy.


What do you consider a Sub-Contractor or Independent Contractor vs. an employee?
Independent contractors and subcontractors are considered employees of their clients unless they meet certain very specific criteria for independence and both parties have their own Work Comp Policies.

Workers Compensation 


State Fund and All Workers Compensation Carriers


Who needs Workers Compensation Coverage?
California law requires employers to have Workers’ Compensation Insurance. Even out-of-state employers may need Workers’ Compensation Insurance coverage if an employee is regularly employed in California or a contract of employment is entered into here. All California employers must provide Workers’ Compensation Insurance benefits to their employees under California Labor Code Section 3700. There are five basic types of Workers’ Compensation Insurance benefits – medical care, temporary disability benefits, permanent disability benefits, vocational rehabilitation services, and death benefits. In California, all employers, whether large or small, are required to have coverage for their employees with Workers’ Compensation Insurance. An employee does not have to be full-time, or employed by only one employer for any number of months or days. In addition, there is no need for a written employment contract and employees can include legal and illegal aliens, minors and prisoners. Under certain circumstances; i.e., a home owner, you may be required to have workers’ compensation if you hire someone to perform gardening, maintenance, house cleaning, etc.


What does a Workers Compensation Policy Cover?
Workers’ Compensation coverage is offered under Part One of a Workers’ Compensation Insurance policy. In Part one, the insurance company agrees to promptly pay all benefits and compensation due to an injured worker. Employers Liability insurance can provide important coverage in addition to Workers’ Compensation Insurance. Employers Liability is offered under Part Two of a Workers’ Compensation and Employers Liability Insurance policy. Employers Liability Part Two protects the employer against instances where an employee’s injury or disease is not considered work related.


Who’s exempt from Workers Compensation Insurance?
Only corporate officers or limited liability company (LLC) owners in the construction industry with at least a 10 percent stock ownership in the corporation or LLC can elect to exempt themselves from Workers’ Compensation coverage. No more than three per corporation or LLC are allowed to be exempt. This new law will curb the tide of costly and dangerous practices by those construction employers looking to make a fast buck, while exposing employees and consumers to financial and physical harm.


Can a sole proprietor or individual exempt themselves from Workers Compensation Insurance?
Sole Proprietors and partners are not required to cover themselves, but can elect to be covered. Corporate officers are covered but those who own at least 10% of the corporation’s stock may elect to be exempted from coverage. If you work for yourself or own a business, you may not be required to carry Workers’ Compensation Insurance coverage. Sole proprietors, partners, and officers of closely held corporations are generally not considered employees unless specifically listed under a policy. If, the employer hires employees, the employees must be covered even if the owner is not. Sole proprietors, partners, and officers of closely held corporations are generally not considered employees unless specifically listed under the business Workers’ Compensation Insurance policy.


What do you consider a Sub-Contractor or Independent Contractor vs. an employee?
Independent contractors and subcontractors are considered employees of their clients unless they meet certain very specific criteria for independence and both parties have their own Work Comp Policies.

Canna  Cannabis Business - Home - Canna Real Estate Fund









Cannabis Business - Home - Canna Real Estate Fund

























































CANNA REAL ESTATE FUND, LP
AN Alternative way to participate in the cannabis business with a targeted 15.7% unlevered IRR
The Fund’s investment objective is to provide investors with an above average rate of return on both an absolute as well as risk adjusted basis, with a focus on delivering long-term appreciation and annual cash flow. The fund will purchase farms, farms with greenhouses and in some cases, indoor grow facilities. The general partners have targeted unlevered IRR of 15.7% and a preferred return of 10%.

REQUEST A CALL














OUR MISSION
Our fund was formed to address the capital and liquidity needs of cannabis oriented businesses. Many states have moved to legalize cannabis for medical or recreational use. However, the federal government prohibition precludes federally insured financial institutions from transacting with the industry, forcing many cannabis businesses to lockup large amounts of equity capital in their real estate that are otherwise needed for their operations and expansions. Through long-term leasebacks structured as absolute triple net (“NNN”) leases, the Fund seeks to produce superior returns.












 WHO WE ARE
Execution of the Fund’s strategic  plan is implemented by a team of seasoned professionals with  decades of experience in the real estate industry and the NNN property market. The principals of the Fund have a strong track record in the acquisition, development, financing, management, marketing and sale of NNN properties throughout the United States.

Learn More About Our Team














WHAT WE DO
We seek to produce superior risk adjusted returns by investing in long term triple net leases, including sale leaseback transactions, targeting licensed Cannabis growers who are uniquely situated and are primed to pay premium rental rates.

Cannabis Industry and the Real Estate Market Growing in Massachusetts
Massachusetts – The Next Frontier 
With legalization, Massachusetts will soon see opening of recreational marijuana shops, growhouses, testing facilities, and edible product manufacturers. There are dozens of industries that could experience major upticks in profitability. For example, contractors for greenhouses, security guards to protect the products, and mechanics and vendors will all be needed.
All industries can potentially benefit when the retail market opens in July 2018. The vast majority of that money is likely to stay within the state, boosting the economy. It is important to note however, that federal law prohibits marijuana. Interstate sales are extremely risky.
Cannabis Case Study – Colorado
In 2016, the Marijuana Policy Group, a cannabis-focused economic and public policy consulting firm in Denver, published a robust study on the marijuana industry in Colorado. The report revealed that forevery dollar spent on retail marijuana in Colorado, $2.40 in economic activity was generated in the state.
Adam Orens, a coauthor of the study, spoke aboutindustries that have seen a significant boost with the success of the marijuana industry. Real estate, in particular, has seen a boom.“We saw the cannabis industry rent a lot of B- and C-class retail space, and also transform a lot of industrial space,” Oren said.
Orens believes that Massachusetts can similarly flourish.  “A dollar spent in the cannabis industry in Massachusetts will mostly stay in Massachusetts and will then get spent within the cannabis industry or other industries that are closely related, or are serving it,” he said.
Colorado’s Pueblo County Commissioner Sal Pace met with Boston city councilors in early 2017. Pueblo County has become the center of commerce for Colorado’s marijuana industry. “Here in Pueblo County, 40 percent of all construction permits countywide have been attributed to the cannabis industry,” he said.
How to Invest in Cannabis-Oriented Real Estate 
Canna RE Fund addresses the capital and liquidity needs of cannabis-oriented businesses and gives investors a relatively low-risk method to invest in the cannabis industry without “touching the plant.” To invest in the future of cannabis with Canna RE Fund, visit our homepage to learn more.

In addition, there are special risks associated with investments connected to the cannabis business, including without limitation: (i) marijuana remains illegal under United States Federal Law even in those states in which the use of marijuana has been legalized; consequently, (ii) the potential enforcement of Federal Law could include seizure of property leased to a cannabis business, as well as an operator’s personal property and inventory, and the closure of such business, (iii) it is unlawful under Federal Law to lease property to be used to operate a cannabis business and lessors of property aware of a lessee’s cannabis business activities could be deemed to be facilitating the selling or distribution of marijuana in violation of the Federal Controlled Substances Act, or constitute aiding or abetting, or being an accessory to, a violation of that Act, which could constitute a criminal offense, and (iii) changes in state, county, city or local laws could result in a cannabis business being unable to obtain or maintain the necessary licenses, permits, authorizations, etc. to operate its business, which could have a material adverse effect on its business operations rendering it unable meet its financial obligations.

Cannabis real estate company gets NYSE approval, but Wall Street debut delayed
California-based Innovative Industrial Properties is hoping to raise $80 million, with eye on gaining properties for use by medical marijuana businesses 

462SHARESShareTweetRedditWhatsappMailPrintGoogleTumblrPinterestLinkedinPocketDiggStumbleupon

 





Published: Nov 23, 2016, 4:39 pm • Updated: Jan 24, 2017, 8:59 am  By Alicia Wallace,  The Cannabist Staff Updated Nov. 29, 2016, at 2:05 p.m.: For the second time in three business days, Innovative Industrial Properties downsized its planned offering. On Tuesday afternoon, just before 2 p.m. MST, the company notified the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it planned to offer 4 million shares at $20 per share. 
On Friday, the company lowered its deal size to  5 million shares for $20 per share  — down from the original 8.75 million shares offered at $20 per share. 

The first cannabis company to land a listing on the New York Stock Exchange could go public early next week; however, a culmination of factors — including marijuana’s uncertain future on the federal level — appear to be giving investors some pause, an analyst says.
Innovative Industrial Properties, a San Diego-based real estate investment trust (REIT) for medical cannabis facilities, filed documents in October to raise $175 million by offering 8.75 million shares at $20 per share. At that price, the company would have a $201.7 million market value and would use part of its proceeds for a $30 million sale-leaseback transaction with PharmaCann, a New York-based medical cultivator and dispensary operator.

The company received approval from the NYSE to list its ticker “IIPR” and was initially expected to have its shares price and go public this week.
“Getting NYSE clearance means there’s at least one less hurdle for cannabis IPOs (initial public offerings) in the future,” said Matthew Kennedy, an analyst with Renaissance Capital, a Greenwich, Conn.-based manager of IPO-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
IIP’s IPO could open doors for others to participate in the cannabis industry, PharmaCann’s general counsel told Forbes:
“IIP’s publicly-traded REIT will be the very first opportunity for institutional investors to comfortably generate exposure to an industry that currently lacks the sort of transparency that SEC oversight provides.”
However, Innovative Industrial Properties’ trip to Wall Street was delayed.
On Monday, IIP officials disclosed in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that the company’s founders may forego receiving some stock as part of the IPO — a sign that there is some pushback from investors, Kennedy said.
“With a newly formed REIT, they can’t really lower the valuation,” Kennedy said, noting that the company’s chief executive “may decide to take less shares to effectively boost the value for IPO investors.”
IPO investors want a “clean story” with a company, and there are some unprecedented risks with this company, he said.
“I think the company definitely benefited from election results,” he said, noting the medical and recreational marijuana measures passing in eight states.
However, that was dampened by the ongoing federal illegality of marijuana coupled with President-elect Donald Trump nominating the anti-legalization Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., for the post of attorney general, Kennedy added.
“There is the possibility that the federal prosecutors would just seize the company’s assets,” Kennedy said.
Such a potential occurrence was noted in the company’s list of “risk factors.” 
Following the Sessions’ news, Renaissance Capital officials noticed a sell-off occur in marijuana stocks that trade on the over-the-counter exchanges, he said.
Additionally, there’s risk in that the company is a REIT, he said, noting that interest in real estate investment trusts have trended down now that it looks like the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates. 
As with other newly formed REITs, Innovative Industrial Properties’ IPO will fund its first asset; the quality and stability of the tenant are uncertain; and the REIT has no operating history nor a track record, although its chairman does, Kennedy said. 
As has been previously reported, executive chairman Alan Gold took REITs BioMed Realty Trust and Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc. public and sold BioMed to the Blackstone Group in an $8 billion deal that closed earlier this year.

*Reg A and Reg D notations above refer to the Regulation A and Regulation D securities offering rules under the Securities Act of 1933 and subsequent amendments and implementing regulations.
    
Regulation A companies can offer their securities to the public with limitations on the amounts invested and the total raise. Companies relying on Reg A file an offering circular with the SEC that contains detailed information about the company and the offering, though less information than what is required in registered public offerings. You do not need to be an accredited investor to purchase securities in a Reg A offering. Securities issued in a Reg A offering are not restricted and may be sold immediately after they are issued, though they might not be listed on a national securities exchange and may not be easy to sell. Learn more on the  SEC site.
    
Regulation D companies do not have to register their offerings with the SEC and the SEC does not review the offering materials. You need to be an accredited investor to purchase securities in most Reg D offerings. Securities issued in a Reg D offering are restricted and cannot be sold without compliance with a number of requirements, including that you hold the securities for at least one year in most cases. Learn more on the  SEC site.
    
**Accredited Investor, as defined in Rule 501(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, is a person who has earned income that exceeded $200,000 (or $300,000 together with a spouse) in each of the prior 2 years, and reasonably expects the same for the current, or has a net worth over $1 million, either alone or together with a spouse (excluding the value of the person’s primary residence).

Workers Compensation 


State Fund and All Workers Compensation Carriers


Who needs Workers Compensation Coverage?
California law requires employers to have Workers’ Compensation Insurance. Even out-of-state employers may need Workers’ Compensation Insurance coverage if an employee is regularly employed in California or a contract of employment is entered into here. All California employers must provide Workers’ Compensation Insurance benefits to their employees under California Labor Code Section 3700. There are five basic types of Workers’ Compensation Insurance benefits – medical care, temporary disability benefits, permanent disability benefits, vocational rehabilitation services, and death benefits. In California, all employers, whether large or small, are required to have coverage for their employees with Workers’ Compensation Insurance. An employee does not have to be full-time, or employed by only one employer for any number of months or days. In addition, there is no need for a written employment contract and employees can include legal and illegal aliens, minors and prisoners. Under certain circumstances; i.e., a home owner, you may be required to have workers’ compensation if you hire someone to perform gardening, maintenance, house cleaning, etc.


What does a Workers Compensation Policy Cover?
Workers’ Compensation coverage is offered under Part One of a Workers’ Compensation Insurance policy. In Part one, the insurance company agrees to promptly pay all benefits and compensation due to an injured worker. Employers Liability insurance can provide important coverage in addition to Workers’ Compensation Insurance. Employers Liability is offered under Part Two of a Workers’ Compensation and Employers Liability Insurance policy. Employers Liability Part Two protects the employer against instances where an employee’s injury or disease is not considered work related.


Who’s exempt from Workers Compensation Insurance?
Only corporate officers or limited liability company (LLC) owners in the construction industry with at least a 10 percent stock ownership in the corporation or LLC can elect to exempt themselves from Workers’ Compensation coverage. No more than three per corporation or LLC are allowed to be exempt. This new law will curb the tide of costly and dangerous practices by those construction employers looking to make a fast buck, while exposing employees and consumers to financial and physical harm.


Can a sole proprietor or individual exempt themselves from Workers Compensation Insurance?
Sole Proprietors and partners are not required to cover themselves, but can elect to be covered. Corporate officers are covered but those who own at least 10% of the corporation’s stock may elect to be exempted from coverage. If you work for yourself or own a business, you may not be required to carry Workers’ Compensation Insurance coverage. Sole proprietors, partners, and officers of closely held corporations are generally not considered employees unless specifically listed under a policy. If, the employer hires employees, the employees must be covered even if the owner is not. Sole proprietors, partners, and officers of closely held corporations are generally not considered employees unless specifically listed under the business Workers’ Compensation Insurance policy.


What do you consider a Sub-Contractor or Independent Contractor vs. an employee?
Independent contractors and subcontractors are considered employees of their clients unless they meet certain very specific criteria for independence and both parties have their own Work Comp Policies.

Workers Compensation 


State Fund and All Workers Compensation Carriers


Who needs Workers Compensation Coverage?
California law requires employers to have Workers’ Compensation Insurance. Even out-of-state employers may need Workers’ Compensation Insurance coverage if an employee is regularly employed in California or a contract of employment is entered into here. All California employers must provide Workers’ Compensation Insurance benefits to their employees under California Labor Code Section 3700. There are five basic types of Workers’ Compensation Insurance benefits – medical care, temporary disability benefits, permanent disability benefits, vocational rehabilitation services, and death benefits. In California, all employers, whether large or small, are required to have coverage for their employees with Workers’ Compensation Insurance. An employee does not have to be full-time, or employed by only one employer for any number of months or days. In addition, there is no need for a written employment contract and employees can include legal and illegal aliens, minors and prisoners. Under certain circumstances; i.e., a home owner, you may be required to have workers’ compensation if you hire someone to perform gardening, maintenance, house cleaning, etc.


What does a Workers Compensation Policy Cover?
Workers’ Compensation coverage is offered under Part One of a Workers’ Compensation Insurance policy. In Part one, the insurance company agrees to promptly pay all benefits and compensation due to an injured worker. Employers Liability insurance can provide important coverage in addition to Workers’ Compensation Insurance. Employers Liability is offered under Part Two of a Workers’ Compensation and Employers Liability Insurance policy. Employers Liability Part Two protects the employer against instances where an employee’s injury or disease is not considered work related.


Who’s exempt from Workers Compensation Insurance?
Only corporate officers or limited liability company (LLC) owners in the construction industry with at least a 10 percent stock ownership in the corporation or LLC can elect to exempt themselves from Workers’ Compensation coverage. No more than three per corporation or LLC are allowed to be exempt. This new law will curb the tide of costly and dangerous practices by those construction employers looking to make a fast buck, while exposing employees and consumers to financial and physical harm.


Can a sole proprietor or individual exempt themselves from Workers Compensation Insurance?
Sole Proprietors and partners are not required to cover themselves, but can elect to be covered. Corporate officers are covered but those who own at least 10% of the corporation’s stock may elect to be exempted from coverage. If you work for yourself or own a business, you may not be required to carry Workers’ Compensation Insurance coverage. Sole proprietors, partners, and officers of closely held corporations are generally not considered employees unless specifically listed under a policy. If, the employer hires employees, the employees must be covered even if the owner is not. Sole proprietors, partners, and officers of closely held corporations are generally not considered employees unless specifically listed under the business Workers’ Compensation Insurance policy.


What do you consider a Sub-Contractor or Independent Contractor vs. an employee?
Independent contractors and subcontractors are considered employees of their clients unless they meet certain very specific criteria for independence and both parties have their own Work Comp Policies.

Workers Compensation 


State Fund and All Workers Compensation Carriers


Who needs Workers Compensation Coverage?
California law requires employers to have Workers’ Compensation Insurance. Even out-of-state employers may need Workers’ Compensation Insurance coverage if an employee is regularly employed in California or a contract of employment is entered into here. All California employers must provide Workers’ Compensation Insurance benefits to their employees under California Labor Code Section 3700. There are five basic types of Workers’ Compensation Insurance benefits – medical care, temporary disability benefits, permanent disability benefits, vocational rehabilitation services, and death benefits. In California, all employers, whether large or small, are required to have coverage for their employees with Workers’ Compensation Insurance. An employee does not have to be full-time, or employed by only one employer for any number of months or days. In addition, there is no need for a written employment contract and employees can include legal and illegal aliens, minors and prisoners. Under certain circumstances; i.e., a home owner, you may be required to have workers’ compensation if you hire someone to perform gardening, maintenance, house cleaning, etc.


What does a Workers Compensation Policy Cover?
Workers’ Compensation coverage is offered under Part One of a Workers’ Compensation Insurance policy. In Part one, the insurance company agrees to promptly pay all benefits and compensation due to an injured worker. Employers Liability insurance can provide important coverage in addition to Workers’ Compensation Insurance. Employers Liability is offered under Part Two of a Workers’ Compensation and Employers Liability Insurance policy. Employers Liability Part Two protects the employer against instances where an employee’s injury or disease is not considered work related.


Who’s exempt from Workers Compensation Insurance?
Only corporate officers or limited liability company (LLC) owners in the construction industry with at least a 10 percent stock ownership in the corporation or LLC can elect to exempt themselves from Workers’ Compensation coverage. No more than three per corporation or LLC are allowed to be exempt. This new law will curb the tide of costly and dangerous practices by those construction employers looking to make a fast buck, while exposing employees and consumers to financial and physical harm.


Can a sole proprietor or individual exempt themselves from Workers Compensation Insurance?
Sole Proprietors and partners are not required to cover themselves, but can elect to be covered. Corporate officers are covered but those who own at least 10% of the corporation’s stock may elect to be exempted from coverage. If you work for yourself or own a business, you may not be required to carry Workers’ Compensation Insurance coverage. Sole proprietors, partners, and officers of closely held corporations are generally not considered employees unless specifically listed under a policy. If, the employer hires employees, the employees must be covered even if the owner is not. Sole proprietors, partners, and officers of closely held corporations are generally not considered employees unless specifically listed under the business Workers’ Compensation Insurance policy.


What do you consider a Sub-Contractor or Independent Contractor vs. an employee?
Independent contractors and subcontractors are considered employees of their clients unless they meet certain very specific criteria for independence and both parties have their own Work Comp Policies.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
