Executive leadership team
James Whitehurst 
President and chief executive officer
















@JWhitehurst
James "Jim" Whitehurst is president and CEO of Red Hat, the world’s leading provider of open source enterprise IT products and services. Whitehurst is an avid advocate for open software as a catalyst for business innovation. With a background in business development, finance, and global operations, Whitehurst has proven expertise in helping companies flourish—even in the most challenging economic and business environments. Since joining in January, 2008, he has more than doubled the company’s revenue. Under his leadership, Red Hat was named to Forbes’ list of “The World’s Most Innovative Companies” in 2015, 2014, and 2012; added to Standard and Poor’s (S&P) 500 stock index in 2009; and named one of the best places to work by Glassdoor in 2014. 
In June 2015, Whitehurst published a book with Harvard Business Review Press entitled "The Open Organization: Igniting Passion and Performance" showing how open principles of management—based on transparency, participation, and community—can help organizations navigate and succeed in a fast-paced connected era. 
Prior to Red Hat, Whitehurst spent six-years at Delta Air Lines where he oversaw all aspects of airline operations and drove significant international expansion as chief operating officer. Before Delta, Jim held several corporate development leadership roles at The Boston Consulting Group, working in the Chicago, Hong Kong, and Shanghai offices, and as a partner in the Atlanta office with numerous clients across a wide range of industries.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/22/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Frontier Airlines, American Airlines (AAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL) have been fined for violating U.S. Transportation Department airline consumer protection rules, the department said on Friday.

















                                                    U.S. says 180 airlines implement boosted security measures
                                                


                                                    Reuters –

Some 180 airlines worldwide that fly directly to U.S. airports have complied with a first phase of enhanced security measures outlined in June and do not face any new restrictions, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said on Thursday. The U.S. directives no longer include any in-cabin restrictions on large electronics including laptops, DHS spokesman David Lapan said.

The Dow Jones Transportation Average dropped 83 points, or 0.9%, to buck the rally in the broader stock market, with the selloff in railroad stocks and United Airlines' parent United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL) shares accounting for the bulk of the weakness. United's stock fell $3.29, or 4.2%, in morning trade in the wake of disappointing unit revenue guidance. That was shaving about 20 points off the Dow transports, which is a price-weighted index.

Jim Whitehurst keynote at the Red Hat Summit in 2010


Jim Whitehurst (born 1966/1967 (age 49–50)) is the Chief Executive Officer at Red Hat. Prior to that, he was a Chief Operating Officer of Delta Air Lines. Whitehurst was tapped by former Delta CEO Gerald Grinstein to lead the airline out of bankruptcy and played a critical role in Delta's battle for survival against the hostile takeover attempt by US Airways in 2006.
Whitehurst became a very popular figure during the campaign to Keep Delta My Delta because of his transparent honesty and genuine affection for the company and its heritage. Some have speculated that his fierce defense of Delta worked against him as Delta's Board sought a successor to CEO Grinstein in 2007. Before his appointment as COO of Delta, Whitehurst served as Senior Vice President and Chief Network and Planning Officer for the company.
Prior to joining Delta in 2002, he served as Vice President and Director of The Boston Consulting Group and held various management roles at its Chicago, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Atlanta offices.
In 2013, the Governor of North Carolina, Pat McCrory, appointed Whitehurst as a member and vice-chairman of the North Carolina Economic Development Board.[1][2]
In 2014, Whitehurst was selected as the recipient of the NC State Park Scholarships program's William C. Friday Award.
