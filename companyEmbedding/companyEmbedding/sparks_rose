Additional Information



Details


No need to mix to get your desired "it" color for the fall, Sparks has created Rose Gold to give you hot hair in one step! Sparks is a vibrant, permanent hair color that produces the brightest shades imaginable and conditions hair as it colors, leaving hair healthier looking. Sparks colors can be used individually or intermixed to create a limitless pallet of color options. For maximum color vibrancy and durability with Rose Gold, you must pre-lighten your hair to a level 9 or 10. Sparks colors may also be applied to virgin hair or to hair that has been previously colored but not lightened, however, the color will not be nearly as vibrant nor will it last as long in the hair.3 fluid oz.Not tested on animalsImported

 Details

        Spark Naturals Rose Water, in 4oz and 8oz Spray Bottles (with a fine misting spray top)

Spark Naturals Rose Water is an herbal distillate, which is an important co-product produced in the process of making Spark Naturals Rose essential oil. The amazing thing about that is that SN Rose Water carries many of the beneficial properties of SN Rose essential oil (although in a much lower concentration).

Rose water has been used by generations in food, skincare, and haircare products. It is well-known for its many benefits, which include (but are not limited to):
-improving skin tone and elasticity
-moisturizing (great for dry skin, but appropriate for all skin types - it is effective, but not a heavy moisturizer)
-helping to prevent and possibly even alleviate sun damage (research is ongoing regarding substantiating these claims)
-anti-inflammatory (excellent for soothing sensitive skin)
-rich source of antioxidants

Rose water, straight from the bottle, is a fantastic moisturizer, linen spray, facial toner, and makeup remover. Rose water is often used in cooking applications, as well, including many middle eastern and southeast asian drinks and foods.
Imagine all the possibilities in combination with other beneficial essential oils!

Green Plant - 8" pot




 







                                    	Premium - shown

                    	We personally choose our green foliage plants at our growers' California greenhouses to ensure they are lush and healthy. The 8-inch pot is the most common size we sell because it is perfect for nearly all purposes of gift-giving, and are perfect for home and office environmental enhancement. We decorate our plants with special items to add visual appeal. This option also offers the best long-term ease of care because we use a premium organic planting medium containing time-release fertilizer. Most green foliage plants prefer lots of indirect sunlight and moderate, stable room temperatures. It is usually best to water thoroughly when the soil is dry to the touch, but to allow the water to drain completely.
