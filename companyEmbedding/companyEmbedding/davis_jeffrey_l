                           Blow-in-place operations provide a proven method of handling unexploded ordnance, but they also deliver significant amounts
                              of munitions constituents residues to the environment. These residues may persist and affect environmental sustainability
                              on training ranges. Alkaline hydrolysis is a well-established method for the destruction of explosives compounds. The objective
                              of this study was to measure the efficacy of on-site treatment of munitions constituents with hydrated lime following blow-in-place
                              operations. Samples taken immediately following topical application of hydrated lime demonstrate that lime does have an immediate
                              effect on RDX concentration. However, munitions constituents residues unaffected by lime treatment remained at the end of
                              the study, probably because of poor contact between munitions constituents residues and hydrated lime. This study highlighted
                              three challenges to consider as technology development moves forward on alkaline treatment of munitions constituents. First,
                              inconsistent RDX concentrations obscured the results of the field study. Second, the application method will make an important
                              impact on the success of the treatment. Finally, application rates will need to be tailored to individual applications so
                              that enough alkaline material is delivered to effect complete destruction of the munitions constituent residues of concern

                           Energetic compounds, such as 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX), and their degradation
                              products, can act as a source of contamination for soil on Department of Defense testing and training ranges. Base-catalyzed
                              hydrolysis degrades nitroaromatics and nitramines, and the potential effectiveness of this reaction in soil has been demonstrated
                              at both bench and pilot scales. This report evaluates the potential for soil bacteria to degrade the transformation products
                              from the alkaline hydrolysis of munitions residues. The media were obtained from the hydrolytic destruction of TNT and RDX
                              at pH 12.5, 11.5, and 10.5. Duplicate reactors were amended with [14C]-labeled explosive compounds. Bench-scale microcosms
                              incubated aerobically and anaerobically using grenade range soil as the inoculum and reaction mixtures (quenched and neutralized)
                              as the media showed that there is a potential for biodegradation. Nutrient analysis confirmed the presence of increased levels
                              of nitrite and formate following both aerobic and anaerobic incubation. TNT end products from alkaline hydrolysis were aerobically
                              mineralized, with 16% [14C]-label recovered as CO2. RDX reaction end products demonstrated much greater mineralization than
                              TNT (roughly threefold). The use of alkaline material on training ranges has the potential to treat source-zone energetics
                              contamination

                              products can act as a source of contamination for soil on Department of Defense testing and training ranges. Base hydrolysis
                              degrades nitroaromatics and nitramines, and the potential effectiveness of lime to induce this reaction has been demonstrated
                              at the laboratory scale. The objective of this research was to further examine both basic and applied aspects of alkaline
                              application as an inexpensive and effective means of reducing source-zone contamination on military ranges. Bench-scale microcosms
                              were used to examine basic conditions that could affect the alkaline hydrolysis reaction, such as soil organic matter content,
                              lime concentration, soil type, and contamination type. Results from experiments using soil from a variety of ammunition production
                              facilities and training ranges, in general, support the use of explosive contaminant treatment by alkaline material in well-mixed
                              systems. RDX in crystalline form was more resistant to treatment, possibly due to limitations associated with the dissolution
                              of the RDX from the crystal to the aqueous phase. Larger-scale experiments, conducted in vessels packed with approximately
                              55 kg of soil, were used to investigate topical versus well-mixed applications of three alkaline materials (hydrated lime,
                              quicklime, and Class C fly ash). TNT, RDX, and HMX in the mixed system were removed quickly from both the leachate and soil.
                              However, results from experiments with topical applications of alkali material indicated that the aqueous transport of hydroxide
                              ion was not sufficient to overcome the buffering capacity of the soil. Consequently, the soil pH was not raised to the extent
                              necessary for alkaline treatment of explosive compounds. This result is fundamentally related to the CEC properties of the
                              soil and is consequently considered a soil specific (and therefore site specific) result

                              Electrolytic reactive barriers (e-barriers) consist of closely spaced permeable electrodes installed across a groundwater
                                 contaminant plume in a permeable reactive barrier format. Application of sufficient potential to the electrodes results in
                                 sequential oxidation and reduction of the target contaminant. The objective of this study was to quantify the mass distribution
                                 of compounds produced during sequential electrolytic oxidation and reduction of ordinance related compounds (ORCs) in a laboratory
                                 analog to an e-barrier. In this study, a series of column tests were conducted using RDX (hexahydro-1,3,5- trinitro-1,3,5-friazine)
                                 and TNT (2,4,6-trinitrotoluene) as representative ORCs. The experimental setup consisted of a Plexiglass column packed with
                                 quart-feldspar sand to simulate aquifer conditions. A single set of porous electrodes consisting of expanded titanium-mixed
                                 metal oxide mesh was placed at the midpoint of the soil column as a one-dimensional analog to an e-barrier. Constant current
                                 of 20 mA (variable voltage) was applied to the electrode set. Initial studies involved quantification of reaction products
                                 using unlabeled RDX and TNT. Approximately 70 percent of the influent concentration was transformed, in one pass, through
                                 sequential oxidation-reduction for both contaminants. Following the unlabeled studies, 14C labeled RDX and TNT were introduced
                                 to determine the mass balance

                              The use of hydrated lime has the potential to be an effective in situ technology for the destruction and containment of explosives
                                 contamination. This was proven with the results from the SERDP project CU-1230, where it was shown to rapidly degrade RDX
                                 and TNT. However, prior to field deployment of this technology additional experimental work was required to address concerns
                                 regarding the mechanism of the alkaline hydrolysis reaction, the character of the final products of the reaction, the potential
                                 for biodegradation of the reaction products, and the amount of lime required for alkaline hydrolysis in different soils. The
                                 results can be summarized as follows. First, spectroscopic studies of the TNT alkaline hydrolysis reaction identified two
                                 well-resolved and spectrally distinct reaction intermediates. A single radical species was formed during the TNT hydroxide
                                 reaction that correlated with the second reaction intermediate. Second, TNT and RDX degraded rapidly through alkaline hydrolysis
                                 at pH 12.5. The end products of the reaction were low water-soluble molecular weight compounds that included nitrate and format.
                                 No polymer formation was observed under these reaction conditions. Third, anaerobic and aerobic incubation of neutralized
                                 hydrolysis reaction mixtures with range soil showed that there is a high potential for biodegradation. This was evidenced
                                 by mineralization of reaction end products (production of [14C]-labeled carbon dioxide) and a decrease in nitrite and nitrate
                                 concentrations. Fourth, a simple method to predict the lime required by different soils under different environmental and
                                 contamination conditions was developed based on current ASTM methods for raising soil pH. A guidance document was prepared
                                 to provide site managers a means to easily and inexpensively determine the lime dosage required to raise pH to levels required
                                 for munitions and metals remediation

                              The identification and quantification of explosives and their degradation products in soil and natural waters is helpful in
                                 the design of remediation technologies, mobility investigations and performing risk assessments. The objective of this study
                                 was to develop a method for the determination of the degradation of nitramine compounds, specifically hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine
                                 (RDX). The analytical methods developed in this study were based on reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography
                                 (HPLC) using both C-18 and CN bonded silica columns to eliminate common interferences. Contaminant identification was further
                                 confirmed by performing spectral analysis of the compounds upon elution. The proposed method yields good separation of RDX
                                 from its degradation products and from other common energetic compounds. Method detection limits for the proposed method ranged
                                 from 0.01 to 0.03 mg/L. This method satisfies the need for analytical techniques to monitor the formation and subsequent degradation

                                 11 to 13, RDX 1 to 10 mg/L) achieved pseudo first-order RDX transformation rates in the range of 0.2 to 47.5 min-1, corresponding
                                 to 57.8 to 0.2 hrs of half-life period, respectively. In the CFSTR system (pH 11 to 11.9, HRT 0.54 to 2 days), the best alkaline
                                 RDX transformation was achieved a 99% RDX removal with the longest HRT and the highest reaction pH. Formate ({approx}2 M/M
                                 RDXremoved) and nitrite ({approx}0.2 M/M RDXremoved) were produced as the major hydrolysates, indicative of a simultaneous
                                 transformation mechanism by RDX ring cleavage and ring nitrogen elimination. The net OH- demand was found to be 1.5, 390 and
                                 130 M OH-/M RDXremoved at the pH of 11.9, 11.5 and 11.0, respectively, in the CFSTR system

                              A series of column studies, with aquifer material from the former Nebraska Ordnance Plant, were performed to explore the phenomenon
                                 of electron competition from ubiquitous inorganic electron acceptors (nitrate and sulfate) present in contaminated groundwater.
                                 Acetate was used as a source of readily biodegradable carbon in all of the treatment column systems. Influent hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine
                                 (RDX) concentrations (1 to 1.8 mg L(exp -1) were completely removed to below detection levels of 20 micrograms L(exp -1) in
                                 all treatment column systems without any nitroso-metabolites. In the control column system (with no carbon amendment), significant
                                 levels (^30 percent of the inlet molar RDX) of nitroso-substituted RDX derivates were observed in the effluent stream. The
                                 estimated first-order biodegradation rate coefficient for RDX was highest (0.79 hr(exp -1) in the treatment column system
                                 where acetate was the only amendment, about 52 times higher than the rate coefficient (0.015 hr(exp -1) obtained in the control
                                 column system. The presence of sulfate (100 mg L(exp -1) in influent groundwater temporarily delayed the onset of RDX biotransformation
                                 without any adverse effects on overall RDX biotransformation. Coexistence of low (100 mg L(exp -1) nitrate levels in the influent
                                 feed water reduced the first-order biodegradation rate coefficient obtained in the absence of nitrate by about 80 percent
                                 to 0.16 hr(exp -1). These nitrate levels, however, were low to halt the RDX biodegradation, probably because the available
                                 carbon levels were high enough to exceed the demands for nitrate reduction. High levels of nitrate (500 mg L(exp -1) initially
                                 halted RDX removal and significantly reduced the rate of RDX biotransformation by about 98 percent to 0.02 hr(exp -1), thereby
                                 increasing the half-life from 0.9 hr in the absence of nitrate to about 32 hr, with noticeable levels of untreated RDX in
                                 the effluent stream

How the BuildZoom Score works








Follow this contractor

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Michigan:













Does Davis, Jeffrey L carry a valid contracting license?



Michigan requires contractors performing any work on residential properties to be licensed with the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs. 
Davis, Jeffrey L currently holds license 2101110375 , which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Michigan?



Contractors in Michigan must complete a 60 hour approved prelicensure education class prior to taking a buisness and law exam. Contractors are required to take continuing education upon renewal of an active license. 











Your liability risk when hiring Davis, Jeffrey L



Michigan requires licensed contractors to carry an active workers' compensation policy. Although general liability insurance is not required under Michigan state law, it is always advisable to hire contractors who carry it. Request copies of the certificates for both forms of insurance for your records. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Michigan, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

Here are some of the more common dentists people seek out to improve their oral health:General Dentist
These dentists generally serve as the primary provider of dental care. If you need your teeth cleaned, crowns and bridges placed or any number of cosmetic procedures, book an appointment with a general dentist. Though not as common, these dentists will also provide more specialized services, including some forms of oral surgery - chief among them root canals and restorative care - fitting patients with a mouthguard and counseling people on how to stop smoking and what constitutes proper nutrition.Endodontist
To become an endodontist means undergoing an additional two years of training beyond dental school. As a result, these specialized dentists perform more specific procedures beyond general teeth cleaning and repair work. While a dentist may perform a handful of root canal treatments in a week, an endodontist may end up working on 20 or more in the same timespan. Your average endodontist also repairs teeth damaged by trauma and performs endodontic retreatments, which is repeat root canal procedure. Their added training also means that the endodontist is much more adept at utilizing complex dental equipment - especially ultrasonic instruments or microscopes. Most of that equipment is used to improve the health of teeth that are affected by disease and even congenital deformities.Pediatric Dentist
Proper oral care starts when you're young, and that's why pediatric dentists are so important. These dentists treat people under the age of 13, though there are exceptions based on a child's unique dental background. Pediatric dentists face unique challenges, because they must treat newly teething babies and children losing their primary teeth.Though cleanings are an integral part of their job, pediatric dentists are mostly concerned with planning ahead. That means working to ensure the child has straight teeth and correcting an improper bite. However, they also help address more child-specific conditions of thumb sucking and an over-reliance on pacifiers. As a result, pediatric dentists usually require an additional two-year residency working with infants and children.Oral Pathologist
Pathology refers to the study of disease, specifically as it presents in tissue. Oral pathologists, then, are responsible for studying the diseases that affect the tissue of the mouth and other surrounding muscle groups. These experts are considered to be true specialists, having focused their work on very niche areas of both dentistry and pathology. Though oral pathology is rather specialized, it's a vital component of the oral health industry. By analyzing tissue taken from biopsies, oral pathologists can help diagnose and eventually treat a number of oral diseases, including leukoplakia, cementoma and squamous cell carcinoma, among others.Periodontist
Similar to the endodontist, periodontists receive several additional years of training beyond dental school. However, whereas endodontists study advanced treatments, periodontists generally have a very specific field of interest. Your average periodontist focuses less on cleanings and more on diagnosing and treating gingivitis, periodontitis, which is an untreated form of the aforementioned ailment, and other periodontal diseases. Periodontists treat patients with more complicated oral care backgrounds, those people who require root planing - where dentists clean any infected surfaces - and root debridement, or the removal of dead tissue. Periodontists are especially concerned with proper gum health, including painful recession and teeth alignment.Cosmetic Dentist
Most of the aforementioned dentists are concerned with the health and well-being of a patient's teeth. While that is important to cosmetic dentists, they specialize in a number of different treatments meant to enhance the look or aesthetic of your teeth. To begin the average appointment, cosmetic dentists will examine your teeth for any imperfections or irregularities, and then suggest ways to make your teeth more white or properly aligned. The most popular such treatments are bleaching - where special chemicals are used to whiten your teeth - placing veneers or caps to alter the appearance of teeth, and bonding, where dentists fill unappealing gaps with structural replacement material.Orthodontist
Orthodontists are responsible for treating most dental irregularities, which includes everything from misaligned jaws - like an under or overbite - to overcrowding teeth and even certain cosmetic issues. Following dental school, the would-be orthodontist then has another three years of schooling, most of which is clinical experience in an orthodontic residency program. To properly diagnose and treat most dentofacial issues, the orthodontist relies on a collection of corrective gear. That includes braces, retainers and various facemask configurations. Though orthodontists work with people of all ages, the bulk of patients are young children and teens.Prosthodontist
Similar to the field of orthodontics, the average prosthodontist receives an additional three years of training following dental school. And though prosthodontics is something of a cosmetic field like orthodontics, it's primarily concerned with replacing missing teeth. Prosthodontists have a number of teeth-replacing procedures to implement, including filling veneers, onlays and inlays, bridges, crowns and complete or partial dentures. Beyond their work in implant dentistry, these experts treat a number of other mouth-related ailments, namely snoring, post-cancer jaw reconstruction, traumatic injuries and pain related to lock jaw and other temporomandibular joint disorders.Oral and Maxillofacial Radiologist
Similar to endodontists, these specialists - one of nine such unique fields recognized by the American Dental Association - utilize machinery to treat and diagnose patients. Specifically, these dentists make use of radiographic imaging to treat those diseases and ailments that impact the teeth, mouth and the maxillofacial region, which consists of the face and jaw. While X-rays are a popular option, OMRs also rely on plain and computed tomography, MRIs, ultrasounds and other forms of digital imaging. OMRs are among the first adaptors of new technology, using innovations in the field of imaging to find increasingly effective ways at understanding the impact of oral disease and what that means to patients.Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeon
Your primary dentist may refer you to an oral and maxillofacial surgeon if you experience facial pain, or if he or she suspects you have some variety of oral cancer. OMSs are also your primary source when planning most oral surgeries, like tooth extractions, cyst repairs and removals, and dental implants. However, an OMS can also treat a number of other ailments and diseases related to the maxillofacial region. For instance, malformations in your facial bones can cause sleep apnea, and an OMS can perform corrective surgery that removes or shapes bone. Many of these experts are also involved with more cosmetic procedures, performing or assisting with facial implants and rhinoplasty, in which the nose bone is modified.Dental Public Health Clinics
These clinics are available in most cities across the U.S., and they're meant to offer affordable health care to many low-income families and individuals. Though it differs depending on the specific clinic, the average clinic offers only the most essential oral care services, including X-rays, teeth cleaning, basic root canals and repairs, and tooth extractions. The fees an individual pays depend on a number of different factors, and most clinics have a sliding-fee that is determined equally by income and family size.Most Common Oral Care IssuesThere are several different kinds of dentists, each one with his or her own specialty. However, there are a core group of ailments all dentists treat. Conditions include:Tooth Decay: When your teeth fall out or begin to disintegrate in your mouth, improper brushing is often to blame. Certain infections also cause tooth loss or decay. One of the most affective ways to prevent tooth decay is with regular brushing and flossing right at home.Bad Breath: As your teeth fall out or you don't brush properly, your gums and teeth begin to break down and cause foul odors. Other causes of bad breath include gum disease and oral infections. As with tooth decay, brushing and flossing are vital, as is regular tongue scraping and the use of mouthwash.Teeth Sensitivity: Some people are born with teeth that are naturally sensitive to cold. A lack of brushing can also comprise your teeth's natural protection. The best method to help protect otherwise sensitive teeth is to use specialized toothpaste geared toward people with worn or damaged teeth.Dry Mouth: Certain medications will cause your salivary glands to stop producing spit. This in turn can harm the structure of your teeth and gums. There are several at-home measures you can take to combat dry mouth. These include regular hydration, chewing sugar-free gum, which also hydrates your mouth, and avoiding mouthwash with alcohol in it, which dries out your entire mouth.Teeth Grinding: For many people, grinding their teeth - also known as bruxism - is a subconscious behavior, usually the result of stress. It can eventually damage your teeth. The only way to treat your grinding habit is to meet with an endodontist, who will fit you with with a bite plate to mitigate the damage to your teeth.Mouth Sores: Also called canker sores, these painful bumps are the result of irritation to the soft tissue of your mouth. These sores can make brushing almost impossible. There are a number of different causes for sores, including anemia or a vitamin B-12 deficiency. As a result, your primary physician will have to examine the bump, find its root cause and then help develop a specific treatment plan, including the use of corticosteroids to reduce inflammation or antimicrobial mouthwash.Discoloration: Yellow teeth are the result of a number of bad habits, mainly smoking, drinking too much coffee and improper nutrition. Proper brushing can usually prevent discolored teeth before they happen. However, if your teeth become worse, many dentists will treat with a whitening procedure.A Guide for Dental Care BasicsProper oral care begins at home. The following are a few preventative measures you can take to keep your teeth and gums healthy. They just may reduce your time spent in your dentist's chair.Remember Your Angles
When brushing your teeth, always place the brush at a 45-degree angle. That way, you're able to hit every surface of each tooth.Don't Forget the Tongue
Within your mouth, your tongue is the largest source of bacteria. Be sure to brush it front to back and don't forget the sides.Floss Everyday
Brushing alone isn't enough to keep your mouth healthy, and that's why flossing is so important. Each time you floss, be sure to have at least 18 inches of floss available, which is what you should go through if you use proper technique. For optimal control, hold the floss between your thumbs and forefingers.Watch What You Eat
Sugar, alcohol and coffee all contain phosphorus. While some can prove beneficial, too much of this chemical can eat away at your teeth and gums.Keep in Mind the Mouthwash
Though not a requirement, mouthwash can be helpful if used to supplement proper brushing and flossing. Most mouthwash brands contain chlorine dioxide, a chemical that targets the majority of oral bacterial strains. However, don't overuse mouthwash, as it can cause a number of ailments.How to Choose The Right DentistProper oral care is an integral component of your greater well-being, which highlights why having the right dentist is of the utmost importance. Consider the following as you make an effort to find a dentist who will fit your unique medical history:Find a Recommendation
It's important to use a dentist whom you feel comfortable with. Because that's difficult to achieve by simply choosing names out of a phone book, you should always seek out a recommendation. Whether it's a friend, family member or co-worker, this individual can offer intimate details about a dentist's demeanor, operating style and approach to patient care. Be sure to always ask plenty of questions.Vet Your Dentist
Once you get a recommendation from a friend, don't simply book your first cleaning right away. Instead, meet with any prospective dentists to conduct a series of pretreatment interview. During this session, you can ask them about what treatments they perform most often, procedures they're not as familiar with, what accreditation they have or any organizations they belong to and how their offices handles insurance and payments. Just be aware that booking this time can be difficult based on a dentist's schedule.Consider Accessibility and Other Factors
Perhaps you've met a dentist with whom you feel comfortable. Not only that, but this dentist's payment options are suitable for your finances. However, don't be so quick to make a final decision, as other factors may influence your choice. Is the dentist's office nearby, or do you have to drive out of your way? Is the office open at a time that will fit the rest of your schedule? How much flexibility will the dentist's staff offer in booking appointments? Though seemingly trivial, these factors are nonetheless important.Check With Your State Board
One of the last things you should do before coming to a decision is to check with your state's dental board. Dentists must abide by different rules and regulations depending on where they practice, and the state board can outline what requirements your candidate must meet. These organizations can also offer information about any discrepancies in the dentist's background and if he or she has faced any disciplinary actions.Picking the Right Dental InsuranceAs with other forms of health care, insurance is a great way to both reduce associated costs and ensure you and your dependents receive the best care possible. However, you don't want to simply buy the first such plan you see. Here are some factors to consider when shopping for dental insurance:Pick Your Plan
There is no such thing as a one-size-fits-all dental insurance plan. Instead, most people purchase three main varieties, usually through their employers. An indemnity or fee-for-service plan is just as it sounds and means you'll have to pay for annual deductibles and co-insurance payments out of pocket. A preferred provider organization is less costly, and you choose from a network of dentists. However, PPOs have some limitations and accompanying deductibles. Similarly, a dental health maintenance organization plan limits you to just a few choices of dentists, and one doctor handles all of your oral care needs. However, these HMO are usually much less costly.Examine the Networks
As noted, PPO plans and dental HMOs work with only a select number of doctors. While that usually means fewer costs compared to other insurance plans or payment options, it also means you don't have quite as much say in the dentist who can treat you. That doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing, especially if you know who is in the network. Before purchasing the plan, you'll receive a list of dentists in each network. Do research on each doctor - just as you would when picking a dentist otherwise. From there, you can then pick a plan with doctors who meet your standards and requirements.Consider Your Coverage
Sometimes, it's not just the doctor that you want to consider. For many people, even the plans with the best doctors are deemed a bad choice. The reason? The coverage is less-than-stellar. When picking a plan, you need to look at just how much you'll pay for each and every service. For instance, some plans won't cover your fillings or X-rays, while others may charge more or less for a crown or tooth extraction. Knowing just what you'll be responsible for is important, as you don't want to be caught off-guard by unforeseen charges. Depending on your employer, a human resources specialist can walk you through specific coverage options.Make Your Plan Work for You
It's a sad fact that the dentist you want most might not be covered by the plan you've purchased. However, that doesn't mean that you have to look for dental services elsewhere. If you're truly comfortable with a dentist and you feel he or she can be an ally in your ongoing oral care regimen, then consider signing a plan to just keep that dentist available. That means potentially deal with costs and other insurance-related factors that you might have wanted to. If need be, you might be able to work with the dentist's office to address some of the plan-specific concerns.
