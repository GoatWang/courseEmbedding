                Ryan Parker is the new San Antonio CEO for BBVA Compass Bancshares Inc.            

                Bahram Mark Sobhani            








 



Ryan Parker, the new San Antonio market CEO for BBVA Compass Bancshares Inc., won't be moving into a corner office in the company's new local headquarters downtown — because there isn't one.




Instead, he can be found either roaming the floor of the company’s financial center on the ground level of the Weston Centre or working at his standing desk in the corner of BBVA’s open office layout on the second floor. In many ways it's a fitting arrangement for the new market CEO, who appears to be the youngest top executive among the major financial institutions operating in the Alamo City area.

Bahram Mark Sobhani










 


Parker, 36, who doesn’t self-identify as a millennial but said he straddles that cohort and GenerationX, will oversee his fellow bankers in the very physically accessible workspace while being able to peer down on the retail branch below. When he has to take a client call, there are high-tech phone booths with video conferencing capability that he can pop into — or tech-centric meeting rooms to accommodate conferences with clients or other executives. In an effort to preserve privacy, there’s white noise playing from the ceiling of the office space. In fact, all the bankers at this new corporate office operate in the same way, which Parker told the Business Journal has improved collaboration within the workplace.
“By giving up my walls, that means I have opportunities to talk to more bankers,” Parker said. “We try to bring fresh ideas to the bank but keep the core banking principles intact.”
The newly promoted executive described his leadership style as the opposite of a micromanager. He was previously senior vice president of corporate banking for BBVA Compass in San Antonio — a position he was promoted to just a few months ago. In 2012, Parker began as a corporate relationship manager at BBVA, and he has been working up the ranks since then. In recent months, he led the company’s local commercial loan production total that was undisclosed. He’s worked at Frost Bank and Lone Star National Bank over the course of his career that spans more than a decade in regional banking.





 


“There’s no greater benefit in a banker’s career than seeing a market grow as much as San Antonio has grown,” Parker said.
A University of Texas at San Antonio graduate, Parker said BBVA is looking to “breed homegrown leadership” as part of its strategy to succeed in the local market. The bank is focused on getting in on the ground floor with businesses in San Antonio — especially small and midsize companies that are looking to scale.
Parker will oversee BBVA’s commercial and small business lending, as well as its global wealth office in San Antonio and most of the company's 200 local employees across 24 branches. The role doesn't include oversight of retail banking. Beyond that, he plans to have wealth management and small business banking grow as quickly as commercial lending has — which can be a challenge.
“There’s been consistent growth. We haven’t seen any major spikes from a client-acquisition standpoint,” he said. “We’ve had double-digit growth in the past, but we don’t have any foresight at this time what market share is going to be.”
When ranked by deposits, BBVA Compass has about 4 percent of the San Antonio area's marketshare, according to data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Parker will report to Jeff Dudderar, BBVA Compass’ Texas regional executive based in Houston.
The new executive succeeds Andrea Smith as San Antonio CEO for BBVA Compass. Smith — who had been in the role since 2013 after more than a decade as a commercial banking manager for the financial institution — returned to Birmingham, Alabama, in October 2016 to become market CEO there. An executive search is underway to fill Parker's old job as the bank's local commercial banking leader, according to the company.
