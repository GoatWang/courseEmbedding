$145 million in commitments, including $115 million from 3 leading Canadian institutional investors and $30 million from Sun Life 
Targets strong risk-adjusted returns, primarily through high yield debt instruments in markets across Canada

TORONTO, July 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ - Bentall Kennedy (Canada) Limited Partnership announced today the successful first close of the Bentall Kennedy High Yield Canadian Property Fund I Limited Partnership (the "High Yield Canadian Property Fund"), totaling $145 million in commitments. The first close raised $115 million in commitments from three leading Canadian institutional investors. Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada had previously committed $30 million to the Fund to enable it to begin making loan commitments.








"The early success in raising capital for our High Yield Canadian Property Fund is a clear recognition from the marketplace of the tremendous opportunity that our relationship with Sun Life Investment Management offers for our institutional clients," said Malcolm Leitch, Chief Operating Officer, Investment Management, Bentall Kennedy.  
Sun Life Financial acquired Bentall Kennedy in September 2015 with the goal of expanding and diversifying the real estate capabilities of its Sun Life Investment Management business, which provides investment services to third parties and manages Sun Life's general account.
The Fund will utilize Bentall Kennedy's expertise in real estate equity investments combined with Sun Life Investment Management's leading capability in the commercial mortgage market.  The Fund is targeting an internal rate of return to investors, after fees, of 7% to 9%, primarily through lending secured by well positioned real estate projects across Canada.  The Fund will invest in high ratio first mortgages, mezzanine loans, land loans, second mortgages, participating debt and direct real estate equity.  
To date, the Fund has made 3 loan commitments for an aggregate of $25.4 million, with investments in Vancouver and Calgary. 
"The strength and capabilities of the combined real estate equity and debt team at Bentall Kennedy and Sun Life Investment Management enables us to offer our clients a differentiated investment vehicle that complements our other products and lets our clients choose the real estate strategy most suited to them," said Phil Gillin, Executive Vice President & Portfolio Manager, Bentall Kennedy and Sun Life Investment Management.
