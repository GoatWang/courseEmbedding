Palmer transports the viewer within his reductive canvases, with the use of understated and abstract forms. Palmer's work depicts forms that hint at reference, but leave interpretation open to the viewer. ''Studying in Florence under Philip Rubinov-Jacobson gave me the opportunity to open the door to more free forms in my work and add the flexibility to allow the viewer to be an integral part,'' states Palmer. Through this interaction between the loose forms, one may recall past experiences. His paintings depict a residue of memory with the power to transport the viewer back in time. Palmer has studied at Santa Reparata International School of Art in Florence under Master Philip Rubinov-Jacobson and Roberto Venosa in Cadaques, Spain. One of Palmers' focuses today is the ability to share his art in areas of deeper meaning. Texas Children's Hospital chose Palmer as their featured artist in 2003 to work with the children to create six canvases to be auctioned for local charities. Palmer has exhibited his artwork throughout the United States and Europe. Read more....

Armed with some know how, a few small touches and Walmart's Every Day Low Prices on home furnishings and decor, you can breathe new life into your living space   whether it be with fresh furniture like a bedroom set or something functional like a new bookshelf. Spaced out: Your living room life Are you rethinking your current living room? A new television is always a nice addition, but you may want a new sofa, arm chair or accent table first. When considering what furniture to buy, think about the space you have available and the look you want for the room. Possibly the most important piece of furniture in your living room will be the sofa. If you have a lot of space to work with, look for a big sofa that can accommodate your family and guests. If you don't have much space, look for something more compact, possibly even a loveseat. For additional seating (again, depending on how much space you have), you can add a loveseat, recliner or armless chair. An accent table and an ottoman can add functionality and style too. If you don't have a lot of interior design experience and you want a consistent look throughout the room, consider getting a living room furniture set. Living room sets come with different pieces to fit different spaces, so you can choose one that best serves your needs. You can also refresh the look of the room with smaller changes. Try reframing your pictures, adding some wall art or getting a new slipcover for the couch if you don't want to buy a new sofa. Decorative accent pillows are a great, inexpensive way to give your living room some personality as well. Stackable modular storage cubes are a simple design solution and they're eco-friendly. Cubes are an excellent home organizer for your modern living space. Each one is separate so you can stack them side by side or on top of each other, or you can get creative and build a pyramid or ladder design. You can also mix and match the colors or just keep it simple with a single shade. Build a better bedroom Getting a new set of bedding is a great way to give your bedroom a quick makeover, while providing the warmth and comfort you need. When picking out bedding, consider the size of your mattress, the climate and weather where you live, the material you want and whether you'd prefer a bedding set or separates. Bedding comes in the same sizes as mattresses (single, double, twin, full, queen, king and so on) so it's easy to match your sheets and blankets to your mattress size. For colder weather, choose bedding that is thicker, like a down duvet or comforter, and consider flannel-weave sheets if you tend to get cold more easily. For warmer weather, look for lighter top bedding and percale-weave or silk sheets. Cotton is the most popular material for sheets, but there are many varieties to pick from, including Pima and Egyptian cottons, both of which are extremely comfortable and luxurious. You can also choose from a variety of weaves, including percale, which is very soft, smooth and shiny. Easy kitchen solutions Your kitchen and dining area make up the heart of your home. Let's face it, with three meals per day, you spend a lot of time there eating, not to mention the time it takes to prepare the meals. With kitchenware, dinnerware, kitchen furniture and more from Walmart, you can make these areas functional, welcoming spaces for the entire family. The kitchen can easily be made more inviting by adding a fresh coat of paint to the cabinets and walls. For finishing touches, get some color-coordinated kitchen towels or potholders, and place a new plant in the kitchen window. Keep your kitchen neat and organized with storage and organization products, including pantries, racks, cabinet and counter organizers and food storage containers. Handy products like these make it easier to find what you need when you need it, so you can prepare meals with less confusion and frustration. Complete sets of pots, pans and knives make cooking easier, whether you're prepping for your family or a crowd. And if you like to bake, it's worth stocking up on bakeware, so you always have what you need. Let there be lighting New window treatments and lighting can really pick up the atmosphere throughout your home. Choose window furnishings that add both color and style and let in the natural light from your outdoor surroundings. Then use accent lights to highlight your favorite keepsakes and add light fixtures that complement your decor.

Add your unique touch to your space with home decor itemsthere's a reason that being an interior decorator can be such a lucrative career. The ability to create unique spaces within people's homes that they love and that wows visitors is a gift. If you don t want to go the professional decorator route, you can still create a space that shows off your personal tastes and represents who you're as a person and that of your family. Walmart makes it easy to find just the right home decor items to make your home the showplace you want it to be, and we can help you do so while saving you money at the same time with our Every Day Low Prices.curtains and window treatmentsThe right curtains or window treatments really set off a room, such as a living room or bedroom. In addition to looking good, curtains and window treatments need to be functional as well, which is what may cause someone to favor one over the other. Curtains and drapes are a way to add color, style and depth to a room and can serve to showcase the windows of your home. They're available in many colors as well as materials, including linen, cotton, rayon, satin, polyester, silk and several different fabric blends. You can choose curtains and drapes that run from the ceiling to the floor to create the illusion of higher ceilings, or those that are just slightly larger than the window they're covering for a crisper look or if you have small children or pets at home that you don't want to play with longer curtains. When selecting curtains and drapes you need to know both the length and the width you need for the space, as well as if you want them to have tiebacks or have certain properties like odor neutralizing and energy efficiency.Another common window treatment is the use of blinds and shades. Blinds are especially functional because they make it easy to control how much light comes in through the windows, and you can adjust them depending on the time of day. Many shades are made from wood, wood composite or synthetic wood, but there are shades made from vinyl, metal and bamboo as well. Depending on the blinds, they generally rest inside the window frame, so you'll need to know the length and width of your window frame before selecting them as well as deciding whether you want vertical or horizontal blinds. Shades often work in conjunction with drapes or curtains and are ideal for keep sunlight out, especially on hot days. These also go inside the window frame. Choose cordless shades that pull down and raise with a quick tug when you don't want dangling cords.Lighting and light fixturesLighting options include permanent fixtures such as overhead lighting, wall fixtures and ceiling fan lights. Lamps are portable lights you can place anywhere and can range from table lamps to floor lamps. Permanent ceiling fixtures that you choose depend on the style you're seeking to match. For an Old World or traditional feel, you can select chandeliers or pendant lighting. For more modern touches, dome or flush mount lighting and track lighting are good options. Chandeliers look especially good above a dining table or in an entryway or hall. Many permanent fixtures allow you to control the amount of light put out through the use of a dimmer switch you can add. Ceiling fans with lights serve a dual purpose and allow you to run one without the other or both at the same time. Ceiling fans also help the heating and cooling units in your home be more efficient, giving you added cost savings on your energy bills.Lamps are often more decorative pieces and can fall under many distinctive style schemes. Many table lamps are modern-looking pieces with lots of metal, such as brushed nickel or stainless steel. More traditional-looking table lamps are available with ceramic and wooden bases. Most table lamps have lampshades, which can add a splash of color to the room. Floor lamps can blend into the background of a room or be a showpiece that draws attention. Place one in a corner for a warm lighting effect. You can mix or match lamps for a room, and some are even available in sets.RugsIf you have hardwood or vinyl flooring, a throw rug or area rug is a functional and stylish addition to any room. Many area rugs offer unique color schemes or designs that can set off a room. You can use these rugs to cover up bare areas of your floor, including high-traffic areas, or place them under furniture, such as dining tables and coffee tables, adding some stability and protecting your floors at the same time. You can also add accent rugs and runners to areas of your floor that you'd rather see covered or places where rugs would be more comfortable on your feet and that of your family and friends.Other decor itemsArtwork and wall decor can make plain wall spaces in your home come alive with color. You can choose from canvas wall art, wall decals or framed wall art, such as paintings and sketches. You can also add family portraits or framed pictures to make your wall spaces more personal. Mirrors, both wall hanging and floor standing, can add depth to a room and make it seem larger.If your sofa, loveseat or armchairs are lacking in vitality, a few colorful throw and decor pillows can liven them up. These pillows are also functional, making an evening of TV watching more comfortable. Pillows come in many sizes, although most are square, round or rectangle, and feature a variety of color and designs, such as stripes, floral, animal and graphic prints. Choose what you love best and what brings out the decor in your home.Show moreElectrode, Comp-147349557, DC-prod-dal2, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-

Choose the best options for your decorating needs by considering the wall space you want to fill. If your wall space is small, one piece of art will do. Larger spaces do best with a series of wall hangings or one large piece that serves as a focal point. Consider your existing decor when choosing art and wall decor. Vintage signs add appeal to a home that already has an antique flavor, for example. Sleek, minimalist art goes best with contemporary decor. Choose art and wall decor that reflects your taste and personality. If you love nature, create a garden on your walls. If you're more of a romantic, adorn your walls with red hearts and a sentimental quotation. Whether you go for canvas wall art, metal decor or vinyl wall decals, there's an abundance of pieces that speak to you at Walmart, where you'll find gorgeous artwork at Every Day Low Prices. Wall Art and Photography Invigorate your decor with new and exciting wall art and inspiring photography. From architecture and landscapes to still life displays and sports, you'll find canvas art, posters and photography in every subject you desire, framed or unframed, in sizes from less than 30 inches to over 100 inches in height and in various lengths to match. To hang wall art, let the shape of the wall help you determine the arrangement. For example, put a wall art set on a long horizontal wall, two pieces of art one over the other on a narrow vertical wall or one large piece of art between two windows on a wall. The design options are endless with wall art. Wall Art Sets Large wall spaces benefit from coordinated wall art sets. Eliminate the guesswork when it comes to coordinating color and style with art sets that do the pairings for you. Consider wall art sets that unite a space with one theme or one image that ties your room's decor together.  Floater-framed photography sets, which make the art look like it's floating in the frame, come in various configurations, sizes and numbers of pieces. Floater-framed staggered sets come in three pieces that make a statement across your wall, for example, while a floater-framed set of four pieces can create a more coordinated square pattern on your wall. Wrapped canvas sets of five pieces make it easy to hang photography printed on cotton canvas in fade-resistant inks. Sets of two oversized wall plaques of paintings, drawings and inspirational sayings hung side by side create symmetry. Metal Wall Art Turn your home into a gallery with sophisticated, rustic or whimsical metal wall art. Hang a set of three elegant wire poppies with vintage flair, dimensional wall art that makes it look like you attached vases of flowers on the wall or a contemporary radiating iron wire wall sculpture structure with multi-colored discs to add sparkle to your home. Wall Decals What better way is there to put up nail-free wall art than with decorative decals? From sports themes to wall murals and inspirational quotations to backsplash-style tiles, wall decals cover all types and sizes of wall spaces or emphasize smaller areas with a pop of color and curiosity. Today's wall decals are sophisticated enough to put in dining rooms and cute enough for nurseries, too. They look like customized wall murals or stencils, but they're much easier to remove and reposition thanks to easy peel-and-stick technology. Mirrors and Frames Mirrors are works of art, and they come in all shapes, sizes and finishes and in sets. Decorate a baby's room with a sweet heart-shaped mirror, or add a round mirror with a kitten's silhouette in a child's room. Formalize your entryway, hall or dining area with Baroque-inspired framed mirrors. Decorate your living room with rustic framed, mirrored wall panels. Frame and surround yourself with your favorite memories. There's never a need to wonder how to perfectly set your images because collage frames do the work for you with a combination of horizontal and vertical frames attached to each other. From large-size frames for collectible posters to novelty word-shaped frames, your walls will be filled with uplifting decor. Personalized Wall Art Gift someone you love with a piece of art that's personalized. When ordering personalized wall art, you have the option of choosing a variety of messages. For example, for a housewarming gift, create a personalized street sign featuring a first or last name or even the name of a street stamped on metal. Give your music lover a guitar lounge sign shaped like a guitar pick and personalized with a first name. Celebrate family with a personalized home and family blessings canvas that features your last name. The options for personalizing wall art are only as limited as your imagination.Show moreElectrode, Comp-115863629, DC-prod-dal2, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-

Palmer transports the viewer within his reductive canvases, with the use of understated and abstract forms. Palmer's work depicts forms that hint at reference, but leave interpretation open to the viewer. ''Studying in Florence under Philip Rubinov-Jacobson gave me the opportunity to open the door to more free forms in my work and add the flexibility to allow the viewer to be an integral part,'' states Palmer. Through this interaction between the loose forms, one may recall past experiences. His paintings depict a residue of memory with the power to transport the viewer back in time. Palmer has studied at Santa Reparata International School of Art in Florence under Master Philip Rubinov-Jacobson and Roberto Venosa in Cadaques, Spain. One of Palmers' focuses today is the ability to share his art in areas of deeper meaning. Texas Children's Hospital chose Palmer as their featured artist in 2003 to work with the children to create six canvases to be auctioned for local charities. Palmer has exhibited his artwork throughout the United States and Europe. Read more....

Armed with some know how, a few small touches and Walmart's Every Day Low Prices on home furnishings and decor, you can breathe new life into your living space   whether it be with fresh furniture like a bedroom set or something functional like a new bookshelf. Spaced out: Your living room life Are you rethinking your current living room? A new television is always a nice addition, but you may want a new sofa, arm chair or accent table first. When considering what furniture to buy, think about the space you have available and the look you want for the room. Possibly the most important piece of furniture in your living room will be the sofa. If you have a lot of space to work with, look for a big sofa that can accommodate your family and guests. If you don't have much space, look for something more compact, possibly even a loveseat. For additional seating (again, depending on how much space you have), you can add a loveseat, recliner or armless chair. An accent table and an ottoman can add functionality and style too. If you don't have a lot of interior design experience and you want a consistent look throughout the room, consider getting a living room furniture set. Living room sets come with different pieces to fit different spaces, so you can choose one that best serves your needs. You can also refresh the look of the room with smaller changes. Try reframing your pictures, adding some wall art or getting a new slipcover for the couch if you don't want to buy a new sofa. Decorative accent pillows are a great, inexpensive way to give your living room some personality as well. Stackable modular storage cubes are a simple design solution and they're eco-friendly. Cubes are an excellent home organizer for your modern living space. Each one is separate so you can stack them side by side or on top of each other, or you can get creative and build a pyramid or ladder design. You can also mix and match the colors or just keep it simple with a single shade. Build a better bedroom Getting a new set of bedding is a great way to give your bedroom a quick makeover, while providing the warmth and comfort you need. When picking out bedding, consider the size of your mattress, the climate and weather where you live, the material you want and whether you'd prefer a bedding set or separates. Bedding comes in the same sizes as mattresses (single, double, twin, full, queen, king and so on) so it's easy to match your sheets and blankets to your mattress size. For colder weather, choose bedding that is thicker, like a down duvet or comforter, and consider flannel-weave sheets if you tend to get cold more easily. For warmer weather, look for lighter top bedding and percale-weave or silk sheets. Cotton is the most popular material for sheets, but there are many varieties to pick from, including Pima and Egyptian cottons, both of which are extremely comfortable and luxurious. You can also choose from a variety of weaves, including percale, which is very soft, smooth and shiny. Easy kitchen solutions Your kitchen and dining area make up the heart of your home. Let's face it, with three meals per day, you spend a lot of time there eating, not to mention the time it takes to prepare the meals. With kitchenware, dinnerware, kitchen furniture and more from Walmart, you can make these areas functional, welcoming spaces for the entire family. The kitchen can easily be made more inviting by adding a fresh coat of paint to the cabinets and walls. For finishing touches, get some color-coordinated kitchen towels or potholders, and place a new plant in the kitchen window. Keep your kitchen neat and organized with storage and organization products, including pantries, racks, cabinet and counter organizers and food storage containers. Handy products like these make it easier to find what you need when you need it, so you can prepare meals with less confusion and frustration. Complete sets of pots, pans and knives make cooking easier, whether you're prepping for your family or a crowd. And if you like to bake, it's worth stocking up on bakeware, so you always have what you need. Let there be lighting New window treatments and lighting can really pick up the atmosphere throughout your home. Choose window furnishings that add both color and style and let in the natural light from your outdoor surroundings. Then use accent lights to highlight your favorite keepsakes and add light fixtures that complement your decor.

Add your unique touch to your space with home decor itemsthere's a reason that being an interior decorator can be such a lucrative career. The ability to create unique spaces within people's homes that they love and that wows visitors is a gift. If you don t want to go the professional decorator route, you can still create a space that shows off your personal tastes and represents who you're as a person and that of your family. Walmart makes it easy to find just the right home decor items to make your home the showplace you want it to be, and we can help you do so while saving you money at the same time with our Every Day Low Prices.curtains and window treatmentsThe right curtains or window treatments really set off a room, such as a living room or bedroom. In addition to looking good, curtains and window treatments need to be functional as well, which is what may cause someone to favor one over the other. Curtains and drapes are a way to add color, style and depth to a room and can serve to showcase the windows of your home. They're available in many colors as well as materials, including linen, cotton, rayon, satin, polyester, silk and several different fabric blends. You can choose curtains and drapes that run from the ceiling to the floor to create the illusion of higher ceilings, or those that are just slightly larger than the window they're covering for a crisper look or if you have small children or pets at home that you don't want to play with longer curtains. When selecting curtains and drapes you need to know both the length and the width you need for the space, as well as if you want them to have tiebacks or have certain properties like odor neutralizing and energy efficiency.Another common window treatment is the use of blinds and shades. Blinds are especially functional because they make it easy to control how much light comes in through the windows, and you can adjust them depending on the time of day. Many shades are made from wood, wood composite or synthetic wood, but there are shades made from vinyl, metal and bamboo as well. Depending on the blinds, they generally rest inside the window frame, so you'll need to know the length and width of your window frame before selecting them as well as deciding whether you want vertical or horizontal blinds. Shades often work in conjunction with drapes or curtains and are ideal for keep sunlight out, especially on hot days. These also go inside the window frame. Choose cordless shades that pull down and raise with a quick tug when you don't want dangling cords.Lighting and light fixturesLighting options include permanent fixtures such as overhead lighting, wall fixtures and ceiling fan lights. Lamps are portable lights you can place anywhere and can range from table lamps to floor lamps. Permanent ceiling fixtures that you choose depend on the style you're seeking to match. For an Old World or traditional feel, you can select chandeliers or pendant lighting. For more modern touches, dome or flush mount lighting and track lighting are good options. Chandeliers look especially good above a dining table or in an entryway or hall. Many permanent fixtures allow you to control the amount of light put out through the use of a dimmer switch you can add. Ceiling fans with lights serve a dual purpose and allow you to run one without the other or both at the same time. Ceiling fans also help the heating and cooling units in your home be more efficient, giving you added cost savings on your energy bills.Lamps are often more decorative pieces and can fall under many distinctive style schemes. Many table lamps are modern-looking pieces with lots of metal, such as brushed nickel or stainless steel. More traditional-looking table lamps are available with ceramic and wooden bases. Most table lamps have lampshades, which can add a splash of color to the room. Floor lamps can blend into the background of a room or be a showpiece that draws attention. Place one in a corner for a warm lighting effect. You can mix or match lamps for a room, and some are even available in sets.RugsIf you have hardwood or vinyl flooring, a throw rug or area rug is a functional and stylish addition to any room. Many area rugs offer unique color schemes or designs that can set off a room. You can use these rugs to cover up bare areas of your floor, including high-traffic areas, or place them under furniture, such as dining tables and coffee tables, adding some stability and protecting your floors at the same time. You can also add accent rugs and runners to areas of your floor that you'd rather see covered or places where rugs would be more comfortable on your feet and that of your family and friends.Other decor itemsArtwork and wall decor can make plain wall spaces in your home come alive with color. You can choose from canvas wall art, wall decals or framed wall art, such as paintings and sketches. You can also add family portraits or framed pictures to make your wall spaces more personal. Mirrors, both wall hanging and floor standing, can add depth to a room and make it seem larger.If your sofa, loveseat or armchairs are lacking in vitality, a few colorful throw and decor pillows can liven them up. These pillows are also functional, making an evening of TV watching more comfortable. Pillows come in many sizes, although most are square, round or rectangle, and feature a variety of color and designs, such as stripes, floral, animal and graphic prints. Choose what you love best and what brings out the decor in your home.Show moreElectrode, Comp-147349563, DC-prod-dal2, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-

Choose the best options for your decorating needs by considering the wall space you want to fill. If your wall space is small, one piece of art will do. Larger spaces do best with a series of wall hangings or one large piece that serves as a focal point. Consider your existing decor when choosing art and wall decor. Vintage signs add appeal to a home that already has an antique flavor, for example. Sleek, minimalist art goes best with contemporary decor. Choose art and wall decor that reflects your taste and personality. If you love nature, create a garden on your walls. If you're more of a romantic, adorn your walls with red hearts and a sentimental quotation. Whether you go for canvas wall art, metal decor or vinyl wall decals, there's an abundance of pieces that speak to you at Walmart, where you'll find gorgeous artwork at Every Day Low Prices. Wall Art and Photography Invigorate your decor with new and exciting wall art and inspiring photography. From architecture and landscapes to still life displays and sports, you'll find canvas art, posters and photography in every subject you desire, framed or unframed, in sizes from less than 30 inches to over 100 inches in height and in various lengths to match. To hang wall art, let the shape of the wall help you determine the arrangement. For example, put a wall art set on a long horizontal wall, two pieces of art one over the other on a narrow vertical wall or one large piece of art between two windows on a wall. The design options are endless with wall art. Wall Art Sets Large wall spaces benefit from coordinated wall art sets. Eliminate the guesswork when it comes to coordinating color and style with art sets that do the pairings for you. Consider wall art sets that unite a space with one theme or one image that ties your room's decor together.  Floater-framed photography sets, which make the art look like it's floating in the frame, come in various configurations, sizes and numbers of pieces. Floater-framed staggered sets come in three pieces that make a statement across your wall, for example, while a floater-framed set of four pieces can create a more coordinated square pattern on your wall. Wrapped canvas sets of five pieces make it easy to hang photography printed on cotton canvas in fade-resistant inks. Sets of two oversized wall plaques of paintings, drawings and inspirational sayings hung side by side create symmetry. Metal Wall Art Turn your home into a gallery with sophisticated, rustic or whimsical metal wall art. Hang a set of three elegant wire poppies with vintage flair, dimensional wall art that makes it look like you attached vases of flowers on the wall or a contemporary radiating iron wire wall sculpture structure with multi-colored discs to add sparkle to your home. Wall Decals What better way is there to put up nail-free wall art than with decorative decals? From sports themes to wall murals and inspirational quotations to backsplash-style tiles, wall decals cover all types and sizes of wall spaces or emphasize smaller areas with a pop of color and curiosity. Today's wall decals are sophisticated enough to put in dining rooms and cute enough for nurseries, too. They look like customized wall murals or stencils, but they're much easier to remove and reposition thanks to easy peel-and-stick technology. Mirrors and Frames Mirrors are works of art, and they come in all shapes, sizes and finishes and in sets. Decorate a baby's room with a sweet heart-shaped mirror, or add a round mirror with a kitten's silhouette in a child's room. Formalize your entryway, hall or dining area with Baroque-inspired framed mirrors. Decorate your living room with rustic framed, mirrored wall panels. Frame and surround yourself with your favorite memories. There's never a need to wonder how to perfectly set your images because collage frames do the work for you with a combination of horizontal and vertical frames attached to each other. From large-size frames for collectible posters to novelty word-shaped frames, your walls will be filled with uplifting decor. Personalized Wall Art Gift someone you love with a piece of art that's personalized. When ordering personalized wall art, you have the option of choosing a variety of messages. For example, for a housewarming gift, create a personalized street sign featuring a first or last name or even the name of a street stamped on metal. Give your music lover a guitar lounge sign shaped like a guitar pick and personalized with a first name. Celebrate family with a personalized home and family blessings canvas that features your last name. The options for personalizing wall art are only as limited as your imagination.Show moreElectrode, Comp-167313236, DC-prod-dal2, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-

John Palmer Parker (May 1, 1790 – August 20, 1868) was the founder of the Parker Ranch on the island of Hawaiʻi in Hawaii.
Life[edit]
John Palmer Parker was born May 1, 1790 in Newton, Massachusetts. His father was Samuel Parker (1742–1822) and mother was Ann Palmer Parker (1753–1841).[1]:25
Parker arrived in Hawaii around 1809 by jumping off of a ship. John Parker came to the attention of King Kamehameha I, the chief who united the eight separate islands into the Kingdom of Hawaii, and was given important tasks by the king. John traveled to China during the War of 1812, returning to Hawaii in 1815. Having brought back with him a new, state-of-the-art American musket, Parker was given the privilege of being the first man allowed to shoot some of the thousands of feral cattle that roamed Hawaii’s remote plains and valleys. These animals were the descendants of one bull and five cows given by British Captain George Vancouver to Kamehameha as a gift in 1793.[1]:21
A year after he returned to Hawaii in 1815, he married Chiefess Kipikane (1800–1860), the granddaughter of Kamehameha I[1]:26 and daughter of Kahiwa Kanekapolei.[2] Kipikane took the Christian name Rachel. She bore John a daughter Mary Ann Kaulalani (1819–1859) and two sons Ebenezer (1829–1855) and John Palmer Kamaikaaloa Kalanioku (1827–1900). The Parker dynasty figured in the next two centuries of Hawaiian history.[1]:25 The family first settled at a small farm in the Kohala district. In 1835 he was hired by Honolulu merchant William French to start a commercial operation selling products of the wild cattle near the present town of Waimea. With his New England education, Parker became accountant of French's business and managed a store called Puʻuloa.[3]
Beef from these cattle was salted and sold to whaling vessels. Live cattle were driven down to the harbor at Kawaihae and shipped to Honolulu. Meat, animal products, and hides were shipped to South America and the United States. Salted beef eventually replaced the increasingly scarce sandalwood as the island’s chief export. On January 8, 1847, Parker acquired some land in the remote uplands of Mauna Kea at about 3,500 feet (1,100 m) elevation at 19°59′48″N 155°33′29″W﻿ / ﻿19.99667°N 155.55806°W﻿ / 19.99667; -155.55806﻿ ("Mānā") called Mānā.[4] Mānā means "arid" in the Hawaiian language.[5]
The first Parker homestead was a small cottage called Hale Mānā ('Dry House') at this site. After the Great Mahele allowed private land ownership, he purchased 640 acres (2.6 km2) around Mānā in 1850 and another thousand acres in 1851. More land was leased from King Kamehameha III, and the ranch continued to grow.[1]:151 Over time Parker switched from hunting wild animals to domesticating and raising them in fenced paddocks.[3]
His son John Palmer II married Hawaiian Hanai on October 6, 1845, and then after her death, Leiakaula on January 3, 1865.[6] Ebenezer married Kilia June 7, 1849.[7]
Parker also developed orchards and a dairy operation. Despite the death of his son Ebenezer in 1855 and a drought in 1856, he added yet more land in the area known as Paʻauhau by 1861. After his first wife Kipikane died, he married another Hawaiian woman named Leiakaula. His health began to fail in 1867. Parker died August 20, 1868 on Oʻahu and was buried back at the family cemetery near Hale Mānā. He was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners at the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in 2008.[8] The ranch would be inherited by John Palmer II and Ebenezer's son Samuel Parker (only 15 years old at the time). John Palmer II took over operation of the ranch, although he was appointed to the upper House of Nobles in the legislature of the Hawaiian Kingdom in 1873.[9] Grandson Samuel became more active in politics, so after John II's death Alfred Wellington Carter became ranch manager.

You want a real financial expert. You also want an expert you can trust.


Registration: Only Registered Investment Advisors (firms) and Investment Advisor Representatives (professionals) can provide financial advice and ongoing services for fees.


Type of Registration: RIAs with less than $100 million of assets register with your state’s Securities Commissioner. RIAs with more than $100 million of assets register with the Securities and Exchange Commission.


Industry Licenses: These licenses permit advisors to sell investment and insurance products for commissions.
