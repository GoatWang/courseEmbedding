Zacks Rank:



 




Style Scores:



NA Value | NA Growth | NA Momentum | NA VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

FNCB Bancorp, Inc. Reports Third Quarter 2016 Net IncomeBack to FNCB Snapshot

Share Story4:05PM ET 10/28/2016 Globe NewswireDUNMORE, Pa., Oct.  28, 2016  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FNCB Bancorp, Inc. (OTCQX: FNCB), the parent company of Dunmore-based FNCB Bank (the "Bank"), announced net income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 of $2.0 million, or $0.12 per basic and diluted share. Net income for the comparable period of 2015 was $2.3 million, or $0.14 per basic and diluted share. The $0.3 million, or 13.7%, decrease in third quarter earnings primarily reflected increases in income tax expense and non-interest expense, partially mitigated by higher net interest income. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $4.8 million, or $0.29 per basic and diluted share, compared to net income of $6.6 million, or $0.40 per basic and diluted share, for the same period of 2015. Annualized return on average assets was 0.73% and 0.58%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 0.91% and 0.90%, for the respective periods of 2015. Annualized return on average equity was 8.46% and 6.95%, respectively, for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, compared to 16.38% and 15.96%, respectively, for the comparable periods in 2015. FNCB paid holders of its common stock dividends of $0.02 for the third quarter of 2016, totaling $0.06 per share for the year-to-date period of 2016. FNCB did not pay a dividend during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.
Effective October 17, 2016, the corporate name, formerly First National Community Bancorp, Inc., changed to FNCB Bancorp, Inc., following the completion of a charter conversion of FNCB Bank, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, from a national bank to a Pennsylvania state bank. Performance Highlights: Year-over-year deposit growth of 9.3%;Year-over-year growth in net interest income of $3.0 million, or 15.4%;7 basis point improvement in tax-equivalent net interest margin comparing the third quarters of 2016 and 2015; and11.8% decrease in non-performing loans from prior quarter end; 64.1% decrease from one year ago."We are pleased with the strong, double-digit growth in net interest income given this very challenging rate environment," stated Gerard A. Champi, President and Chief Executive Officer. "In addition, through the diligent efforts of our entire banking team, we posted meaningful, organic deposit growth, while maintaining funding costs, during the third quarter of 2016. The launch of our new WOW ME suite of consumer checking and savings products earlier in the year has led to increases in personal demand deposits, while initiatives in our governmental banking, retail and commercial divisions resulted in strong deposit growth in public funds and small business accounts," concluded Champi. Summary Results for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Net interest income before (credit) provision for loan and lease losses was $7.7 million for the third quarter, an increase of $0.5 million compared to $7.2 million for the same quarter of 2015. The 6.9% increase in net interest income reflected strong growth in volume and yields on earning assets aided by stable funding costs. For the year-to-date period, net interest income grew $3.0 million, or 15.4%, to $22.8 million in 2016 from $19.8 million in 2015. The improvement for the year-to-date period resulted primarily from significant growth in earning assets, higher earning asset yields and reduced funding costs. Average earning assets grew $42.3 million, or 4.4%, and $69.9 million, or 7.5%, comparing the quarter and year-to-date periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Tax-equivalent earning asset yields improved 8 basis points for the third quarter and 7 basis points for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 over the same periods of 2015. FNCB's cost of funds increased 1 basis point comparing the third quarters of 2016 and 2015. However, comparing the nine-month periods, FNCB's cost of funds decreased 16 basis points to 0.50% in 2016 from 0.66% in 2015. Causing the greatest impact in year-to-date funding costs was a decrease in the cost of borrowed funds, which resulted from a modification of the interest rate on FNCB's subordinated notes from 9.00% to 4.50% in mid-2015. The tax-equivalent net interest margin for third quarter 2016 was 3.14%, which reflected no change from the second quarter of 2016, and a 7 basis point increase over the margin for the same prior year period. The year-to-date tax-equivalent net interest margin was 3.13% in 2016, an improvement of 20 basis points compared to 2.93% in 2015. Non-interest income was $1.4 million for both three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Higher net gains on the sale of mortgage loans, net gains on the sale of SBA guaranteed loans and other income were offset by reductions in service charges, loan-related fees and net gains on the sale of other real estate owned. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, non-interest income totaled $4.8 million, a decrease of $1.5 million, or 24.2%, compared to $6.3 million for the same nine months of 2015. The change resulted primarily from a $1.3 million decrease in net gains on the sale of securities, coupled with a $0.2 million reduction in other income related to legal settlements received in 2015. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, non-interest expense totaled $6.6 million, an increase of $0.1 million, or 2.2%, from $6.4 million for the same three months of 2015. The increase for the third quarter 2016 was due primarily to advertising expense related to new deposit product offerings. On a year-to-date basis, non-interest expense increased $0.5 million, or 2.5%, to $20.4 million in 2016 from $19.9 million in 2015.  The increase in non-interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period of 2015 was due primarily to increases in salaries and benefits expenses of $0.8 million due to higher health insurance costs, partially offset by a $0.4 million reduction in occupancy expense. Asset Quality  FNCB continues to realize an improvement in asset quality as total non-performing loans decreased $0.3 million, or 11.8%, to $2.4 million at September 30, 2016 from $2.7 million at June 30, 2016, and $1.4 million, or 36.2%, from December 31, 2015. The ratio of non-performing loans to total loans was 0.33% at September 30, 2016 compared to 0.37% at June 30, 2016 and 0.52% at December 31, 2015. (At June 30, 2016, the most recent data available, the FDIC average for commercial banks with assets between $1.0 billion and $3.0 billion was 0.79%). The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of gross loans was 1.17% at September 30, 2016, which was unchanged compared to the prior quarter end, and 1.21% at the end of 2015. (The above described FDIC peer group average was 1.22% at June 30, 2016.) Financial Condition Total assets increased $31.0 million, or 2.8%, to $1.122 billion at September 30, 2016 from $1.091 billion at December 31, 2015. The change in total assets primarily resulted from an increase of $36.3 million in cash and cash equivalents. Total deposits increased $109.4 million, or 13.3%, to $931.0 million at September 30, 2016 from $821.5 million at year-end 2015. The deposit growth resulted primarily from a cyclical influx of public funds from seasonal tax payments during the third quarter. In addition, deposit gathering initiatives in FNCB's commercial and governmental banking units, coupled with the new WOW ME product offering also favorably impacted deposit growth.  The inflow of cash from deposit growth was used to repay borrowings from the FHLB of Pittsburgh, which declined $77.0 million, or 56.7%, when comparing September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. In addition, accrued interest payable decreased $10.9 million, or 97.4%, as FNCB repaid in entirety all accrued interest that had previously been deferred on the subordinated debentures in the first quarter of 2016. Payoffs of several large commercial loan relationships outpaced demand, which resulted in a $4.1 million, or 0.6%, decline in loans, net of net deferred costs and unearned income. Investment securities available for sale increased $9.7 million, or 3.8%. Total shareholders' equity increased $10.4 million, or 12.1%, to $96.6 million at September 30, 2016 from $86.2 million at December 31, 2015. The capital improvement resulted primarily from a $6.2 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income, which resulted from appreciation in the fair value of available-for-sale securities net of the tax impact of the appreciation, coupled with net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $4.8 million. At September 30, 2016, FNCB's total risk-based capital and Tier I leverage ratios were 12.37% and 7.52%, respectively. The respective ratios for the Bank at September 30, 2016 were 13.40% and 9.05%. The ratios well exceeded the 10.00% and 5.00% required to be well capitalized under the prompt corrective action provisions of the Basel III capital framework for U.S. banking organizations. Book value per share increased $0.59 per share, or 11.3%, to $5.81 at September 30, 2016 from $5.22 at December 31, 2015.

FNCB Bancorp, Inc. Reports 2016 Earnings of $6.3 MillionBack to FNCB Snapshot

Share Story4:52PM ET 1/26/2017 Globe NewswireDUNMORE, Pa., Jan.  26, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FNCB Bancorp, Inc. (OTCQX: FNCB) ("FNCB"), the parent company of Dunmore-based FNCB Bank (the "Bank"), today reported net income of $6.3 million, or $0.38 per basic and diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $1.5 million, or $0.09 per basic and diluted share.
2016 HIGHLIGHTS             
FNCB reported net income for the fourth consecutive fiscal year. Cumulative net income for fiscal years 2013 through 2016 totaled $62.0 million.
Net interest income increased $3.1 million, or 11.5%, to $30.5 million in 2016 from $27.4 million in 2015.  
Total assets increased $104.8 million to $1.2 billion at December 31, 2016 from $1.1 billion at December 31, 2015, an increase of 9.6%.
Total deposits increased $193.6 million, or 23.6%, to $1.0 billion at year-end 2016 from $821.5 million at year-end 2015.
Non-performing assets decreased $0.5 million, or 7.2%, from $6.9 million at December 31, 2015 to $6.4 million at the close of 2016.
FNCB paid $10.9 million deferred interest on subordinated debt in March 2016 and accelerated the payment of $4.0 million in principal on the subordinated debt due September 1, 2017 to December 1, 2016.
FNCB resumed quarterly shareholder dividend payments in March 2016, and declared and paid dividends throughout the remainder of 2016.
FNCB reinstated its dividend reinvestment and optional cash purchase plans in June 2016.
FNCB declared a fourth quarter 2016 dividend of $0.03 per share, an increase of 50.0% compared to the $0.02 per share dividend declared for the third quarter of 2016.
FNCB's tangible book value improved 4.0% to $5.42 per share at December 31, 2016 from $5.21 per share at December 31, 2015.
The Bank successfully completed a conversion from a federal charter to a state charter in the second quarter 2016.

"We are pleased with the continued success of our Company in 2016," stated Gerard A. Champi, President and Chief Executive Officer. "We were able to deliver strong balance sheet growth and solid core-banking performance as evidenced by a double-digit increase in net interest income. We believe that the achievements we've made over the past four years have allowed us to create value for our shareholders, including growth in book value and the reinstatement of quarterly dividend payments as well as the dividend reinvestment and optional cash purchase plans," continued Champi. "We are optimistic as we enter 2017 with the announcement of our planned expansion into the Lehigh Valley marketplace through the opening of a loan production office. We are excited to begin offering FNCB's community bank brand and commitment to unsurpassed customer service to the Lehigh Valley," concluded Champi.     
Net income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $35.8 million, or $2.17 per basic and diluted share. For the fourth quarter of 2015, FNCB recorded net income of $29.2 million, or $1.77, per basic and diluted common share. FNCB's 2015 earnings performance was significantly impacted by the non-recurring reversal of a deferred tax asset ("DTA") valuation allowance, which resulted in tax benefits of $27.7 million and $27.8 million in the consolidated statement of income for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2015, respectively.
For the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2016, dividends declared and paid were $0.03 and $0.09 per share, respectively. The dividend payout ratio for 2016 was 23.7% and equaled a 1.5% annual return to shareholders based on the closing stock price of $6.05 per share at December 31, 2016. FNCB did not pay any dividends in 2015.
Return on average assets and return on average shareholders' equity were 0.57% and 6.82%, respectively, in 2016, compared to 3.57% and 63.24%, respectively, in 2015. For the three months ended December 31, 2016, return on average assets and return on average shareholders' equity were 0.55% and 6.43%, respectively, compared to 10.99% and 192.68%, respectively, for the same three months of 2015.  Return on average assets and return on average shareholders' equity for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 were significantly impacted by the non-recurring $27.8 million tax benefit detailed above.
Summary Results for 2016
Net interest income before the credit for loan and lease losses increased $3.2 million, or 11.5%, to $30.6 million in 2016 from $27.4 million in 2015. The improvement in net interest income reflected a $2.5 million increase in interest income, coupled with a $0.6 million, or 12.6%, reduction in interest expense, in 2016 compared to 2015. The 7.9% increase in interest income in 2016 was largely due to an increase in average earning assets of $58.4 million, or 6.2%, to $1.0 billion in 2016 from $942.1 million in 2015. Specifically, average loans increased $35.0 million, or 5.0%, to $731.6 million in 2016 from $696.6 million in 2015, while average investment securities increased $34.4 million, or 15.1%, to $261.8 million in 2016 from $227.4 million in 2015. The 12.6% reduction in interest expense was due primarily to an 11 basis point reduction in FNCB's cost of funds to 0.50% in 2016 from 0.61% in 2015.  In 2016, FNCB realized a full year of the effect of its $11.0 million principal payment and a 450 basis point rate modification of its subordinated debentures, which was completed on June 30, 2015. As a result, interest expense on its subordinated debentures decreased $0.8 million, or 56.9%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. Overall, the average cost of borrowed funds decreased 59 basis points to 1.42% in 2016 from 2.01% in 2015. FNCB anticipates further reductions in borrowing costs in 2017 as a result of its accelerated repayment of $4.0 million in principal on its subordinated debentures which had a stated due date of September 1, 2017, but was paid by FNCB on December 1, 2016. FNCB's tax-equivalent margin improved 14 basis points to 3.13% in 2016 from 2.99% in 2015. The margin improvement reflected the growth in average earning assets, as well as the positive effects of the reduced cost of borrowing funds.
Non-interest income decreased $1.6 million to $6.2 million in 2016 from $7.8 million in 2015. The 20.5% decrease was largely due to a $1.3 million, or 58.2%, decrease in net gains on the sale of investment securities.
Total non-interest expense decreased $0.9 million, or 3.2%, to $27.6 million in 2016 from $28.5 million in 2015. The decrease primarily reflected $0.8 million in non-recurring legal settlements that were accrued in 2015, coupled with decreases in occupancy costs of $0.5 million, or 22.2%, regulatory assessments of $0.2 million, or 23.3%, and insurance expense of $0.1 million, or 21.7%. Partially offsetting these decreases were increases in salaries and benefits of $0.5 million, equipment expense of $0.1 million, or 4.5%, and bank shares tax of $0.1 million, or 18.6%. The improvement in net interest income, and reduced expense levels, are reflected in an improvement in FNCB's efficiency ratio to 75.49% in 2016 from 84.70% in 2015.
Improved Asset Quality 
Asset quality continued to improve in 2016, reflecting FNCB's continued focus on sound problem credit resolutions and commitment to disciplined credit risk management. Total non-performing assets decreased $0.5 million, or 7.2%, to $6.4 million at December 31, 2016 from $6.9 million at December 31, 2015. Decreases in non-performing loans, including non-accruing troubled debt restructurings, of $1.6 million and other real estate owned ("OREO") of $1.1 million were partially offset by an increase in other non-performing assets of $2.2 million. Other non-performing assets include a classified account receivable secured by a letter of credit and foreclosed equipment.
The ratio of non-performing loans to total loans improved 21 basis points, or 40.4%, to 0.31% at December 31, 2016, compared to 0.52% at December 31, 2015. The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.15% at December 31, 2016 compared to 1.20% at the end of 2015. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2016 was 0.21%, compared to 0.20% for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Financial Position
Total assets increased $104.8 million, or 9.6%, to $1.2 billion at December 31, 2016 from $1.1 billion at December 31, 2015. The balance sheet growth primarily reflected an increase in total deposits of $193.6 million, or 23.6%, a portion of which was used to repay $77.3 million in FHLB advances, accelerate the $4.0 million principal payment on the subordinated debentures, and fund net increases in loans, net of deferred costs and unearned income, and investment securities of $0.6 million and $18.9 million, respectively. With regard to the increase in total deposits, specifically, non-interest-bearing demand accounts increased $19.2 million, or 12.4%, and interest-bearing deposits increased $174.4 million, or 26.2% comparing December 31, 2016 and 2015. The increase in non-interest-bearing demand deposits is primarily attributable to growth in business checking accounts, while growth in municipal deposits contributed to the increase in interest-bearing deposits.
Total shareholders' equity improved $4.0 million, or 4.6%, to $90.1 million at December 31, 2016 from $86.2 million at the end of 2015, which resulted primarily from net income for 2016 of $6.3 million, partially offset by a $1.5 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss resulting from depreciation in the market value, net of tax, of FNCB's available-for-sale securities, due to changes in market interest rates. Also affecting shareholders' equity were dividends declared and paid of $1.5 million, common shares issued through the dividend reinvestment and optional cash purchase plans of $0.4 million and stock-based compensation of $0.3 million.
FNCB's total risk-based capital ratio and the Tier 1 leverage ratio improved to 12.06% and 7.53%, respectively, at December 31, 2016, from 11.79% and 7.27%, respectively, at December 31, 2015. The ratios exceeded the 10.00% and 5.00% required to be well capitalized under the prompt corrective action provisions of the Basel III capital framework for U.S. Banking organizations, which became effective for the Company and the Bank on January 1, 2016.
