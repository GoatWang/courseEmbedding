Managed Account

What is a 'Managed Account'
A managed account is an investment account that is owned by an individual investor and overseen by a hired professional money manager. In contrast to mutual funds, which are professionally managed on behalf of many mutual-fund holders, managed accounts are personalized investment portfolios tailored to the specific needs of the account holder. With a mutual fund, the fund company hires a money manager who looks after investments in the fund's portfolio and may alter the fund's holdings in accordance with its objectives.

      
BREAKING DOWN 'Managed Account'
      A managed account may hold assets, cash or title to property for the benefit of the client. The manager may buy and sell assets without the client’s prior approval, as long as the manager acts according to the client’s objectives. Because a managed account involves fiduciary duty, the manager must act in the best interest of the client, or potentially face civil or criminal penalties.Similarities and Differences Between Managed Accounts and Mutual FundsManaged accounts and mutual funds help diversify an investor’s portfolio. Pools of money are invested over a variety of securities that are actively managed by professional managers.However, with a managed account, the investor puts in money, and the manager purchases and places physical shares of securities in the account. The account holder owns the securities and may have the manager sell them as desired. In contrast, mutual funds are classified by investors’ risk tolerance and the funds’ investment objectives, not by individual preferences. For example, an investor with an aggressive growth profile may purchase volatile stocks, whereas a conservative investor may purchase safer investments. Also, investors purchasing shares of a mutual fund own a percentage of the value of the fund, not the fund itself.With a managed account, days may pass before the manager has the money fully invested. Also, managers may liquidate securities at specific times only. Conversely, shares of mutual funds may typically be purchased and redeemed as desired.When owning a managed account, the manager may attempt to offset gains and losses by buying and selling assets when it is the most tax-efficient time to do so. This may result in little or no tax liability. In contrast, mutual fund shareholders owe taxes on capital gains when portfolio managers sell underlying stocks for a profit. Therefore, shareholders have no control over when capital gains are realized.Example of a Managed AccountIn July 2016, the use of managed accounts was increasing as institutional investors withdrew from hedge funds due to disapproval of fees, returns and transparency. The investors wanted broader platforms, customized strategies, full control over their separate accounts, daily valuation, significantly lower fees and full transparency of portfolio holdings.The Alaska Permanent Fund Corp. in Juneau redeemed $2 billion in hedge funds to invest in a managed account so that investment choices would be made in-house. Likewise, the Iowa Public Employees’ Retirement System in Des Moines was setting up plans for moving investments to managed accounts with seven firms.

Past performance is not an indication of future performance. Diversification and asset allocation help you spread risk throughout your portfolio, so investments that do poorly may be balanced by others that do relatively better. Diversification and asset allocation do not ensure profit or protect against loss.

Important Information

 

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses which may be obtained by visiting the iShares Fund and BlackRock Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.


The fund is actively managed and its characteristics will vary. Stock and bond values fluctuate in price so the value of your investment can go down depending on market conditions. International investing involves special risks including, but not limited to political risks, currency fluctuations, illiquidity and volatility. These risks may be heightened for investments in emerging markets. Fixed income risks include interest-rate and credit risk. Typically, when interest rates rise, there is a corresponding decline in bond values. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the bond issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments. Principal of mortgage- or asset-backed securities normally may be prepaid at any time, reducing the yield and market value of those securities. Obligations of US govt. agencies are supported by varying degrees of credit but generally are not backed by the full faith and credit of the US govt. Non-investment-grade debt securities (high-yield/junk bonds) may be subject to greater market fluctuations, risk of default or loss of income and principal than higher rated securities. Investments in emerging markets may be considered speculative and are more likely to experience hyperinflation and currency devaluations, which adversely affect returns. In addition, many emerging securities markets have lower trading volumes and less liquidity. The fund may use derivatives to hedge its investments or to seek to enhance returns. Derivatives entail risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and increase volatility.  Morningstar Analyst Rating™is not a credit or risk rating. It is a subjective evaluation performed by Morningstar’s manager research group, which consists of various Morningstar, Inc. subsidiaries (“Manager Research Group”). In the United States, that subsidiary is Morningstar Research Services LLC, which is registered with and governed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The Manager Research Group evaluates funds based on five key pillars, which are process, performance, people, parent, and price. The Manager Research Group uses this five pillar evaluation to determine how they believe funds are likely to perform relative to a benchmark, or in the case of exchange-traded funds and index mutual funds, a relevant peer group, over the long term on a risk-adjusted basis. They consider quantitative and qualitative factors in their research, and the weight of each pillar may vary. The Analyst Rating scale is Gold, Silver, Bronze, Neutral, and Negative. A Morningstar Analyst Rating of Gold, Silver, or Bronze reflects the Manager Research Group’s conviction in a fund’s prospects for outperformance. Analyst Ratings ultimately reflect the Manager Research Group’s overall assessment, are overseen by an Analyst Rating Committee, and are continuously monitored and reevaluated at least every 14 months. For more detailed information about Morningstar’s Analyst Rating, including its methodology, please go to global.morningstar.com/managerdisclosures/. The Morningstar Analyst Rating (i) should not be used as the sole basis in evaluating a fund, (ii) involves unknown risks and uncertainties which may cause Analyst expectations not to occur or to differ significantly from what they expected, and (iii) should not be considered an offer or solicitation to buy or sell the fund.


Performance results reflect past performance and are no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value of shares will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. All returns assume reinvestment of all dividends. Performance information shown without sales charge would have been lower if the applicable sales charge had been included. Performance during periods of exceptional market conditions should not be expected to be repeated in a normal market environment. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.Fund details, holdings and characteristics are as of the date noted and subject to change. Yields are based on income earned for the period cited and on the Fund's NAV at the end of the period. Some BlackRock funds make distributions of ordinary income and capital gains at calendar year end. Those distributions temporarily cause extraordinarily high yields. There is no assurance that a fund will repeat that yield in the future. Subsequent monthly distributions that do not include ordinary income or capital gains in the form of dividends will likely be lower.


The Funds are distributed by BlackRock Investments, LLC (together with its affiliates, “BlackRock”).

Managed Accounts










The Benefits of Managed Accounts
Separately managed accounts (SMAs) are the investment vehicle of choice among high net worth individuals seeking sophisticated investment solutions and direct ownership of securities in their accounts.
Establishing an SMA is a consultative process. SMA investors typically work with their Financial Professionals to establish personal objectives and investment plans. SMA owners also may have access to the portfolio manager, a service usually reserved for institutional clients.  A higher level of service than other retail investment solutions is typical, and may include periodic reports summarizing account activity and performance, as well as in-person meetings, conference calls and written commentaries.
Unlike mutual funds, exchange traded funds and other pooled vehicles, SMA investors can:

Impose reasonable investment restrictions on the management of their accounts
Impose reasonable limits on the amount of gains or losses recognized in their accounts

Why BlackRock ManagedAccount Strategies?
Our scale provides more resources working for you. BlackRock is one of the largest managers of SMAs with $72.5 billion in assets under management (AUM).* And, as a fiduciary, we are committed to our relationship with you.

Conning Launches Second Series of CLO-Focused  Separately Managed Accounts 
 
HARTFORD, CT – December 29, 2016 – Conning, a leading global investment management firm, has announced the recent launch of the second series of CLOQ (“CLOQ 2”), its separately managed accounts focused on investment grade tranches of collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”). This mandate, sub-advised by Octagon Credit Investors, LLC (“Octagon”), a specialized credit manager and Conning subsidiary, follows the initial series launched earlier this year.
Conning’s CLOQ series of separate accounts are designed as a portfolio solution for insurers and offer access to a diversified portfolio of AAA, AA, and A-rated CLO debt securities. 
“Conning’s success with CLOQ 2 demonstrates Conning’s insurance expertise and the value that Octagon brings as an accomplished manager in this asset class,” said Mike Haylon, Head of Asset Management Sales, Marketing, and Insurance Research at Conning. “We believe investment grade CLO debt is an attractive asset class for many insurance investors in today’s market, offering income enhancement, floating interest rates, low capital charges and a history of very low credit losses.” 
“We are very pleased with the interest we have seen from insurers and other investors in this strategy,” said Doug McDermott, a Managing Director, Business & Product Development at Octagon. “As we head into the new year, we anticipate growing demand for similar investment solutions and expect to complete a number of these programs in 2017.”
As of November 30, 2016, Octagon manages $14.2 billion in assets, including separately managed accounts, CLOs and private credit funds.
ABOUT CONNING®
Conning (www.conning.com) is a leading global investment management firm with approximately $120 billion in global assets under management as of September 30, 2016.*  With a long history of serving the insurance industry, Conning supports institutional investors, including pension plans, with investment solutions and asset management offerings, award-winning risk modeling software, and industry research. Founded in 1912, Conning has offices in Boston, Cologne, Hartford, Hong Kong, London, New York, and Tokyo.
*As of September 30, 2016, represents the combined global assets under management for the affiliated firms under Conning Holdings Limited, and Cathay Securities Investment Trust Co., Ltd. ("SITE"). SITE reports internally into Conning Asia Pacific Limited, but is a separate legal entity under Cathay Financial Holding Co., Ltd. which is the ultimate controlling parent of all Conning entities.

                Wrap It Up: Terms And Benefits Of Managed Money            


    By James E. McWhinney | Updated July 11, 2016 — 12:35 PM EDT

The definition of wrap account was created to refer to a product offering a multitude of services "wrapped" in a single fee. When the wrap business was a rather obscure, niche product used primarily by sophisticated institutional investors and ultra-high net-worth individual investors, everyone involved in the wrap industry understood the terminology and the product's benefits. Since then, however, the wrap industry has broadened to a wider market. Here we look at these changes as well as the benefits and vehicles of "wrapped" services. (For more information, read The Rap On Wrap Fees For Retirement Accounts.)
TUTORIAL: Stock Basics
Evolution of Wrap and Brokerage VocabularyWhen advances in technology reduced the minimum required investment, the wrap account became available to an audience of affluent retail investors. This new constituency was unfamiliar with the product's benefits, so "wrap account" was replaced with the more descriptive managed-money (account). The change in terminology focused more on communicating the product's benefits as well as its price structure (fees are still fully disclosed).
The creation of the wrap account caused changes also in the traditional language of the brokerage industry. Various factions of the investment advisory business still debate the use and appropriateness of the titles "broker" and "advisor", but the underlying economics of the debate are undisputed. The traditional definition of the term "broker" refers to an investment professional who helps match buyers and sellers in exchange for a commission. The size of a traditional broker's paycheck is based on the volume of transactions brokered, so, if no trades take place, the broker doesn't get paid, regardless of whether he or she provided any investment advice to clients.
This role of the broker changed, however, as some brokers started to offer wrap accounts, requiring them to manage money as well as complete client transactions. Thus, brokers took on the responsibilities of advisors, not only completing transactions (a service that on its own does not regard the assets currently within the client's account) but also providing portfolio management.
When an investment professional, whether a broker or advisor, works with managed-money products, he or she is paid a flat fee based on the assets under management. This fee is recurring regardless of the number of transactions that take place in the investor's account. Fee-based investing, as this business model is called, compensates investment professionals for the advice they provide, not for the number of transactions that they generate. (For more, read Full-Service Brokerage Or DIY?)
Benefits of Managed MoneyWhen you invest in fee-based products, you receive the benefit of ongoing consultation with a professional financial advisor in exchange for a predictable fee. The advisor is responsible for managing your financial plan, which includes examining your overall financial situation, determining your risk tolerance, helping you set goals, recommending an asset allocation that is appropriate for your goals, assisting with investment selection and monitoring your portfolio and the progress toward your goals.
Because the advisor is paid based on a percentage of assets under management, he or she has a personal stake in the success of your portfolio. For example, if your advisor's fee is 1% and your portfolio contains $100,000, he or she earns $1,000 per year. If your portfolio grows to $200,000, that same 1% fee is now worth $2,000. Clearly, the advisor has a financial incentive to seek out the best available products instead of only selling those that pay the highest commissions. This arrangement lessens the investor's concern over churning, and ensures that advisors play for the same team as their clients - both client and advisor stand to win if the portfolio grows in value.
Managed-Money Investment Vehicles There are five primary investment vehicles in the managed-money environment, each offering different features and benefits. The particulars of each vary based on the firm providing the services, but here are the general categories:
Traditional Managed- or Separate-Account Programs
		Unlike mutual funds, where many investors pool their assets to access the services of a professional money manager, traditional managed-account programs (also known as "separate accounts") allow investors to contract the services of a professional money manager for an account that is separate and distinct from the accounts of other investors. These services include significant tax management and portfolio customization. Investment decisions are based on the investor's individual needs, not on the generic needs of a portfolio designed to represent a pool of investors that may number well into the thousands. (For further reading, see The Quest To Build A Unified Managed Account.)
		Mutual-Fund Advisory Programs		The term "mutual fund wrap" has largely been replaced by "mutual fund advisory program" to describe a portfolio of mutual funds selected to match a preset asset allocation model appropriate for an investor's goals, offered in a single investment account together with the services of a professional investment advisor. The account is automatically rebalanced to maintain the asset allocation model, and provides consolidated performance reporting regardless of the number of mutual funds in the model. A variety of asset allocation models are available with equity-to-fixed-income proportions, such as 100% equity, 80/20, 60/40, 50/50, 40/60, 20/80 or 100% fixed income. A professional financial advisor works with the investor to determine which asset allocation model is appropriate for the investor's goals, risk tolerance, time horizon, etc., and provides ongoing guidance in the pursuit of the investor's financial objectives.
		Fee-based Brokerage Accounts		Unlimited trading with no commission fees makes the fee-based brokerage account an attractive tool for frequent traders. The fee includes ongoing guidance of a professional financial advisor, and provides a measure of comfort for the do-it-yourselfer who prefers a bit of expert assistance.
		Multi-Discipline Accounts		Multi-discipline accounts combine the services of multiple separate account managers into a single portfolio. This portfolio offers all the benefits of a traditional managed-account portfolio - and more - at reduced investment minimums. Activities across each of the different managers of the portfolio are coordinated by an overlay manger to maintain compliance with the wash-sale rule and minimize capital gains tax liabilities.
		ETF Wraps		ETF wraps are one of the latest entrants to the managed-money arena and are similar to mutual fund wraps but use exchange-traded funds instead of mutual funds as their investment vehicles. Since ETFs have lower expense ratios than mutual funds, ETF wraps have a strong appeal to cost-conscious investors.
Is Managed Money Right for You?Managed money offers a degree of tax efficiency, flexibility, convenience and peace of mind that few other investment options can provide. These features have made fee-based investing and managed-money investment vehicles quite popular among affluent, tax-sensitive investors. But these vehicles still pose some complexity that makes them unsuitable for a large part of the public. Before going ahead with managed money, find out if it's right for your portfolio by consulting a professional financial advisor.

In banking, a managed account is a fee-based investment management product for high-net-worth individuals. The main appeal for wealthy individuals is the access to professional money managers, a high degree of customization and greater tax efficiencies in a fee-based product. They are not to be confused with managed bank accounts such as thinkmoney, e-money accounts and basic bank accounts, all of which are consumer banking products in the UK.[1][2]
Managed accounts started as separately managed accounts (SMAs) and have since evolved into multiple strategy accounts (MSAs) and the rapidly emerging unified managed accounts (UMAs). There is broad agreement that managed accounts provide the added benefits of greater transparency, liquidity and control.[3]
Managed account minimums and the cost to operate managed account programs have steadily dropped as technology helps with efficiency and scale. Increasingly, managed account products are seeing interest from the "mass affluent" as well.
The retail managed accounts industry was sized at $1.70 trillion in 3Q 2009.[4] Managed Accounts are typically offered by global investment banks and specialist investment firms.
