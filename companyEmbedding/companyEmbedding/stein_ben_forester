DMH Spotlight

 - Oh Andrew Stein! 


Back




 




Diana Mara Henry photographed Andrew Stein's marriage to his second wife, Lynn Forester, a lawyer, in 1983. The wedding cake was constructed to look like the statue of liberty. 




 




Bobby Short played piano at the wedding. Laurie Benjamin standing beside Andrew Stein. 




 



Andrew Stein and Lynn Forester posing for the press in the lobby of the building where their wedding reception was held. Other guests photographed by Diana Mara Henry at the reception included Barbara Walters, Roy Cohn, Walter Mondale, Donald Trump, Ron Perlman, Sidney Zion...The reception was at the home of Edward Reynolds Downe, Jr. Downe was eventually convicted of wire fraud, filing false income tax returns, and securities fraud. Wikipedia says Stein is "a New York City political figure who served as the last president of the New York City Council. By this marriage, he has two stepchildren, Ben and Jake Stein. Forrester is currently married to the British financier Evelyn Robert de Rothschild....Sir Evelyn and his family live at Ascott House, a country estate owned by the National Trust in Buckinghamshire about 46 miles north of London."
