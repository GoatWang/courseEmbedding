OverviewCorporate ProfileiRhythm is a digital healthcare company redefining the way cardiac arrhythmias are clinically diagnosed by combining our wearable biosensing technology with cloud-based data analytics and machine- learning capabilities. Our goal is to be the leading provider of first-line ambulatory electrocardiogram, or ECG, monitoring for patients at risk for arrhythmias. 

We have created a unique platform, ZIO by iRhythm, which we believe allows physicians to diagnose many arrhythmias more quickly and efficiently than traditional technologies, avoiding multiple indeterminate tests, allowing for appropriate medical intervention and potentially avoiding more serious downstream medical events, including stroke.

Why is my doctor
prescribing Zio?
The Zio system is proven and trusted by physicians to detect and diagnose irregular heart rhythms — and has been prescribed to hundreds of thousands of patients.
The FDA has cleared the Zio system to monitor for many different kinds of irregular heart rhythms. In a study, physicians were able to reach a diagnosis 90% of the time with the Zio system1.
You can wear the Zio monitor — a small, discreet, comfortable patch — during your normal day-to-day activity, including while you sleep, shower, and exercise, while it records every single heartbeat for analysis.
1Barrett, P., et al. Comparison of 24 Hour Holter Monitoring Versus 14 Day Novel Adhesive Patch Electrocardiographic Monitoring. American Journal of Medicine, 2014.











What is arrhythmia?
What is an ECG?
What is ambulatory cardiac monitoring?



Do you sometimes experience a skipped beat in your chest? Or feel a racing of the heart?
Your heart might beat too slow, too fast, or with an irregular beat. It may feel like skipped beats or a brief pause. It might be so slight that you don’t even feel it or experience any symptoms. You may have an irregular heartbeat or an arrhythmia. Fortunately, there are treatments available for arrhythmias. However before you can begin treatment, the condition must be diagnosed.
A simple, one-time test with the Zio by iRhythm system could be all you need to find out whether or not you have an arrhythmia and what kind you have. Your doctor can then use this data to prescribe the most effective form of treatment.
What causes arrhythmias, or irregular heart rhythms?
Arrhythmias may be caused by many different factors, including prior heart attack or heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes or sleep apnea. Irregular heart rhythms can also occur in "normal, healthy" hearts.
What is atrial fibrillation (AFib)?
Atrial fibrillation (also called AFib or AF) is a quivering or irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) that can lead to blood clots, stroke, heart failure and other heart-related complications. At least 2.7 million Americans are living with AFib.
Normally, your heart contracts and relaxes to a regular beat. In atrial fibrillation, the upper chambers of the heart (the atria) beat irregularly (quiver) instead of beating effectively to move blood into the ventricles.
For more information visit the American Heart Association website
You can use the the interactive AFib Risk Assessment tool to help estimate your risk of AFib.


An electrocardiogram — abbreviated as EKG or ECG — is a test that measures the electrical activity of the heartbeat. With each beat, an electrical impulse (or “wave”) travels through the heart. This wave causes the muscle to squeeze and pump blood from the heart. A normal heartbeat on ECG will show the timing of the top and lower chambers. For more information please visit the American Heart Association.


An ambulatory ECG records the electrical activity of your heart while you are doing your normal everyday activities.
“Ambulatory” means that you are able to stand and walk, and are not stationary or motionless. Many heart problems are only detectable during activity such as standing or walking and will not appear in a brief test in your doctor’s office.
1Turakhia, M., et al. (2013). Diagnostic Utility of a Novel Leadless Arrhythmia Monitoring Device. The American Journal of Cardiology.











Live without restrictions
The Zio ambulatory cardiac monitor is a small, unobtrusive, and water-resistant patch—you might even forget you’re wearing it. The Zio monitor records and stores every beat of your heart, whether you're sleeping, working out, or showering.

Zio vs. Holter monitoring
The Zio monitor can be comfortably worn for up to 14 days. Holter monitors can be worn for 24 to 48 hours, limiting the time to record any irregular heart rhythms you may have. Zio is able to capture data for the 51% of patients who have their first symptom-triggered arrhythmia after 48 hours.1

A simple path to a clear diagnosis



Record 
After the comfortable, easy-to-wear Zio monitor is applied, the Zio patch records and stores every single heartbeat.


Analyze 
These recordings are analyzed by a powerful Zio system that identifies any irregular rhythms you’ve experienced—how many, what type, and when. In a study, physicians were ablet o reach a diagnosis 90% of the time with the Zio system2.


A definitive diagnosis to accelerate your care 
Your doctor receives a clear report that shows how many and what types of irregular heart rhythms you experienced, as well as your normal heart rhythm, and when they happened -- all to help determine the best course of treatment.

STORIES FROM PATIENTS LIKE YOU





Nobody knew I was wearing the patch. I could do my work, perform my daily routine without catching wires and I could shower. I was relieved to be able to resume my active family, work and recreational activities. I urge other patients who suspect AFib or are at increased risk to see their doctors promptly. I felt like a normal human being with ZIO® XT Patch. I didn’t have to explain myself to people. You get scared because it’s your heart, but it’s curable. The technology is so far advanced today. People should not have to suffer, especially if they know to get to the doctor quickly.





When the Zio XT patch came along as a viable substitute to my prior monitoring system, I was thrilled that I could now exercise, shower, and engage socially without the visible stigma. I felt I was reclaiming some of my life back.





THANKS TO WHOEVER PUT YOUR MONITOR TOGETHER. It was simple to use, unobtrusive, easy to access in order to "highlight" events … and I even got to shower regularly! It was absolutely comfortable. Most of the time, awake or asleep, I didn’t notice that it was there.





Ended up needing a total pacemaker replacement and wire extraction....Without the Zio patch, no one was listening or able to see what my heart/pacemaker issues were with the old 12-lead monitor. We had ideas but nothing concrete until the Zio patch. The Zio Patch gave my MD at Brigham and Women’s the tools necessary to come up with a plan, fix what was wrong, and know what was wrong.





I went to Dr. Chang for stroke-like symptoms, and he had me wear the iRhythm monitor for two weeks to discover what was happening. This easy-to-wear, comfortable patch was really the catalyst for me getting a pacemaker and, more importantly, getting my life back.

WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING ABOUT ZIO BY iRHYTHM







I have been in cardiology for 29 soon to be 30 years and over those years I have used many different monitors to decipher patients with rhythm disturbances. The majority of times the results would show benign rhythms with the occasional SVT. I have been using the ZIO Patch for quite a few years now and in studying the results we have found non sustained V Tach over 100 times, we have found pauses that have called for pacemakers, long runs of SVT at over 190bpm, two of those patients had worn a variety of other monitors with no abnormal results. I could go on and on but I will say this, I will not use another type of monitor than the ZIO Patch, it has caused very ill patients to receive the proper treatment.





Nobody knew I was wearing the patch. I could do my work, perform my daily routine without catching wires and I could shower. I was relieved to be able to resume my active family, work and recreational activities. I urge other patients who suspect AFib or are at increased risk to see their doctors promptly. I felt like a normal human being with ZIO® XT Patch. I didn’t have to explain myself to people. You get scared because it’s your heart, but it’s curable. The technology is so far advanced today. People should not have to suffer, especially if they know to get to the doctor quickly.





Physicians need to know if stroke or TIA patients have an underlying cardiac arrhythmia which may have caused their neurological event, as this will impact treatment to help prevent a recurrence. Continuous long-term cardiac monitoring is essential to detect AFib, which may occur infrequently and often has no symptoms. However, many of the available monitoring options do not capture enough data or record for a long enough period of time, are burdensome for patients to wear or are too expensive.





As an active mid-fifties woman with a busy athletic life-style, being diagnosed with serious AFib needing continuous monitoring was a huge blow to me. When ZIO® XT Patch came along as a viable substitute to my prior monitoring system, I was thrilled that I could now exercise, shower, and engage socially without the visible stigma. I felt I was reclaiming some of my life back.

I have been using the ZIO Patch for quite a few years now and in studying the results we have found non sustained V Tach over 100 times, we have found pauses that have called for pacemakers, long runs of SVT at over 190bpm, two of those patients had worn a variety of other monitors with no abnormal results. I could go on and on but I will say this, I will not use another type of monitor than the ZIO Patch, it has caused very ill patients to receive the proper treatment.





Nobody knew I was wearing the patch. I could do my work, perform my daily routine without catching wires and I could shower. I was relieved to be able to resume my active family, work and recreational activities. I urge other patients who suspect AFib or are at increased risk to see their doctors promptly. I felt like a normal human being with ZIO® XT Patch. I didn’t have to explain myself to people. You get scared because it’s your heart, but it’s curable. The technology is so far advanced today. People should not have to suffer, especially if they know to get to the doctor quickly.





Physicians need to know if stroke or TIA patients have an underlying cardiac arrhythmia which may have caused their neurological event, as this will impact treatment to help prevent a recurrence. Continuous long-term cardiac monitoring is essential to detect AFib, which may occur infrequently and often has no symptoms. However, many of the available monitoring options do not capture enough data or record for a long enough period of time, are burdensome for patients to wear or are too expensive.





As an active mid-fifties woman with a busy athletic life-style, being diagnosed with serious AFib needing continuous monitoring was a huge blow to me. When ZIO® XT Patch came along as a viable substitute to my prior monitoring system, I was thrilled that I could now exercise, shower, and engage socially without the visible stigma. I felt I was reclaiming some of my life back.
