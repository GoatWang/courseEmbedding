Customer Success






FISION was the only company that could meet our requirements and deliver a robust solution that met the unique needs of our hotels. They kept some aggressive promises and delivered exactly what they said they would. Even with this platform of success, FISION was always quick to come up with new and innovative ideas that allowed us to push the envelope in new ways. They insured that our questions were always answered quickly, and no task was too small or too large to be met head on. I highly recommend working with the FISION team!

                    Fission Uranium Corp.
                










                Fission is the most awarded uranium explorer in the world. It owns the PLS project in Canadas Athabasca Basin, home to the worlds richest uranium deposits.  PLS is host to the Triple R deposit  the only major, high-grade deposit in the region that is near-surface  together with three additional high-grade, shallow-depth zones. This mineralization is part of a 2.58km mineralized trend that has the largest footprint in the Athabasca Basin and is still open in multiple directions. Exploration is ongoing.

Fission has won the industrys top awards, including The Northern Miners Mining Person/s of the Year, PDACs Bill Denis Award and The Mining Journals Excellence Award. Most recently, The Mining Journal ranked PLS as the top undeveloped uranium project in the world. Headed up by CEO Dev Randhawa, the company has made two major uranium discoveries in three years. President and Chief Geologist, Ross McElroy, has been instrumental in five of the last ten major discoveries in the basin. In January, 2016, CGN Mining invested $82M (cash) in Fission at a premium, ensuring the company is very well-funded.

		"On July 24, 2017, Fission Uranium Corp. announced the results of the first two holes of its summer drill program at Patterson Lake South. . .this drilling has resulted in the expansion of the R1515W zone. The zone was expanded down dip and laterally to the south."
		
		












  
      David Talbot, Eight Capital
  

(7/24/17)

		
		"Fission Uranium Corp.'s first two summer drill holes hit at the R1515W zone, the newest Triple R zone at PLS. . .drilling now extends mineralization to the west along the Patterson Lake corridor for a total of 3.17 km. Specifically, the R1515W zone was expanded down dip and laterally to the south and now measures 60m along strike and up to 45m wide."
		
		












  
      Rob Chang, Cantor Fitzgerald
  

(7/24/17)

		
		"Fission Uranium Corp.'s summer drilling program is off to a good start as the announced scintillometer results have expanded the R1515W zone to approximately 45m; management notes that the R1515W zone shows similar characteristics to those found at the flagship R780E zone. We reiterate our Buy recommendation."

(7/7/17)

		
		"On July 6, 2017, Fission Uranium Corp. announced a $6.59M summer program for its Patterson Lake South project. The program is expected to focus on expanding resources at the high-grade R1515W zone in addition to expediting progress towards a prefeasibility study."
		
		
















New Areas of High-Grade Uranium Mineralization Drilled in Athabasca Basin
				(6/20/17)

			    		A winter drilling program at Patterson Lake South in Canada's uranium-rich Athabasca Basin has confirmed high grades of mineralization on one company's property, and suggests the mineralized trend may be extendable.

      Heiko Ihle, Rodman & Renshaw
  

(6/6/17)

		
		"Fission Uranium Corp. announced results from the final assays of its winter program, which confirmed high-grade mineralization at the new R1515W zone at its Patterson Lake South property; six of eight holes were mineralized, with four returning multiple high-grade intervals. Results included hole PLS17-557, which returned 3.12% uranium over 8.5m within 1.24% uranium over 27.5m."

The  Energy Report Interview with Louis James 

(5/18/17)

		
		"To buy right now [in the uranium space], I like Fission Uranium Corp.  a lot. It's super high grade. It's near surface in the Athabasca Basin, Canada's premier uranium mining district. I think it's going to be a mine in the not-too-distant future. Meanwhile, it's discovering new deposits in the property. It could end up even bigger and better than it now looks."

(5/1/17)

		
		"Fission Uranium Corp. hit a couple of very nice holes in drilling outside the resource area at Triple R, the deposit-hosting portion of the company's Patterson Lake South uranium project. . .the highlight holes were hole 517 (7.5m of 7.31% U3O8 within a larger interval of 51m of 1.89% U3O8) and hole 515 (25.5m of 2.39% U3O8). These results indicate that this already world-class uranium deposit has the ability to keep growing."

		
		












  
      Rob Chang, Cantor Fitzgerald
  

(4/24/17)

		
		"Fission Uranium Corp. has released a total of 16 assay results from drilling on the R840W and R1620E zones. . .drill hole PLS17-517 (line 765W) contained 7.5m at 7.31% U3O8 within a larger interval of 51m at 1.89% U3O8 (104.5m155.5m). We estimate that this particular drill hole represents 1.4 Mlb U3O8."
		
		












  
      David Talbot, Eight Capital
  

(4/20/17)

		
		"In a follow-up to final exploration results announced this week, Fission Uranium Corp.'s infill drilling has expanded multiple zones at the Triple R zone. . .mineralization appears to have expanded the center of the R840W zone to both the north and south, with local high-grade uranium. There appear to be significant improvements at the R1620E zone as well."
		
		












  
      Rob Chang, Cantor Fitzgerald
  

(4/20/17)

		
		"Fission Uranium Corp. announced scintillometer results for the final 15 holes from its 2017 winter drill program. . .the expansion of the eastern side of R780E is positive as it points to the potential of additional mineable pounds on the eastern edge of the best zone at Patterson Lake South. Meanwhile, the results at R840W and R1620E appear to confirm the quality of those zones."
		
		












  
      David Talbot, Eight Capital
  

(4/18/17)

		
		"Fission Uranium Corp.'s winter drill program at Patterson Lake South in the Athabasca basin ended on a high note. Scintillometer results suggest it has drilled the best hole yet from the new R1515W discovery; 47m of composite radioactivity within a 125m interval includes 27.5m of continuous mineralization and 5.29m total composite high-grade core of greater than 10,000 cps radioactivity in PLS17-557 (L1530W)."
		
		












  
      Heiko Ihle, Rodman & Renshaw
  

(4/5/17)

		
		"Fission Uranium Corp.'s Patterson Lake South (PLS) project continues to expand. On March 20, 2017, the company announced a newly discovered high-grade zone at PLS and named the zone R1515W. . .hole PLS17-539, the discovery hole, intersected 32m of mineralization (134.5222m) including 31m continuous mineralization (191222m)."
		
		












  
      Rob Chang, Cantor Fitzgerald
  

(4/4/17)

		
		"Fission Uranium Corp. has announced the expansion of the R1515W zone through two mineralized holes; while still early stage, the R1515W zone may provide yet another additional source of uranium pounds for Patterson Lake South. We reiterate our Buy recommendation."
		
		












  
      David Talbot, Eight Capital
  

(4/4/17)

		
		"Fission Uranium Corp.'s second hit returned 48m of total composite radioactivity within a 76.5m interval  (hole PLS17-553) on L1515W within the R1515W zone. . .[the] R1515W zone may see further expansion. Further upside potential is likely."
		
		












  
      Rob Chang, Cantor Fitzgerald
  

(3/20/17)

		
		"Fission Uranium Corp. has announced the discovery of a new mineralized zone (R1515W). . .situated 510m to the west of the R840W zone, drill hole PLS17-539 intersected a 31m continuously mineralized interval, thus extending the mineralized trend at Patterson Lake South to 3.14 km in total (an increase from 2.63 km). Follow-up drilling is being planned for with the intent to grow the new zone."
		
		









  Alexander Peace, BMO Capital Markets 

(3/20/17)

		
		"We continue to like Fission Uranium Corp. due to its relatively lower risk exposure to one of the largest and near-surface resources in the Athabasca basin. Its CA$50M cash balance means its exploration and development activities are fully funded for the next 1824 months on our forecasts. . .the near-surface nature of the ore body, cash balance and proven mergers and acquisitions interest warrant a premium, in our view."
		
		









  Rob Chang, Uranium Investing News 

(3/16/17)

		
		"Fission Uranium Corp.'s Patterson Lake South is a high-quality asset, has the potential to be open pitted; if the company gets all the permits to do that, it's a low-cost operator in the making. It has a significant world-class resource."
		
		












  
      David Talbot, Eight Capital
  

(2/27/17)

		
		"An initial 10 holes of scintillometer results from an expanded 63 hole winter program at Patterson Lake South were provided today. . .identification of a new potential area of uranium mineralization at the far western end of the known mineralized trend appears exciting. This might extend the PLS trend by another 25% or 660m to measure 2.63km strike; further uranium was also intersected at the far eastern R1620E zone."
		
		












  
      Rob Chang, Cantor Fitzgerald
  

(2/27/17)

		
		"Fission Uranium Corp. has released 10 scintillometer results from drilling at its wholly owned Patterson Lake South property. . .a new hit located 660m west of the R840W zone highlights potential for a new zone. These are encouraging results as the company continues to explore for large pods of mineralization at the ends of what is already an impressive strike length."
		
		












  
      Brien Lundin, Gold Newsletter (Jefferson Financial)
  

(2/1/17)

		
		"Fission Uranium Corp. is about to embark on an aggressive regional exploration program on its Patterson Lake South uranium project. . .I'm excited about this program, as the company's geologists have already amply demonstrated their ability to turn promising surface showings into a significant, high-grade and near-surface uranium deposit."
		
		









  
      Brien Lundin, Gold Newsletter (Jefferson Financial)
  

(11/8/16)

		
		"Fission Uranium Corp. has been using drilling on the outer limits of
its Triple R deposit to grow that deposits already world-class stash
of uranium. . .over the long-term, the insitu value it has already proved up at Triple R, combined with the exploration success the company
continues to enjoy, will make current prices seem cheap by comparison. . . .that said, current market conditions call for caution in this sector. . .well keep Fission a hold until we get a better sense of the broader market for the energy metal."
		
		












  
      Rob Chang, Cantor Fitzgerald
  

(10/27/16)

		
		"Our recommendation for Fission Uranium remains a BUY at a $1.15 per share. . .a  constant  stream  of  high-grade assay results from the 
$13.3M budgeted summer drill program targeted 52 holes totaling 15,200m of total drilling; 36 of the 52 targeted holes were dedicated to connecting the various high-grades zones. . .the high-grade R840W Zone (along with the R1620E Zone) has the potential to add to the current resource. An updated resource estimate is expected for some time in 2017."
		
		












  
      Heiko Ihle, Rodman & Renshaw
  

(10/25/16)

		
		"We are reiterating a Buy rating and $1.70 per share price target
on Fission Uranium Corp. . .our valuation is based on a DCF of operations at PLS utilizing a 10.0% discount rate and a long-term uranium price of $65 per pound (beginning in 2023). . .to this, we add cash and value for future resource expansion outside of the currently defined resource base with an additional 30 million pounds at an average price of $6.75 per pound. . . we continue to view Fission as an eventual takeout target and expect future drilling campaigns to significantly expand the project's existing resource base."
		
		












  
      David Talbot, Dundee Capital Markets
  

(10/24/16)

		
		"We recommend Fission Uranium Corp. with a BUY and a target of C$2.20. . .final PLS assays end the summer drill program with a strong finish; drilling continued to widen R840W zone, demonstrating further growth right until the end. . .we do see potential for uranium to the west...like beads on a necklace, there are already at least 10 zones that occur along trend within the PLS, Arrow and Spitfire deposits. . .R840W Zone lies entirely outside of existing resource areas, and we estimate that it may host upwards of  20MM lbs U3O8."   
		
		









  
      David Talbot, Dundee Capital Markets
  

(10/12/16)

		
		"We recommend Fission Uranium Corp. with a BUY and C$2.20 target. . .assays for another seven holes were released overnight,
highlighting further high-grade intersections at both the far east (R1620E zone) and west (840W Zone) ends of known mineralization. All holes demonstrate strong alteration, mineralization and structure--they host shallow, high-grade U3O8 mineralization, occur beyond existing resource boundaries, and remain open. . .these positive indicators suggest potential to find further uranium along trend; both through expansion of known zones, and via potential discoveries within wide gaps in drilling. . .the R1620E zone returned its highest grades to date."
		
		









  
      David Talbot, Dundee Capital Markets
  

(9/26/16)

		
		"Fission Uranium Corp. is outperforming its peers, except for developers. . .Initial results look very good with high grade uranium assays reported from both ends of the 2.63 km PLS trend in the Athabasca Basin. . .Both of these zones occur outside of the current 105.5 MM lbs U3O8 PLS resource boundary. . .We believe that these zones meet the criteria of being "meaningful" and expect resources to grow which may positively impact economics. . .We recommend Fission Uranium with a BUY and a target of C$2.20, based on a 0.8x multiple applied to our 10% DCF model."
		
		












  
      Heiko Ihle, Rodman & Renshaw
  

(8/26/16)

		
		"Fission Uranium announced results from the final 11 exploration holes of its summer drilling program at PLS. . .it uncovered three additional targets that should warrant further drilling. . .the program at R840W successfully merged two zones into a single, larger zone. . .drill holes at both ends of the trend indicate that the trend is open, which leads us to believe an increase in resources is probable in 2017. . .we continue to view Fission as a takeout target and expect the firm to continue to aggressively drill the project in order to expand PLS' resource base prior to a takeout occurring."
		
		












  
      David Talbot, Dundee Capital Markets
  

(8/24/16)

		
		"We recommend Fission Uranium Corp. with a BUY and a target of CA$2.20. . .scintillometer results for the final seven core, and four reverse circulation drill holes, were reported overnight from the 100%-owned PLS project in the Athabasca Basin; results from systematic exploration along several conductive trends were also reported and some returned anomalous alteration and uranium mineralization. . .great strides are being made by Fission to de-risk economics via drilling, metallurgy and ongoing review of mine scheduling and project infrastructure."
		
		









  
      David Talbot, Dundee Capital Markets
  

(8/2/16)

		
		"Scintillometer results from another nine holes [at Fission Uranium Corp.'s Triple R deposit] were reported. . .drill results from both areas demonstrate wide zones, high-grade cores and shallow uranium mineralization, assays pending. The results from the R1620E zone appear particularly important. . .the main take-away here is that multiple stacked zones provide for added exploration potential. . .due to the expectation that rocks may get more structurally complex moving westward, small step outs are a good way to grow this zone. Critical mass is desired, particularly if zones get deeper."

		
		









  Jocelyn Aspa, Uranium Investing News
(7/26/16)

		
		"The outside mark of the Athabasca Basin has become a hot spot, which leads us to Fission Uranium Corp.'s Triple R deposit, the only major, high-grade deposit in the region that is potentially open pittable. . .new large, high-grade zones have recently been discovered by Fission, which outlined the largest mineralized trend in the Basin at 2.58 kilometers in length."
		
		












  
      Heiko Ihle, Rodman & Renshaw
  

(7/25/16)

		
		"We once again highlight the potential for an open-pit mine at PLS given the shallow nature of the site, a unique feature among the larger undeveloped assets in the Athabasca. . .the recent drilling results at PLS have been quite encouraging. . .we continue to believe that PLS should eventually be acquired, though hope that the current management team can expand the resource at the site prior to an acquisition occurring."
		
		












The Gold Report Article by Thibaut Lepouttre 

(7/22/16)

		
		"The recent uranium discoveries in the Athabasca Basin could definitely be described as world class. NexGen Energy blew all expectations out of the water with a maiden resource estimate containing in excess of 200 Mlb, but neighbor Fission Uranium Corp. is located within wheelbarrowing distance from NexGen, and both companies combined will very likely have in excess of 400 Mlb uranium. Fission's Triple R deposit contains almost 110 Mlb uraniumand this is expected to increase toward the 150 Mlb mark as Fission is now trying to connect the mineralized systems at the different target areasat an average grade of approximately 1.75% U3O8. However, there are higher-grade zones located within this resource estimate and Triple R has 45 Mlb in the Indicated resource category at an average grade of 18.22% U3O8."

		"Fission Uranium Corp. announced the kickoff for summer drilling at its Patterson Lake South project. . .The 52 hole, 15,200 meter program is expected to cost about $13.3 million. . .36 of the holes are slated to be drilled on recently discovered high-grade zones, which were a product of the winter drilling programs success at the project. . .We highlight that these zones remain outside the Triple R deposit and its corresponding current resource estimate. . .In short, we think PLS has a lot more to give and believe resources should continue to grow at what we already view as a world-class uranium asset."
		
		












  
      Brien Lundin, Gold Newsletter (Jefferson Financial)
  

(7/7/16)

		
		"Fission Uranium Corp. is about to kick off a CA$13.3M summer drilling campaign on its Patterson Lake South project. . .the 52-hole, 15,200m program will seek to grow and connect known high-grade resources along the Triple R deposit and to test regional targets on the district-scale property. . .any movement toward feasibility at the world-class Triple R deposit is good movement, and the company's geologists have had pretty good luck with the exploration methods theyve applied to PLS. . .Fission Uranium is still an important uranium play on our list." 
		
		












  
      David Talbot, Dundee Capital Markets
  

(5/17/16)

		
		"Fission Uranium Corp.s 13,000m winter program discovered the R840W Zone via regional drilling; delineated R600W, and expanded R780E and R1620E. . .five mineralized zones now extend for over 2.58 km of strike extent (up 250m). . .R1620E impresses with 2.6% over 40m incl. 11% over 5m and 7.6% over 3m. We expect resource growth from 106 MM lbs U3O8 to ~140 to 150 MM lbs upon completion of a new estimate. . .we expect a positive PLS PEA update."
		
		









  Alexander Pearce, BMO Capital Markets 

(5/16/16)

		
		"Fission Uranium Corp.'s management have a proven track record of resource delivery and a high grade of 1.76% U3O8 totaling 108Mlb (72% indicated, 28% inferred). . .the deposit remains open and has further prospective trends showing mineralisation suggesting upside scalability. . .the recent PEA increases confidence in delivery of an economic project, expected to have low total cost of production in early years of US$25/lb. . .Fission could be attractive for M&A by an established player, or a company looking for a foothold in the basin. . .it has relatively more attractive trading multiples than exploration peers"
		
		












  
      David Sadowski, Raymond James
  

(4/18/16)

		
		"Chemical assay results were released from 10 Fission Uranium Corp. holes2 at the new, on-land R840W zone; 1 at on-land R600W; 2 at R780E; and five on the easternmost R1620E. Results confirmed previously released scintillometer data and included three high-grade holes8.5m of 2.54% at R840W and 40.0m of 2.64% at R1620E, both of which are outside the current 108 Mlb resource area."
		
		









  Haywood Securities 

(4/1/16)

		
		"Fission Uranium Corp. released drill assay results from its PLS property, host to the Triple R deposit, in Canada's Athabasca Basin. . .the latest results are from holes drilled at the R840W and R600W zones. . .also included are infill drill holes from the R780W zone, located within the current Triple R resource. . .the latest results continue to define uranium mineralization beyond the extents of the Triple R resource. . .both the R600W and R840W zones. . .are shallow, land-based targets that could add significantly in terms of tonnage and positive economics to the current resource at Triple R."
		
		












  
      David Talbot, Dundee Capital Markets
  

(3/31/16)

		
		"Fission Uranium Corp. released assays for nine holes. . .initial winter assays demonstrate a good start overall, returning grades and thickness largely in-line with the current Triple R resource; we expect that these assays will help add pounds in the updated resource/PEA due later this year. Given that Triple R has seen extensive drilling since January 2015, we wouldn't be surprised if the initial 105.5 Mlb U3O8 resource were to increase by 3040% in the updated estimate; while size matters somewhat, the real goal is to provide resources that are easier and cheaper to access, sooner in mine life."
		
		









  
      David Talbot, Dundee Capital Markets
  

(3/28/16)

		
		"FCU's regional drilling lays groundwork for future upside potential. . .all three new highlights had minor radioactivity and plenty of graphitic structure required for this style of basement hosted U3O8 deposit. Follow up could lead to discoveries down the road, much as similar results led in the Triple R and Arrow deposits. . .Fission's upside potential remains considerable, but we must wait until a summer program before we might see further progression. . .Triple R has seen extensive drilling since announced in January 2015 and could be 30-40% larger than the initial 105.5 Mlb U3O8, largely Indicated resource, suggests."
		
		












  
      Heiko Ihle, Rodman & Renshaw
  

(3/22/16)

		
		"On March 21, Fission Uranium announced drill results. . .while all four holes hit mineralization, of note is PLS16-479, which returned 41.0m mineralization, including 4.8m off-scale mineralization. Notably, PLS16-479 was a 45m step-out hole to the west of the R840W zone, resulting in continued growth at Patterson Lake South (PLS) beyond the resource utilized in the current and initial preliminary economic assessment for the site. . .in our view, PLS retains significant exploration potential beyond what is currently defined and continues to prove itself as a world-class uranium asset. . .we are reiterating a Buy rating."
		
		









  Haywood Securities 

(3/8/16)

		
		"Fission Uranium Corp. released scintillometre results from extension drilling at its Triple R deposit in Saskatchewan. . .highlights include the strongest mineralization to date on the R1620E zone. . .the latest drilling continues to demonstrate the potential to expand on the current resource estimate at Triple R (81.1 Mlb U3O8 Indicated and 27.2 Mlb U3O8 Inferred). . .with over $80M in the bank, the company is well prepared to continue to test for further expansion potential either side of the Triple R resource along strike, as well as testing other exploration targets within its exploration portfolio." 
		
		












The  Gold Report Interview with Paul Renken 

(3/7/16)

		
		"Fission Uranium Corp. and NexGen Energy are finding more mineralization in the same trend. They're essentially adjoining companies and, because of the grades in that trend, both NexGen and Fission's properties are going to be high-grade mines. They're willing, at these current low uranium prices, to find additional pounds and not push toward production. It's probably the right way for those companies to add value. . .recent drill results show mineralized extensions to the southwest and northeast on the R600W zone. They're essentially continuations on the same trend that contains Patterson Lake South. Fission will continue to add pounds there. Neither of those areas is included in the current resource, so the company will end up getting some kind resource boost from both extensions at a future date. . .the Fission-Denison Mines deal . . .is a natural fit. Both parties might revisit a merger at a later date because the management teams of both firms get along well."

		"Fission Uranium Corp. announced positive scintillometer results from 11 holes drilled on the R600W, R780E and R1620E sections of the Triple R uranium deposit. Highlights included hole 460 (8.04m composite mineralization with greater than 10,000 cps radioactivity). . .the strongest mineralization encountered in the R1620E zone to date. . .I'm high on the uranium story in general this year and on this project and company in particular."

		"Fission Uranium Corp. released positive preliminary scintillometer results from seven holes at the Triple R deposit of its flagship, 100%-owned Patterson Lake South (PLS) project in northern Saskatchewan. Drilling includes a significant step-out to the east that cut high-grade uranium, expanding the potential scope of shallow mineralization on the project. . .this strong interval sits within a wider, continuously mineralized 50.0m zone starting at only 65.6m vertical depthmeaningfully shallower than where one might expect based on the overall mineralized plunge."

		"A potential new high-grade uranium discovery has been made by Fission Uranium Corp. to the west of the R600W zone at Patterson Lake South (PLS) in the Athabasca Basin. This thick intercept was hit by the first wildcat drill hole this year. . .this may or may not be a continuation of the R600W zone or a new zone. Either situation has potential to add pounds. The structure is thick, suggesting that it has seen plenty of uranium-bearing fluids pass through, which may have been deposited nearby, ready to be found."

		"CGN Mining Co. Ltd. has agreed to purchase about 20% of Fission Uranium Corp. at the corporate level. . . GN is attracted to this asset and it plans to buy almost 20% of Fission Uranium to gain a foothold in the Patterson Lake South (PLS) project. This is the second-largest undeveloped project in the Athabasca Basin, but that resource estimate is now about a year old. Fission continued to drill it last winter and through the summer, and has added meaningful pounds at the R600 West and R780 zones. Fission is planning a $7M, 11,000-meter (11,000m) winter drill program that will focus on 600 West and parallel zones north of that. The goal is to add some land-based resources to lower costs and improve the mine plan. CGN's involvement may accelerate the development process."

The  Gold Report Interview with Rick Rule 

(1/4/16)

		
		"Fission Uranium Corp. (FCU:TSX) did something highly unusualit created value. It made what appears to be a world-class uranium discovery. The market was looking for near-term share price performance and didn't properly appreciate the value. But a Chinese investor who understood that the current malaise in uranium prices can't continue and was looking for security of supply came in at a substantial premium to market and provided the company with sufficient working capital to move the project forward. There are a whole bunch of instructive lessons here. First of all, that the market in very good times or very bad times is a bad arbiter of value. In very good markets, investors overvalue reserves, resources, narratives and potential, and in very bad markets they undervalue the very same thing. The second lesson is that the time frames investors, in particular speculators, limit themselves to are farcical. It will take probably five years for the southwestern part of the Athabasca Basin to deliver enough certainty with regard to the NPV of those resources that they could be appropriately valued, but investors have trauma holding stock over a long weekend. Their expectations of value are unrealistic. The Chinese investor, by contrast, understood that the malaise in uranium prices is temporary because it knows how much uranium it is going to need. It realizes that it could come in to a deposit paying a premium to market but at the same time obtaining a substantial discount on its estimation of the NPV. It's truly a win-win for all concerned."

The  Energy Report Interview with Rob Chang 

(12/22/15)

		
		"We still like Fission Uranium Corp.'s Patterson Lake South property in Saskatchewan. Fission management may need to do some public relations work to get investors back on the company's side. That said, facts are facts. Fission will continue to explore and add pounds to what is already a world-class project: 105.5 Mlb with a projected opex of $14.02/lb. Fission is one of the best uranium stories we've seen in quite a while. We give it a Buy rating with a 12-month, $1.55/share price target."

		"Fission Uranium Corp. announced the final results from its extensive summer program at PLS. . .of the 17 holes drilled, 16 returned mineralization, including 12 at R600W. We highlight hole PLS15-439, which returned 25.5m mineralization grading 11.02% from 117.0m to 142.5m. Much like R780E, R600W's mineralization is high grade occurring at a shallow depth. Given this, we believe further drilling is warranted at R600W in an effort to continue to add resources to the already robust resource profile for Triple R."
		
		









  Haywood Securities 

(11/27/15)

		
		"Fission Uranium Corp.'s final set of drill assay results from the 2015 summer program highlights the potential of the R600W zone, located approximately 500m southwest of the eastern extent of the current Triple R resource (NI-43-101-compliant resource of 81.1 Mlb at 1.83% U3O8 Indicated and 27.2 Mlb at 1.57% U3O8 Inferred). The shallow, land-based R600W zone is open in all directions, and further growth of this zone will be a focus for an upcoming 2016 winter drill program."
		
		












  
      David Talbot, Dundee Capital Markets
  

(11/25/15)

		
		"Final assays provided a strong finish to Fission Uranium Corp.'s summer drill program at the Triple R uranium deposit at PLS in the western Athabasca Basin. Sixteen of the final 17 holes host uranium mineralization, expanding the high-grade R600W zone and extending the R780E zone eastward. Today's results are important: They delineate high-quality pounds. Mineralization is shallow, occurs on land, is relatively higher grade, and is gaining critical mass. . .the R600W discovery is not yet included in the 105.5 Mlb Triple R resource nor incorporated in its preliminary economic assessment."

(11/3/15)

		
		"Fission Uranium Corp.'s Ross McElroy and his team have done a great job growing the Patterson Lake South (PLS) resource, which is turning out to be a world-class deposit. It is clear the majority of the company's shareholders wanted the company to stay focused on its PLS project and didn't believe the benefits of diversification, including access to a mill, the Lundin group and Wheeler River, outweighed the potential of the PLS deposit. I had a great run early on with Fission. We tripled our money, and we sold, albeit a bit too early, but a profit is a profit. . .the company could become an acquirer of other projects on the east or west side of the basin, or it too could become a takeout target by larger company. . .in the near term, I think Fission will keep drilling fantastic numbers and move its project forward."

The high-grade mineralization in the 600W zone is not included in the existing resource or the PEA. It is also important to note the potential for the near-surface and land-based mineralization at 600W, to provide a starting pit while the more complicated mining process is developed for the 780E zone which will require damming the lake." 
		
		









  Haywood Securities 

(10/23/15)

		
		"Fission Uranium Corp.'s latest results from Triple R continue to indicate that the R600W zone has the potential to add significant, high-grade U308 mineralization to what is already a significant resource. In addition, the R600W zone, not included in the latest PEA for Triple R, could potentially improve the economics of an open-pit operation, given it is situation on land to the east of Patterson Lake."

(10/21/15)

		
		"Given the strong results from Fission Uranium Corp.'s summer drill program, we believe resource growth at Patterson Lake South (PLS) is probable. While the Triple R deposit remains robust on its own, we believe the R600W zone could ultimately contribute significant resources to PLS as a whole, ultimately enhancing the robust economics set forth in the recently announced PEA. . .we continue to view PLS as a strong takeout candidate and expect the company to continue to move the project forward, particularly through the expansion of resources."

Mergers and acquisitions are the name of the game in uranium. . .the combined larger entities could attract strategic and institutional investors, which could open the capital markets to improved exploration and development budgets. In this bear market companies need to consolidate in order to cut costs and attract major institutional interest. Denison with Fission will have the best portfolio of high-grade advanced uranium assets in the Basin plus free cash flow from Denison's toll-milling agreements and management fees with Uranium Participation Corp."
		
		












  Brien Lundin, Gold Newsletter (Jefferson Financial) 

(7/30/15)

		
		"Fission Uranium Corp. stole the headlines recently by announcing its intent to merge with Denison Mines Corp. . .the combination would be powerful and attractive. . .the merger with Denison. . .produces not only a very attractive target for the remaining potential suitors, but also a viable competitor if they don't act. So the announcement of this merger could itself precipitate a counteroffer. . .the worst case, at this point, is a merger with a great company in Denison. . .all in all, not a bad position to be in."
