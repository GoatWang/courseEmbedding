        November 1, 2016.
        
          AGENCY:

End Preamble
Start Supplemental Information
Supplementary Information:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained via the Commission's Web site by searching for the file number, or for an applicant using the Company name box, at http://www.sec.gov/​search/​search.htm or by calling (202) 551-8090.
Summary of the Application
1. Applicants request an order that would allow Funds to operate as index exchange traded funds (“ETFs”).[1] 
           Fund shares will be purchased and redeemed at their NAV in Creation Units only. All orders to purchase Creation Units and all redemption requests will be placed by or through an “Authorized Participant”, which will have signed a participant agreement with a broker-dealer registered under the Exchange Act (together with any future distributor, the “Distributor”). Shares will be listed and traded individually on a national securities exchange, where share prices will be based on the current bid/offer market. Certain Funds may operate as Feeder Funds in a master-feeder structure. Any order granting the requested relief would be subject to the terms and conditions stated in the application.
2. Each Fund will hold investment positions selected to correspond generally to the performance of an Underlying Index. In the case of Self-Indexing Funds, an affiliated person, as defined in section 2(a)(3) of the Act (“Affiliated Person”), or an affiliated person of an Affiliated Person (“Second-Tier Affiliate”), of the Trust or a Fund, of the Adviser, of any sub-adviser to or promoter of a Fund, or of the Distributor will compile, create, sponsor or maintain the Underlying Index.[2] 

3. Shares will be purchased and redeemed in Creation Units and generally on an in-kind basis. Except where the purchase or redemption will include cash under the limited circumstances specified in the application, purchasers will be required to purchase Creation Units by depositing specified instruments (“Deposit Instruments”), and shareholders redeeming their shares will receive specified instruments (“Redemption Instruments”). The Deposit Instruments and the Redemption Instruments will each correspond pro rata to the positions in the Fund's portfolio (including cash positions) except as specified in the application.
4. Because shares will not be individually redeemable, applicants request an exemption from section 5(a)(1) and section 2(a)(32) of the Act that would permit the Funds to register as open-end management investment companies and issue shares that are redeemable in Creation Units only.
5. Applicants also request an exemption from section 22(d) of the Act and rule 22c-1 under the Act as secondary market trading in shares will take place at negotiated prices, not at a current offering price described in a Fund's prospectus, and not at a price based on NAV. Applicants state that (a) secondary market trading in shares does not involve a Fund as a party and will not result in dilution of an investment in shares, and (b) to the extent different prices exist during a given trading day, or from day to day, such variances occur as a result of third-party market forces, such as supply and demand. Therefore, applicants assert that secondary market transactions in shares will not lead to discrimination or preferential treatment among purchasers. Finally, applicants represent that share market prices will be disciplined by arbitrage opportunities, which should prevent shares from trading at a material discount or premium from NAV.
6. With respect to Funds that effect creations and redemptions of Creation Units in kind and that are based on certain Underlying Indexes that include foreign securities, applicants request relief from the requirement imposed by section 22(e) in order to allow such Funds to pay redemption proceeds within fifteen calendar days following the tender of Creation Units for redemption. Applicants assert that the requested relief would not be inconsistent with the spirit and intent of section 22(e) to prevent unreasonable, undisclosed or unforeseen delays in the actual payment of redemption proceeds.
7. Applicants request an exemption to permit Funds of Funds to acquire Fund shares beyond the limits of section 12(d)(1)(A) of the Act; and the Funds, and any principal underwriter for the Funds, and/or any broker or dealer registered under the Exchange Act, to sell shares to Funds of Funds beyond the limits of section 12(d)(1)(B) of the Act. The application's terms and conditions are designed to, among other things, help prevent any potential (i) undue influence over a Fund through control or voting power, or in connection with certain services, transactions, and underwritings, (ii) excessive layering of fees, and (iii) overly complex fund structures, which are the concerns underlying the limits in sections 12(d)(1)(A) and (B) of the Act.
8. Applicants request an exemption from sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(2) of the Act to permit persons that are Affiliated Persons, or Second-Tier Affiliates, of the Funds, solely by virtue of certain Start Printed Page 78230ownership interests, to effectuate purchases and redemptions in-kind. The deposit procedures for in-kind purchases of Creation Units and the redemption procedures for in-kind redemptions of Creation Units will be the same for all purchases and redemptions and Deposit Instruments and Redemption Instruments will be valued in the same manner as those investment positions currently held by the Funds. Applicants also seek relief from the prohibitions on affiliated transactions in section 17(a) to permit a Fund to sell its shares to and redeem its shares from a Fund of Funds, and to engage in the accompanying in-kind transactions with the Fund of Funds.[3] 
           The purchase of Creation Units by a Fund of Funds directly from a Fund will be accomplished in accordance with the policies of the Fund of Funds and will be based on the NAVs of the Funds.
9. Applicants also request relief to permit a Feeder Fund to acquire shares of another registered investment company managed by the Adviser having substantially the same investment objectives as the Feeder Fund (“Master Fund”) beyond the limitations in section 12(d)(1)(A) and permit the Master Fund, and any principal underwriter for the Master Fund, to sell shares of the Master Fund to the Feeder Fund beyond the limitations in section 12(d)(1)(B).
10. Section 6(c) of the Act permits the Commission to exempt any persons or transactions from any provision of the Act if such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt any person, security, or transaction, or any class or classes of persons, securities, or transactions, from any provision of section 12(d)(1) if the exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors. Section 17(b) of the Act authorizes the Commission to grant an order permitting a transaction otherwise prohibited by section 17(a) if it finds that (a) the terms of the proposed transaction are fair and reasonable and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; (b) the proposed transaction is consistent with the policies of each registered investment company involved; and (c) the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the Act.

1.
     Applicants request that the order apply to the Trust's initial index-based ETF series, as well as any additional series of the Trust, and any other open-end management investment company or existing or future series thereof that may be created in the future (each, included in the term “Fund”), each of which will operate as an ETF and will track a specified index comprised of domestic or foreign equity and/or fixed income securities (each, an “Underlying Index”). Any Fund will (a) be advised by the Initial Adviser or an entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Initial Adviser (each, an “Adviser”) and (b) comply with the terms and conditions of the application.

        Back to Citation
      


2.
     Each Self-Indexing Fund will post on its Web site the identities and quantities of the investment positions that will form the basis for the Fund's calculation of its NAV at the end of the day. Applicants believe that requiring Self-Indexing Funds to maintain full portfolio transparency will help address, together with other protections, conflicts of interest with respect to such Funds.

        Back to Citation
      


3.
     The requested relief would apply to direct sales of shares in Creation Units by a Fund to a Fund of Funds and redemptions of those shares. Applicants, moreover, are not seeking relief from section 17(a) for, and the requested relief will not apply to, transactions where a Fund could be deemed an Affiliated Person, or a Second-Tier Affiliate, of a Fund of Funds because an Adviser or an entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with an Adviser provides investment advisory services to that Fund of Funds.

Retirement
FAQs for Retirement






             Why do I have a Customer Identification Number?
          






To protect your privacy, Prudential does not use your Social Security Number (SSN) in any correspondence we send you. Instead, we create a unique Customer Identification Number (CIN) for every person with an annuity as an identifier to be used in place of your SSN in our communications to you. The CIN is a nine-digit, alpha-numeric number that starts with a letter—for example, A12345678.








             What is the "Contract" that was purchased and what kind of annuity was purchased for me under it—a group annuity or an individual annuity?
          






The “Contract” that was purchased to provide your annuity is a group annuity contract offered through the Prudential Insurance Company of America. A group annuity contract is a financial product sold by an insurance company that provides a guaranteed stream of income for members of a group at stated intervals (in this case monthly) for each recipient’s lifetime, and, in some circumstances, if applicable, for the lifetime of a joint annuitant (such as a spouse) thereafter.








             What is a Contract Number and why do I need to reference it when I contact you?
          






A Contract Number is the unique identifying number assigned to the group annuity contract that covers the annuity that was purchased for you. Whenever you contact us by phone or mail, you should reference your Contract Number. It helps us locate your records on our administrative systems and enables us to be more responsive to you.








             On My Fact Sheet there’s a box – Important Information Regarding Beneficiary Designation. Why do I need to complete your Beneficiary Designation Form?
          






If this box appears on your Fact Sheet, then your benefit has a death benefit feature that requires you to designate a beneficiary:

Prudential is required to have your valid beneficiary designation form in our records. Since your prior payer did not transfer your prior beneficiary designation form to us, we ask that you complete the form enclosed in this folder and return it to Prudential to ensure that we have your valid beneficiary form on file.
If this box is not on your Fact Sheet, your benefit does not have a death benefit feature.









             I currently receive my pension benefit through direct deposit. Will Prudential continue that?
          






If you currently receive your pension through direct deposit, your prior payer provided that information to Prudential, and we will continue direct deposit of your benefit. No action or information is required on your part for Prudential to continue your direct deposit.








             How safe is my Prudential annuity?
          






Your annuity is provided under a group annuity contract issued by The Prudential Insurance Company of America, a New Jersey life insurance company whose principal office is located in Newark, New Jersey. As a highly regulated insurance company, The Prudential Insurance Company of America is required to maintain appropriate reserves to meet its financial obligations.

Life Insurance
FAQs for Life Insurance






             How do I file a death claim?
          






There are two ways you can now file a death claim on a Prudential policy or account.
You can submit your individual life insurance claim online and on your own time at www.prudential.com/claims or contact your Financial Professional. 








             How do I get information about my policy values?
          






You can view your policy values online by logging in to our online account access service. If you have not enrolled yet for Prudential Online Account Access, you may do so by using the Login box at the top right corner of the prudential.com homepage. Select the 'Insurance, Mutual Funds & Annuities' category from the drop down menu. On the Login screen, click on the Enroll link in the First Time User box to begin your enrollment online. If you need assistance with enrollment, please call 1-800-PRU-HELP (778-4357). The "First Time Logging In" link at the top of the enrollment page shows the products supported for product owners. Once you have your username and password and have logged in to the account access service, you will be able to view your policy values. Please keep in mind that detailed policy information may not be available for all of your policies. Your other option for getting policy values is to call Prudential's automated IVR response system. The following policy value information is available through this online system:

Policy Face Amount
Policy Cash Value
Value of All Dividends
Unit Value of Each Fund (for variable life policies beginning with Q, R, or 9)
Balances of Each Fund (for variable life policies beginning with Q, R, or 9)
Fund Withdrawal Amount (for variable life policies beginning with Q, R, or 9)
Loan Amount Available
Loan Amount Outstanding
Policy Surrender Value

To access Prudential's automated response system, call us toll-free at 800-778-2255. Remember to have your policy numbers handy when you call. You also have the option of speaking with a customer service specialist if the information you need is not available through the automated response system, or if you have additional questions or requests.








             How do I take a loan out against my Prudential policy?
          






Please be aware that withdrawals and loans will affect policy values and the death benefit, and thus, may have tax consequences. To request a loan or withdrawal from your Prudential policy, or to perform a cash surrender of your policy, contact your Prudential professional, or call our Customer Service Center at 1-800-778-2255, Mon.-Fri., 8 a.m.-8 p.m. ET. Please have your policy numbers available when you call.








             How do I change my personal information (i.e., address, phone number, email)?
          






Log in to your Account Access. If you do not have Account Access, enroll now.

You may change your mailing address and home telephone information using the "Update Mailing Address and Home Telephone Number" option from your Policy Profile page.

You may change your home telephone number using the "Update Home Telephone Number Only" option from your Policy Profile page.

You may change your email address using the "Update Email Address" option from your Policy Profile page.








             How do I change my Beneficiary?
          






Log in to your Account Access. If you do not have Account Access, enroll now.

You may change Beneficiary Information by accessing "Change Beneficiary(ies)" from your Policy Profile page or by accessing the "Forms Library" and selecting "Request to Change Beneficiary on Life Insurance" form.








             Where can I find an agent after moving to another state?
          






To find the nearest Prudential office, you can visit our site's office locator. This feature will find the five offices nearest your new home. You may also call our Customer Service Center at 1-800-778-2255, Mon.-Fri., 8 a.m.-8 p.m. ET.








             How do I request a policy search?
          






To request a policy search, contact your Prudential professional or call our Customer Service Center at 1-800-778-2255, Mon.-Fri., 8 a.m.-8 p.m. ET.








             What do I do if I've lost my policy?

             What are the contribution limits for Traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs for Tax Years 2016 and 2017?
          










 


Under age 50

Lesser of $5,500 or 100% of Taxable Income


Lesser of $6,500 or 100% of Taxable Income




2017


Lesser of $5,500 or 100% of Taxable Income


Lesser of $6,500 or 100% of Taxable Income












             What is the contribution deadline for Tax Year 2016?
          






Traditional IRA and Roth IRA contributions received between January 1 and the tax filing deadline may be attributed to tax year 2016. Written instructions indicating attribution to the previous tax year must accompany the contribution, or else the contribution will be attributed to the current tax year. The federal tax filing deadline for Tax Year 2016 is April 18, 2017.

IRA checks that are received after April 18, 2017, but on or before April 22, 2017 must be accompanied with proof that the check was post-marked to the Agent/Financial Professional on or before April 18, 2017. Proof should be a copy or fax of the envelope with the post-mark, or statement of proof of delivery by the USPS or courier service (i.e. UPS or Federal Express); not the actual envelope. Otherwise the contribution will be attributed to the current tax year.

All Tax Year Contributions received after April 22, 2017 will be coded with the 2017 Tax Year.

New contracts must be issued on or before April 18, 2017 for a contribution to be attributed to the 2016 tax year, even if a contribution is made with accompanying attribution instructions prior to the tax filing deadline.

All SEP IRA contributions are coded for the current calendar year, no exceptions.








             If my contract is owned by a trust and is not subject to 72(u), why was the Form 1099-R coded with a 1 in box 7 when I'm over 59?
          






Entity owned contracts, i.e. Trusts, are not subject to 72(u) will always use Distribution code 1, as there is no date of birth for an entity, except in the case of a Grantor Trust. Distributions from a Grantor Trust are reported based on the Grantor's date of birth (DOB), and it will be coded as a 1 for an early distribution or as a 7 for normal distribution based on the Grantor's DOB.








             Why wasn't my Form 1099-R coded as a disability payment?
          






The withdrawal form did not indicate disability. You can file IRS Form 5329 and would have to prove to the IRS on your own that the disability exception applies.








             Why is my entire distribution taxable?
          






For Non-Qualified contracts there are 2 possible reasons:

The distribution was all earnings; it did not contain any return of cost basis.
The contract is aggregated.

For Qualified contracts (except for Qualified Trustee Owned Pension Plans and 457 Plans):

Since some or all of the distribution may be taxable as ordinary income for the tax year in which the distribution is made. We report all distributions as fully taxable on IRS Form 1099-R. If a portion of the distribution is not taxable, you would indicate that on your own return.

Qualified contracts are funded with pretax dollars and Prudential doesn't track Cost Basis. Non-Qualified are funded with after tax dollars, and earnings are taxable and generally come out first.








             Why is box 2b "Taxable amount not determined" checked on my 1099-R?
          







Taxable Amount Not determined is used on Non-Qualified accounts that were funded with a 1035 exchange where the prior institution did not send us the cost basis
For Roth IRA contracts we report all distributions as taxable amount not determined









             Why does my Form 1099-R show such a high taxable amount compared to my cost basis?
          






If the taxable amount seems high this contract is most likely a non-qualified annuity that is part of an aggregated group.
Section 72(e) (12) of the Internal Revenue Code requires that all annuities entered into after October 21, 1988 be aggregated and treated as a single deferred annuity contract for the purpose of determining the amount of taxable gain includible in gross income. Aggregation applies to all contracts:

Purchased by the same contract owner
From the same insurance company and its affiliates
During the same calendar year

All non-qualified annuity contracts issued to the same contract owner, by the same insurance company or affiliate, in the same calendar year they are treated as a single contract for tax gain purposes. Aggregated groups are determined by the TIN of the owner.
Aggregation rules do not apply to: Qualified Contracts, Immediate Annuities, contracts subject to 72(u) of the Internal Revenue Code and contracts issued prior to October 21, 1988.








             Why did I receive tax Form 1099-R if I converted my IRA into a Roth IRA?
          






An IRA to Roth conversion is generally fully taxable. Taxable amounts are included in income in the year of conversion subject to ordinary income tax. 10% withholding applies unless election out. RMD if applicable should be removed before the conversion.
Amounts converted from an eligible IRA to a Roth IRA are required to be included in the customer's taxable income in the year of conversion. Generally, this includes deductible contributions made to the IRA and any earnings on those contributions and the present value of the actuarial benefit if applicable. A Form 1099-R will be issued reflecting the conversion from the traditional to the Roth IRA. The Form 1099-R will reflect a distribution code of either a 2 (under 59 ½ with an exception) or 7 (over 59 ½). In addition, a Form 5498 will be generated to reflect the amounts converted to the Roth IRA.








             Why did I receive tax Form 1099-R when I received these funds as a Death Claim?
          






Death proceeds from an annuity contract are taxable to the extent that there is gain. Under normal circumstances a beneficiary is responsible for the income tax on the death benefit they receive. However, there are exceptions to this general rule as indicated below.

On an annuitant driven contract the death proceeds are payable at the death of the annuitant and are payable to the beneficiary. If the annuitant is the owner, tax reporting is to the beneficiary. If the annuitant and owner are different, tax reporting is to the owner.

On an owner driven contract the proceeds become payable upon death of the owner. For single owned contracts, the proceeds are paid to and reportable to the beneficiary. For Jointly owned contracts, if the surviving owner is not the beneficiary, the surviving owner will receive the tax reporting, however, the beneficiary will receive the proceeds.

On an Entity owned contract the death proceeds are payable at the death of the annuitant and are paid to the beneficiary. The tax reporting is to the owner.
