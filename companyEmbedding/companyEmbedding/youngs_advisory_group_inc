    exempt reporting advisers may be required to provide state securities authorities with a copy of reports and
    any amendments they file with the SEC. If this is an initial application or report, check the box(es) next to
    the state(s) that you would like to receive notice of this and all subsequent filings or reports you submit to

Consensus Ratings for CEB (NASDAQ:EXBD) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A

You own the assets.
The custodian safeguards them.
We care for them.

With the Right Roadmap, wealth is a matter of course 




Clear.  Measurable.  Adaptive.





You know where you are.
You know where you want to be.
Let us help you get there.



We help our clients create a financial roadmap that is designed to provide lifestyle vision and direction—for today and for the future.
This structure helps our clients identify, clarify and address a number of key factors that will influence critical decisions.  This often includes lifestyle goals, wealth accumulation plans, retirement strategies, tax management, and legacy planning.   The end result:  a comprehensive financial and investment strategy that makes sense for our clients.
And, because we know that life brings changes, adapting the roadmap around you over time by us is as important as its initial creation.
At Youngs Advisory Group, we provide guidance to our clients regarding any aspect that touches their lives financially.

A proper roadmap includes a proper investment strategy




Put us to work.




Your roadmap will guide the proper investment strategy to support your goals.
Any sound investment strategy begins with a well-diversified investment core — from diversity comes stability.  While investment return is important, so too is relative risk control and tax-awareness.  Most of our clients need us to focus as much on preservation as growth.
How do we do this?  Similar to many successful endowment strategies, we introduce a broad variety of investments with reduced correlation to traditional equity markets to balance risk with return goals.  By harnessing diverse instruments such as dynamic funds, tactical exchange traded funds (ETFs), closed-end funds, and other specialty vehicles, while selectively utilizing defensive long/short and covered-call strategies, our hallmark is favorable risk-adjusted growth with a tax-sensitive focus.

What are you seeking in an ideal advisor?




You want a wealth manager sitting on the same side of the table with you, representing your best interests first. We are Registered Investment Advisors.  As an RIA, we are bound by what’s known as a ‘Fiduciary Standard’, which is the highest legal and ethical standard those of us who render financial advice can be held to. A Fiduciary must place your interests ahead of their own. Period.




Higher standard – Compare our fiduciary standard to the ‘suitability standard’ to which non-RIA advisory brokers are held.  Advisory brokers are not specifically required to place your interests ahead of their own, but rather merely recommend financial products that are reasonably suitable for you.  Under this scenario brokers can recommend one product over another if it pays them more, as long as both meet the definition of being suitable for you.
Fee transparency – We are a fee-only wealth management firm.  What does that mean?  It means we have clearly-disclosed fees for our services.  These fees are our sole source of revenue – no commissions, no hidden fees, no other arrangements.
Pure relationship – The essence of our business model is to align our interests with yours, transparently.  We succeed only if we help you succeed.  We specifically choose to be an RIA wealth manager because we feel it is the cleanest, purest way to deliver financial advice.
