JERICHO, N.Y., July 25, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Esquire Financial Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:    ESQ) (the "Company"), the holding company for Esquire Bank, National Association ("Esquire Bank"), today announced its operating results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017. Significant achievements during the quarter include:

Successfully completed the Company's initial public offering ("IPO") of common stock resulting in net proceeds of $21.7 million on June 30, 2017. On July 20, 2017, the underwriter exercised its full over-allotment option resulting in additional net proceeds of $4.6 million. 
Net income increased 37.3% to $1.0 million, or $0.20 per diluted common share. Adjusted(1) net income increased 23.1% to $921 thousand, or $0.18 per diluted share. 
Net interest income for the second quarter increased $782 thousand, or 20.4%, to $4.6 million, supported by our strong net interest margin of 4.34%. 
On a linked quarter basis, loans increased $16.9 million or 23.3% annualized to $307.4 million from $290.6 million for the first quarter of 2017, primarily driven by our higher yielding commercial and consumer loan categories. 
Continued solid asset quality metrics and reserve coverage with no non-performing assets and an allowance for loan losses to total loans of 1.24% at June 30, 2017. 
Non-interest income consisting primarily of our merchant services platform increased 30.4% to $1.4 million or 22.7% of total revenue. 
Deposits totaled $376.4 million, a $42.9 million or 12.9% increase from the second quarter of 2016 with a cost of funds of 0.14% (including demand deposits). Off-balance sheet funds totaled $203.6 million at June 30, 2017. 
Returns on average assets and common equity were 0.95% and 7.64%. Adjusted(1) returns on average assets and common equity were 0.85% and 6.85%. 
Esquire Bank remains well above the bank regulatory "Well Capitalized" standards.









"Our successful IPO, including the subsequent exercise of the over-allotment option, is a testament to our unique and attractive business model," stated Dennis Shields, Executive Chairman. "Our solid capital base, anchored by a diverse list of new institutional investors, will support our future growth and business initiatives."
"Our three key paths for continued high performance are our strong net interest margin, diverse mix of fee based income and our branchless distribution network," stated Andrew C. Sagliocca, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our Company is at a true inflection point for scalability and profitability."

Net Earnings and Returns
Net income for the quarter was $1.0 million or $0.20 per diluted share, compared to $748 thousand or $0.15 per diluted share for 2016.  Returns on average assets and common equity for the current quarter were 0.95% and 7.64% compared to 0.83% and 6.03% in 2016, respectively. For the second quarter of 2017, the effective tax rate of 32.0% was lower than anticipated due to tax benefits resulting from the exercise of certain stock options during the quarter. Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2017 was $1.8 million or $0.36 per diluted share, compared to $1.4 million or $0.27 per diluted share for 2016.  Returns on average assets and common equity for the six months ended June 30, 2017 were 0.87% and 7.02% compared to 0.78% and 5.65% in 2016, respectively.  
Adjusted net income for the quarter was $921 thousand or $0.18 per diluted share and adjusted returns on average assets and common equity were 0.85% and 6.85%, respectively. Adjusted net income for the six months ended 2017 was $1.7 million or $0.34 per diluted share and adjusted returns on average assets and common equity were 0.82% and 6.62%, respectively. 
Net interest income for second quarter of 2017 increased $782 thousand, or 20.4%, to $4.6 million, primarily due to growth in average interest earning assets totaling $74.7 million, or 21.2%, to $427.4 million when compared to 2016. Our net interest margin remained stable and was 4.34% for the second quarter of 2017 compared to 4.38% in 2016. Average loans in the quarter increased $54.8, million or 23.2%, to $290.6 million and average securities increased $23.3 million, or 28.9%, to $103.7 million when compared to the second quarter of 2016. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, net interest income increased $1.4 million or 19.3% to $8.9 million, primarily due to growth in average interest earning assets totaling $72.2 million, or 20.8%, to $419.5 million when compared to the second quarter of 2016. The Company's net interest margin remained stable and was 4.29% for the six months ended 2017 compared to 4.33% in 2016. Average loans for the six months ended 2017 increased $52.5 million or 22.6% to $284.4 million and average securities increased $19.1 million or 23.2% to $101.6 million when compared to the second quarter of 2016. Increases in loans and securities for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2017 represent organic growth funded with low cost core deposits.
The provision for loan losses was $300 thousand for the second quarter of 2017, $170 thousand higher than the comparable period in 2016 and $450 thousand for the six months ended June 30, 2017, $175 thousand higher than 2016. The higher provision is reflective of loan growth experienced in the Company's higher yielding commercial and consumer loan categories. As of June 30, 2017, Esquire had no delinquent loans and no non-performing assets. Additionally, the Company had no charge-offs for the quarter ended June 30, 2017.
Non-interest income increased $317 thousand or 30.4%, to $1.4 million for second quarter of 2017, and increased $535 thousand, or 26.4%, to $2.6 million for the six months ended 2017. These increases were primarily due to the growth in customer related fees and anchored by the continued success of the Company's merchant services platform. 
Non-interest expense increased $645 thousand to $4.2 million in the second quarter of 2017 and increased $1.2 million to $8.2 million for the six months ended 2017. These increases were primarily driven by increases in employee compensation and benefits costs and occupancy and equipment costs. The increase in compensation and benefit costs was due to the Company's continued growth and related hiring efforts as well as increases in current salaries. The increase in occupancy and equipment costs was due to the consolidation of administrative offices, executive offices and employees into the Company's new corporate headquarters in Jericho, NY to increase efficiency and productivity. The Company's efficiency ratio decreased to 69.7% and 71.4% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017.
The effective tax rate for second quarter of 2017 was 32.0% due to tax benefits resulting from the exercise of certain stock options during the quarter. The Company expects the effective tax rate to return to a more normalized rate of approximately 39.0% for the remainder of the year.
Balance Sheet and Asset Quality
At June 30, 2017, total assets were $455.8 million, reflecting a $68.2 million or 17.6% increase from June 30, 2016. This increase is primarily attributable to increases in loans totaling $54.2 million or 21.4% to $307.4 million and increases in securities totaling $16.0 million or 19.6% to $97.3 million at June 30, 2017. This growth was primarily funded with low cost core deposits. Esquire Bank had no non-performing assets at June 30, 2017 or 2016. The allowance for loan losses was $3.8 million, or 1.24% of total loans, as compared to $3.1 million, or 1.22% of total loans, at June 30, 2016. Premises and equipment increased to $2.7 million at June 30, 2017 from $1.6 million due to the completion of our new corporate headquarters and related investments in technology. The Company believes that consolidating its administrative and executive areas throughout the bank in its new headquarters will increase efficiency and productivity, thereby enhancing our customer service. 
Total deposits were $376.4 million at June 30, 2017, a $42.9 million, or 12.9%, increase from June 30, 2016. This was primarily due to a $35.3 million, or 36.7%, increase in non-interest bearing demand deposits to $131.6 million at June 30, 2017 from June 30, 2016. The Company also continued to prudently manage its balance sheet through its mass tort deposit sweep programs, maintaining off-balance sheet funds totaling $203.6 million at June 30, 2017. These funds are a current source of fee based income and should be a source of deposit growth in the future.
Stockholders' equity increased $24.7 million to $77.0 million at June 30, 2017 primarily due to our successful IPO. The Company sold 1,800,000 shares and selling stockholders sold 563,873 shares of Esquire common stock at $14.00 per share in the offering. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders nor did selling stockholders include any members of the board of directors or executive management. The offering resulted in net proceeds to the Company of $21.7 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering related expenses. On July 20, 2017, the Company sold 354,580 additional shares of common stock at the public offering price of $14.00 per share pursuant to the underwriter's overallotment option. The net proceeds to the Company, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses associated with the over-allotment option, were approximately $4.6 million. Esquire Bank remains well above bank regulatory "Well Capitalized" standards. 
With excess capital as its foundation, the Company anticipates continued earnings growth in 2017 driven by its robust commercial, post settlement consumer and small business loan pipelines, as well as its merchant services and other fee income.

Adjusted net income, which is used to compute adjusted return on average assets, adjusted return on average common equity and adjusted earnings per share, excludes the impact of a tax benefit related to certain stock option exercises during the period.  
The efficiency ratio, adjusted, is a non-GAAP measure of expense control relative to adjusted revenue. We calculate the efficiency ratio, adjusted, by dividing total noninterest expenses, as determined under GAAP, by the sum of total net interest income and total noninterest income, each as determined under GAAP, but excluding net gains on securities and other non-recurring income sources, if applicable, from this calculation, which we refer to below as adjusted revenue. We believe that this provides one reasonable measure of core expenses relative to core revenue.
We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide information that is important to investors and that is useful in understanding our financial position, results and ratios. However, these non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental and are not a substitute for an analysis based on GAAP measures. As other companies may use different calculations for this measure, this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures by other companies.

Esquire Financial Holdings, Inc. Reports Second Quarter 2017 Results
Growth in Capital, Net Income, Fee Income, Loans and Core Deposits 


July 25, 2017 -- 





!-- AddToAny BEGIN -->




















 JERICHO, N.Y., July 25, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Esquire Financial Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: ESQ) (the "Company"), the holding company for Esquire Bank, National Association ("Esquire Bank"), today announced its operating results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017. Significant achievements during the quarter include:  Successfully completed the Company's initial public offering ("IPO") of common stock resulting in net proceeds of $21.7 million on June 30, 2017. On July 20, 2017, the underwriter exercised its full over-allotment option resulting in additional net proceeds of $4.6 million. Net income increased 37.3% to $1.0 million, or $0.20 per diluted common share. Adjusted(1) net income increased 23.1% to $921 thousand, or $0.18 per diluted share. Net interest income for the second quarter increased $782 thousand, or 20.4%, to $4.6 million, supported by our strong net interest margin of 4.34%. On a linked quarter basis, loans increased $16.9 million or 23.3% annualized to $307.4 million from $290.6 million for the first quarter of 2017, primarily driven by our higher yielding commercial and consumer loan categories. Continued solid asset quality metrics and reserve coverage with no non-performing assets and an allowance for loan losses to total loans of 1.24% at June 30, 2017. Non-interest income consisting primarily of our merchant services platform increased 30.4% to $1.4 million or 22.7% of total revenue. Deposits totaled $376.4 million, a $42.9 million or 12.9% increase from the second quarter of 2016 with a cost of funds of 0.14% (including demand deposits). Off-balance sheet funds totaled $203.6 million at June 30, 2017. Returns on average assets and common equity were 0.95% and 7.64%. Adjusted(1) returns on average assets and common equity were 0.85% and 6.85%. Esquire Bank remains well above the bank regulatory "Well Capitalized" standards. "Our successful IPO, including the subsequent exercise of the over-allotment option, is a testament to our unique and attractive business model," stated Dennis Shields, Executive Chairman. "Our solid capital base, anchored by a diverse list of new institutional investors, will support our future growth and business initiatives." "Our three key paths for continued high performance are our strong net interest margin, diverse mix of fee based income and our branchless distribution network," stated Andrew C. Sagliocca, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our Company is at a true inflection point for scalability and profitability."

Net Earnings and Returns Net income for the quarter was $1.0 million or $0.20 per diluted share, compared to $748 thousand or $0.15 per diluted share for 2016.  Returns on average assets and common equity for the current quarter were 0.95% and 7.64% compared to 0.83% and 6.03% in 2016, respectively. For the second quarter of 2017, the effective tax rate of 32.0% was lower than anticipated due to tax benefits resulting from the exercise of certain stock options during the quarter. Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2017 was $1.8 million or $0.36 per diluted share, compared to $1.4 million or $0.27 per diluted share for 2016.  Returns on average assets and common equity for the six months ended June 30, 2017 were 0.87% and 7.02% compared to 0.78% and 5.65% in 2016, respectively.   Adjusted net income for the quarter was $921 thousand or $0.18 per diluted share and adjusted returns on average assets and common equity were 0.85% and 6.85%, respectively. Adjusted net income for the six months ended 2017 was $1.7 million or $0.34 per diluted share and adjusted returns on average assets and common equity were 0.82% and 6.62%, respectively.  Net interest income for second quarter of 2017 increased $782 thousand, or 20.4%, to $4.6 million, primarily due to growth in average interest earning assets totaling $74.7 million, or 21.2%, to $427.4 million when compared to 2016. Our net interest margin remained stable and was 4.34% for the second quarter of 2017 compared to 4.38% in 2016. Average loans in the quarter increased $54.8, million or 23.2%, to $290.6 million and average securities increased $23.3 million, or 28.9%, to $103.7 million when compared to the second quarter of 2016. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, net interest income increased $1.4 million or 19.3% to $8.9 million, primarily due to growth in average interest earning assets totaling $72.2 million, or 20.8%, to $419.5 million when compared to the second quarter of 2016. The Company's net interest margin remained stable and was 4.29% for the six months ended 2017 compared to 4.33% in 2016. Average loans for the six months ended 2017 increased $52.5 million or 22.6% to $284.4 million and average securities increased $19.1 million or 23.2% to $101.6 million when compared to the second quarter of 2016. Increases in loans and securities for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2017 represent organic growth funded with low cost core deposits. The provision for loan losses was $300 thousand for the second quarter of 2017, $170 thousand higher than the comparable period in 2016 and $450 thousand for the six months ended June 30, 2017, $175 thousand higher than 2016. The higher provision is reflective of loan growth experienced in the Company's higher yielding commercial and consumer loan categories. As of June 30, 2017, Esquire had no delinquent loans and no non-performing assets. Additionally, the Company had no charge-offs for the quarter ended June 30, 2017. Non-interest income increased $317 thousand or 30.4%, to $1.4 million for second quarter of 2017, and increased $535 thousand, or 26.4%, to $2.6 million for the six months ended 2017. These increases were primarily due to the growth in customer related fees and anchored by the continued success of the Company's merchant services platform.  Non-interest expense increased $645 thousand to $4.2 million in the second quarter of 2017 and increased $1.2 million to $8.2 million for the six months ended 2017. These increases were primarily driven by increases in employee compensation and benefits costs and occupancy and equipment costs. The increase in compensation and benefit costs was due to the Company's continued growth and related hiring efforts as well as increases in current salaries. The increase in occupancy and equipment costs was due to the consolidation of administrative offices, executive offices and employees into the Company's new corporate headquarters in Jericho, NY to increase efficiency and productivity. The Company's efficiency ratio decreased to 69.7% and 71.4% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017. The effective tax rate for second quarter of 2017 was 32.0% due to tax benefits resulting from the exercise of certain stock options during the quarter. The Company expects the effective tax rate to return to a more normalized rate of approximately 39.0% for the remainder of the year. Balance Sheet and Asset Quality At June 30, 2017, total assets were $455.8 million, reflecting a $68.2 million or 17.6% increase from June 30, 2016. This increase is primarily attributable to increases in loans totaling $54.2 million or 21.4% to $307.4 million and increases in securities totaling $16.0 million or 19.6% to $97.3 million at June 30, 2017. This growth was primarily funded with low cost core deposits. Esquire Bank had no non-performing assets at June 30, 2017 or 2016. The allowance for loan losses was $3.8 million, or 1.24% of total loans, as compared to $3.1 million, or 1.22% of total loans, at June 30, 2016. Premises and equipment increased to $2.7 million at June 30, 2017 from $1.6 million due to the completion of our new corporate headquarters and related investments in technology. The Company believes that consolidating its administrative and executive areas throughout the bank in its new headquarters will increase efficiency and productivity, thereby enhancing our customer service.  Total deposits were $376.4 million at June 30, 2017, a $42.9 million, or 12.9%, increase from June 30, 2016. This was primarily due to a $35.3 million, or 36.7%, increase in non-interest bearing demand deposits to $131.6 million at June 30, 2017 from June 30, 2016. The Company also continued to prudently manage its balance sheet through its mass tort deposit sweep programs, maintaining off-balance sheet funds totaling $203.6 million at June 30, 2017. These funds are a current source of fee based income and should be a source of deposit growth in the future. Stockholders' equity increased $24.7 million to $77.0 million at June 30, 2017 primarily due to our successful IPO. The Company sold 1,800,000 shares and selling stockholders sold 563,873 shares of Esquire common stock at $14.00 per share in the offering. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders nor did selling stockholders include any members of the board of directors or executive management. The offering resulted in net proceeds to the Company of $21.7 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering related expenses. On July 20, 2017, the Company sold 354,580 additional shares of common stock at the public offering price of $14.00 per share pursuant to the underwriter's overallotment option. The net proceeds to the Company, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses associated with the over-allotment option, were approximately $4.6 million. Esquire Bank remains well above bank regulatory "Well Capitalized" standards.  With excess capital as its foundation, the Company anticipates continued earnings growth in 2017 driven by its robust commercial, post settlement consumer and small business loan pipelines, as well as its merchant services and other fee income.

We calculate the efficiency ratio, adjusted, by dividing total noninterest expenses, as determined under GAAP, by the sum of total net interest income and total noninterest income, each as determined under GAAP, but excluding net gains on securities and other non-recurring income sources, if applicable, from this calculation, which we refer to below as adjusted revenue. We believe that this provides one reasonable measure of core expenses relative to core revenue. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide information that is important to investors and that is useful in understanding our financial position, results and ratios. However, these non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental and are not a substitute for an analysis based on GAAP measures. As other companies may use different calculations for this measure, this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures by other companies.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.      Key Stock Data    P/E Ratio (TTM) N/A     EPS (TTM) N/A     Market Cap $100.37 M     Shares Outstanding 6.86 M     Public Float 5.58 M     Yield ESQ has not issued dividends in more than 1 year.

Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month. Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 4    3.82      Net Money Flow ($)  24,948    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock. A ratio above one suggests greater buying pressure, below one suggests greater selling.

GuruFocus Profitability Rank ranks how profitable a company is and how likely the companys business will stay that way. It is based on these factors:

1. Operating Margin
2. Trend of the Operating Margin (5-year average). The company with an uptrend profit margin has a higher rank.
3. Consistency of the profitability
4. Piotroski F-Score
5. Predictability Rank

The maximum rank is 10. A rank of 7 or higher means a higher profitability and may stay that way. A rank of 3 or lower indicates that the company has had trouble to make a profit.

Profitability Rank is not directly related to the Financial Strength Rank. But if a company is consistently profitable, its financial strength will be stronger.

Based on the public offering price of $14.00 per share, we estimate that the
net proceeds from the sale of the shares of common stock by us will be
approximately $21.9 million (or approximately $26.5 million if the underwriter
exercises in full its option to purchase additional shares of common stock from
us), after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us.

In order to maintain our capital and liquidity ratios at acceptable levels while
we continue to grow our balance sheet with commercial real estate loans and
commercial loans, we have decided to undertake a public offering at this time.
Additionally, our lending limit is expected to increase by $4.0 million
following the completion of this offering, which will allow us to originate
larger loans and be more competitive in the market place.

We intend to use the net proceeds of the offering to support the growth in
Esquire Bank’s loan portfolio, including the possibility of making larger loans
due to our increased legal lending limit, to finance potential strategic
acquisitions to the extent such opportunities arise and for other general
corporate purposes, which could include other growth initiatives. We have no
current plans, arrangements or understandings relating to any specific
acquisition or similar transaction and management has not yet determined the
types of businesses that they might target.

Our management will retain broad discretion to allocate the net proceeds of this
offering, and the precise amounts and timing of our use of the net proceeds of
this offering will depend upon market conditions, as well as other factors.
Until we deploy the proceeds of this offering for the uses described above, we
expect to hold such proceeds in short-term investments.

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock by
the selling stockholders.


The bank and non-bank financial services industries in our markets and
surrounding areas is highly competitive. We compete with a wide range of
regional and national banks located in our market areas as well as non-bank
commercial finance companies on a nationwide basis. We experience competition in
both lending and attracting funds as well as merchant processing services from
commercial banks, savings associations, credit unions, consumer finance
companies, pension trusts, mutual funds, insurance companies, mortgage bankers
and brokers, brokerage and investment banking firms, non-bank lenders,
government agencies and certain other non-financial institutions. Many of these
competitors have more assets, capital and lending limits, and resources than we
do and may be able to conduct more intensive and broader-based promotional
efforts to reach both commercial and individual customers. Competition for
deposit products can depend heavily on pricing because of the ease with which
customers can transfer deposits from one institution to another.

We define the market area for legal community products as law firms practicing
within the United States, United States territories and United States
commonwealths, and we serve the litigation industry on a nationwide basis. For
traditional community banking products and services, our primary market areas
are Nassau and New York (Manhattan) Counties in New York and secondarily
throughout the state of New York.

Competition for Attorney-Related Loans is derived primarily from eight to ten
nationally-oriented financial companies that specialize in this market. Some of
these companies are focused exclusively on loans to law firms, while others
offer loans to plaintiffs as well. While some overlap exists between the
litigation market loan products offered by Esquire Bank and these companies
(primarily lines of credit, case-cost and post-settlement commercial loans),
there are a number of critical differences that management believes give Esquire
Bank a competitive advantage:

• Esquire Bank can offer more competitive rates on loans compared to specialty
  finance companies because its cost of funds is much lower than the funding
  costs for these non-bank competitors. A number of these companies purchase the
  settlements from law firms at steep discounts, which has drawn negative
  attention from some state regulators. Esquire Bank does not purchase
  settlements, it uses them to collateralize loans;
 
• the non-bank companies are not able to offer deposit products or business
  services such as remote deposit capture or letters of credit, or debit cards;
  and
 
• non-banks cannot offer products uniformly across the country because they are
  not national banks.
 
We have established our niche in the litigation community, which, according to
the Towers Watson 2011 Update on U.S. Tort Cost Trends, was an approximately
$264.6 billion market in the United States in 2010, through the strategic
development of a business model that understands our market’s unique needs and
provides access to our target customers. We have designed unique, value added
products and services for our current and potential clients and created a
distribution network with direct access to the market through the experience and
networks of our Board of Directors, attorney stockholders, customers and
management. A number of our directors, investors and customers are active
members of leading litigation law firms in the nation, national and state bar
associations as well as other industry leading companies. In addition, we have
established informal affiliations or relationships with key industry
organizations such as the American Association for Justice, Mass Tort Made
Perfect, New York State Trial Lawyers Association, Consumer Attorneys of
California, Florida Justice Association and others, which we believe gives us
access to thousands of trial attorneys across the United States.

Our traditional community banking market area has a diversified economy typical
of most urban population centers, with the majority of employment provided by
services, wholesale/retail trade finance/ insurance/real estate (“FIRE”) and
construction. Services account for the largest employment sector across the two
primary market area counties, while wholesale/retail trade accounts for the
second largest employment sector in Nassau and New York Counties. New York City
is one of the premier financial centers in the world, and thus FIRE is the third
largest employment sector in New York County.


Company Description
We are a bank holding company headquartered in Jericho, New York and registered
under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”). Through
our wholly owned bank subsidiary, Esquire Bank, National Association, we are a
full service commercial bank dedicated to serving the


 financial needs of the
legal and small business communities on a national basis, as well as commercial
and retail customers in the New York metropolitan market. We offer tailored
products and solutions to the legal community and their clients as well as
dynamic and flexible merchant services solutions to small business owners, both
on a national basis. We also offer traditional banking products for businesses
and consumers in our local market area (a subset of the New York metropolitan
market). We believe these activities, primarily anchored by our legal community
focus, generate a stable source of low cost core deposits and a diverse asset
base to support our overall operations. Our commercial and consumer loans
tailored to the litigation market (“Attorney-Related Loans”) enhance our overall
yield on our loan portfolio, enabling us to earn attractive risk-adjusted net
interest margins. Additionally, our merchant processing activities have
generated a relatively stable source of fee income. We believe our unique and
dynamic business model distinguishes us from other banks and non-bank financial
services companies in the markets in which we operate as demonstrated by
comparing our performance metrics for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and
2016 as well as our year ended 2016 and 2015.

For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016:

• Our net income increased 26.8% to $815,000 or $0.16 per diluted share.
 
• We had a net interest margin of 4.23%, stabilized by a low cost of funds of
  0.15% on our deposits.
 
• Our loans increased 23.0%, or $54.3 million, to $290.6 million, with no 
  non-performing loans and solid asset quality metrics.
 
• Our noninterest income increased 22.0% to $1.2 million, which represented 
  21.9% of our total revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2017,
  primarily driven by our merchant services platform.
 
• As of March 31, 2017, our total assets, loans, deposits and stockholders’
  equity totaled $438.1 million, $290.6 million, $383.4 million and $53.2 
  million, respectively.
 
For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:
 
• Our net income increased 140.8% to $2.8 million, or $0.55 per diluted share.
 
• We had a net interest margin of 4.25%, an increase from 3.74%, stabilized by
  a low cost of funds of 0.15% on our deposits.
 
• Our loans increased 24.1%, or $54.1 million, to $278.6 million, with no
  non-performing loans and solid asset quality metrics.
 
• Our noninterest income increased 40.2% to $4.1 million, which represented 
  20.9% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily 
  driven by our growing merchant services platform.
 
• As of December 31, 2016, our total assets, loans, deposits and stockholders’
  equity totaled $424.8 million, $278.6 million, $370.8 million and $52.2 
  million, respectively.
 
Both 2015 and 2016 were transformational years for the Company, due in part to
the successful execution of our unique and dynamic business model. We believe
our ongoing commitment to the litigation and small business communities have
been, and should continue to be, the foundation for our success. In August 2015,
we closed our private placement offering of common stock and preferred stock
that began in 2014, raising net proceeds totaling $17.2 million and successfully
converted Esquire Financial Holdings, Inc. and Esquire Bank from a savings and
loan holding company and savings bank to a bank holding company and national
bank, respectively. We believe that the additional capital, coupled with the
conversion to a national bank, has enhanced and should continue to enhance our
commercial loan growth in the legal industry and business communities we serve.

We remain true to our commitment to serve the litigation community and our
commercial customers through our tailored and innovative products and solutions.
We believe Esquire Bank’s approach to the legal community is simple yet
effective — we listen to the customer’s needs and tailor products and services
around those needs. Our management team includes attorneys and bankers who have
serviced the legal community throughout their careers, which is a
differentiating factor and key to our robust attorney network. This model
continues to set us apart from other institutions that offer a “one product fits
all” model. Our relationships within the litigation community are a key
contributor to our loan growth, strong loan yields, and low cost core deposits.
The litigation community represented more than 70% of our deposit base at
March 31, 2017. In addition to our lending and deposit gathering activities, we
have also remained steadfast in growing our merchant services platform. We
provide dynamic and flexible merchant services solutions to small business
owners. Our merchant services platform has grown to approximately 13,000 small
businesses at March 31, 2017, which generated most of our noninterest income and
represented 21.9% of our revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and
20.9% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. We believe our
merchant services platform represents a significant opportunity for future
growth in fee income, core deposits and enhanced lending opportunities.

Our low cost core deposits (deposits, excluding time deposits), representing our
primary funding source for loan growth, totaled $360.7 million at March 31, 2017
resulting in a total cost of deposits of 0.15%. These stable low cost funds are
driven by our attorney operating and escrow deposits, representing more than 70%
of our total deposit base at March 31, 2017. We intend to continue to prudently
manage growth in deposits, utilizing customer sweep programs for our mass tort
and class action business banking programs. We do not have a traditional “brick
and mortar” branch network to support our deposit growth. Instead, we rely on
our robust attorney network to gather deposits and our customers utilize on-line
cash management technology to manage their operating and escrow accounts as well
as their business banking needs across the country. We believe the lack of
branch infrastructure coupled with our strong net interest margin and growth
will continue to drive our efficiency ratio below the 73% reported for the three
months ended March 31, 2017.

With a growing and generally unseasoned loan portfolio, our credit risk may
continue to increase and our future performance could be adversely affected;
however, we have invested in and developed underwriting and credit management
processes tailored to each of the products we offer in order to minimize these
risks. We are committed to continuing to invest in and develop our underwriting
and credit management processes to ensure our asset quality remains high and we
minimize our credit risk. At March 31, 2017, the average age of our loan
portfolio was 2.10 years and we currently do not have any non-performing loans.

Esquire Bank, National Association is subject to comprehensive regulation and
examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) and Esquire
Financial Holdings, Inc. is supervised by the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System (“FRB”).
