Expanded Metal

Gibraltar's AMICO and Dramex and companies offer wide varieties of expanded metal products.
AMICO's expanded metal products are the most versatile you will find for almost any industrial or commercial application. These products allow excellent control of light and circulation of air. They also provide clear visibility in such applications as overhead walkways, maintenance platforms and other areas where visible security might be necessary. 
Expanded Metal is made from steel plates or sheets that are simultaneously slit and expanded in a cold drawn operation to form diamond shaped openings of uniform size and thickness.

Beyond this small… MoreGibraltar Industries' IT department has a central location at its Buffalo, NY, headquarters with an IT staff led by the Corporate Vice President of Information Services. The VP is assisted by a manager who oversees networks and security.

Beyond this small centralized group, the company has IT directors at its subsidiaries, including Air Vent, USP Structural Connectors, and Alabama Metals Industries (AMICO). In the area of applications, the firm relies on consultants for any development or customization work that needs to be done. Additionally, business unit managers have particular technical expertise in certain areas, like HRIS, and deal with some of the company's applications. 

The company has a number of subsidiaries, many of which have also been acquiring firms, and as a result operates in over 50 locations. These different divisions are using different software applications. While the applications have been moved to the company's central (virtualized) data center, the IT staff has only begun the work of consolidating these systems onto a standardized Oracle ERP platform. This process involves implementing a test pilot at each location before bringing the division live with the new Oracle applications.

The CEO posts positive reviews......

Here's my experience:Great service, but slow cleaning the first time I used them(12/2012). Called for our second session and scheduled in January of 2013 for March of 2013, no one showed. Called no answer. Oh and the 3 session special that is on the website, they won t sell it because their web guy is supposed to be taking it down 5 months ago!!!! If you see a positive review and the name is Shannon...it s the owner and most likely FAKE!! Had I know I would have saved the money. I will amend this should they get back to me and rectify this properly.

                        I purchased 2-3hr house cleanings for $150.00 which is a bargain for detailed professional cleaning.  I am preparing my home for the holidays.  I was not sure if they would be able to finish my " long list " of tasks.  Not only did they finish on time...but everything was detailed.  I was so happy !  Now if I could just find someone to cook. Thank you Gibraltar for your kind and courteous staff.
