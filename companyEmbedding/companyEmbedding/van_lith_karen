  MakeMusic, Inc. (NASDAQ:MMUS) announced its board of directors has appointed Karen van Lith (formerly Karen Beckwith) as president, chief executive officer and director, effective June 13, 2011. Van Lith replaces interim CEO, Jeff Koch, who will remain on the board of directors.   Karen van Lith (Photo: Business Wire)   Robert Morrison, chairman of the board of MakeMusic, stated, “We are very excited to welcome someone of Karen van Lith’s caliber to the MakeMusic management team. Karen has an exceptional record of transforming companies through conversions to new technology platforms and growth acceleration. We believe MakeMusic is poised to enter into its next phase of growth as we invest in new products and reposition our current products to take advantage of newer technologies. Karen has the skill set and the experience to lead MakeMusic in its continuing evolution. We also thank Jeff for serving as interim CEO and look forward to his continued contribution and service on the board.”  Karen van Lith stated, “I am very passionate about MakeMusic’s business as well as its future growth prospects. MakeMusic has strong, well established brands and loyal customers. The music industry has always embraced the use of new technology and as such, I look forward to leveraging my strengths to further expand and enhance MakeMusic’s brands.”  Van Lith, 51, brings 20 years of leadership experience to MakeMusic. Throughout her career she has consistently implemented change to drive growth and profitability. For the past three years van Lith has provided interim CEO leadership to companies in start-up, high growth and crisis phases, in addition to running her own internet-marketing services company. From 2000 through 2007, she held the role of CEO & president of Gelco Information Network, a SaaS company serving multi-national companies around the world. Prior to that she was president of Ceridian Canada and SVP business development at Ceridian Corporation, where she led the company’s M&A efforts. Van Lith currently serves as a corporate director of Associated Banc-Corp, a publicly-held regional bank holding company headquartered in Green Bay, WI, and of Xata Corp., a publicly-held SaaS company serving the trucking industry headquartered in Eden Prairie. She also served on the board of CNS, a publicly-held consumer goods company headquartered in Eden Prairie until its sale to GlaxoSmithKline in 2006. Additionally, van Lith serves on the board of Food for Hungry Minds, a non-profit organization that develops and runs schools and provides a path out of poverty for the poorest children in the Philippines and Honduras.

 After a year on the job, MakeMusic President, CEO and director Karen van Lith is out, the Eden Prairie software firm announced Thursday.
Without further explanation, board Chairman Robert Morrison said in a statement, "On behalf of MakeMusic, I would like to wish Ms. van Lith the best in her future endeavors."
The company said Chief Financial Officer Karen VanDerBosch will act as interim CEO as the board searches for a replacement for Van Lith.


Morrison said that during Van Lith's tenure, "MakeMusic made progress towards fulfilling its strategic direction, enhancing the company's technology architecture, and extending its core product value into new product innovations and platforms."
However, in a May 1 earnings statement, the company reported a first-quarter loss of $840,000 compared with a net loss of $180,000 a year earlier. Net revenue was $4.2 million compared with $4 million a year earlier.
In 2011, the company reported net income of $4,000 compared to $1 million a year earlier.
MakeMusic creates and markets software to assist in the composition, teaching and performance of music.

As of last year, MakeMusic had been through four CEOs in five years.
