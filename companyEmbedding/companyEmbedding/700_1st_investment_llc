In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporations Compared to LLCs









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Corporation&rtrif;Corporations Compared to LLCs 













        Corporations Compared to LLCs      
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are one of the newest types of business entities. Like corporations, they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships. Whether an LLC or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business. The best comparison here is between an LLC and an S corporation, because an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S corporation.
Social Security Taxes
The owners of the S corporation can take out some profits without Social Security taxes. For a large business in which the owners take out salaries of $118,500 or more plus profits, there would not be much difference, since the Social Security tax cuts out at that level as of 2015. However, for a smaller business, in which an owner could take out a $30,000 salary and $20,000 profit, the extra taxes on the $20,000 would be over $3,000.
Raising Money
If a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people, the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the LLC.
Liability Protection
An important advantage of an LLC is that in some states, a creditor cannot collect the members’ LLC distributions. With a corporation, creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets, but can collect the shareholder’s dividends.
Profits, Losses, and Taxes
The other advantages of LLCs are found in certain tax situations. For example, an LLC can make special allocations of profits and losses among members, whereas S corporations cannot. S corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership. In an LLC, money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis (and lower the taxes) of the owners, whereas in an S corporation, it does not. Contributing property to set up an LLC is not taxable, even for minority interest owners, whereas for a corporation, regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business.
Foreign Ownership
The owners of an LLC can be foreign persons, other corporations, or any kind of trust, whereas the owners of S corporations cannot. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, while an S corporation is limited to one hundred.
Management Options
LLCs are also popular because of their flexible management options, allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations. LLCs have fewer formalities than corporations, another advantage for some business owners.
Fringe Benefits
Corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity. Various retirement, stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations. Plus, sole proprietors, partners and employees owning more than 2% of an S corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits (such as group-term life insurance, medical reimbursement plans, medical insurance premiums and parking). Shareholder-employees of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.

Meet Chicago's first 'enlightened' hedge fund. Yes, enlightened


There's no CEO or dress code. But there is a feng shui consultant and nostalgia for the early days of the hedge-fund craze.No reception desk or smiling gatekeeper greets you at the entrance of Satori Investment Partners LLC's office. There is just one big, red Oriental rug, courtesy of the feng shui consultant who helped the new hedge-fund firm incorporate the five Zen elements into its office.  The red rug signifies fire. The loftlike office's concrete walls are earth, and overhead ducts are metal. How to incorporate water is an open question, but the partners have nixed cheesy fountains. To find the fifth element, wood, you only have to walk ahead to the heart of the evolving business, where two light-colored tables are pushed back-to-back—placeholders for a round maple centerpiece being handcrafted by an artisan. It will anchor a semicircle of desks, each a chair-spin distance away, so Satori's founding partners can swing around anytime for impromptu meetings. “Trying to take ego out of the equation will be a key to our success,” says the head of trading, a former Big Ten football player named John Kiple.  It's all part of an effort to distinguish Satori as a softer, more “sustainable” hedge fund  and to summon the collaborative spirit Mr. Kiple and his four partners say they felt early in their careers at pioneering Chicago options trading firm O'Connor & Associates and a branded successor. That was before an explosion of growth in the industry changed the marketplace and the nature of their jobs. “We've all worked together for a long period of time, and so we do know, like and trust each other,” says Rich Excell, chief investment officer and primary pitchman.







Satori Investment Partners LLC's John Kiple, from left, Patrick Whalen, Michael Taylor, Rich Excell and Chris Dardanes Photo: Manuel MartinezWith every decision, from incorporating feng shui to adopting the name “Satori,” which is a Japanese Zen Buddhist word meaning “awakening” or “enlightenment,” they are intent on distancing themselves from the stereotypical image of megalomaniac hedge-fund managers. “Most hedge funds are autocratic and single-partner entities with strong hierarchies where the employees are just contracted and functionaries,” says Patrick Whalen, a New York transplant who is chief operating officer. ”We are building a team approach where everyone is asked to contribute in numerous ways.” To be clear, there's no mistaking these middle-aged traders for New Age gurus: They can't always remember all five Zen elements, and the vibe they're going for doesn't extend to socially conscious investing.  And while being distinct is one thing, raising $250 million from investors, as Satori aims, is quite another.  Drinker Biddle & Reath LLP attorney David Matteson, who has long worked with hedge funds, says it's easy to launch a fund. The challenge is luring investors. “It's just hard to be successful,” he says, “to attract the capital necessary to make it a viable concern.”   At Satori, there's no CEO and no dress code. On a recent Tuesday, one partner wears a T-shirt stamped with the word “intrepid,” and another a long-sleeved golf shirt. Sometimes, they say, a meeting shifts at the last minute to the golf course, a place where the  future partners hatched the idea for the firm.  Both 46, Mr. Excell and Mr. Kiple have known each other since 1990, when they started at O'Connor the same day. They collaborated on and off over the next 20 years, even as their firm went through a tumble of transactions. (It was acquired in 1992 by Swiss Bank Corp., which in turn was absorbed in 1998 by UBS AG, Switzerland's biggest bank.) Through it all, O'Connor employees grouped together. Eventually the two men went on to other companies, but by 2012, each had returned to the “O'Connor” fund at UBS. Over lunch one day, they reflected on how much the firm—and the industry—had changed from the independent days when trading managers pulled together and shared in gains and losses. That spirit, they agreed, had faded as teams grew more specialized and siloed in their work, with certain groups rewarded for performance more than the whole. “At some point in time, the structure of the hedge-fund industry changed. Collaboration was lost along that path,” Mr. Kiple explains.

Their shop talk spilled over onto golf rounds with another O'Connor pal, Chris Dardanes, 50, who had left the firm along with Mr. Kiple in 2003 to found statistical consulting firm Van Buren Advisors. (They're still stakeholders but no longer in management.) They also reached out to Michael Taylor, 48, an O'Connor portfolio manager who sat near Mr. Excell at the office for years.  Casual talk soon turned into long lunch meetings at Monk's Pub on Wells Street. To make up for squatting at a table for hours intently brainstorming how to recapture that old O'Connor rhythm, they left big tips for Monk's waitresses. Then, in 2012, prompted by financial losses and intense post-crisis government scrutiny of the industry, UBS began a massive restructuring. Mr. Kiple, Mr. Excell and Mr. Taylor exited one by one. (They won't say whether their departures were voluntary; Mr. Excell notes only that UBS is generous in its breakups.) They began seriously plotting their firm. Soon, Mr. Dardanes came on board.  At the suggestion of a big bank sales manager, they contacted Mr. Whalen, 51, a New Yorker whose views of the industry were similar and who had worked for O'Connor early in his career before shifting to such Wall Street firms as Morgan Stanley and Lehman Bros. Holdings Inc. With a divorce in the works and his four kids in high school or college, he agreed to sign on as Satori chief operating officer and chief compliance officer and move to Chicago.  For what they consider the culminating chapter of their careers, each of the five partners ponied up equal investments for equal ownership stakes to start Satori. “All endeavors require taking risk—especially startups,” Mr. Taylor says.Hedge funds largely are a phenomenon of the past 25 years, with the amount of capital invested in them rising nearly every year since 1990. At the end of the second quarter of 2014, an astounding $2.80 trillion had been invested. In the early days, hedge funds mainly catered to high-net-worth clients who sought steady strong returns—and who wanted to avoid extreme swings in the market—through the funds' hedging techniques. Under federal law, such funds are open only to individual investors with a net worth of at least $1 million, excluding their primary residence, or $200,000 in annual income. That's because they're generally less transparent, with fewer federal disclosure requirements than, say, mutual funds. They're riskier, too, because there are fewer limits on the types of investments they make.







In their first decade, hedge funds demonstrated impressive early returns, often of 20-plus percent, so gradually they attracted a flood of big institutional investors such as pension funds and endowments. With the influx, firms swelled and grew more bureaucratic. New funds proliferated: niche funds, copycat funds. But returns mellowed. In 2013, the average return for hedge funds was 9 percent, according to Chicago-based Hedge Fund Research Inc., while the S&P 500 Index was up 30 percent. “The total industry has grown, but much of it is in the most well-established funds,” says Ken Heinz, head of Chicago-based Hedge Fund Research. “To become established is the challenging part.” That's because institutional investors often have a strong bias toward well-known names, such as Chicago giant Citadel LLC. Nearly 90 percent of hedge-fund capital last year flowed into funds that  already have $1 billion under management; the remainder mainly went to funds with less than $100 million.  Satori is the latest in a long line of O'Connor spinoffs trying to gain a foothold. Successful local spawn include Peak6 Investments LP, Getco LLC, Chicago Trading Co. and Wolverine Trading LLC. There doubtless have been failures, too, but those are mostly forgotten. In 2013, almost as many hedge funds liquidated as launched, with 1,060 starting up and 904 closing down. Mr. Heinz argues that the bulk of failures are at funds started by novices who rely on friends and family for investments. New managers who can call on former customers are much more likely to succeed, he says. Still, it's tough to find investors willing to take first-fund risk. Mr. Taylor, Satori's head of research, sees an advantage for smaller firms like Satori over larger ones, where rules and bureaucracy have choked the mission. “Somewhere along the line, those rules kind of distort or lose sight of the fact that there's this end consumer, this investor, for whom we need to deliver the best product,” he says.Satori's partners are in constant communication. They frequently text each other business ideas, to the point that Mr. Excell's teenage daughter tells her father that he spends more time messaging his partners than she does her friends.  To build the firm, it's all about luring capital right now—the trading comes later. In addition to their own contact lists, they've hired Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Bank of America Corp. as brokers to introduce them to prospective investors. So far, they've contacted some 100 prospects since mid-March, meeting some and calling or emailing others.  But it's a steep climb. Mr. Excell says one potential investor told him he looks at 600 to 700 new funds each year.
quote|Nearly as many hedge funds liquidated in 2013 as launched.
For now, they're meeting mainly with investment firms that put together funds made up of hedge funds—such as Chicago-based Grosvenor Capital Management LP. They are also meeting with managers that invest for wealthy families and with institutional investors, though the latter are harder to lure in the early stages. They decline to name any of the prospects. The ask: a minimum $5 million to $10 million investment, with the goal of collecting $250 million. New York is the epicenter of fundraising, so the partners have spent most of their time there. But they've made the occasional trips to California and Texas. The hard part, Mr. Kiple says, is that it's a “long, slow, iterative process,” with an average of six to nine meetings or other “touchpoints” over as many months before someone writes a check.  That slow burn is not the kind of work these Chicago traders know. They're all about fast outcomes, good or bad. “It's an immediate,” says Mr. Kiple, snapping his fingers. “The market tells you how smart or how dumb you are every single day.” Being on the sixth meeting with four or five big investors is “great,” but interest is still hard to gauge, he says.   The Satori partners won't get to invest and trade until later this year. They're developing a strategy that takes long and short positions in stocks and stock options, with an interdisciplinary approach that draws from all of their skills. Mr. Excell is the big-picture guy, scanning the world for economic and geopolitical trends, while Mr. Kiple focuses on event-driven ripples in the markets, like acquisitions mounting in certain industries. Mr. Taylor drills down, monitoring headwinds and tailwinds in industries and at companies. Mr. Dardanes is the “quant man” poring over data from world economies and industries for patterns. As for Mr. Whalen, he tends the operations, overseeing accounting and human resources, among other things. Following the Bernie Madoff scandal, in which investors were bilked of $64 billion, potential customers want to know the business is sound, he says.  To demonstrate their commitment, the partners tell prospects that they've personally got a majority of their “liquid net worth” wrapped up in the fund. They won't say how much that is, but it's likely at least millions of dollars, thanks to each of their two decades of earnings. While they're asking a standard 1.5 percent to 2 percent annual management fee on capital invested and 20 percent of returns, early investors may be able to negotiate better deals. On the cost side, some vendors are allowing a long-term payment schedule. Satori's partners aren't locking themselves into any particular growth goal, but they're optimistic. They draw inspiration from their headquarters' previous tenant: a software company that grew so fast it tripled its staff and was forced to seek bigger digs.Related: Meet Chicago's stock fund stars

In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporations Compared to LLCs









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Corporation&rtrif;Corporations Compared to LLCs 













        Corporations Compared to LLCs      
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are one of the newest types of business entities. Like corporations, they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships. Whether an LLC or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business. The best comparison here is between an LLC and an S corporation, because an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S corporation.
Social Security Taxes
The owners of the S corporation can take out some profits without Social Security taxes. For a large business in which the owners take out salaries of $118,500 or more plus profits, there would not be much difference, since the Social Security tax cuts out at that level as of 2015. However, for a smaller business, in which an owner could take out a $30,000 salary and $20,000 profit, the extra taxes on the $20,000 would be over $3,000.
Raising Money
If a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people, the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the LLC.
Liability Protection
An important advantage of an LLC is that in some states, a creditor cannot collect the members’ LLC distributions. With a corporation, creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets, but can collect the shareholder’s dividends.
Profits, Losses, and Taxes
The other advantages of LLCs are found in certain tax situations. For example, an LLC can make special allocations of profits and losses among members, whereas S corporations cannot. S corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership. In an LLC, money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis (and lower the taxes) of the owners, whereas in an S corporation, it does not. Contributing property to set up an LLC is not taxable, even for minority interest owners, whereas for a corporation, regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business.
Foreign Ownership
The owners of an LLC can be foreign persons, other corporations, or any kind of trust, whereas the owners of S corporations cannot. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, while an S corporation is limited to one hundred.
Management Options
LLCs are also popular because of their flexible management options, allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations. LLCs have fewer formalities than corporations, another advantage for some business owners.
Fringe Benefits
Corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity. Various retirement, stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations. Plus, sole proprietors, partners and employees owning more than 2% of an S corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits (such as group-term life insurance, medical reimbursement plans, medical insurance premiums and parking). Shareholder-employees of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
