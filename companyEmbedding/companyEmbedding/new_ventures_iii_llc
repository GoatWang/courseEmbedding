Tyson Overview







Tyson New Ventures, LLC


Overview
As part of its commitment to innovation and growth, Tyson Foods, Inc. has launched a venture capital fund, Tyson New Ventures, LLC, that will invest in companies developing breakthrough technologies, business models and products to sustainably feed a growing world population.


Tyson will make available $150 million to the fund, which has been named Tyson New Ventures LLC, to complement the company’s continuing investment in innovation in its core fresh meats, poultry and prepared foods businesses. 



The fund will concentrate on three areas in the foods space: commercializing delicious, safe and affordable alternative proteins; tackling food insecurity and food loss through market making and other commercial models; and tapping the internet of food to promote more precise and productive resource application, safety, and consumer empowerment in the food chain. Tyson New Ventures will invest in these entrepreneurial food businesses and leverage Tyson Foods’ expertise to boost their development. The first investment involves Tyson Foods’ previously-announced five percent ownership stake in plant-based protein producer Beyond Meat. 


“This fund is about broadening our exposure to innovative, new forms of protein and ways of producing food, while remaining focused on our core fresh meats, poultry and prepared foods businesses, which are also experiencing tremendous consumer demand and growth,” Monica McGurk, executive vice president of strategy and new ventures and president of foodservice for Tyson Foods.


Approach
Tyson New Ventures will collaborate with promising food entrepreneurs who are pioneering new products and technology that are making meaningful changes and improvement to food systems. 


“We believe we can accelerate the growth of startups through our capabilities in such areas as food and culinary research and development, sourcing, insights, customer relationships and distribution. By doing so, we hope to materially advance the state of the U.S. and global food system.”  McGurk said.


Investment Focus
We are focused on these key investment areas:



Great-Tasting Alternative Proteins


Profitable business models to eliminate food loss and insecurity


“Internet of Food” technologies that leverage big data, drones, robotics or even consumer information platforms to empower consumers and drive more efficient resource application and performance throughout the food chain.


Team
Tyson New Ventures is based in Chicago and led by Mary Kay James, who has been named vice president and general manager. She previously served as managing director of DuPont Ventures, was chairperson of the National Venture Capital Association, Corporate Venture Group, and an advisory board member to Global Corporate Venturing.

James and her team will seek startups that complement Tyson Foods’ existing business and product development efforts. They will focus on the areas of alternative proteins, elimination of food waste and leveraging innovative trends in technology.

Contacts
Entrepreneurs interested in working with us can reach out via email: TysonNewVentures@tyson.com.

Houston Ventures | Seeking operational solutions for the Energy Industry































































































The Energy Industry is being eaten by complexity. Environments are developing in which all components must integrate and communicate.  At Houston Ventures, we understand the inefficiencies of supply chains in the oil and gas industry.
About Our Approach

critical operating issues.
We scale solutions to serve the needs of global
oil and gas customers.
Our approach, refined over the past decade,
helps generate sustainable revenue growth while positioning our portfolio companies as attractive
acquisition targets.









Global Strategies
What are the barriers to small companies who
aim to serve large energy customers? The Energy

it is reluctant to partner with companies that don’t
scale with its own operations.










Let's talk

Do you solve an operational problem for Energy Industry?
Do you have a developed product and at least $1 million
in annualized revenue?
Do you offer a large ROI for your customers?
Do you need at least $2 million?

Founded in 1999, Legacy aggregates over $1.5 billion from over 500 investors who intend that all returns, both principal and gains, will be used for their individual philanthropic interests.

Legacy Venture manages a series of fund-of-funds. We invest in a select group of premier venture capital firms who in turn invest in companies that have included Facebook, LendingClub, Fitbit, YouTube, Skype, Xiaomi, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Airbnb. These venture firms are often highly sought after and in many cases are not accessible to new investors. Legacy has gained access to these venture funds by virtue of its philanthropic mission and its well-connected management team.

About Us
With 20 years of experience, our team has founded and funded more than 60 ventures sourced from some of the world's great technology companies.  We began as the venture capital arm of Lucent's renowned Bell Labs in the mid-90's and became an independent venture firm in 2001.



What We Do

We invest in new ventures with proprietary technology. We take an active role in identifying candidate technologies, building great management teams and developing partnerships with major corporations.

LEARN MORE 



The Rationale

Corporations that invest heavily in R&D often lack channels to market for the opportunities they create. Strategic and financial rewards from commercializing innovations through venturing are often missed. Expertise and capital are needed.

Corporate Partnership

New Venture Partners establishes close, long-term relationships with global technology corporations and other institutions to commercialize their technologies. We seek to leverage the corporate ecosystem to generate financial returns for the corporation and commercial advantage for the new venture.

Our Team
Our founding team has been together for nearly 20 years of venture capital investing in concert with major global corporations.We are supported by a strategic advisory board of executives, academics, and statesmen.

Novinda
Novinda has developed a proprietary technology that effectively removes mercury from post combustion gases of coal fired power plants. Proposed 2011 federal regulation, in addition to existing state regulations, requires the removal of a large portion of mercury, which is toxic to humans. Removal is accomplished with the injection into the furnace flue ducts of a solid sorbent material based on naturally occurring clays. Unlike the principal alternative, activated carbon, Novinda’s sorbent allows resale of fly ash, a solid combustion byproduct, as a component of concrete. This is both environmentally safer and an economic advantage for the power utility. The company is introducing its product to the utility market this year. Novinda is based in Denver, CO.

NVMdurance

NVMdurance delivers via software, a set of NAND Flash optimization techniques developed over the past 13 years by technical co-founders Joe Sullivan and Conor Ryan. These have the effect of greatly extending the endurance (lifespan) of Solid State Disks (SSDs), and thus overcoming a major issue (limited endurance) that is delaying the storage industry’s transition from spinning magnetic (hard) disks to SSDs, particularly for server/enterprise storage.
We know from our engagement with major SSD manufacturers and Flash foundries that the results routinely achieving are significantly ahead of any in-house or competitive approaches to endurance improvement. At Flash Memory Summit 2013, NVMdurance won Most Innovative Technology after demonstrating endurance improvements greater than tenfold. NVMdurance achieves higher levels of improvement with the newer smaller geometry devices, many of which have major endurance challenges.
“Ironically, two of the more popular innovators at the event were in a small booth at the back of the show floor. Conor Ryan and Joe Sullivan of the two-month-old startup NVMdurance won a best of show award for their 10-fold increase in flash endurance — an Achilles’ heel of the otherwise hot memory chips. ” -Rick Merritt, EETimes.com, August 2013

by Zsolt Kerekes, editor – StorageSearch.com – May 23, 2016
On a handful of occasions in more than 20 years writing about the SSD market I’ve spoken to companies which I known instinctively would change the way that the whole market thinks about itself. NVMdurance is one of those companies.
While we have seen many companies in the past 5 years telling us about the different ways in which their technologies can leverage the mysterious elasticity of flash endurance in an SSD controller context – most of those have leveraged combinations of techniques such as adaptive R/W pulse modication, DSP ECC, and big controller application or array awareness which become so closely tied to a particular product line or application space that the benefits derived from each element in the mix cannot be easily or quickly extracted and migrated to other applications.

NVPLLC’s Marc Rappoport, CFO & Partner, participated in a roundtable discussion for PEI Magazine’s April Issue article written by Nicholas Donato.
Is the industry on the verge of providing investors with monthly reporting? It’s a scary question
for CFOs, who struggle enough as it is to deliver valuation statements on a semiannual or
even quarterly basis. But forces outside of GPs’ control may prompt institutional investors
to demand timelier, more rigorous reporting. Questions surround whether this is ultimately
good for the industry, and if so, how firms’ finance teams could possibly cope with a heavier
workload. To find out, pfm assembled a roundtable of private fund CFOs, auditors and
valuation specialists to assess the situation and discuss what other valuation best practices a
firm could utilize to save time and expense, and above all, to satisfy information-hungry LPs.

About Us


At New Ventures we specialize in providing value added services priced to be affordable for even those at an entry level. Simply we offer a documentably superior product than competitors at a better price. More than 12,000 hours of pure research, testing, and validation have gone into the products listed here to ensure quality. If you have any questions, contact us!
We are a client oriented business and we strive to assist everyone in improving their ability to pursue their financial independence. In order to further that, in addition to our business model, a portion of our profits go towards improving financial literacy in underprivileged communities.
If still despite our deeply discounted prices compared to market you find it difficult to afford our products please DM us on twitter and we may be able to show you some things that have helped others in similar circumstances.
While our products are proven to perform in the market our website is in beta at the moment. Please contact us with any difficulty you experience when using the website or any other feedback. 
Please note that you will be able to receive payment for referral points and potentially other rewards, rather than just store credit, after the referred transaction has completed. Points left on account may yield additional value at the prevailing ~0.5% depending upon conditions with potential earnings bonuses.
Additionally we are considering stock awards for our most productive partners as well as select customers. We feel strongly that the best business practice is to align incentives naturally so that all of our best interests are shared in a real and meaningful way. You fundamentally basically don't see shareholder ownership consideration with anybody else in our market. We aren't a churn and burn operation. Your success is our success.
Please note by visiting our website you consent to the New Ventures Group llc terms of service and privacy policy. Referral promotions can't be combined in a single transaction. Other rates, terms, conditions and restrictions may apply. Terms and conditions may change at anytime without notice. Please contact us for more details.
 

No credit card fees with Kash means a lower price for you. Kash uses bank grade security and backs every transaction with a $100,000 fraud loss guarantee.
