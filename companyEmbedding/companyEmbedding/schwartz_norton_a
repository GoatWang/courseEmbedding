Norton Allan Schwartz[1] (born December 14, 1951)[2] is a retired United States Air Force general[3] who served as the 19th Chief of Staff of the Air Force from August 12, 2008 until his retirement in 2012.[4] As Chief of Staff, he served as the senior uniformed Air Force officer responsible for the organization, training and equipping of nearly 700,000 active-duty Air Force, Air Force Reserve, Air National Guard and civilian forces serving in the United States and overseas. As a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Schwartz functioned as a military adviser to the Secretary of Defense, National Security Council and the President. He previously served as Commander, United States Transportation Command from September 2005 to August 2008.
Schwartz graduated from the United States Air Force Academy in 1973. He is an alumnus of the National War College, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and a 1994 Fellow of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Seminar XXI. He has served as Commander of the U.S. Special Operations Command Pacific, as well as Alaskan Command, Alaskan North American Aerospace Defense Command Region and the 11th Air Force.
Schwartz is a USAF Command Pilot with more than 4,400 flying hours in a variety of aircraft. He has flown C-130 Hercules and MC-130 Combat Talon I and Combat Talon II aircraft and MH-53 Pave Low III and Pave Low IV, and MH-60 Black Hawk and Pave Hawk special ops helicopters. His operational background goes back to the final days of the Vietnam War; at the time, he was a crew member taking part in the 1975 airlift evacuation of Saigon.[5] By 1991 he was chief of staff of the Joint Special Operations Task Force for Northern Iraq during the first Gulf War. He participated as a crew member in the 1975 airlift evacuation of Saigon, and in 1991 served as Chief of Staff of the Joint Special Operations Task Force for Northern Iraq in operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. In 1997, he led the Joint Task Force that prepared for the noncombatant evacuation of U.S. citizens in Cambodia.
Schwartz is the first Air Force Chief of Staff with a background as an Air Force transport and special operations airplane and helicopter pilot and not with a background as a fighter or bomber pilot. It is speculated that Secretary of Defense Robert Gates picked him for that reason.[6]

Norton Allan Schwartz[1] (born December 14, 1951)[2] is a retired United States Air Force general[3] who served as the 19th Chief of Staff of the Air Force from August 12, 2008 until his retirement in 2012.[4] As Chief of Staff, he served as the senior uniformed Air Force officer responsible for the organization, training and equipping of nearly 700,000 active-duty Air Force, Air Force Reserve, Air National Guard and civilian forces serving in the United States and overseas. As a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Schwartz functioned as a military adviser to the Secretary of Defense, National Security Council and the President. He previously served as Commander, United States Transportation Command from September 2005 to August 2008.
Schwartz graduated from the United States Air Force Academy in 1973. He is an alumnus of the National War College, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and a 1994 Fellow of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Seminar XXI. He has served as Commander of the U.S. Special Operations Command Pacific, as well as Alaskan Command, Alaskan North American Aerospace Defense Command Region and the 11th Air Force.
Schwartz is a USAF Command Pilot with more than 4,400 flying hours in a variety of aircraft. He has flown C-130 Hercules and MC-130 Combat Talon I and Combat Talon II aircraft and MH-53 Pave Low III and Pave Low IV, and MH-60 Black Hawk and Pave Hawk special ops helicopters. His operational background goes back to the final days of the Vietnam War; at the time, he was a crew member taking part in the 1975 airlift evacuation of Saigon.[5] By 1991 he was chief of staff of the Joint Special Operations Task Force for Northern Iraq during the first Gulf War. He participated as a crew member in the 1975 airlift evacuation of Saigon, and in 1991 served as Chief of Staff of the Joint Special Operations Task Force for Northern Iraq in operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. In 1997, he led the Joint Task Force that prepared for the noncombatant evacuation of U.S. citizens in Cambodia.
Schwartz is the first Air Force Chief of Staff with a background as an Air Force transport and special operations airplane and helicopter pilot and not with a background as a fighter or bomber pilot. It is speculated that Secretary of Defense Robert Gates picked him for that reason.[6]

Norton Allan Schwartz[1] (born December 14, 1951)[2] is a retired United States Air Force general[3] who served as the 19th Chief of Staff of the Air Force from August 12, 2008 until his retirement in 2012.[4] As Chief of Staff, he served as the senior uniformed Air Force officer responsible for the organization, training and equipping of nearly 700,000 active-duty Air Force, Air Force Reserve, Air National Guard and civilian forces serving in the United States and overseas. As a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Schwartz functioned as a military adviser to the Secretary of Defense, National Security Council and the President. He previously served as Commander, United States Transportation Command from September 2005 to August 2008.
Schwartz graduated from the United States Air Force Academy in 1973. He is an alumnus of the National War College, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and a 1994 Fellow of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Seminar XXI. He has served as Commander of the U.S. Special Operations Command Pacific, as well as Alaskan Command, Alaskan North American Aerospace Defense Command Region and the 11th Air Force.
Schwartz is a USAF Command Pilot with more than 4,400 flying hours in a variety of aircraft. He has flown C-130 Hercules and MC-130 Combat Talon I and Combat Talon II aircraft and MH-53 Pave Low III and Pave Low IV, and MH-60 Black Hawk and Pave Hawk special ops helicopters. His operational background goes back to the final days of the Vietnam War; at the time, he was a crew member taking part in the 1975 airlift evacuation of Saigon.[5] By 1991 he was chief of staff of the Joint Special Operations Task Force for Northern Iraq during the first Gulf War. He participated as a crew member in the 1975 airlift evacuation of Saigon, and in 1991 served as Chief of Staff of the Joint Special Operations Task Force for Northern Iraq in operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. In 1997, he led the Joint Task Force that prepared for the noncombatant evacuation of U.S. citizens in Cambodia.
Schwartz is the first Air Force Chief of Staff with a background as an Air Force transport and special operations airplane and helicopter pilot and not with a background as a fighter or bomber pilot. It is speculated that Secretary of Defense Robert Gates picked him for that reason.[6]

Tips and Information on Buying an Antivirus
With a seemingly endless amount of pc protection solutions to
            choose from, it can be hard to make sure you get the right product for you. Here are
            some top tips and valuable information which will help you make your decision..











                            Free antivirus software; is it any good?                           

Antivirus software is widely available on the internet today with countless antivirus software provides to choose from. A good free antivirus software provider however isn’t as easy to find, so we ask the question how useful is free antivirus software? Most reputable companies now offer a free version of their antivirus software for a trial period, most typically 30 days but is the user really seeing a true representation of the fully paid versions? Surprisingly the answer is yes, in most cases you can scan your computer with the software, it will display the issues and give you the option to destroy the unwanted virus. In a lot of cases the only difference between the free and paid versions are the added extras, VPN, parental control etc, however if it is just antivirus software you are in the market for then the free version is a good option. There are however some experts that will try and tell you that the free antivirus software providers offer a significantly poorer virus detection rate, claims that a free version will only detect around 25% of viruses whereas a paid version will offer you up to a 90% detection rate. However in reality the chances are if an antivirus software provider is offering you a free or trial version of their software it will be the same software that they are offering for a fee. So when choosing a provider make sure that the paid version of the software is robust enough for your needs and the likelihood is that your free version will be just as robust. So in summation, how useful is free antivirus software? Very useful, the key things to remember are that you must do your research before you commit to downloading the antivirus software as 9 times out of 10 you will be downloading the same version of the software as the one you pay for so look for customer reviews, if people have paid for the antivirus software and are happy to recommend it then you are on to a winner. 












                            Does a free virus scan speed up my computer?                           

Computers are supposed to make people's lives easier, yet sometimes it feels like they exist around us only to give us endless amounts of frustration. The most popular advice for all the slow computers includes using a free virus scan to speed up your computer, but this make a lot of assumptions about what's going all wrong with your computer .

Tips and Information on Buying an Antivirus
With a seemingly endless amount of pc protection solutions to
            choose from, it can be hard to make sure you get the right product for you. Here are
            some top tips and valuable information which will help you make your decision..











                            Free antivirus software; is it any good?                           

Antivirus software is widely available on the internet today with countless antivirus software provides to choose from. A good free antivirus software provider however isn’t as easy to find, so we ask the question how useful is free antivirus software? Most reputable companies now offer a free version of their antivirus software for a trial period, most typically 30 days but is the user really seeing a true representation of the fully paid versions? Surprisingly the answer is yes, in most cases you can scan your computer with the software, it will display the issues and give you the option to destroy the unwanted virus. In a lot of cases the only difference between the free and paid versions are the added extras, VPN, parental control etc, however if it is just antivirus software you are in the market for then the free version is a good option. There are however some experts that will try and tell you that the free antivirus software providers offer a significantly poorer virus detection rate, claims that a free version will only detect around 25% of viruses whereas a paid version will offer you up to a 90% detection rate. However in reality the chances are if an antivirus software provider is offering you a free or trial version of their software it will be the same software that they are offering for a fee. So when choosing a provider make sure that the paid version of the software is robust enough for your needs and the likelihood is that your free version will be just as robust. So in summation, how useful is free antivirus software? Very useful, the key things to remember are that you must do your research before you commit to downloading the antivirus software as 9 times out of 10 you will be downloading the same version of the software as the one you pay for so look for customer reviews, if people have paid for the antivirus software and are happy to recommend it then you are on to a winner. 












                            Does a free virus scan speed up my computer?                           

Computers are supposed to make people's lives easier, yet sometimes it feels like they exist around us only to give us endless amounts of frustration. The most popular advice for all the slow computers includes using a free virus scan to speed up your computer, but this make a lot of assumptions about what's going all wrong with your computer . Everyday when you start up your computer it takes an extra time to “read” each breadcrumb, slowing things down. Like any machine that’s exposed to the elements, things start to bog down and the question is will a free virus scan help the situation?
The claim that to “clean up” and “speed up” your PC — for a fee , you will find these kinds of offers everywhere on the internet, but does a free virus scan help the speed of your computer? 
Your PC or Mac hold temporary files and “cookies” from places you’ve visited on the Web.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
