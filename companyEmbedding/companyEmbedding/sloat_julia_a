Julie Sloat: Should utilities be allowed to hike their fixed rate? Yes



Monday
Apr 24, 2017 at 12:01 AM
Apr 24, 2017 at 6:28 AM




It will facilitate service, drop in other charges


The men and women at AEP Ohio work hard to deliver electricity reliably and safely to all of our customers. We know that when you flip on the lights, charge your phone, or turn on your fan or air conditioner, you rely on energy being there exactly when you need it.
We’ve proposed changing the way the costs of providing service are shown on your bill. Some costs will move to a fixed charge that better reflects the actual costs of maintaining the system that delivers your power. The cost to deliver electricity to your home or business does not generally change based on the amount of energy you use.
Increases in the fixed charge will be accompanied by reductions in other charges. AEP Ohio has taken careful steps to ensure that lower income customers and those on fixed incomes are not unfairly affected by these changes. In fact, the average customer who qualifies for a low-income payment plan shouldn’t see any change in their bill as a result of this shift. Some customers will see their bill decrease while others might see a modest increase, but the average customer will see an increase of a couple of dollars per month.
The costs of each component of providing service also will be illustrated more clearly on your bill. Ultimately, you have more choices and control than ever before to reduce your electricity costs by taking advantage of energy efficiency programs. The majority of your bill will still be based on how much energy you use and driven by the choice you make for an electric supplier. If you take steps to make your home more efficient, install energy-saving lighting and devices or generate your own electricity, you will be able to reduce your overall bill.
And, investments in new technologies on our system will improve efficiency even more. Our filing has several other important parts to it that benefit every AEP Ohio customer. It allows us to continue our investments in modernizing the electric grid and provides a way for us to develop solar and wind energy in Ohio. We have invested heavily to make the electric grid smarter, more reliable, safe and secure.
Over the past year, we’ve reduced the number of times our customers lost power. We also shortened the length of outages when they did occur — reducing outage times in 2016 by more than 3 million minutes from 2015. Tree trimming, a rigorous inspection program, proactive equipment replacement and new technologies have provided these significant benefits. Because of these and future investments, customers can expect continued reliability in your electric service.
Over the next four years, we will be adding more smart equipment to the network of wires and other equipment that deliver power to our homes and businesses. These devices communicate with each other and the team that manages our system to identify problems before they turn into outages. And when outages do occur, this smart equipment will help our crews find the problem and fix it faster.
Our plans for the future also include supporting programs like the Smart Columbus initiative. AEP Ohio has been a key partner with the city of Columbus on making the Smart Columbus concept a reality. We are working to bring smart street lights, electric vehicle charging and advanced energy resources to customers in Columbus and across the state. We also plan to build microgrids — small sections of the system that can be isolated in case of an emergency — to serve hospitals, fire stations and social service agencies so they will always have power to help keep us all safe.
Our customers have told us they want access to cleaner energy that is produced locally. We’ve proposed the development of 400 megawatts of solar, with preference for projects located in Appalachian Ohio, and 500 megawatts of wind to be built in Ohio by 2021. AEP Ohio has been an integral part of this community for more than a century. Our proposal is about improving your service and providing the energy solutions you want and need for the long term. It's our commitment to build a brighter energy future for Ohio.
Julie Sloat is President, chief operating officer at AEP Ohio
