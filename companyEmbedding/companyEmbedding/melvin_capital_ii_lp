Headquartered near Newbury, English Landscapes is a leading independent provider of landscape maintenance, street cleansing and horticultural construction services to the public and private sector. Employing over 600 people and operating on a UK wide basis, English Landscapes has £38m of revenues and has grown successfully from the trend of local authorities to outsource their grounds maintenance, street cleaning and hard and soft landscaping requirements, together with the increased level of public realm regeneration works and historic park restoration.

Elysian Capital LLP is directing this website towards professional clients and eligible counterparties only and may not deal with retail clients.
Elysian’s clients are the funds it manages - Elysian Capital I LP and Elysian Capital II LP (“the Funds”). No other person, whether or not involved in a transaction with Elysian, should expect to be treated as a client by Elysian and no employee or other person associated with Elysian has the authority to represent otherwise. Elysian will not provide any investment services to any person other than the Funds in relation to, the terms of any transaction. Therefore, neither Elysian nor any member of the Elysian group (including its affiliates and its or their members, directors, officers and employees) is responsible for providing you with protections afforded to its clients, and you should seek your own independent legal, investment and tax advice as you see fit.
The website ("Site") is intended to provide information about Elysian and its approach to companies seeking investment. Nothing on this Site is intended to be, nor should anything be construed as, a promotion of the Funds managed by Elysian or an invitation to any person to invest in those Funds. The Funds are not available to the general public; investment in them is subject to regulatory restrictions. The ability to achieve successful results depends on a number of factors, and the past performance may not necessarily be repeated. There is no recognised market for dealing in the Funds and therefore it may be difficult for an investor to sell an interest in the Funds or to obtain reliable information as to the value or the extent of the risks to which they are exposed.
No information communicated via this Site should be construed, under any circumstances, as a direct or indirect offering or placement of interests or securities in any collective investment undertaking, or as any other form of marketing, promotion, sale or distribution of such interests or securities, with or to any investor domiciled or with a registered office in the EEA (which, for the purposes of this provision, shall be deemed to exclude the United Kingdom).
