Life insurance: a multi-purpose financial tool
Life insurance is designed primarily to protect your family’s financial security after you die. But your needs change and some types of insurance can offer you access to assets to meet needs during your lifetime. So it’s a smart addition to any financial plan — because it can serve different functions within your overall investment strategy.
Security for your family should something happen to you
Life insurance can help:

Pay debts and taxes after your death
Allow your family to maintain its standard of living 
Support your dependents’ goals and dreams 
Provide immediate access to cash1 

Should your need for a death benefit decrease, certain types of life insurance may serve to provide funds for other needs.  Please discuss these options with your financial professional.
A must-have for your financial plan
No matter what kind of life insurance you choose, there’s no substitute for the peace of mind it can provide. Life insurance is one of the ways you can protect your family’s financial security should something happen to you. Talk to your financial professional/licensed insurance agent about your long-term needs, and he or she can help you determine:

Which type of insurance is right for you
How much protection you and your family need

How to make the most of your premium dollars


How much life insurance do you need?
One very simple way to get a rough estimate may be to base the amount of insurance on your current, after-tax income (since life insurance is generally paid out tax free). Multiply that by the number of years your beneficiaries will need the income. Remember to make an allowance for inflation. 
But there is no substitute for a careful evaluation and review of your life insurance needs with your financial advisor.  If you aren't yet working with a financial professional, we can have someone contact you.

Retirement

Retirement information and strategies for each stage of life







Overview


All Products


View By Product Type









Retirement is one of the key financial goals for many people.  Saving early and often is important.  So is taking advantage of products and accounts designed specifically for retirement.
Tax advantages are a key feature of annuities, IRAs and employer sponsored retirement savings plans, such as 401(k), 403(b) and 457(b) plans.  Any earnings growth in these products is generally tax-deferred until you make withdrawals, generally when you are retired and may well be in a lower tax bracket. 
What's more, your contributions to IRAs and employer retirement plans may be made pretax or may be tax deductible, helping reduce your current tax bill.  Annuities
An annuity is long-term retirement product that can help protect you against the risk of outliving your assets. It is a contract between you and an insurance company: you receive future income in return for your contributions.
Any earnings on contributions are tax-deferred until they are withdrawn, usually at retirement when you may be in a lower tax bracket. You may receive income in a number of ways, including payments that will last for as long as you live. Annuities can be a valuable addition to your retirement plan. There are contract limitations and fees and charges associated with annuities, which include, but are not limited to, mortality and expense risk charges, sales and surrender charges, administrative fees, and charges for optional benefits. Amounts in a variable annuity's investment portfolios are subject to fluctuation in value and market risk including loss of principal. A financial professional can provide cost information and complete details. Withdrawals from annuities are subject to normal income tax treatment and if taken prior to age 59 1/2 may be subject to an additional 10% federal income tax penalty. Withdrawals may also be subject to a contractual withdrawal charge.

How annuities can help you
Annuities offer many features that can help you to:

Receive retirement income payments for as long as you live
Protect beneficiaries with a death benefit  
Diversify your investments
Provide an opportunity for growth on a tax-deferred basis
Avoid outliving your assets


Variable annuities
Variable annuities provide the opportunity for market appreciation — through a variety of investment options — with tax-deferred accumulation and future income.
Variable annuities are designed for people willing to take more risk with their money in exchange for greater growth potential. While there is more risk associated with a variable annuity, many variable annuities offer guarantees of principal and downside protection at an additional cost (depending on contract rider availability). These guarantees do not apply to the investment performance or safety of amounts held in the variable investment options.  Variable annuities offer:

Tax-deferred growth potentialTaxes are deferred on earnings until money is withdrawn. 
The opportunity for market appreciationA variety of investment options are available. 
Access to account valueMost variable annuities allow withdrawal of a portion of your account value without penalty. Withdrawals may be subject to a contingent deferred sales charge within the first several years of any contribution, and if taken prior to age 59½, will be subject to a 10 percent IRS penalty.
Benefits to beneficiaries Death benefits paid directly to a named beneficiary are not subject to probate.
Benefits to spousesSpousal beneficiaries may continue the contract and its tax deferral, if this option is chosen.

Please consider the charges, risks, expenses, and investment objectives carefully before purchasing a variable annuity. For a prospectus containing this and other information, please contact a financial professional. Read it carefully before you invest or send money.

Individual Retirement Accounts
IRAs are savings plans that enable you to defer paying taxes on the any earnings growth until you actually withdraw the money, after age 59 1/2. There are different types of IRAs, each with their own tax implications and eligibility requirements. The two primary types of IRAs are:

Traditional IRAs Contributions may lower your taxable income and earnings grow tax deferred until withdrawn, usually at retirement when you may be in a lower income bracket. 
Roth IRAs Contributions do not lower your taxable income, but qualified earnings can be withdrawn tax-free. 

Learn more about IRAs from AXA Advisors, LLCEmployer sponsored plans
For many people, their 401(k), 403(b) or 457(b) plan is a significant way to plan and save for retirement. They allow people to put a portion of their annual income into investment accounts specifically for retirement.
Tax free investment growth potential is one of their key features. Combined with other investment products, our plans can be an important part of an overall retirement strategy.

Variable Annuities

The opportunity for market appreciation with tax-deferral






























Variable annuities provide the opportunity for market appreciation — through a variety of investment options — with tax-deferral and future income. Variable annuities are designed for people willing to take on more risk in exchange for greater growth potential. While there is risk associated with a variable annuity, many offer guarantees of principal and downside protection at an additional cost and depending on contract rider availability. However, these guarantees do not apply to the investment performance or amounts held in the variable investment options.













Investment Edge®
Defers current taxes when trying to accumulate wealth and provides tax-efficient distributions, adding powerful tax advantages to a diversified portfolio.


BENEFITSDiversificationTax-efficient Tax deferralDeath Benefit





Retirement Cornerstone®
A single tax-deferred platform comprised of two separate accounts with distinct features that help address different goals - offering the ability to not only accumulate, but also protect retirement income.


BENEFITSInvestment opportunityGuaranteed incomeDeath benefit guarantees





Structured Capital Strategies®
Several investment options, some of which allow participation in the upside potential of indices, up to a cap, that track certain domestic, international and commodities markets, and which have a built-in partial protection feature.
 


BENEFITSUpside potential up to a capPartial protectionTax deferral





The Accumulator® Series
A long-term retirement product that allows the ability to invest for growth potential on a tax-deferred basis. Also provides for guaranteed benefits through optional riders available for an additional fee.


BENEFITSInvestment Lifetime incomeDeath benefit






















Important Note AXA believes that education is a key step toward addressing your financial goals, and we've designed this material to serve simply as an informational and educational resource.  Accordingly, the information on this website does not offer or constitute investment advice and makes no direct or indirect recommendation of any particular product or of the appropriateness of any particular investment-related option.  Your needs, goals and circumstances are unique, and they require the individualized attention of your financial professional.
Annuities are long-term financial products designed for retirement purposes. In essence, annuities are contractual agreements in which payment(s) are made to an insurance company, which agrees to pay out an income or a lump sum amount at a later date. There are contract limitations and fees and charges associated with annuities, administrative fees, and charges for optional benefits. A financial professional can provide cost information and complete details. Variable annuities are subject to fluctuation in value and market risk, including loss of principal.
Withdrawals from annuities are subject to normal income tax treatment and if taken prior to age 59½, may be subject to an additional 10% federal income tax penalty. Withdrawals may also be subject to a contractual withdrawal charge.
Please consider the charges, risk, expenses, and investment objectives carefully before purchasing a variable annuity. For a prospectus containing this and other information, please contact a financial professional. Read it carefully before you invest or send money.
Guarantees are based on the claims-paying ability of AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company (NY,NY).
Variable annuities are issued by AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company (NY, NY) and co-distributed by affiliates AXA Distributors, LLC and AXA Advisors, LLC (members FINRA, SIPC).GE-92925 (10/2016)

Henry Hyde leaves the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York to start his own firm, then known as Equitable Life Assurance Society of America. In its tenth year, Equitable writes more new business than any other company in the world.



The company's new headquarters is the first office building with steam elevators, paving the way for future skyscrapers. By 1879, it will expand to be the tallest office building in the world at that time.



Equitable markets the first joint and survivor annuity and pioneers the practice of paying death claims immediately. Miss Ray Wilner appointed Equitable's first woman agency manager.



Equitable supported the American College in launching the CLU professional designation program. Equitable started new agent training classes in 1902.



Equitable introduces its first line of individual variable annuity products and in 1976 pioneers variable life insurance, an investment-oriented policy that commands significant market share.



With a $1 billion investment from the AXA Group, Equitable completes the largest-ever conversion from a mutual to a stock company at that time and soon becomes a member of the Global AXA Group.



AXA celebrates its eighth consecutive year as the #1 insurance brand in the world as measured by the Interbrand annual report.
