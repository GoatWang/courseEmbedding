NYSE:IVC 






ELYRIA, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Invacare Corporation (NYSE: IVC) announced today that it has appointed 
      Matthew E. Monaghan as President and Chief Executive Officer, effective 
      April 1, 2015. Mr. Monaghan’s appointment follows an extensive global 
      search conducted by an executive search firm under the direction of the 
      Invacare Board of Directors. Mr. Monaghan, 47, will join Invacare with a 
      breadth of general management, medical device and turnaround experience 
      within global companies. Robert K. Gudbranson will continue to serve as 
      Interim President and Chief Executive Officer until Mr. Monaghan joins 
      the Company, after which time Mr. Gudbranson will continue as Senior 
      Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
    

      Mr. Monaghan currently serves as Senior Vice President and General 
      Manager of Zimmer’s Global Hips business, where he is responsible for 
      more than $1.3 billion in revenue and the division’s new product 
      development, engineering, clinical studies, quality, regulatory affairs 
      and marketing functions. Mr. Monaghan also oversees the company’s global 
      reconstructive research group. Prior to joining Zimmer in 2009, he spent 
      eight years as an operating executive for two leading private equity 
      firms, Texas Pacific Group (TPG) and Cerberus Capital, where he led 
      operational improvements of portfolio companies. Among the most notable 
      were the carve-out of a global medical device business from Baxter 
      Healthcare, making significant improvements at a U.S. personal insurance 
      business and running a consumer durable goods business spun off from 
      Newell-Rubbermaid.
    

      ''On behalf of the Board of Directors, I am pleased to welcome Matt as 
      Invacare’s next President and CEO. Our Board conducted a thorough and 
      comprehensive search over the past six months and unanimously concluded 
      that Matt is best suited to lead Invacare through this critical time and 
      into its next phase of growth and development. In addition to his 
      medical device background, he has proven turnaround experience, which 
      will be critical to Invacare as it works through its short-term 
      challenges. We are fortunate to have someone with Matt’s broad 
      cross-functional experience, and the Board looks forward to the results 
      of partnering with the senior management team under Matt’s experience 
      and leadership,'' said Dr. C. Martin Harris, Interim Chairman of 
      Invacare’s Board of Directors.
    

      ''I am honored to have been selected to lead Invacare at a time of 
      unprecedented opportunity for the Company. Invacare is well positioned 
      to take advantage of the growing global home healthcare market. I look 
      forward to working closely with Invacare’s Board of Directors, executive 
      team and talented and hard-working associates to continue to turnaround 
      this business, innovate, and resume the Company’s historical market 
      leadership position,'' said Mr. Monaghan.
    

      Added Dr. Harris, ''I want to thank Rob Gudbranson for the outstanding 
      job he has done as Invacare’s Interim Chief Executive Officer. Under 
      Rob’s direction, the Company has made progress on the quality systems 
      remediation and continued to implement the business improvements 
      necessary to begin to return the Company to profitability during this 
      challenging time.''
    

      The terms of Mr. Monaghan's employment agreement will be described in a 
      Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed by the Company on or about the 
      date of this press release.

      Affordable Care Act of 2010 (such as, for example, the impact on the 
      Company of the excise tax on certain medical devices, which began on 
      January 1, 2013, and the Company's ability to successfully offset such 
      impact); ineffective cost reduction and restructuring efforts or

      uncollectible accounts receivable; difficulties in 
      implementing/upgrading Enterprise Resource Planning systems; risks 
      inherent in managing and operating businesses in many different foreign
