Overview
Synthetic Biologics is a late-stage clinical company developing therapeutics that preserve the microbiome to protect and restore the health of patients. Our lead candidates poised for Phase 3 development are: (1) SYN-004 (ribaxamase) which is designed to protect the gut microbiome from the effects of certain commonly used intravenous (IV) beta-lactam antibiotics for the prevention of C. difficile infection (CDI), pathogenic overgrowth and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and (2) SYN-010 which is intended to reduce the impact of methane producing organisms in the gut microbiome to treat an underlying cause of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C). We are also developing preclinical stage monoclonal antibody therapies for the prevention and treatment of pertussis and novel discovery stage biotherapeutics for the treatment of phenylketonuria (PKU).

Our Lead Candidates

SYN-004 (ribaxamase)
Ribaxamase is an oral enzyme tablet engineered to survive the stomach thereby allowing IV beta-lactam antibiotics to treat infection while ribaxamase protects and preserves the naturally occurring gut microbiome from the onset of antibiotic-mediated primary C. difficile infection, pathogenic colonization and the emergence antimicrobial resistance.
View SYN-004 (ribaxamase)


SYN-010
SYN-010 is a proprietary, modified-release formulation of lovastatin lactone that is designed to bypass the stomach and reduce the body's natural methane production in the GI tract to treat an underlying cause of the symptoms associated with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C).

Protecting the Gut Microbiome
Your body has 10 times as many microbe cells as human cells.  We’re leveraging the microbiome to radically change today’s medicine.




Watch Video


How SYN-004 (ribaxamase) Works
SYN-004 is an oral prophylactic therapy designed to degrade residual and still viable IV beta-lactam antibiotics which pass through the GI tract following systemic circulation.





Watch Video


How SYN-010 Works
SYN-010 is intended to act primarily in the intestinal lumen while avoiding systemic absorption, thereby targeting the major cause of IBS-C, not just the symptoms.

SYN-004 (ribaxamase)
Designed to be co-administered with IV beta-lactam antibiotics, ribaxamase is an oral enzyme tablet that allows the IV antibiotic to treat the infection, while protecting the gut microbiome and preventing Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), pathogenic overgrowth and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). SYN-004 received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA for the prevention of Clostridium difficile Infection.

Collaborative Partners

SYN-005
Through our August 2012 Exclusive Channel Collaboration (ECC) with Intrexon Corporation (NYSE: XON) and academic researchers at The University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin), we are developing SYN-005, a combination of two humanized antibodies that includes hu1B7, for the treatment of critically ill infants with Pertussis. In addition, UT Austin was awarded a grant from the Gates Foundation to generate preclinical proof-of-concept data to test the hypothesis that hu1B7 antibody administration at birth may also have a role in the prevention of Pertussis. Jennifer Maynard, Ph.D., the principal investigator of the grant at UT Austin, will test this hypothesis by using our hu1B7 antibody.


SYN-200
Through our August 2015 ECC with Intrexon Corporation, we are pursuing the development and commercialization of novel biotherapeutics for the treatment of patients with phenylketonuria (PKU), a serious and debilitating metabolic disorder. Through the ECC, we plan to utilize Intrexon's ActoBiotics™ platform which is a proprietary method of delivering therapeutic protein and peptides to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract through food-grade microbes.

					Full Description



Synthetic Biologics, Inc., incorporated on December 23, 2008, is a clinical-stage company. The Company is engaged in developing therapeutics to protect the gut microbiome while targeting pathogen-specific diseases. The Company's lead product candidates in Phase II development are SYN-010, which is intended to reduce the impact of methane-producing organisms in the gut microbiome to treat an underlying cause of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C), and SYN-004, which is designed to protect the gut microbiome (gastrointestinal (GI) microflora) from the effects of certain commonly used intravenous (IV) antibiotics for the prevention of C. difficile infection (CDI) and antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). Its other product candidates include SYN-007, SYN-006, SYN-005, SYN-200 and SYN-020. The Company is also developing preclinical-stage monoclonal antibody therapies for the prevention and treatment of pertussis, and discovery-stage biotherapeutics for the treatment of phenylketonuria (PKU). Its IBS-C and CDI/AAD programs are focused on protecting the gut microbiome, or gut flora.SYN-010The Company's product candidate, SYN-010 is intended to act primarily in the intestinal lumen while avoiding systemic absorption, thereby targeting the cause of IBS-C, not just the patient's symptoms. The Company has completed Phase I clinical trial of SYN-010.SYN-004The Company's product candidate, SYN-004 is an oral prophylactic therapy. The Company has completed Phase I clinical trial of SYN-004.SYN-007The Company's SYN-007 product is used for the prevention of CDI and AAD. Preclinical work is ongoing to determine the ability of SYN-007 to protect the gut microbiome and degrade oral beta-lactam antibiotics. SYN-007 comprises a reformulated version of SYN-004 for use with oral beta-lactam antibiotics versus IV beta-lactam antibiotics.SYN-006The Company's SYN-006 product is used for the prevention of CDI and AAD. The development of SYN-006 is in the discovery stage. SYN-006 is intended to be an oral prophylactic therapy designed to degrade IV carbapenem antibiotics (a third class of beta-lactam antibiotics) within the GI tract and maintain the natural balance of the gut microbiome.SYN-005The Company's SYN-005 product is used for the prevention of pertussis (whooping cough). The development of SYN-005 is in preclinical-stage.SYN-200The Company's SYN-200 product is used for the treatment of Phenylketonuria (PKU). The development of SYN-200 is in discovery-stage.SYN-020The Company's SYN-020 is used for the treatment of oral intestinal alkaline phosphatase. The development of SYN-020 is in the discovery-stage. SYN-020 is being developed as a modified-release oral dosage form of intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP).

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
