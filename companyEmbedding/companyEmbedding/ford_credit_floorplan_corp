                Ford Motor Credit Outsources Wholesale Audit and Vehicle Inspection Business
            

                June 15, 2009

LONG BEACH,
Calif. — Alliance Inspection Management Inc. (AiM) struck an agreement with
Ford Motor Credit Company to takeover floorplan audits at dealerships with wholesale
financing from the captive lender. The vehicle inspection company will also 
conduct lease-end inspections of vehicles financed by the captive finance company.
Ford Credit employees previously handled these functions.
As part of
the agreement, approximately 110 current Ford Credit employees will be offered
fulltime positions with AiM later this summer. The influx of new workers will
increase AiM's total number of employees to more than 625. Both current AiM
employees and the new hires will be cross-trained to work on all AiM accounts.
"We
are very pleased that Ford Credit has selected AiM for these very important
activities," said Jim Yates, president & CEO, AiM. "They align
nicely with our existing business and give us the unique opportunity to add
experienced employees who will make AiM stronger for all of our clients."
Ford Credit's employees will be merged into the overall AiM workforce along
with the culture they'll bring from their Ford experience. AiM management
believes both groups can learn from each other and make the combined workforce
smarter, more efficient and more capable.
"Our
vision for AiM is to be an industry-wide partnership that allows all of our
customers and partners to better manage their portfolios as positive
contributors to bottom line profits," said Yates.
AiM has
conducted more than 50-million vehicle inspections since it was founded in
2005.

Great vehicles are great for drivers everywhere, and that’s the foundation of our business’s strength. To meet demand, Ford is in the midst of its most ambitious manufacturing expansion in 50 years. We’re increasing capacity in the United States and adding plants around the world.

Better World




Our work doesn’t stop with our products and our bottom line. An integral part of the Ford team’s DNA is ‘people serving people.’ That’s why our global brand promise is called Go Further – we go further so you can.
We’re helping to solve global challenges linked to economic development, energy security and environmental sustainability. In 2013, for example, Ford globally reduced the amount of water it used to produce each vehicle by 30 percent compared to a 2009 baseline, reaching its goal two years ahead of schedule. Plans are under way to set new long-term goals.
Community service is an important part of Ford’s heritage and always has been. The Ford Volunteer Corps celebrated its 10th anniversary in 2015. Ford Motor Company Fund and Community Services has donated more than $1.5 billion in its 65-year history.
Within our Sustainability report, our Blueprint for Mobility envisions the future of transportation, in which vehicles communicate with each other and the world around them to make driving safer, easier and more efficient. Our Blueprint for Sustainability goes beyond improved fuel economy and reduced CO2 emissions to define sustainability as a business model that creates value by preserving and enhancing environmental, social and financial capital.

Grantor ”), THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON, a New York
banking corporation, as Indenture Trustee for the benefit of the
Series 2016-4 Noteholders (in this capacity, the “

The parties are entering into this
Agreement to perfect the security interest in the bank
accounts.
 

The parties agree as follows

Section 2.2.
                                
Account Changes
.  Neither the Financial
Institution nor the Grantor will change the name or account number
of a Collateral Account without the consent of the Secured
Party.  The Financial Institution will promptly notify the
Servicer of any changes.  This Agreement will apply to each
successor account to a Collateral Account, which will also be a
Collateral Account.
 

Section 2.3.
                                
Account Types
.  The Financial Institution
agrees that each Collateral Account is, and will be maintained as,
either a “securities account” (as defined in
Section 8-501 of the UCC) or a “deposit account”
(as defined in Section 9-102(a)(29) of the UCC).
 

Section 2.4.
                                
Securities Accounts
.  If a Collateral Account is a
securities account, the Financial Institution agrees
that:
 

(a)                                 
Financial Assets
.  It will promptly credit each
item of property (whether cash, investment property, security,
instrument or other financial asset) delivered to the Financial
Institution under the Indenture Supplement to the Collateral
Account and treat each item of property as a “financial
asset” (within the meaning of
Section 8-102(a)(9) of the UCC); and
 

(b)                                 
Registration and
Indorsement .  It
will ensure that all financial assets (other than cash) credited to
the Collateral Account are registered in the name of the Financial
Institution, indorsed to the Financial Institution or in blank or
credited to another securities account maintained in the name of
the Financial Institution and that no financial asset credited to
the Collateral Account is registered in the name of the Grantor,
payable to the order of the Grantor or specially indorsed to the
Grantor unless it has been indorsed to the Financial Institution or
in blank.
 
ARTICLE III
SECURED PARTY CONTROL
 

Section 3.1.
                                
Control of Collateral
Accounts .  To
establish “control” of the Collateral Accounts by the
Secured Party under Sections 9-104 and 9-106 of the UCC, the
Financial Institution agrees to comply with any order or
instruction from the Secured Party directing the deposit,
withdrawal, transfer or redemption of the cash or other financial
assets credited to a Collateral Account (a “ Secured Party
Order ”) without the need for consent by the Grantor or
any other Person.
 

Section 3.2.
                                
Investment
Instructions .  If

Institution) on the Business Day before a Payment Date or
(b) the Financial Institution receives notice from the
Indenture Trustee that a
 
3 





 
Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing for the Series 2016-4 Notes, the Financial
Institution will invest and reinvest funds in the Collateral
Account according to the last investment instruction received, if
any.  If no prior investment instructions have been received
or if the instructed investments are no longer available or
permitted, the Indenture Trustee will notify the Servicer and
request new investment instructions, and the funds will remain
uninvested until new investment instructions are
received.
 

Section 3.3.
                                
Conflicting Orders or
Instructions .  If
the Financial Institution receives conflicting orders or
instructions from the Secured Party and the Grantor or any other
Person, the Financial Institution will follow the orders or
instructions of the Secured Party and not the Grantor or such other
Person.
 
ARTICLE IV
SUBORDINATION OF LIEN; WAIVER OF SET-OFF
 

Section 4.1.
                                
Subordination
.  If the Financial Institution
has, or later obtains, a security interest in a Collateral Account
(or any portion of a Collateral Account), the Financial Institution
agrees that the security interest will be subordinate to the
security interest of the Secured Party.
 

Section 4.2.
                                
Set-off and Recoupment
.  The cash, investment
property, security, instrument or other financial assets credited
to a Collateral Account will not be subject to deduction, set-off,
recoupment, banker’s lien, or other right in favor of a
Person other than the Secured Party.  However, the Financial
Institution may set off (a) the customary fees and expenses
for the routine maintenance and operation of the Collateral Account
due to the Financial Institution, (b) the face amount of
checks credited to the Collateral Account but subsequently returned
unpaid due to uncollected or insufficient funds and
(c) advances made to settle an investment of funds in the
Collateral Account.
