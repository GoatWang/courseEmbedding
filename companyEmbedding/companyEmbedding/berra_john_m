Von DrehleAlumni Achievement AwardAfter graduating from Washington University with a degree in industrial engineering in 1952, Ramon A.

During this time, he reconsidered his career goals and decided to go to law school after service.The law suited Von Drehle, and he graduated first in his class from the University of Texas Law School in 1957. His objective was to be on the inside of a large, international company. This goal led him to Ford Motor Company's office of the general counsel, where he served as senior attorney. In time, Von Drehle specialized in international and financial transactions. When Ford decided to form a European headquarters, he moved to the United Kingdom for the launch. This transfer overseas in 1967 led to over 12 exciting years of living and working in Europe, where Von Drehle's three children grew up. He worked in every European capital and became vice president and general counsel for Ford's activities in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.In 1979 Von Drehle was reassigned to Ford headquarters in Detroit and became chief legal officer for Ford's financial services activities around the world. These new responsibilities, in turn, heavily involved Von Drehle in Washington, D.C., affairs, where he became chairman of the American Financial Services Association. He now lives in the Washington, D.C., area.After retiring from Ford, Von Drehle continued to live an active international professional life with government- sponsored projects in Central and Eastern Europe and Russia. He now accepts consulting projects and enjoys life with his wife, Gillian, among homes in Washington, D.C., London, and France.

In 1997 Hedg-peth was named AT&T president, Pacific and Western states. In 1998, while serving in that same capacity, Hedg-peth was named the lead AT&T executive responsible for ensuring the efficient and timely implementation of the company's merger with Teleport Communications Group.

Joining the staff in 1969 as assistant dean and registrar, he subsequently served as associate dean, and, currently, vice dean of academic affairs. Russell's path to the engineering school began at Carnegie Institute of Technology where, as a senior in physics, he took a part-time job as a resident-hall assistant.After graduation in 1957, Russell worked for nine months as a Naval Research Laboratory engineer and six months as an Army officer to fulfill ROTC requirements. He then started graduate studies at the University of Illinois as an electrical engineering teaching assistant. One semester into the program, Russell again sought a resident assistant position in the university residence halls. However, by misreading the university's phone book, he went to the office for nonuniversity-owned residence halls. There he was referred to a couple who ran a private dorm.He worked for the couple for eight and a half of his 10 years at the University of Illinois. Several years into the doctoral program, Russell realized that, although he enjoyed teaching and research, he also liked working with students in the residence halls. On the advice of a friend, he didn't change his educational path, but finished his PhD. He then began looking for a job.Washington University offered Russell a position that seemed a perfect fit networking with engineering students and their academic (and occasionally nonacademic) problems. In addition to his other responsibilities, Russell also has served as dean of the University of Missouri-St. Louis/ Washington University Joint Undergraduate Engineering Program. Russell is active in his church. Other interests include railroads (traveling on and modeling), reading, and home remodeling.

Emerson's John Berra Honored for Lifetime Achievement Award by Frost & Sullivan 





Emerson's John Berra Honored for Lifetime Achievement Award by Frost & Sullivan 

 May 26, 2004 

    May 24, 2004 07:45 AM US Eastern Timezone 



MIAMI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 24, 2004--Frost & Sullivan has named John M. Berra, president of Emerson Process Management, recipient of its Lifetime Achievement Award in the process control and automation industry. Berra is only the third person in 42 years to be recognized for lifetime achievement by the global consulting firm. 


Berra has exemplified achievement throughout his 28 years with Emerson Process Management, a business of Emerson (NYSE:EMR). His willingness to embrace and develop new technologies and approaches that are revolutionary to the industry and built upon strong business cases, has contributed to the business success of not only Emerson but producers and manufacturers. Berra has been the driving force behind Emerson Process Management's corporate goal to provide excellence and innovative technology-based solutions to producers and manufacturers in the process industry. He envisioned and helped lead Emerson and the industry toward process plants with "smart" field instruments and systems throughout, that would enable manufacturers to run their plants at their full potential with minimum interruptions. 

"In the early 1980s, before the era of ubiquitous microprocessors, John Berra helped revolutionize the process control industry and set new standards by advocating a vision of technology both within Emerson and with various industry groups and standards bodies," said John Ruggles, vice president of Frost and Sullivan. "Mr. Berra has helped the establishment of various nonprofit organizations that would set industrywide process communication standards." 

The Lifetime Achievement Award is presented to those who have made significant and lasting impressions in the global industrial market and to overall American business. Berra was presented the award May 19 during Frost & Sullivan's Excellence in Industrial Technologies Awards Banquet. 

Born in St Louis, Berra holds a bachelor of science degree in systems science and engineering from Washington University in St. Louis. He began his career as an instrument and electrical engineer with Monsanto Corporate Engineering. He joined Emerson as a marketing manager for its Rosemount division in 1976. In 1997, he became president of Emerson's Fisher-Rosemount division (now Emerson Process Management) and executive vice president and process group business leader for Emerson. Berra oversees Emerson Process Management from its division headquarters in Austin, Texas. 

Berra currently serves as chairman of the Fieldbus Foundation, a consortium of global suppliers and end users that developed the international FOUNDATION fieldbus process communications standard. He is past chairman of the measurement, control and automation association (1988-90), a former member of the president's industry advisory committee for the Instrumentation, Systems and Automation Society (ISA); and a 2002 recipient of ISA's Life Achievement Award.
