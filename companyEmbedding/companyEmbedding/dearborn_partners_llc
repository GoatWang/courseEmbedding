2nd Quarter 2017
download commentary
US stocks had their best first half total return performance (price change plus reinvested dividends) since 2013 advancing +9.3% for both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  US stocks made new all-time highs as they outperformed most of the other major asset classes during the 2017 first half. In addition, US stocks have been the best performing asset class over the last 5 and 3 year periods ending June 30, 2017. The 5 year gross total return for the S&P 500 increased +97.9% and the 3 year total return rose +31.7% ending June 30, 2017. The other major asset classes had returns for the first half of 2017 as follows: 3 month US Treasury Bills (+0.3%); long term US Treasury Bonds (+5.5%); Investment Grade Corporate Bonds (+3.9%); and gold (+8.4%). The highest quality stocks (ranked B+ or better by Merrill Lynch ) advanced slightly more for the first half (+6.4% vs. +6.2%) compared to the lower quality stocks (ranked B or worse).   We saw a major shift during the latter months of the first half as the higher quality growth companies substantially underperformed the lower quality companies.  The A+ rated companies only rose +5.0%, while the C & D rated companies increased +8.3%.  This was primarily the result of the higher beta stocks responding to expectations of better global economic growth. The equal-weighted Nifty Fifty (S&P 500 largest companies) recorded a positive return of +6.4%, but modestly underperformed the other 450 stocks in the S&P 500 for the first half +6.9%.  The MSCI AC World Equity Index (Ex. US) rose +9.0% in local currency, outperforming US equities. In US dollars, the MSCI AC World Index rose significantly by 14.5%, reflecting the substantial depreciation of the US dollar during the 2017 second quarter. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index (local currency) increased +15.0% during the first half. Many of the emerging economies are highly dependent upon commodities, which experienced some price rebound during the half. The US consumer price index (CPI) rose +1.4% for 2017 through May.  The 2017 first half was marked by increasing US employment, decent corporate profit growth and optimism regarding legislative changes that would enhance US economic and corporate profit growth.  These included: (1) lower corporate and individual income tax rates; (2) a reduced regulatory environment; (3) more US based manufacturing; (4) lower healthcare costs for companies and individuals: and (5) higher governmental spending on infrastructure and defense.  The best performing equity sectors during 2017 first half were primarily focused on industries that were positively impacted by improving economic growth, reduced governmental regulations and generally stocks with the highest betas. The best performing sector (price change only) was Technology (+16.4%), but it began to falter in June. Technology stocks contributed 38% (3.5 percentage points) of the S&P 500 first half gain, but had contributed as much as 50% prior to the June sell-off.  The second best performing sector was Health Care (+15.1%). The third best performing sector was Consumer Discretionary (+10.2%). Correspondingly, the two worst performing sectors for the half were Energy (-13.8%) and Telecommunications (-12.8%)   The Energy sector suffered from lower crude oil prices and telecommunications reflected increased competition. While US GDP growth is sub-par as compared to prior economic recoveries, the US economy is still showing signs of moderate growth. However, with the 2017 change in administration, the likelihood of (1) lower income taxes for companies and individuals; (2) less regulatory requirements; and (3) higher spending on infrastructure should provide a more positive environment for economic growth over the next few years.  As long as employment grows and real wages can experience some improvement, the US economy should advance in 2017, despite the difficulty in some other world economies.  Dearborn Partners envisions 2017 US GDP growth to be in the area of 2.0%- 2.5%, despite a slower growth rate in the first half.  On the positive side, corporate earnings are doing reasonably well even though revenue growth continues to be moderate for many industries. Corporate margins remain near record highs. Productivity improvement and share repurchases by corporations have been an important contributor to the advance in earnings per share growth.  Federal Reserve policy is still very accommodative, despite the recent rise in short term interest rates. US employment is rising. The unemployment rate is relatively low at 4.4%.  Inflation continues to run below 2%. Modification of bank lending requirements (Dodd/Frank) should help economic growth.  Low energy prices should continue to help the level of disposable income for most families. Housing prices continue to show signs of improvement in most regions of the country. The housing affordability index is still attractive due to low mortgage rates.  On the negative side, inflation-adjusted wage growth has been flat or falling for the last few years. In addition, the US employment participation rate (62.6%) remains low.  Since consumer spending accounts for about 70% of the US GDP, this places pressure on domestic economic growth.  There is a shortage of skilled labor in a number of key industries, especially for computer science and engineering.  The energy industry, which has historically been an important sector for employment growth, is still experiencing layoffs due to the sharp decline in energy prices.  Finally, income tax rates remain high following the passage of the Affordable Care Act placing additional pressure on disposable income for upper income groups. The top federal income tax rate is 39.6% before the impact of Alternative Minimum Tax.  In general, the higher quality companies that dominate our portfolios continue to generate improving free cash flow with earnings/dividends advancing at a faster pace than inflation.  Balance sheets are the best condition that we have seen in years due to higher capital positions, lower cost of carrying debt, as well as reduced overall debt levels.  Productivity remains high and profit margins reflect management’s focus on cost containment.  We continue to closely watch the trend in revenue and earnings growth for 2017.

Rising Dividend Story:
In 2011, Dearborn Partners created its first retail products-The Core Rising Dividend separately managed account and the High and Rising Dividend separately managed account. The Rising Dividend Strategy was originally created in 1993 by Carol M. Lippman, CFA., now co-managed by Michael B. Andelman, and has been well received within the broker-dealer community. In 2013, Dearborn Partners launched its Rising Dividend Mutual Fund as another vehicle to access this strategy.




Investment Strategy:
Investing in a diversified mix of rising dividend companies may help preserve what you have by providing a defensive ballast to investment portfolios. Rising dividend portfolios offer the potential to pay investors consistently and with prospects for “pay raises” over time—while offering a prudent way to participate in the wealth-building potential offered by the stocks of good quality companies over the long term.

Dearborn Partners LLC was formed in 1997.  An independent, privately held firm based in Chicago, Dearborn Partners manages assets for institutional and individual clients.
Dearborn Partners, LLC is the Advisor to the Dearborn Partners Rising Dividend Fund. The Fund invests in companies diversified across numerous sectors.  We seek to own a portfolio of companies with an average yield that exceeds the S&P 500 Index and that appear to have good prospects for annual dividend growth. Our objectives are current income, rising income over time, and long-term capital appreciation. We endeavor to identify companies that appear likely to raise their dividends with regularity over time. The combination of a current yield plus the potential for dividend increases can offer investors a fund that we believe should perform well in both rising and falling markets.
 
 
Mutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. The Fund's strategy of investing in dividend-paying stocks involves the risk that such stocks may fall out favor with investors and underperform the market. In addition, there is the possibility that such companies could reduce or eliminate the payment of dividends in the future or the anticipated acceleration of dividends could not occur. The Fund may invest in foreign securities and ADR's which involve political, economic and currency risks, greater volatility and differences in accounting methods. Medium- and small- capitalization companies tend to have limited liquidity and greater price volatility than large-capitalization companies. Investments in REIT securities involve risks such as declines in the value of real estate and increased susceptibility to adverse economic regulatory expenses. The fund may invest in MLP's which can be negatively influenced when interest rates rise. These investments also entail many of the general tax risks of investing in a partnership. There is always the risk that an MLP will fail to qualify for favorable tax treatments.
The Dearborn Partners Rising Dividend Fund is offered only to United States residents, and information on this site is intended only for such persons. Nothing on this web site should be considered a solicitation to buy or an offer to sell shares of the Fund in any jurisdiction where the offer or solicitation would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.
The S&P 500 Index is a broad based unmanaged index of 500 stocks, which is widely recognized as representative of the equity market in general. You cannot invest directly in an index.
Diversification does not assure a profit nor protect against loss in a declining market.
The Dearborn Partners Rising Dividend Fund is distributed by Quasar Distributors, LLC.

February 1, 2016
By Luisa Beltran
 Follow @LuisaRBeltran





Stryker Corp has agreed to buy Sage Products, a portfolio company of Madison Dearborn Partners, for $2.775 billion. Cary, Illinois-based Sage develops products used to prevent hospital-acquired conditions. Barclays advised Sage with Kirkland & Ellis LLP and Madden, Jiganti, Moore & Sinars LLP providing the company with legal counsel. JP Morgan is serving as Stryker’s exclusive financial advisor while Sullivan & Cromwell LLP was their lawyer.
PRESS RELEASE
CARY, Ill., February 1, 2016 – Sage Products LLC (Sage), a leading developer of innovative products used
to prevent hospital-acquired conditions, today announced that it has signed a definitive agreement by
which it will be acquired by Stryker Corporation (NYSE: SYK) (Stryker) from Madison Dearborn Partners
(MDP) in an all cash transaction for $2.775 billion. Stryker, headquartered in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and
operating in over 100 countries, is one of the world’s leading medical technology companies and offers a
diverse array of innovative products and services in Orthopedics, Medical and Surgical, and
Neurotechnology and Spine. Chicago-based MDP acquired a majority ownership position in Sage in
December 2012.
As part of a publicly traded company with global reach, diverse product lines and a shared commitment
to improving patient care and outcomes, Sage will be strongly positioned to achieve continued growth,
create more opportunities for its employees and continue its commitment to active community
engagement. Sage plans to continue to operate under its existing brand name as part of Stryker’s
Medical division. Sage’s current executive committee, led by President and CEO Scott Brown and
Chairman of the Board Vincent Foglia, will remain in place and continue leading Sage from its
headquarters in Cary, Illinois. 





“Over our 45 years, we have achieved incredible growth through our focus on innovation, our Sage
culture and our deep commitment to our community,” said Scott Brown, President and CEO of Sage
Products. “With MDP’s support, our business has grown domestically and we have achieved significant
initial success with our international expansion. We are grateful for MDP’s partnership over the past few
years and believe that Sage is well-positioned for continued achievement and long-term success with
Stryker, a company that understands our business, supports our goals and embraces our values.”
“We warmly welcome Vince, Scott, the exceptional leadership team and all Sage employees to the
global Stryker family,” said Kevin A. Lobo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Stryker Corporation.
“We are fully aligned with Sage’s strategy and culture, and we see this acquisition as a very strong
addition to our existing product portfolio. Stryker looks forward to helping Sage continue its impressive
growth trajectory around the world while remaining true to its roots and local community engagement.”
The closing of the transaction is subject to expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and other customary closing conditions. The
transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2016.
Barclays is serving as Sage’s exclusive financial advisor with Kirkland & Ellis LLP and Madden, Jiganti,
Moore & Sinars LLP providing the company with legal counsel. JP Morgan is serving as Stryker’s exclusive
financial advisor and Sullivan & Cromwell LLP is serving as outside legal counsel for Stryker in connection
with this transaction.
