"Our task is to scour the large and diverse universe of small-cap companies for businesses that look mispriced and underappreciated, with the caveat being that they must also have a discernible margin of safety. We are looking for stocks trading at a discount to our estimate of their worth as businesses."—Chuck Royce

Important Performance and Expense Information


 All performance information reflects past performance, is presented on a total return basis, net of the Fund's investment advisory fee, and reflects the reinvestment of distributions. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than performance quoted. Returns as of the recent month-end may be obtained at www.roycefunds.com. The market price of the Fund's shares will fluctuate, so that shares may be worth more or less than their original cost when sold. 
The Fund invests primarily in securities of small-cap and micro-cap companies, which may involve considerably more risk than investing in larger-cap companies. The Fund's broadly diversified portfolio does not ensure a profit or guarantee against loss. From time to time, the Fund may invest a significant portion of its net assets in foreign securities, which may involve political, economic, currency, and other risks not encountered in U.S. investments.






Rolling Returns




On a monthly basis, the Fund outperformed the Russell 2000 in 61% of all 5-Year periods; and 59% of all 1-Year periods.For 96% of the periods, 10-year average annual total returns were greater than 5%; For 56% of the periods, 10-year average annual total returns were greater than 10%.

Morningstar Style Mapas of 03/31/17











The Morningstar Style Map is the Morningstar Style Box with the center 75% of fund holdings plotted as the Morningstar Ownership Zone. The Morningstar Style Box is designed to reveal a fund's investment strategy. The Morningstar Ownership Zone provides detail about a portfolio's investment style by showing the range of stock sizes and styles. The Ownership Zone is derived by plotting each stock in the portfolio within the proprietary Morningstar Style Box. The shaded area represents the center 75% of the Fund's assets while the plot point in the middle represents the weighted average of its holdings. Over time, the shape and location of a fund's ownership zone may vary.
