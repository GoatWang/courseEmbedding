the extent Trust assets are
sufficient therefor, including but not
limited to all Unpaid Amounts upon the

(b) In the event that any payment with respect to the
Underlying Securities is not received by
the Trustee by 12 noon (New York City
time) on an Underlying Securities Payment
Date as a result of any Deferral
Period, the Trustee shall not make any
payment to the Swap Counterparty on
such Underlying Securities Payment Date. If
any payment with respect to the
Underlying Securities is made to the
Trustee after an Underlying Securities
Payment Date on which such payment was due,
the Trustee shall promptly
distribute such amount received to the Swap
Counterparty on any date the
Trustee receives such payment, or as soon

5.11, 5.16, 6.2, Article VII, 8.1, 8.2
and 8.10 of the Base Trust Agreement and
any other provision of the Base Trust
Agreement which imposes obligations on or
creates rights in favor of the
Trustee or the Certificateholders as a
result of or in connection with an
"Event of Default" or "Administrative Agent
Termination Event" shall be
inapplicable with respect to the
Certificates. In addition, there is no
"Administrative Agent" specified herein,
and all references to "Administrative
Agent" in the Base Trust Agreement,
therefore shall be inapplicable with
respect to the Certificates.
 
                 
Section 10. Distributions. (a) On each Distribution Date,
except during any Deferral Period during
which no distributions to
Certificateholders shall be made, so long
as no Swap Agreement Termination
Event has occurred for which the Trust is
the Defaulting Party or an Affected
Party, the Trustee shall distribute to the
Certificateholders the Interest
Collections. On the Maturity Date, and to
the extent received on any other
Scheduled Distribution Date or any
Underlying Securities Redemption
Distribution Date, so long as no Swap
Agreement Termination Event has occurred
for which the Trust is the Defaulting Party
or an Affected Party, the Trustee
shall distribute to the Certificateholders,
the principal amount of the
Underlying Securities to the extent the
principal of the Underlying Securities
is received by the Trustee on such date or
during the related Collection
Period plus any accrued interest
thereon.
 
                 
(b) If a Swap Agreement Termination Event has occurred for
which the Trust is the Defaulting Party or
an Affected Party, the Trustee,
first, shall distribute all collections
received on the Underlying Securities
to the Swap Counterparty until all amounts
owing to the Swap Counterparty
under the Swap Agreement for payments in
connection with such Swap Agreement
Termination Event (including any Unpaid
Amounts) have been paid in full and,
second, shall distribute all remaining
amounts to the Certificateholders. If
the distribution in the preceding sentence
is insufficient to pay in full all
amounts owing to the Swap Counterparty, the
Trustee shall proceed to liquidate
or distribute the Underlying Securities in
accordance with Section 10(i). Upon
any liquidation of the Underlying
Securities, the Trustee, first, shall
distribute the proceeds thereof to the Swap
Counterparty until all amounts
owing to the Swap Counterparty have been
paid in full and, second, shall
distribute all remaining amounts to the
Certificateholders. In the event of a
Swap Agreement Termination Event, after
paying all amounts due to the Swap
Counterparty as set forth in the first
sentence of this Section 10(b), if no
Trust Termination Event has occurred, all
Interest Collections shall
thereafter be distributed to
Certificateholders on each applicable
Distribution Date. If a Swap Agreement
Termination Event has occurred for
which the Swap Counterparty is the
Defaulting Party or the only Affected
Party, notwithstanding the termination of
the Swap Agreement, the Trustee
shall distribute any Unpaid Amounts to the
Swap Counterparty from Interest
Collections on the Underlying
Securities.
 
                 
(c) In all cases hereunder, except as provided in
subsections 8(b) and 10(d) hereof, if any
payment with respect to the
Underlying Securities is made to the
Trustee after the Underlying Securities
Payment Date on which such payment was due,
the Trustee shall distribute such
amount received on the Business Day
following such receipt.
 
 
 
                                     
8
<PAGE>
 
                 
(d) Upon the occurrence of any Deferral Period (i) the
Trustee shall not be obligated to
distribute Interest Collections on any
Scheduled Distribution Date until (x)
payments on the Underlying Securities
have resumed and (y) all amounts due and
payable on the Underlying Securities
have been received by the Trust and any
amounts owed to the Swap Counterparty
under the Swap Agreement have been paid to
the Swap Counterparty. Upon the
satisfaction of these conditions, the
Trustee shall distribute the Interest
Collections to Certificateholders in
accordance with subsection 10(a) above.
 
                 
(e) In the event of a Payment Default while the Swap
Agreement is in effect and if any payment
is due to the Swap Counterparty, the
Underlying Securities will be liquidated in
accordance with Section 10(i).
Otherwise, in the event of a Payment
Default, the Trustee shall proceed
against the Underlying Securities Issuer on
behalf of the Certificateholders
to enforce the Underlying Securities or
otherwise to protect the interests of
the Certificateholders, subject to the
receipt of indemnity in form and
substance satisfactory to the Trustee;
provided, that Holders of the
Certificates representing a majority of the
Voting Rights on the Certificates
will be entitled to direct the Trustee in
any such proceeding or direct the
Trustee to sell the Underlying Securities,
subject to the Trustee's receipt of
satisfactory indemnity.
 
                 
(f) In the event of an Acceleration and a corresponding
payment on the Underlying Securities prior
to any liquidation of the
Underlying Securities hereunder, the
Trustee shall distribute the proceeds to
the Certificateholders no later than two
(2) Business Days after the receipt
of immediately available funds pursuant to
Section 10(b).
 
                 
(g) In the event the Trustee receives property other than
cash in respect of the Underlying
Securities such property will be applied
first, to the Swap Counterparty until all
amounts owing to the Swap
Counterparty have been paid in full and,
second, to the Certificateholders.
Property other than cash will be liquidated
by the Trustee, and the proceeds
thereof distributed in cash, to the extent
necessary to pay to the Swap
Counterparty all amounts owed to it under
the Swap Agreement and, thereafter,
to the extent necessary to avoid
distribution of fractional securities to
Certificateholders. In-kind distribution of
Underlying Securities or other
property to Certificateholders will be
deemed to reduce the Stated Amount of
Certificates on a proportionate basis.
Following such in-kind distribution,
all Certificates will be cancelled. No
amounts will be distributed to the
Trustor in respect of the Underlying
Securities. The Swap Counterparty shall
direct the Trustee with respect to any
liquidation of such property to the
extent of the full amount owed to it under
the Swap Agreement.
 
                 
(h) If an SEC Reporting Failure occurs, then the Trustor
shall promptly notify the Trustee, the Swap
Counterparty and the Rating Agency
of such SEC Reporting Failure and the
Trustee shall, only if instructed by the
Trustor, proceed to liquidate or distribute
the Underlying Securities in
accordance with Section 10(i).
 
                 
(i) If at any time, the Trustee is directed to sell the
Underlying Securities, the Trustee shall
solicit bids for the sale of the
Underlying Securities with settlement
thereof on or before the third (3rd)
Business Day after such sale from three
leading dealers in the relevant
market, which may include but is not
limited to any three of the following
dealers: (1) Wachovia Securities, (2)
Goldman, Sachs & Co., (3) Lehman
Brothers Inc., (4) Merrill Lynch, Pierce,
Fenner & Smith Incorporated, (5)
Citigroup Global Markets Inc., (6) J.P.
Morgan Securities Inc.

<PAGE>
 
and (7) Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.;
provided, however, that no bid from
Wachovia Securities or any affiliate
thereof shall be accepted unless such bid
equals the then fair market value of such
Underlying Securities. The Trustee
shall not be responsible for the failure to
obtain a bid so long as it has
made reasonable efforts to obtain bids. If
a bid for the sale of the
Underlying Securities has been accepted by
the Trustee but the sale has failed
to settle on the proposed settlement date,
the Trustee shall request new bids
from such leading dealers. In any
circumstance in which the sale of the
Underlying Securities is required
hereunder, the Trustee shall, to the extent
it is so directed by the Trustor, provide
Certificateholders with the option
to elect to receive an "in-kind"
distribution of their pro rata share of the
Underlying Securities; provided, that, (1)
an in-kind distribution shall be
subject to the prior sale of Underlying
Securities in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 10(i) to the
extent necessary, to pay any amounts
owing to the Swap Counterparty under
Section 10(b), (2) a Certificateholders'
pro rata share of the Underlying Securities
shall be a principal amount of
Underlying Securities equal to the
aggregate principal amount of the
Underlying Securities minus the amount
required to be distributed to the Swap
Counterparty pursuant to the second
sentence of Section 10(b) multiplied by a
fraction the numerator of which is the
Stated Amount of that holder's
Certificates and the denominator of which
is the aggregate principal amount of
the Underlying Securities and (3) odd-lot
amounts that cannot be distributed
in-kind because they are not within the
authorized denominations of the
Underlying Securities shall be distributed
in cash. Any such in-kind
distribution shall constitute the final
distribution in respect of the
Certificates as to which such option is
exercised.
 
                 
(j) Distributions to the Certificateholders on each
Distribution Date will be made to the
Certificateholders of record on the
Record Date.
 
                 
(k) All distributions to Certificateholders shall be
allocated pro rata among the Certificates
based on their respective
Outstanding Amounts as of the Record
Date.
 
                 
(l) Notwithstanding any provision of the Agreement to the
contrary, to the extent funds are
available, the Trustee will initiate payment
in immediately available funds by 1:00 P.M.
(New York City time) on each
Distribution Date of all amounts payable to
each Certificateholder with
respect to any Certificate held by such
Certificateholder or its nominee
(without the necessity for any presentation
or surrender thereof or any
notation of such payment thereon) in the
manner and at the address as each
Certificateholder may from time to time
direct the Trustee in writing 15 days
prior to such Distribution Date requesting
that such payment will be so made
and designating the bank account to which
such payments shall be so made. The
Trustee shall be entitled to rely on the
last instruction delivered by the
Certificateholder pursuant to this Section
10(g) unless a new instruction is
delivered 15 days prior to a Distribution
Date.
 
                 
(m) The rights of the Certificateholders to receive
distributions in respect of the
Certificates, and all interests of the
Certificateholders in such distributions,
shall be as set forth in this Series
Supplement. The Trustee shall in no way be
responsible or liable to the
Certificateholders nor shall any
Certificateholder in any way be responsible
or liable to any other Certificateholder in
respect of amounts previously
distributed on the Certificates based on
their respective Outstanding Amounts.
 
                 
Section 11. Termination of Trust. (a) The Trust shall
terminate upon the occurrence of any Trust
Termination Event.
 
 
 
                                     
10
<PAGE>
 
                 
(b) Except for any reports and other information required
to be provided to Certificateholders
hereunder and under the Base Trust
Agreement and except as otherwise specified
herein and therein, the
obligations of the Trustee will terminate
upon the distribution to the Swap
Counterparty and Certificateholders of all
amounts required to be distributed
to them and the disposition of all
Underlying Securities held by the Trustee.
The Trust shall thereupon terminate, except
for surviving rights of indemnity.
 
                 
Section 12. Limitation of Powers and Duties. (a) The Trustee
shall administer the Trust and the
Underlying Securities solely as specified
herein and in the Base Trust Agreement.
 
                 
(b) The Trust is constituted solely for the purpose of
acquiring and holding the Underlying
Securities, entering into and performing
its obligations under the Swap Agreement
and issuing the Certificates. The
Trustee is not authorized to acquire any
other investments or engage in any
activities not authorized herein and, in
particular, unless expressly provided
in the Agreement, the Trustee is not
authorized (i) to sell, assign, transfer,
exchange, pledge, set-off or otherwise
dispose of any of the Underlying
Securities, once acquired, or interests
therein, including to
Certificateholders, (ii) to merge or
consolidate the Trust with any other
entity, or (iii) to do anything that would
materially increase the likelihood
that the Trust will fail to qualify as a
grantor trust for United States
federal income tax purposes. In addition,
the Trustee has no power to create,
assume or incur indebtedness or other
liabilities in the name of the Trust
other than as contemplated herein and in
the Base Trust Agreement.
 
                
  (c) The parties
acknowledge that the Trustee, as the holder
of the Underlying Securities, has the right
to vote and give consents and
waivers in respect of the Underlying
Securities and enforce the other rights,
if any, of a holder of the Underlying
Securities, except as otherwise limited
by the Base Trust Agreement or this Series
Supplement. In the event that the
Trustee receives a request from the
Underlying Securities Trustee, the
Underlying Securities Issuer, the
Underlying Securities Guarantor or, if
applicable, the Depositary with respect to
the Underlying Securities, for the
Trustee's consent to any amendment,
modification or waiver of the Underlying
Securities, or any document relating
thereto, or receives any other
solicitation for any action with respect to
the Underlying Securities, the
Trustee shall within two (2) Business Days
mail a notice of such proposed
amendment, modification, waiver or
solicitation to the Swap Counterparty and
each Certificateholder of record as of the
date of such request. The Trustee
shall request instructions from the
Certificateholders as to what action to
take in response to such request and shall
be protected in taking no action if
no direction is received. Except as
otherwise provided herein, the Trustee
shall consent or vote, or refrain from
consenting or voting, in the same
proportion (based on the Stated Amounts of
the Certificates of each Class as
allocated based on the respective Voting
Rights of each Class) as the
Certificates were actually voted or not
voted by the Holders thereof as of the
date determined by the Trustee prior to the
date such vote or consent is
required; provided, however, that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
the Base Trust Agreement or this Series
Supplement, the Trustee shall at no
time vote in favor of or consent to any
matter (i) which would alter the
timing or amount of any payment on the
Underlying Securities (including,
without limitation, any demand to
accelerate the Underlying Securities) or
(ii) which would result in the exchange or
substitution of any Underlying
Security whether or not pursuant to a plan
for the refunding or refinancing of
such Underlying Security, except in each
case with the unanimous consent of
the Certificateholders;
 
 
                               
      
11
<PAGE>
 
provided, further, that the Trustee shall
not take any such action if it would
affect the method, amount or timing of
payments due to the Swap Counterparty
or otherwise materially adversely affect
the interests of the Swap
Counterparty under the Swap Agreement and
result in a Swap Agreement
Termination Event, in each case without the
prior written consent of the Swap
Counterparty. The Trustee shall have no
liability for any failure to act or to
refrain from acting resulting from the
Certificateholders' late return of, or
failure to return, directions requested by
the Trustee from the
Certificateholders.
 
                 
(d) Notwithstanding any provision of the Agreement to the
contrary, the Trustee may require from the
Certificateholders prior to taking
any action at the direction of the
Certificateholders, an indemnity agreement
of a Certificateholder or any of its
Affiliates to provide for security or
indemnity against the costs, expenses and
liabilities the Trustee may incur by
reason of any such action. An unsecured
indemnity agreement, if acceptable to
the Trustee, shall be deemed to be
sufficient to satisfy such security or
indemnity requirement.
 
                 
(e) Notwithstanding any provision of the Agreement to the
contrary, the Trustee shall act as the sole
Authenticating Agent, Paying Agent
and Registrar.
 
                 
Section 13. Compensation of Trustee. The Trustee shall be
entitled to receive from the Trustor as
compensation for its services
hereunder, trustee's fees pursuant to a
separate agreement between the Trustee
and the Trustor, and shall be reimbursed
for all reasonable expenses,
disbursements and advances incurred or made
by it (including the reasonable
compensation, disbursements and expenses of
its counsel and other persons not
regularly in its employ). The Trustor shall
indemnify and hold harmless the
Trustee and its successors, assigns, agents
and servants against any and all
loss, liability or reasonable expense
(including attorney's fees) incurred by
it in connection with the administration of
this trust and the performance of
its duties thereunder. The Trustee shall
notify the Trustor promptly of any
claim for which it may seek indemnity.
Failure by the Trustee to so notify the
Trustor shall not relieve the Trustor of
its obligations hereunder. The
Trustor need not reimburse any expense or
indemnify against any loss,
liability or expense incurred by the
Trustee through the Trustee's own willful
misconduct, negligence or bad faith. The
indemnities contained in this Section
13 shall survive the resignation or
termination of the Trustee or the
termination of this Agreement.
 
                 
Failure by the Trustor to pay, reimburse or indemnify the
Trustee shall not entitle the Trustee to
any payment, reimbursement or
indemnification from the Trust, nor shall
such failure release the Trustee
from the duties it is required to perform
under this Series Supplement. Any
unpaid, unreimbursed or unindemnified
amounts shall not be borne by the Trust
and shall not constitute a claim against
the Trust, but shall be borne by the
Trustee in its individual capacity, and the
Trustee shall have no recourse
against the Trust with respect thereto.
 
                 
Section 14. Modification or Amendment of the Base Trust
Agreement, the Series Supplement or the
Swap Agreement. (a) The Trustee shall
not enter into any modification or
amendment of the Base Trust Agreement or
this Series Supplement unless such
modification or amendment is in accordance
with Section 10.1 of the Base Trust
Agreement. If the Rating Agency Condition
is not satisfied with respect to any
proposed modification or amendment of the
Base Trust Agreement or this Series
Supplement, then any such modification or
amendment must be approved by 100% of the
Certificateholders. The Trustee
shall not enter into any
 
 
                                     
12
<PAGE>
 
amendment or modification of this Agreement
that would affect the method,
amount or timing of payment due to the Swap
Counterparty or the consent rights
of the Swap Counterparty hereunder or
otherwise materially adversely affect
the interests of the Swap Counterparty
under the Swap Agreement and result in
a Swap Agreement Termination Event, in each
case without the prior written
consent of the Swap Counterparty. The
Trustee shall provide fifteen Business
Days written notice to the Swap
Counterparty before entering into any
amendment or modification of this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 14.
 
                 
(b) The Trustee shall not enter into any modification or
amendment of the Swap Agreement without the
prior written consent of holders
of Certificates representing 66 ?% of the
Voting Rights and without prior
written confirmation from the Rating Agency
that such amendment will not
result in a reduction or withdrawal of the
then current rating of the
Certificates; provided, however, that each
of the Swap Counterparty and the
Trustee may amend the Swap Agreement
without the prior written consent of
Certificateholders to cure any ambiguity
in, or to correct or supplement any
provision of the Swap Agreement which may
be inconsistent with any other
provision of the Swap Agreement, or to
otherwise cure any defect in the Swap
Agreement, provided that any such amendment
does not materially adversely
affect the interest of the
Certificateholders and that the Rating Agency will
have given its prior written confirmation
that such amendment will not result
in a reduction or withdrawal of the then
current rating of the Certificates;
provided further, however, that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary, no
amendment may alter the timing or amount of
any payment on the Swap Agreement
without the prior consent of 100% of the
Certificateholders and without giving
the Rating Agency prior written notice of
any such amendment.
 
                 
(c) Until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has actual
knowledge of the occurrence of an event
that would constitute a Swap Agreement
Termination Event, the Trustee shall be
entitled to assume (and shall be fully
protected, indemnified and held harmless in
doing so) that no Swap Agreement
Termination Event has occurred and may
accordingly seek instructions under
Section 12 and this Section 14 exclusively
from the Swap Counterparty.
 
                 
Section 15. Assignment of Rights under the Swap Agreement.
The Trustee may consent to any transfer or
assignment by the Swap Counterparty
of its rights under the Swap Agreement, so
long as the Rating Agency shall
have given its prior written confirmation
that such transfer or assignment
will not result in a reduction or
withdrawal of the then current rating of the
Certificates.
 
                 
Section 16. Accounting. Notwithstanding Section 3.16 of the
Base Trust Agreement, "Independent Public
Accountants' Administration Report,"
no such accounting reports shall be
required. Pursuant to Section 4.2 of the
Base Trust Agreement, "Reports to
Certificateholders," the Trustee shall cause
the statement described in Section 4.2 to
be prepared and forwarded as
provided therein.
 
              
    Section

(c) In the event a Payment Default or an Acceleration
occurs, the Trustee shall promptly give
notice to the Swap Counterparty and to
the Depositary or, for any Certificates
which are not then held by the
Depositary or any other depository,
directly to the registered holders of the
Certificates thereof. Such notice shall set

Default or Acceleration, (iii) the
principal amount of the interest or
principal in default, (iv) the Certificates
affected by the Payment Default or
Acceleration, and (v) any other information
which the Trustee may deem
appropriate.
 
                 
(d) Notwithstanding any provisions of the Agreement to the
contrary, the Trustee shall deliver all
notices or reports required to be
delivered to or by the Trustee or the
Trustor to the Certificateholders or the
Swap Counterparty without charge to such
Certificateholders or the Swap

(whether or not such notice or

Agreement), provide such notice or
documents to the Swap Counterparty
concurrently with the delivery thereof to
the Certificateholders.

Section 21. Advances. There is no Administrative Agent
specified herein; hence no person
(including the Trustee) shall be permitted
or obligated to make Advances as described
in Section 4.3 of the Base Trust
Agreement, "Advances."
 
                 
Section 22. Ratification of Agreement. With respect to the
Series issued hereby, the Base Trust
Agreement (including the grant of a
security interest in Section 10.8 of the
Base Trust Agreement with respect to
the Underlying Securities conveyed
hereunder), as supplemented by this Series
Supplement, is in all respects ratified and
confirmed, and the Base Trust
Agreement as so supplemented by this Series
Supplement shall be read, taken
and construed as one and the same
instrument. To the extent there is any
inconsistency between the terms of the Base
Trust Agreement and this Series
Supplement, the terms of this Series
Supplement shall govern.
 
                 
Section 23. Counterparts. This Series Supplement may be
executed in any number of counterparts,
each of which so executed shall be
deemed to be an original, but all of such
counterparts shall together
constitute but one and the same
instrument.
 
                 
Section 24. Governing Law. This Series Supplement and each
Certificate issued hereunder shall be
governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of New York
applicable to agreements made and to be
performed entirely therein without
reference to such State's principles of
conflicts of law to the extent that the
application of the laws of another
jurisdiction would be required thereby, and
the obligations, rights and
remedies of the parties hereunder shall be
determined in accordance with such
laws. The State of New York is the
securities intermediary's jurisdiction of
the Securities Intermediary for purposes of
the UCC.
 
                 
Section 25. Certificate of Compliance. The Trustor shall
deliver to the Trustee and the Swap
Counterparty on or prior to June 30 of
each year prior to a Trust Termination
Event the Officer's Certificate as to
compliance as required by Section 6.1(b) of
the Base Trust Agreement.
 
                 
Section 26. Certain Filing to be Made by the Trustee. In the
event that an event requiring the sale of
the Underlying Securities under this
Agreement occurs and the Underlying
Securities are liquidated at a loss, the
Trustee will disclose pursuant to Treasury
Regulation Section 1.6011-4 the
loss in accordance with the procedures of
such regulation, unless the Trustee
obtains advice from counsel that such
disclosure is not necessary. In general,
the Trustee will (x) attach a completed
Form 8886 to its tax return in the
year the requisite loss occurs and (y) file
a completed form with the Office
of Tax Shelter Analysis (OTSA) at: Internal
Revenue Service LM:PFTG:OTSA,
Large and Midsize Business Division, 1111
Constitution Avenue., NW.,
Washington DC 20224 (or such other address
subsequently required).
 
                 
Section 27. Establishment of Accounts. The Securities
Intermediary and the Trustee hereby
represent and warrant that:
 
                 
(a) Each Account for the Trust is a "securities account"
within the meaning of Section 8-501 of the
UCC and is held only in the name of
the Trustee on behalf of the Trust. The
Securities Intermediary is acting in
the capacity of a "securities intermediary"
within the meaning of Section
8-102(a)(14) of the UCC;
 
 
 
                
                     
15
<PAGE>
 
                 
(b) All Underlying Securities have been (i) delivered to the
Securities Intermediary pursuant to the
Agreement and (ii) credited to the
Certificate Account; and
 
                 
(c) Each Account is an account to which financial assets are
or may be credited, and the Securities
Intermediary shall treat the Trustee as
entitled to exercise the rights that
comprise any financial asset credited to
the Accounts.
 
                 
Section 28. Statement of Intent. It is the intention of the
parties hereto that, for purposes of
federal income taxes, state and local
income and franchise taxes and any other
taxes imposed upon, measured by or
based upon gross or net income, the Trust
shall be treated as a grantor trust,
but failing that, as a partnership (other
than a publicly traded partnership
taxable as a corporation) and, in any
event, shall not be classified as a
corporation. The parties hereto agree that,
unless otherwise required by
appropriate tax authorities, the Trustee
shall file or cause to be filed
annual or other necessary returns, reports
and other forms consistent with
such intended characterization. In the
event that the Trust is characterized
by appropriate tax authorities as a
partnership for federal income tax
purposes, each Certificateholder, by its
acceptance of its Certificate, agrees
to report its respective share of the items
of income, deductions, and credits
of the Trust on its respective returns. As
further consideration for each
Certificateholder's purchase of a
Certificate, each such Certificateholder is
deemed to agree not to irrevocably delegate
to any person (for a period of
more than one year) authority to purchase,
sell or exchange its Certificates.
 
                 
Each Certificateholder (and each beneficial owner of a
Certificate) by acceptance of its
Certificate (or its beneficial interest
therein) agrees, unless otherwise required
by appropriate tax authorities, to
file its own tax returns and reports in a
manner consistent with the
characterization indicated above.
 
                 
Section 29. Filing of Partnership Returns. In the event that
the Trust is characterized (by appropriate
tax authorities) as a partnership
for United States federal income tax
purposes the Trustor agrees to reimburse
the Trust for any expenses associated with
the filing of partnership returns
(or returns related thereto).
 
                 
Section 30. "Financial Assets" Election. The Securities
Intermediary hereby agrees that the
Underlying Securities credited to the
Certificate Account and any Posted
Collateral credited to the Collateral
Account shall be treated as a "financial
asset" within the meaning of Section
8-102(a)(9) of the UCC.
 
                 
Section 31. Trustee's Entitlement Orders. If at any time the
Securities Intermediary shall receive any
order from the Trustee directing the
transfer or redemption of any Underlying
Securities credited to the Accounts,
the Securities Intermediary shall comply
with such entitlement order without
further consent by the Trustor or any other
Person. The Securities
Intermediary shall take all instructions
(including without limitation all
notifications and entitlement orders) with
respect to the Accounts solely from
the Trustee.
 
                 
Section 32. Conflict with Other Agreements. The Securities
Intermediary hereby confirms and agrees
that:
 
 
 
                                     
16
<PAGE>
 
                 
(a) There are no other agreements entered into between the
Securities Intermediary and the Trustor
with respect to the Accounts. Each
Account and all property credited to the
Account is not subject to, and the
Securities Intermediary hereby waives, any
lien, security interest, right of
set off, or encumbrance in favor of the
Securities Intermediary or any Person
claiming through the Securities
Intermediary (other than the Trustee);
 
                 
(b) It has not entered into, and until the termination of
the Agreement will not enter into, any
agreement with any other Person
relating to the Accounts and/or any
financial assets credited thereto pursuant
to which it has agreed to comply with
entitlement orders of any Person other
than the Trustee; and
 
                 
(c) It has not entered into, and until the termination of
the Agreement will not enter into, any
agreement with any Person purporting to
limit or condition the obligation of the
Securities Intermediary to comply
with entitlement orders as set forth in
Section 31 hereof.
 
                 
Section 33. Additional Trustee and Securities Intermediary
Representations. The Trustee and the
Securities Intermediary each hereby
represents and warrants as follows:
 
                 
(a) The Trustee and the Securities Intermediary each
maintains its books and records with
respect to its securities accounts in the
State of New York;
 
                 
(b) The Trustee and the Securities Intermediary each has not
granted any lien on the Underlying
Securities nor are the Underlying
Securities subject to any lien on
properties of the Trustee or the Securities
Intermediary in its individual capacity;
the Trustee and the Securities
Intermediary each has no actual knowledge
and has not received actual notice
of any lien on the Underlying Securities
(other than any liens of the Trustee
in favor of the beneficiaries of the Trust
Agreement); other than the
interests of the Trustee, the
Certificateholders and the Swap Counterparty,
the books and records of the Trustee and
the Securities Intermediary each do
not identify any Person as having an
interest in the Underlying Securities;
and
 
                 
(c) The Trustee and the Securities Intermediary each makes
no representation as to (i) the validity,
legality, sufficiency or
enforceability of any of the Underlying
Securities or (ii) the collectability,
insurability, effectiveness or suitability
of any of the Underlying
Securities.
 
                 
Section 34. Additional Trustor Representations. The Trustor
hereby represents and warrants to the
Trustee as follows:
 
                 
(a) Immediately prior to the sale of the Underlying
Securities to the Trustee, the Trustor, as
Depositor, owned and had good and
marketable title to the Underlying
Securities free and clear of any lien,
claim or encumbrance of any Person;
 
                 
(b) The Trustor, as Depositor, has received all consents and
approvals required by the terms of the
Underlying Securities to the sale to
the Trustee of its interest and rights in
the Underlying Securities as
contemplated by the Agreement; and
 
                 
(c) The Trustor has not assigned, pledged, sold, granted a
security interest in or otherwise conveyed
any interest in the Underlying
Securities (or, if any such interest has
been assigned, pledged or otherwise
encumbered, it has been released), except
such interests sold
 
 
                                     
17
<PAGE>
 
pursuant to the Agreement. The Trustor has
not authorized the filing of and is
not aware of any financing statements
against the Trustor that includes a
description of the Underlying Securities,
other than any such filings pursuant
to the Agreement. The Trustor is not aware
of any judgment or tax lien filings
against Trustor.
 
                 
Section 35. Certification Requirements. The Trustee agrees
to obtain, at the Trustor's direction and
expense, a report of an independent
public accountant sufficient for the
Trustor on behalf of the Trust to satisfy
its obligations with respect to
certification requirements under Rules 13a-14
and 15d-14 of the Exchange Act.
 
                 
Section 36. Additional Rights of the Swap Counterparty.
Section 10.8 of the Base Trust Agreement is
hereby modified for purposes of
this Series Supplement to provide that the
security interest referred to and
created pursuant thereto in the Trust
assets shall, in addition to the
obligations provided for under Section
10.8(b)(3), secure all of the
obligations of the Trustor and the Trust to

(b) The following conditions shall apply to any Optional
Exchange:
 
 
 
                                     
18
<PAGE>
 
                 
(A) A notice specifying the number of Certificates being
        
surrendered and the optional exchange date shall be delivered to
the

(B) Certificates shall be surrendered to the trustee no
        
later than 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the optional
exchange
        
date.
 
                 
(C) The Trustee shall have received an opinion of counsel
        
stating that the Optional Exchange would not cause the Trust to
be
        
classified as a corporation or publicly traded partnership taxable
as
        
a corporation for federal income tax purposes.
 
                 
(D) The Trustee shall not be obligated to determine whether

Depositor to a distribution thereof.
 
                 
(F) The aggregate principal balance of Certificates
        
exchanged in connection with any Optional Exchange pursuant to
this
        
Section 39 shall be in an amount that results in a distribution

of the Underlying Securities.
 
                 
(G) No Swap Agreement Termination Event shall have occurred
        
as a result of the Optional Exchange except to the extent of a

principal amount of the Underlying Securities after giving effect
to
        
the Optional Exchange.

the reduction in such Hedge Notional Amount and any such Swap
        
Agreement Termination Event (x) that are due to the Swap
Counterparty
        
(including but not limited to Unpaid Amounts) shall have been paid
to
        
the Swap Counterparty by the Depositor and (y) that are payable

evidencing an undivided interest in the
Trust, as defined below, the assets of
which include $40,000,000 (by aggregate
liquidation amount) of 6.345% Capital
Securities due February 15, 2034 issued by
the Underlying Securities Issuer.
 
This Certificate does not represent an
interest in or obligation of the
Trustor or any of its affiliates.
 
        
THIS CERTIFIES THAT Cede & Co. is the registered owner of a
nonassessable, fully-paid, fractional
undivided interest in STRATS(SM) Trust For
Goldman Sachs Capital I Securities, Series
2005-3 (the "Trust") formed by
SYNTHETIC FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES, INC., as
Trustor (the "Trustor") evidenced
by Certificates in the number and the
Stated Amount set forth above.
 
        
The Trust was created pursuant to a Base Trust Agreement, dated as
of
September 26, 2003 (as amended and
supplemented, the "Agreement"), between the
Trustor and U.S. Bank Trust National
Association, a national banking
association, not in its individual capacity
but
 
 
                                     
C-1
<PAGE>
 
solely as Trustee (the "Trustee"), as
supplemented by the STRATS(SM)
Certificates Series Supplement 2005-3,
dated as of September 30, 2005 (the
"Series Supplement" and, together with the
Agreement, the "Trust Agreement"),
between the Trustor and the Trustee. This
Certificate does not purport to
summarize the Trust Agreement and reference
is hereby made to the Trust
Agreement for information with respect to
the interests, rights, benefits,
obligations, proceeds and duties evidenced
hereby and the rights, duties and
obligations of the Trustee with respect
hereto. A copy of the Trust Agreement
may be obtained from the Trustee by written
request sent to the Corporate
Trust Office. Capitalized terms used but
not defined herein have the meanings
assigned to them in the Trust
Agreement.
 
        
This Certificate is one of the duly authorized Certificates
designated as "STRATS(SM) Certificates,
Series 2005-3 (herein called the
"Certificate" or "Certificates"). This
Certificate is issued under and is
subject to the terms, provisions and
conditions of the Trust Agreement, to
which Trust Agreement the Holder of this
Certificate by virtue of the
acceptance hereof assents and by which such
Holder is bound. The assets of the
Trust include the Underlying Securities,
all proceeds of the Underlying
Securities and the Trust's rights under the
Swap Agreement.
 
        
Under the Trust Agreement, there shall be distributed on the
dates
specified in the Trust Agreement (a
"Distribution Date"), to the person in
whose name this Certificate is registered
at the close of business on the
related Record Date, such
Certificateholder's fractional undivided interest in
the amount of distributions of the
Underlying Securities to be distributed to
Certificateholders on such Distribution
Date and distributions to the Trust
under the Swap Agreement. The Underlying
Securities will pay interest on
February 15 and August 15 of each year. The
principal of the Underlying
Securities is scheduled to be paid on
February 15, 2034. The Swap Agreement
provides for payments on the 15th calendar
day of each month, except during a
Deferral Period, commencing on October 15,
2005.
 
        
During any Deferral Period, interest on the Certificates will
continue to accrue at a specified rate and
will be payable on the next
succeeding Underlying Securities Payment
Date once (i) distributions on the
Underlying Securities have resumed and (ii)
all amounts due and payable on the
Underlying Securities have been received by
the Trust and any amounts owed to
the Swap Counterparty under the Swap
Agreement have been paid to the Swap
Counterparty. Thereafter, and so long as
the Swap Agreement is in effect,
interest on the Certificates will be
payable semi-annually on each February 15
and August 15 (or the next succeeding
business day), until the Certificates
have been retired.
 
        
The distributions in respect of this Certificate are payable in
such
coin or currency of the United States of
America as at the time of payment is
legal tender for payment of public and
private debts as set forth in the
Series Trust Agreement.
 
        
The Underlying Securities held by the Trust are subject to the
rights
of the Swap Counterparty, as provided for
in the Series Supplement and the
Swap Agreement, and each Certificateholder,
by accepting its Certificate,
acknowledges such rights in accordance with
the terms of the Series Supplement
and the Swap Agreement.
 
        
It is the intent of the Trustor and the Certificateholders that
the
Trust will be classified as a grantor trust
under subpart E, Part I of
subchapter J of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as
 
                                    
C-2
 
<PAGE>
 
amended. Except as otherwise required by
appropriate taxing authorities, the
Trustor and the Trustee, by executing the
Trust Agreement, and each
Certificateholder, by acceptance of a
Certificate, agrees to treat, and to
take no action inconsistent with the
treatment of, the Certificates for such
tax purposes as interests in a grantor
trust and the provisions of the Trust
Agreement shall be interpreted to further
this intention of the parties.
 
        
By acceptance of a Certificate, each Certificateholder (1) elects
to
integrate the Underlying Securities and the
Swap Agreement for United States
federal income tax purposes, (2) authorizes
and directs the trustee (or the
trustee's agent) to retain, as part of the
Certificateholder's books and
records, information that (a) describes the
Underlying Securities and the Swap
Agreement, (b) identifies the two positions
as integrated for federal income
tax purposes and (c) describes the features
of the resulting "synthetic" debt
instrument and (3) agrees to retain copies
of such information as provided to
the Certificateholder by the Trust.
 
        
Each Certificateholder, by its acceptance of a Certificate,
covenants
and agrees that such Certificateholder
shall not, prior to the date which is
one year and one day after the termination
of the Trust Agreement, acquiesce,
petition or otherwise invoke or cause the
Trustor to invoke the process of any
court or governmental authority for the
purpose of commencing or sustaining a
case against the Trustor under any federal
or state bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization or similar law or appointing
a receiver, liquidator, assignee,
trustee, custodian, sequestrator or other
similar official of the Trustor or
any substantial part of its property, or
ordering the winding up or
liquidation of the affairs of the
Trustor.
 
        
Certificates may not be acquired by or for the account of any
employee benefit plan, trust or account,
including an individual retirement
account, that is subject to the
requirements of Title I of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended, or that is described in
Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code, or by or
for the account of any entity whose
underlying assets include any assets
subject to these laws by reason of
investment in that entity by such plans,
trusts or accounts. By accepting and
holding this Certificate, the holder of
this Certificate will be deemed to
have represented and warranted that it is
not a plan or entity described
above, and that its acquisition and holding
of this Certificate are in
compliance with the foregoing
restrictions.
 
        
The Trust Agreement permits the amendment thereof, in certain
circumstances, without the consent of the
Holders of any of the Certificates.
 
        
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon shall have been
executed by an authorized officer of the
Trustee by manual signature, this
Certificate shall not entitle the Holder
hereof to any benefit under the Trust
Agreement or be valid for any purpose.
 
        
A copy of the Trust Agreement is available upon request and all
of
its terms and conditions are hereby
incorporated by reference and made a part
hereof.
 
        
THIS CERTIFICATE SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS
OF
THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REFERENCE TO
ITS CONFLICT OF LAW PROVISIONS,
AND THE OBLIGATIONS, RIGHTS AND REMEDIES OF
THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE
DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH
LAWS.

have entered and/or anticipate entering
into one of more transactions (each a
"Transaction") that are or will be governed
by this Master Agreement, which
includes the schedule (the "Schedule"), and
the documents and other confirming
evidence (each a "Confirmation") exchanged
between the parties confirming
those Transactions.
 
Accordingly, the parties agree as follows:
--
 
1.       
Interpretation
 
(a)      
Definitions. The terms defined in Section 14 and in the Schedule
will
have the meanings therein specified for the
purpose of this Master Agreement.
 
(b)      
Inconsistency. In the event of any inconsistency between the
provisions of the Schedule and the other
provisions of this Master Agreement,
the Schedule will prevail. In the event of
any inconsistency between the
provisions of any Confirmation and this
Master Agreement (including the
Schedule), such Confirmation will prevail
for the purpose of the relevant
Transaction.
 
(c)       Single
Agreement. All Transactions are entered into in reliance on
the fact that this Master Agreement and all
Confirmations form a single
agreement between the parties (collectively
referred to as this "Agreement"),
and the parties would not otherwise enter
into any Transactions.
 
2.       
Obligations
 
(a)       General
Conditions.
 
        
(i) Each party will make each payment or delivery specified in
each
        
Confirmation to be made by it, subject to the other provisions
of
        
this Agreement.
 
        
(ii) Payments under this Agreement will be made on the due date
for
        
value on that date in the place of the account specified in the
        
relevant Confirmation or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement,
in
        
freely transferable funds and in the manner customary for payments
in
        
the required currency. Where settlement is by delivery (that
is,
        
other than by payment), such delivery will be made for receipt on
the
        
due date in the manner customary for the relevant obligation
unless
        
otherwise specified in the relevant Confirmation or elsewhere in
this
        
Agreement.
 
        
(iii) Each obligation of each party under Section 2(a)(i) is
subject
        
to (1) the condition precedent that no Event of Default or
Potential
        
Event of Default with respect to the other party has occurred and
is
 
 
                                   
D-1-1
<PAGE>
 
        
continuing, (2) the condition precedent that no Early
Termination
        
Date in respect of the relevant Transaction has occurred or
been
        
effectively designated and (3) each other applicable condition
        
precedent specified in this Agreement.
 
(b)       Change of
Account. Either party may change its account for receiving
a payment or delivery by giving notice to
the other party at least five Local
Business Days prior to the scheduled date
for the payment or delivery to which
such change applies unless such other party
gives timely notice of a
reasonable objection to such change.
 
(c)       Netting.
If on any date amounts would otherwise be payable: --
 
        
(i) in the same currency; and
 
        
(ii) in respect of the same Transaction,
 
by each party to the other. then, on such
date, each party's obligation to
make payment of any such amount will be
automatically satisfied and discharged
and, if the aggregate amount that would
otherwise have been payable by one
party exceeds the aggregate amount that
would otherwise have been payable by
the other party, replaced by an obligation
upon the party by whom the larger
aggregate amount would have been payable to
pay to the other party the excess
of the larger aggregate amount over the
smaller aggregate amount.
 
The parties may elect in respect of two or
more Transactions that a net amount
will be determined in respect of all
amounts payable on the same date in the
same currency in respect of such
Transactions, regardless of whether such
amounts are payable in respect of the same
Transaction. The election may be
made in the Schedule or a Confirmation by
specifying that subparagraph (ii)
above will not apply to the Transactions
identified as being subject to the
election, together with the starting date
(in which case subparagraph (ii)
above will not, or will cease to, apply to
such Transactions from such date).
This election may be made separately for
different groups of Transactions and
will apply separately to each pairing of
Offices through which the parties
make and receive payments or
deliveries.
 
(d)       Deduction
or Withholding for Tax.
 
        
(i) Gross-Up. All payments under this Agreement will be made
without
        
any deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax unless
such
        
deduction or withholding is required by any applicable law, as
        
modified by the practice of any relevant governmental revenue
        
authority, then in effect. If a party is so required to deduct
or
        
withhold, then that party ("X") will: --
 
                 
(1) promptly notify the other party ("Y") of such
                  
requirement;
 
                 
(2) pay to the relevant authorities the full amount required
                 
to be deducted or withheld (including the full amount
                 
required to be deducted or withheld from any additional
                  
amount paid by X to Y under this Section 2(d)) promptly upon
                 
the earlier of determining that such deduction or
                 
withholding is required or receiving notice that such amount
                 
has been assessed against Y;
 
                 
(3) promptly forward to Y an official receipt (or a
                 
certified copy), or other documentation reasonably
                 
acceptable to Y, evidencing such payment to such
                 
authorities; and
 
                 
(4) if such Tax is an Indemnifiable Tax, pay to Y, in
                 
addition to the payment to which Y is otherwise entitled
                 
under this Agreement, such additional amount as is necessary
                 
to ensure that the net amount actually received by Y (free
                 
and clear of Indemnifiable Taxes. whether assessed against X
                 
or Y) will equal ft full amount Y would have received had no
                 
such deduction or withholding been required. However, X will
                 
not be required to pay any additional amount to Y to the
                 
extent that it would not be required to be paid but for: --
 
                          
(A) the failure by Y to comply with or perform any
                          
agreement contained in Section 4(a)(i), 4(a)(iii)
                          
or 4(d); or
 
                          
(B) the failure of a representation made by Y
                          
pursuant to Section 3(f) to be accurate and true
                          
unless such failure would not have occurred but for
                          
(I) any action taken by a taxing authority, or
                          
brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, on or
         
                 
after the date on which a
 
 
                                   
D-1-2
<PAGE>
 
                          
Transaction is entered into (regardless of whether
                          
such action is taken or brought with respect to a
                           
party to this Agreement) or (II) a Change in Tax
                          
Law.
 
        
(ii)     
Liability. If: --
 
                 
(1) X is required by any applicable law, as modified by the
                 
practice of any relevant governmental revenue authority, to
                 
make any deduction or withholding in respect of which X
                 
would not be required to pay an additional amount to Y under
                 
Section 2(d)(i)(4);
 
                 
(2) X does not so deduct or withhold; and
 
                 
(3) a liability resulting from such Tax is assessed directly
                 
against X,
 
        
then, except to the extent Y has satisfied or then satisfies
the
        
liability resulting from such Tax, Y will promptly pay to X the
        
amount of such liability (including any related liability for
        
interest, but including any related liability for penalties only if
Y
        
has failed to comply with or perform any agreement contained in
        
Section 4(a)(i), 4(a)(iii) or 4(d)).
 
(e)       Default
Interest; Other Amounts. Prior to the occurrence or effective
designation of an Early Termination Date in
respect of the relevant
Transaction, a party that defaults in the
performance of any payment
obligation will, to the extent permitted by
law and subject to Section 6(c),
be required to pay interest (before as well
as after judgment) on the overdue
amount to the other party on demand in the
same currency as such overdue
amount, for the period from (and including)
the original due date for payment
to (but excluding) the date of actual
payment, at the Default Rate. Such
interest will be calculated on the basis of
daily compounding and the actual
number of days elapsed. If, prior to the
occurrence or effective designation
of an Early Termination Date in respect of
the relevant Transaction, a party
defaults in the performance of any
obligation required to be settled by
delivery, it will compensate the other
party on demand if and to the extent
provided for in the relevant Confirmation
or elsewhere in this Agreement.
 
3.       
Representations
 
Each party represents to the other party
(which representations will be deemed
to be repeated by each party on each date
on which a Transaction is entered
into and, in the case of the
representations in Section 3(f), at all times
until the termination of this Agreement)
that: --
 
(a)       Basic
Representations.
 
        
(i) Status. It is duly organised and validly existing under the
laws
        
of the jurisdiction of its organisation or incorporation and,
if
        
relevant under such laws, in good standing;
 
        
(ii) Powers. It has the power to execute this Agreement and any
other
        
documentation relating to this Agreement to which it is a party,
to
        
deliver this Agreement and any other documentation relating to
this
        
Agreement that it is required by this Agreement to deliver and
to
        
perform its obligations under this

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
