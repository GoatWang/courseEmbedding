                Play/Pause





There's an advantage in working with a financial advisor who knows you – and your financial goals. That's what makes Edward Jones different from other investment firms. Supporting the relationship between you and your financial advisor shapes nearly every aspect of our business.
You may have seen one of our 12,000 offices in your community. That's because we believe you deserve more than a 1-800 number when it comes to your financial future.
What you may not know is that we're a Fortune 500 company with thousands of associates and sophisticated technology supporting your local financial advisor.
The Edward Jones approach in determining your goals, and developing tailored financial strategies, has been helping nearly 7 million clients for more than 90 years.
In fact, we like to think we became one of the largest financial services firms in the country by not acting that way. If you're ready to work with a different kind of investment firm—one that cares as much about why you're investing as what you invest in— you're ready to work with Edward Jones.

Working with a Personal Financial Advisor
Whether you're new to investing or have been investing for years, you owe it to yourself to experience the difference of working with an Edward Jones financial advisor. Our firm is built to deliver personalized service, and we treat you with the respect you deserve. We've been doing it since 1922.
How we can help
We get it. Investing can be complicated. Ask all the questions you want, and we will answer them in plain English. Your financial advisor is your long-term financial partner. These are important goals and you need an advocate – someone who listens and really understands what's important to you. We believe that's the best way to develop a personalized financial strategy.

Are We Right for You?
Here are 5 qualities you can expect from an Edward Jones financial advisor.
View slideshow
Read more 

Are We Right for You?






Understands Me
I want to work with a financial advisor who really gets to know me and my family, our goals and what’s important to us.







Clearly Explains Investing
I’m looking for a financial advisor who will spend time educating me on investment topics and answering my questions.







Knows My Investment Style
I want someone who makes recommendations in my best interest and explains how they can help me make progress towards my goals.







Meets on My Schedule
Meeting with my financial advisor should be convenient. And I want choices – whether that means meeting in person or over the phone.







Stays in Touch
I want my financial advisor to contact me to reassure me that I’m on the right track or make suggestions if I’m not. Even if I’m not expecting it.







Edward Jones & You
If these sound like qualities you’re looking for in a financial advisor, Edward Jones might be right for you.

Focus On You

Focus On You




Every investment firm has principles. And they usually sound exactly the same. We believe Edward Jones is different in almost every way. Our principles were deliberately created with you in mind. We don't just talk about personal service. We're built to deliver it.
Your dedicated financial advisor – It's your financial future, so an 800-number or Internet search for financial advice doesn't cut it. You have a relationship with an Edward Jones financial advisor, who spends time to learn why you're investing and then develops a personalized strategy. No cookie-cutter plans here.
In your neighborhood – With more than 15,000 financial advisors, you shouldn't have to go far to find an Edward Jones office in your community. That means you can actually meet with a financial advisor to discuss what's important to you.
Tailored for individual investors - All of our resources – including investment research, online account access, easy-to-understand statements, sophisticated software and detailed reports – are developed with you in mind.
Experienced support team - Backing up this personal service is a Fortune 500 company with thousands of people and advanced technology. Your financial advisor uses these resources to develop the best strategy for you.
We spend the time and have the knowledge to help you sort through complicated financial questions. Most financial services firms claim to focus on you and your needs, but can they really do it? We believe Edward Jones is uniquely positioned from the ground up to provide the attention, respect and service you deserve.

Prepare for Your First Appointment 
Learn more



Prepare for Your First Appointment 




We're honored that you're considering working with us to help achieve your financial goals. Here are three ways you can prepare our first meeting.


Think about why you're investing
Understanding the "why" will help you be better prepared to discuss your goals and strategies to help reach them. What's important to you and your family? What do you want to achieve?


Gather your statements
If you've worked with a financial advisor before, it's helpful to know about your current investments and your experience to date. If you're new to the investing world, we promise to talk with you, not at you. Our goal is to empower you with the knowledge you'll need to pursue your goals.


Bring your questions
We want to make sure to answer any investment questions you may have, as well as how we can best work together. What do you expect? How often do you want to touch base?

Invested in the Community

Invested in the Community






We are invested in our community
We value the communities where we work, so we're committed to giving back. You'll find our associates serving clients in our offices, but you'll also find us investing our time and talents to support local organizations and great causes. Many Financial Advisors are on Chambers of Commerce and serve as board members and event coordinators for local organizations, and our associates volunteer, donate and support a variety of charitable organizations.







Tour De Ted
Each year, branch and Home Office associates take to the road to raise funds for cancer research for the firm's annual Tour de Ted. In memory of Ted Jones, former managing partner who died from cancer, the first Tour de Ted showcased the firm's community-oriented culture while paying tribute to the history of Edward Jones. Volunteers rode the path of the original "wire" that connected Pueblo, Colo., to St. Louis, Mo., which created our branch network.







Emergency Assistance
Sixteen Financial Advisors in Texas decided to set aside one day out of their busy schedules to give back to their community. They volunteered at the Montgomery County Emergency Assistance facility by painting offices and hallways, and sorting and tagging clothes.







School Supply Drive
Eight local Edward Jones Financial Advisors teamed up on behalf of school children, clearly demonstrating their commitment to family values. Their school supply drive brought in hundreds of classroom necessities, from notebooks and markers to tissues and cleaning wipes.







Habitat for Humanity
When investors wanted to save for a new home, Edward Jones was there to help. Associates from Ontario, Canada, helped a local family reach its goal of home ownership in another way when they came together for the Habitat for Humanity build in Amherstburg, Ont., the first such home built in this community.







Pedal the Cause
We're proud of our associates who joined the fight against cancer as Edward Jones Pedal the Cause riders. More than 200 bike riders from across the U.S. took to the streets (and the Katy Trail) to help fundraise for cancer research.







Walk to End Alzheimer's®
At Edward Jones, we live and work in the communities we serve. We want to make a difference in people’s lives, both in and out of the office. Alzheimer’s disease has a significant impact on individuals, family, friends and community. That’s why we’ve chosen to partner with the Alzheimer’s Association as the National Presenting Sponsor of the Walk to End Alzheimer’s®. We invite you to join us in the fight to end this terrible disease.

Your Retirement Wellness Score



                Your Retirement Wellness Score indicates the percentage of your pre-retirement income that is estimated to be
                              available at the specified retirement age (based on your personalized inputs and current assumptions). Studies
                              suggest replacing at least 70-85% of your income in retirement.                *
              

                The score compares what you are estimated to have in monthly income at retirement against your estimated monthly
                                pre-retirement income. For example, based on your inputs you may have $1,000 per month when you retire, but your
                                monthly pre-retirement income is $2,000. Your Retirement Wellness Score would be 50.              

                This score, and what you will have, are merely estimates based on information provided by you and several
                              financial assumptions, including a 4.5% withdrawal rate. This information may be valued as of different dates.
                              This is not a guarantee of future income.              

                Your Retirement Wellness Score always assumes you are replacing 100% of your pre-retirement income.
                              So, it will not change if you make changes that impact your desired income in retirement.

Short and Sharp: The twisted relationship between central banks and inflation

Investors currently face the challenge of the Federal Reserve’s belief that monetary policy needs to be tightened, despite missing inflationary pressures. This is not just a U.S. phenomenon, it’s a global one. In the euro-area, core inflation remains stubbornly low, yet the European Central Bank (ECB) is likely gearing up to announce its tapering plans.

Know Thyself:  Socratic Thoughts on Defined Benefit Fee Policy Statements

I’m not sure what this says about me, but every time someone mentions Socrates, I think of Steve Martin’s depiction of the ancient philosopher in his 1980 TV special Steve Martin: Comedy is Not Pretty. (“…And not once did anyone ever say: ‘Socrates, hemlock is poison!’”)

Investment Fiduciary Support and Services
We provide a level of fiduciary indemnification on our Sub-Advised Investment Options to help with plan sponsors’ investment fiduciary obligations. We also make available optional fiduciary support through services provided by Wilshire.







                Details
                 





A level of fiduciary protection
Sub-Advised Investment Options
Principal Life provides support to cover the investment-related fiduciary concerns regarding:



Qualified Default Investment Alternative (QDIA)
 Principal Life warrants that our lifecycle investment options subject to this coverage1 meet the investment characteristics to be considered a QDIA as required by the Department of Labor.**
Prudent selection and monitoring
 Through our due diligence process:

    
Principal Life warrants that our due diligence process provides prudent and careful review in the selection and ongoing monitoring of managers of Sub-Advised Investment Options
The due diligence process uses a quantitative and qualitative screening process to select, monitor and replace (when appropriate) the managers for our Sub-Advised Investment Options2.
Our due diligence process supports the efforts of financial professionals by providing research information on investment managers.



**Plan sponsors are still responsible for the selection and ongoing monitoring of the investment option as the plan’s QDIA and investment.


Mutual Fund Network
We make quantitative data available to help you monitor and manage the investment manager selection process.
Optional ERISA 3(21) and 3(38) Fiduciary Services
We also make available the optional 3(21) and 3(38) fiduciary services provided by Wilshire Associates Incorporated ("Wilshire®") — an independent third-party firm.
3(21) Fiduciary Service
Under Wilshire's ERISA 3(21) fiduciary service, Wilshire will prudently select investment options to create a list (the "Select List") from which the plan sponsor/plan fiduciary — with education from their financial professional — picks investment options to create an investment lineup for a plan. Investment options chosen from the Select List will receive 3(21) fiduciary coverage from Wilshire. Plan sponsors can still choose investment options that are not on the Select List, but those investment options do not receive fiduciary coverage. There is additional fee for this service.
3(38) Fiduciary Service
Under ERISA 3(38) fiduciary service, Wilshire will have discretion for picking the investment options for a plan (the "Lineup"), monitoring and making changes when they deem appropriate. (As an ERISA 3(38) fiduciary with discretionary control over investments, Wilshire will also be the plan's 3(21) fiduciary.) There is an additional fee for this service.
All financial professionals (based on broker dealer approval) have the option of offering these Wilshire-provided services to their clients, including RIAs, who may wish to supplement their current services to clients.
1For purposes of the QDIA coverage by Principal Life, our lifecycle investment options include Principal LifeTime portfolios, Principal LifeTime Hybrid Funds, Principal LifeTime Hybrid Collective Investment Funds (CITs), and the following Principal Strategic Asset Management (SAM) Portfolios — SAM Flexible Income Portfolio, SAM Conservative Balanced Portfolio, SAM Balanced Portfolio and SAM Conservative Growth Portfolio. All these investment options take into consideration either the participant’s target retirement date or a participant’s target level of risk appropriate for participants of a plan as a whole.
2Sub-Advised Investment Options include the Principal Stable Value Fund and the Principal Life Separate Accounts available through a group annuity contract with Principal Life Insurance Company, Des Moines, IA 50392.
Wilshire® is a registered service mark of Wilshire Associates Incorporated, Santa Monica, California. All other trade names, trademarks, and/or service marks are the property of their respective holders.
Wilshire is not an affiliate of any member company of the Principal Financial Group®.
Principal Life does not act as an ERISA 3(21) or 3(38) fiduciary under the Wilshire-provided fiduciary services.
For full terms and conditions please see the Investment Fiduciary Support and Services Terms and the ERISA 3(38) Service for Defined Contribution Plans – Fiduciary Service Agreement document for more information about the support and services, including the Definitions, Duties and Obligations.
Carefully consider the Fund’s objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact your financial professional or visit principal.com for a prospectus, or summary prospectus if available, containing this and other information. Please read it carefully before investing.
Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.
Equity investment options involve greater risk, including heightened volatility, than fixed-income investment options. Small and mid-cap stocks may have additional risks including greater price volatility. Fixed-income investments are subject to interest rate risk; as interest rates rise their value will decline. International and global investing involves greater risks such as currency fluctuations, political/social instability and differing accounting standards.
Insurance products and plan administrative services are provided by Principal Life Insurance Company. Principal Funds, Inc. is distributed by Principal Funds Distributor, Inc. Securities are offered through Principal Securities Inc., (800) 547-7754, Member SIPC and/or independent broker/dealers. Principal Funds Distributor, Principal Securities and Principal Life are members of the Principal Financial Group®, Des Moines, IA 50392.  Investment options may not be available in all states or U.S. commonwealths.  Separate Accounts are available through a group annuity contract with Principal Life Insurance Company.  See the group annuity contract for the full name of the Separate Account.  Principal Life Insurance Company reserves the right to defer payments or transfers from Principal Life Separate Accounts as permitted by the group annuity contracts providing access to the Separate Accounts or as required by applicable law.  Such deferment will be based on factors that may include situations such as: unstable or disorderly financial markets; investment conditions which do not allow for orderly investment transactions; or investment, liquidity, and other risks inherent in real estate (such as those associated with general and local economic conditions).  If you elect to allocate funds to a Separate Account, you may not be able to immediately withdraw them.

        Usage note        Expand



                The noun principle and the noun and adjective principal are often confused. Although pronounced alike, the words are not interchangeable in writing. A principle is broadly “a rule of action or conduct” (His overriding principle is greed) or “a fundamental doctrine or tenet” (Their principles do not permit the use of alcoholic beverages). The adjective principal has the general sense “chief, first, foremost”: My principal objection is the cost of the project. The noun principal has among other meanings “the head or director of a school” (The faculty supported the principal in her negotiations with the board) and “a capital sum, as distinguished from interest or profit” (The monthly payments go mostly for interest, leaving the principal practically untouched).

There's an advantage in working with a financial advisor who knows you – and your financial goals. That's what makes Edward Jones different from other investment firms. Supporting the relationship between you and your financial advisor shapes nearly every aspect of our business.
You may have seen one of our 12,000 offices in your community. That's because we believe you deserve more than a 1-800 number when it comes to your financial future.
What you may not know is that we're a Fortune 500 company with thousands of associates and sophisticated technology supporting your local financial advisor.
The Edward Jones approach in determining your goals, and developing tailored financial strategies, has been helping nearly 7 million clients for more than 90 years.
In fact, we like to think we became one of the largest financial services firms in the country by not acting that way. If you're ready to work with a different kind of investment firm—one that cares as much about why you're investing as what you invest in— you're ready to work with Edward Jones.

Focus On You




Every investment firm has principles. And they usually sound exactly the same. We believe Edward Jones is different in almost every way. Our principles were deliberately created with you in mind. We don't just talk about personal service. We're built to deliver it.
Your dedicated financial advisor – It's your financial future, so an 800-number or Internet search for financial advice doesn't cut it. You have a relationship with an Edward Jones financial advisor, who spends time to learn why you're investing and then develops a personalized strategy. No cookie-cutter plans here.
In your neighborhood – With more than 15,000 financial advisors, you shouldn't have to go far to find an Edward Jones office in your community. That means you can actually meet with a financial advisor to discuss what's important to you.
Tailored for individual investors - All of our resources – including investment research, online account access, easy-to-understand statements, sophisticated software and detailed reports – are developed with you in mind.
Experienced support team - Backing up this personal service is a Fortune 500 company with thousands of people and advanced technology. Your financial advisor uses these resources to develop the best strategy for you.
We spend the time and have the knowledge to help you sort through complicated financial questions. Most financial services firms claim to focus on you and your needs, but can they really do it? We believe Edward Jones is uniquely positioned from the ground up to provide the attention, respect and service you deserve.

Prepare for Your First Appointment 




We're honored that you're considering working with us to help achieve your financial goals. Here are three ways you can prepare our first meeting.


Think about why you're investing
Understanding the "why" will help you be better prepared to discuss your goals and strategies to help reach them. What's important to you and your family? What do you want to achieve?


Gather your statements
If you've worked with a financial advisor before, it's helpful to know about your current investments and your experience to date. If you're new to the investing world, we promise to talk with you, not at you. Our goal is to empower you with the knowledge you'll need to pursue your goals.


Bring your questions
We want to make sure to answer any investment questions you may have, as well as how we can best work together. What do you expect? How often do you want to touch base?

Invested in the Community






We are invested in our community
We value the communities where we work, so we're committed to giving back. You'll find our associates serving clients in our offices, but you'll also find us investing our time and talents to support local organizations and great causes. Many Financial Advisors are on Chambers of Commerce and serve as board members and event coordinators for local organizations, and our associates volunteer, donate and support a variety of charitable organizations.







Tour De Ted
Each year, branch and Home Office associates take to the road to raise funds for cancer research for the firm's annual Tour de Ted. In memory of Ted Jones, former managing partner who died from cancer, the first Tour de Ted showcased the firm's community-oriented culture while paying tribute to the history of Edward Jones. Volunteers rode the path of the original "wire" that connected Pueblo, Colo., to St. Louis, Mo., which created our branch network.







Emergency Assistance
Sixteen Financial Advisors in Texas decided to set aside one day out of their busy schedules to give back to their community. They volunteered at the Montgomery County Emergency Assistance facility by painting offices and hallways, and sorting and tagging clothes.







School Supply Drive
Eight local Edward Jones Financial Advisors teamed up on behalf of school children, clearly demonstrating their commitment to family values. Their school supply drive brought in hundreds of classroom necessities, from notebooks and markers to tissues and cleaning wipes.







Habitat for Humanity
When investors wanted to save for a new home, Edward Jones was there to help. Associates from Ontario, Canada, helped a local family reach its goal of home ownership in another way when they came together for the Habitat for Humanity build in Amherstburg, Ont., the first such home built in this community.







Pedal the Cause
We're proud of our associates who joined the fight against cancer as Edward Jones Pedal the Cause riders. More than 200 bike riders from across the U.S. took to the streets (and the Katy Trail) to help fundraise for cancer research.







Walk to End Alzheimer's®
At Edward Jones, we live and work in the communities we serve. We want to make a difference in people’s lives, both in and out of the office. Alzheimer’s disease has a significant impact on individuals, family, friends and community. That’s why we’ve chosen to partner with the Alzheimer’s Association as the National Presenting Sponsor of the Walk to End Alzheimer’s®. We invite you to join us in the fight to end this terrible disease.
