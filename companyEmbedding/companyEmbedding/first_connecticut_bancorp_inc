	Forward Looking Statements





	In addition to historical information, this earnings release may contain forward-looking statements for purposes of applicable securities laws. Any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements may or may not include words such as "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," and "intend" or future or conditional verbs such as "will," "would," "should," "could," or "may." Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties. There are a number of important factors described in documents previously filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and other factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to those forward-looking statements which may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this release or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.





	Non-GAAP Financial Measures





	In addition to evaluating the Company's financial performance in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), management routinely supplements their evaluation with an analysis of certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as core net income, the efficiency ratio and tangible book value per share. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure; net income in the case of core net income and the efficiency ratio and stockholders' equity in the case of tangible book value per share, appears in the accompanying Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures table.





	We believe that providing certain non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with information useful in understanding our financial performance, our performance trends and financial position. Specifically, we provide measures based on what we believe are our operating earnings on a consistent basis and exclude non-core operating items which affect the GAAP reporting of results of operations. The Company believes that core net income is useful for both investors and management to understand the effects of items that are non-recurring and infrequent in nature. The Company believes that the efficiency ratio, which measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue, is useful in the assessment of financial performance, including non-interest expense control. The Company believes that tangible book value per share is useful to evaluate the relative strength of the Company's capital position. The Company does not have goodwill and intangible assets for any of the periods presented. As such, tangible book value per common share is equal to book value per common share.





	We utilize these measures for internal planning and forecasting purposes. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for GAAP basis measures and results, and we strongly encourage investors to review our consolidated financial statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.

As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

Institutional Ownership

Ownership > 100%





×
Ownership > 100%




List of possible reasons behind the infrequent cases where we have total institutional ownership that exceeds 100% of the common shares outstanding for a specific company:


 


Double-counting - On the 13-F filing, each institutional holder must report all securities over which they exercise sole or shared investment discretion. In cases where investment discretion is shared by more than one institution, care is generally taken to prevent double-counting, but there is always the exception. Another cause of double-counting is a company name change for the 13F filer where the holdings are accounted for under both filer names.


 


Short Interest - A large short interest amount affects the institutional ownership amount considerably because all shares that have been sold short appear as holdings in two separate portfolios. One institution has lent its shares to a short seller, while the same shares have been purchased by another reporting institution. Consequently, the institutional ownership percentage reflected in the 13-F filings is overstated as a percentage of total shares outstanding.


 



A gap between 'as of' dates - In the case where gaps between the 'as of' dates of the holdings and the shares outstanding arise, the percentage owned could be skewed due to a sharp increase/decrease in shares out. Again, this case doesn’t come up very often but the results are unavoidable.

                                    


 


Other possible reasons:
                                        a) An overlap occurs amongst reporting institutions;
                                        b) The 13F filing includes holdings other than common stock issues;
                                        c) Mutual fund money is co-advised and incorrectly reported by multiple institutions.

Noninterest expense  Noninterest expense increased $1.2 million in the second quarter of 2017 to $15.9 million compared to the prior year quarter primarily due to an $823,000 increase in salaries and employee benefits, a $164,000 increase in marketing and a $255,000 increase in other operating expenses.   Salaries and employee benefits increased $823,000 to $10.0 million primarily due to $343,000 in severance expense and general salary increases which became effective in mid-March.   Marketing increased $164,000 primarily due to efforts to increase the Bank's sales support in central Connecticut and western Massachusetts.   Other operating expenses increased $255,000 to $2.6 million primarily due to a $354,000 decrease in the provision for off-balance sheet commitments as a result of a change in accounting estimate in the prior year quarter offset by a $151,000 decrease in directors' share-based compensation expense due to the 2012 Stock Incentive Plan fully vesting in September 2016.   Income tax expense  Income tax expense was $2.1 million in the second quarter of 2017 and $1.4 million in the prior year quarter.  Increase in income tax expense was primarily due to a $2.1 million increase in income over the prior year.

Our investment portfolio totaled $163.1 million at June 30, 2017 compared to $157.0 million at June 30, 2016, an increase of $6.1 million due to an increase in collateral requirements.   Net loans increased $241.2 million or 10% at June 30, 2017 to $2.6 billion compared to $2.4 billion at June 30, 2016 due to our continued focus on commercial and residential lending.
