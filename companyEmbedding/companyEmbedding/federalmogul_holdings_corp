businesses, restructuring its operations and transferring production to best
cost countries, and utilizing its worldwide technical centers to develop and
provide value-added solutions to its customers. A summary of the Company’s

Company Description
We are a leading global supplier of technology and innovation in vehicle and
industrial products for fuel economy, emissions reduction, alternative energies,
environment and safety systems. We serve the world’s foremost original equipment
manufacturers (“OEM”) and servicers (“OES”) of automotive,


 light, medium and
heavy-duty commercial vehicles, off-road, agricultural, marine, rail, aerospace,
power generation and industrial equipment (collectively, “OE”), as well as the
worldwide aftermarket. We seek to participate in both of these markets by
leveraging our original equipment product engineering and development
capability, manufacturing know-how, and expertise in managing a broad and deep
range of replacement parts to service the aftermarket. We believe that we are
uniquely positioned to effectively manage the life cycle of a broad range of
products to a diverse customer base.

We operate with two end-customer focused business segments. The Powertrain
segment focuses on original equipment products for automotive, heavy duty and
industrial applications. The Motorparts segment sells and distributes a broad
portfolio of products in the global aftermarket, while also serving OEMs with
products including braking, chassis, wipers and other vehicle components. This
organizational model allows for a strong product line focus benefitting both OE
and aftermarket customer sand enables the global Federal-Mogul teams to be
responsive to customers’ needs for superior products and to promote greater
identification with Federal-Mogul premium brands. Additionally, this
organizational model enhances management focus to capitalize on opportunities
for organic acquisition growth, profit improvement, resource utilization and
business model optimization in line with the unique requirements of the two
different customer bases.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

History[edit]
Federal-Mogul was founded in Detroit in 1899 by J. Howard Muzzy and Edward F. Lyon as the Muzzy Lyon Company.[3] Muzzy and Lyon went into business together producing mill supplies and rubber goods.[3] In addition, the partners formed a subsidiary called Mogul Metal Company where they launched various bearing innovations.[4][3][5][unreliable source?] Muzzy Lyon began producing bearings made from their own Babbitt metal called Mogul, an alloy of tin, antimony and copper.[4][3][5] The product was trademarked under “Mogul” and “Duro”.[4][3][5] In addition to Babbitt metal, Muzzy and Lyon invented a process of custom die-casting bearings.[5]
The Muzzy Lyon Company bearings business proved successful in the early 1900s and became the pair's main concern, with Buick as one of their earliest customers.[3] The Muzzy Lyon Company later merged with an engine bearings and bushings manufacturing company, Federal Bearings and Bushings Corporation.[5] Federal Bearings & Bushings Co. was founded in 1915 by a group of Detroit businessmen.[4] In 1924, the Muzzy Lyon Company and Federal Bearings and Bushing merged to become Federal-Mogul Corporation.[5] The combined company also manufactured bronze bearings, a product the Muzzy Lyon Company did not supply.
Federal Mogul established a research division in 1929, with the help of Battelle Memorial Institute.[5] During the depression, Federal-Mogul invested in the Equi-Poise propeller division.[5]
In 1932, the company developed a new alloy called C-100, one of the first new bearing materials since the discovery of Babbitt metal.[5] The Federal-Mogul research team revamped the C-100 in 1934 to create a C-50 alloy.[5]
In 1955, the company acquired National Motor Bearing Company, resulting in a company name change to Federal-Mogul Bower.[6]
In the late 1950s, the company opened business operations in Switzerland.[5] In 1962, the company opened established an overseas service center in Antwerp, Belgium.[7] In 1963, Federal-Mogul Bower’s Arrowhead division manufactured components for NASA’s Saturn launch vehicle.[7]
In April 1965, Federal-Mogul Bower merged with Sterling Aluminum Products. The combined company was renamed the Federal-Mogul Corporation.[6][8]
In 1966, Federal-Mogul Corporation relocated from downtown Detroit, establishing its corporate headquarters in Southfield, Michigan.[7]
In 1981, Federal-Mogul Arrowhead parts were implemented in the NASA space shuttle launch.[7]
In 1981, the company attempted to patent a process for curing rubber based on the mathematical equation written by Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius in 1889. The US Patent Office rejected Federal-Mogul's claim, on the basis that neither a formula, as a law of nature, nor a computer program based on such a formula, could be patented.[9] That same year, the company won a claim in the Supreme Court to the patent.
In 1998, the company acquired Cooper Industries and brands including Anco wiper blades, Champion ignition, MOOG chassis, Wagner and Abex friction, and Wagner and Blazer lighting.[10]
That same year, Federal-Mogul also acquired Turner & Newall, a building materials company based in Manchester, UK. Turner & Newall was one of the world's largest manufacturers of asbestos-related products, including those made with blue crocidolite asbestos mined in South Africa. Turner & Newall was responsible for the Armley asbestos disaster in Leeds, UK. After the acquisition, Federal-Mogul set aside approximately $2.1 billion to cover asbestos-related claims but that amount provide insufficient.[11] The large number of products liability claims that came with this acquisition were largely responsible for Federal-Mogul's federal Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in 2002.[12]
During the company’s restructuring, Federal-Mogul Corporation acquired multiple companies including Robert G. Evans Co., Hanauer Machine Works, Inc., Metaltec, Inc., Mather Co. and Fel-Pro, Inc.[13] The company emerged from Chapter 11 reorganization in January 2008 and in April 2008, the company listed Class A common stock on NASDAQ under the trading symbol FDML.[13]
In June 2010, Federal-Mogul expanded further into Asia by opening a headquarters and technical center in Shanghai, China.[14] The Asia Pacific headquarters and technical center facility contains powertrain dynamometers and vehicle braking test cells among other processes.[14] The location allows for increased technical support to powertrain and vehicle customers as well as technology development.[14]
Federal-Mogul acquired Daros Group in June 2010, a privately owned supplier of pistons for large bore engines used in industrial energy generation and commercial shipping.[15] The acquisition of the group included operations in China, Sweden and Germany.[15] The purchase of Daros added two-stroke and four-stroke piston ring products to Federal-Mogul’s portfolio of industrial piston rings.[15]




Technical Center, Ann Arbor, Michigan


In December 2010 Barcelona (Spain) warehouse was shut down and moved to Madrid.
In March 2012, Federal-Mogul’s board of directors announced its decision to modify the company’s corporate structure to create separate Powertrain and Vehicle Components segments, each with its own CEO.[16] Rainer Jueckstock, former senior vice president of the company's Powertrain Energy business, was named CEO for the Powertrain segment effective April 1, 2012.[16] In February 2014, Daniel A. Ninivaggi was appointed CEO of the Federal-Mogul Vehicle Components segment (VCS).
In July 2012, Federal-Mogul announced a definitive agreement to purchase the BERU spark-plug business from BorgWarner Inc.[17]
In September 2014, the company formally announced the long pending modification to the company's corporate structure would be a split into two separate companies, Federal-Mogul Powertrain, and Federal-Mogul Motorparts. The Powertrain division will focus on the manufacturing and selling of OEM auto parts while the Motorparts division focuses on selling aftermarket parts. Each individual company has their own CEO and corporate level staff that will continue to report to the board of directors of Federal-Mogul Holding Corporation. The company expects the split to be completed in the first half of 2015 pending regulatory approval.[18]
In 2014, Honeywell completed the $155 million sale of its friction materials business to Federal Mogul Corp.
In February 2017, Ninivaggi was promoted to CEO of the Icahn Automotive Group, LLC. Brad Norton was promoted to CEO of Federal-Mogul Motorparts as his replacement.
Company divisions[edit]
Federal-Mogul Powertrain designs and manufacturers original equipment powertrain components and system protection products in the United States and internationally, its diversified production line consists of various products, ranging from powdered metal parts to space suits, including engine bearings, pistons, piston pins, piston rings, cylinder liners, valve seats and guides, spark plugs, ignition coils, transmission products, technical textiles and connecting rods.[4] Bower Roller Bearing Division was a major supplier of bearings for missiles and aircraft, and for many other industries — automotive, construction machinery, machine tool and farm equipment.[19]
Federal-Mogul Motorparts sells and distributes products under more than 20 brands in the global vehicle aftermarket, including ANCO wiper blades; Bentley-Harris protection solutions; Champion spark plugs, wipers and filters, BERU glow plugs; AE, Fel-Pro, Goetze, Nural, Glyco and Payen engine products; MOOG steering and suspension parts; and Ferodo and Wagner brake products.[2]

In June 2010, Federal-Mogul expanded further into Asia by opening a headquarters and technical center in Shanghai, China.[14] The Asia Pacific headquarters and technical center facility contains powertrain dynamometers and vehicle braking test cells among other processes.[14] The location allows for increased technical support to powertrain and vehicle customers as well as technology development.[14]
Federal-Mogul acquired Daros Group in June 2010, a privately owned supplier of pistons for large bore engines used in industrial energy generation and commercial shipping.[15] The acquisition of the group included operations in China, Sweden and Germany.[15] The purchase of Daros added two-stroke and four-stroke piston ring products to Federal-Mogul’s portfolio of industrial piston rings.[15]

In December 2010 Barcelona (Spain) warehouse was shut down and moved to Madrid.
In March 2012, Federal-Mogul’s board of directors announced its decision to modify the company’s corporate structure to create separate Powertrain and Vehicle Components segments, each with its own CEO.[16] Rainer Jueckstock, former senior vice president of the company's Powertrain Energy business, was named CEO for the Powertrain segment effective April 1, 2012.[16] In February 2014, Daniel A. Ninivaggi was appointed CEO of the Federal-Mogul Vehicle Components segment (VCS).
In July 2012, Federal-Mogul announced a definitive agreement to purchase the BERU spark-plug business from BorgWarner Inc.[17]
In September 2014, the company formally announced the long pending modification to the company's corporate structure would be a split into two separate companies, Federal-Mogul Powertrain, and Federal-Mogul Motorparts. The Powertrain division will focus on the manufacturing and selling of OEM auto parts while the Motorparts division focuses on selling aftermarket parts. Each individual company has their own CEO and corporate level staff that will continue to report to the board of directors of Federal-Mogul Holding Corporation. The company expects the split to be completed in the first half of 2015 pending regulatory approval.[18]
In 2014, Honeywell completed the $155 million sale of its friction materials business to Federal Mogul Corp.
In February 2017, Ninivaggi was promoted to CEO of the Icahn Automotive Group, LLC. Brad Norton was promoted to CEO of Federal-Mogul Motorparts as his replacement.

History[edit]
Federal-Mogul was founded in Detroit in 1899 by J. Howard Muzzy and Edward F. Lyon as the Muzzy Lyon Company.[3] Muzzy and Lyon went into business together producing mill supplies and rubber goods.[3] In addition, the partners formed a subsidiary called Mogul Metal Company where they launched various bearing innovations.[4][3][5][unreliable source?] Muzzy Lyon began producing bearings made from their own Babbitt metal called Mogul, an alloy of tin, antimony and copper.[4][3][5] The product was trademarked under “Mogul” and “Duro”.[4][3][5] In addition to Babbitt metal, Muzzy and Lyon invented a process of custom die-casting bearings.[5]
The Muzzy Lyon Company bearings business proved successful in the early 1900s and became the pair's main concern, with Buick as one of their earliest customers.[3] The Muzzy Lyon Company later merged with an engine bearings and bushings manufacturing company, Federal Bearings and Bushings Corporation.[5] Federal Bearings & Bushings Co. was founded in 1915 by a group of Detroit businessmen.[4] In 1924, the Muzzy Lyon Company and Federal Bearings and Bushing merged to become Federal-Mogul Corporation.[5] The combined company also manufactured bronze bearings, a product the Muzzy Lyon Company did not supply.
Federal Mogul established a research division in 1929, with the help of Battelle Memorial Institute.[5] During the depression, Federal-Mogul invested in the Equi-Poise propeller division.[5]
In 1932, the company developed a new alloy called C-100, one of the first new bearing materials since the discovery of Babbitt metal.[5] The Federal-Mogul research team revamped the C-100 in 1934 to create a C-50 alloy.[5]
In 1955, the company acquired National Motor Bearing Company, resulting in a company name change to Federal-Mogul Bower.[6]
In the late 1950s, the company opened business operations in Switzerland.[5] In 1962, the company opened established an overseas service center in Antwerp, Belgium.[7] In 1963, Federal-Mogul Bower’s Arrowhead division manufactured components for NASA’s Saturn launch vehicle.[7]
In April 1965, Federal-Mogul Bower merged with Sterling Aluminum Products. The combined company was renamed the Federal-Mogul Corporation.[6][8]
In 1966, Federal-Mogul Corporation relocated from downtown Detroit, establishing its corporate headquarters in Southfield, Michigan.[7]
In 1981, Federal-Mogul Arrowhead parts were implemented in the NASA space shuttle launch.[7]
In 1981, the company attempted to patent a process for curing rubber based on the mathematical equation written by Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius in 1889. The US Patent Office rejected Federal-Mogul's claim, on the basis that neither a formula, as a law of nature, nor a computer program based on such a formula, could be patented.[9] That same year, the company won a claim in the Supreme Court to the patent.
In 1998, the company acquired Cooper Industries and brands including Anco wiper blades, Champion ignition, MOOG chassis, Wagner and Abex friction, and Wagner and Blazer lighting.[10]
That same year, Federal-Mogul also acquired Turner & Newall, a building materials company based in Manchester, UK. Turner & Newall was one of the world's largest manufacturers of asbestos-related products, including those made with blue crocidolite asbestos mined in South Africa. Turner & Newall was responsible for the Armley asbestos disaster in Leeds, UK. After the acquisition, Federal-Mogul set aside approximately $2.1 billion to cover asbestos-related claims but that amount provide insufficient.[11] The large number of products liability claims that came with this acquisition were largely responsible for Federal-Mogul's federal Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in 2002.[12]

During the company’s restructuring, Federal-Mogul Corporation acquired multiple companies including Robert G. Evans Co., Hanauer Machine Works, Inc., Metaltec, Inc., Mather Co. and Fel-Pro, Inc.[13] The company emerged from Chapter 11 reorganization in January 2008 and in April 2008, the company listed Class A common stock on NASDAQ under the trading symbol FDML.[13]
In June 2010, Federal-Mogul expanded further into Asia by opening a headquarters and technical center in Shanghai, China.[14] The Asia Pacific headquarters and technical center facility contains powertrain dynamometers and vehicle braking test cells among other processes.[14] The location allows for increased technical support to powertrain and vehicle customers as well as technology development.[14]
Federal-Mogul acquired Daros Group in June 2010, a privately owned supplier of pistons for large bore engines used in industrial energy generation and commercial shipping.[15] The acquisition of the group included operations in China, Sweden and Germany.[15] The purchase of Daros added two-stroke and four-stroke piston ring products to Federal-Mogul’s portfolio of industrial piston rings.[15]

In December 2010 Barcelona (Spain) warehouse was shut down and moved to Madrid.
In March 2012, Federal-Mogul’s board of directors announced its decision to modify the company’s corporate structure to create separate Powertrain and Vehicle Components segments, each with its own CEO.[16] Rainer Jueckstock, former senior vice president of the company's Powertrain Energy business, was named CEO for the Powertrain segment effective April 1, 2012.[16] In February 2014, Daniel A. Ninivaggi was appointed CEO of the Federal-Mogul Vehicle Components segment (VCS).

In September 2014, the company formally announced the long pending modification to the company's corporate structure would be a split into two separate companies, Federal-Mogul Powertrain, and Federal-Mogul Motorparts. The Powertrain division will focus on the manufacturing and selling of OEM auto parts while the Motorparts division focuses on selling aftermarket parts. Each individual company has their own CEO and corporate level staff that will continue to report to the board of directors of Federal-Mogul Holding Corporation. The company expects the split to be completed in the first half of 2015 pending regulatory approval.[18]
In 2014, Honeywell completed the $155 million sale of its friction materials business to Federal Mogul Corp.

History[edit]
Federal-Mogul was founded in Detroit in 1899 by J. Howard Muzzy and Edward F. Lyon as the Muzzy Lyon Company.[3] Muzzy and Lyon went into business together producing mill supplies and rubber goods.[3] In addition, the partners formed a subsidiary called Mogul Metal Company where they launched various bearing innovations.[4][3][5][unreliable source?] Muzzy Lyon began producing bearings made from their own Babbitt metal called Mogul, an alloy of tin, antimony and copper.[4][3][5] The product was trademarked under “Mogul” and “Duro”.[4][3][5] In addition to Babbitt metal, Muzzy and Lyon invented a process of custom die-casting bearings.[5]
The Muzzy Lyon Company bearings business proved successful in the early 1900s and became the pair's main concern, with Buick as one of their earliest customers.[3] The Muzzy Lyon Company later merged with an engine bearings and bushings manufacturing company, Federal Bearings and Bushings Corporation.[5] Federal Bearings & Bushings Co. was founded in 1915 by a group of Detroit businessmen.[4] In 1924, the Muzzy Lyon Company and Federal Bearings and Bushing merged to become Federal-Mogul Corporation.[5] The combined company also manufactured bronze bearings, a product the Muzzy Lyon Company did not supply.
Federal Mogul established a research division in 1929, with the help of Battelle Memorial Institute.[5] During the depression, Federal-Mogul invested in the Equi-Poise propeller division.[5]
In 1932, the company developed a new alloy called C-100, one of the first new bearing materials since the discovery of Babbitt metal.[5] The Federal-Mogul research team revamped the C-100 in 1934 to create a C-50 alloy.[5]
In 1955, the company acquired National Motor Bearing Company, resulting in a company name change to Federal-Mogul Bower.[6]
In the late 1950s, the company opened business operations in Switzerland.[5] In 1962, the company opened established an overseas service center in Antwerp, Belgium.[7] In 1963, Federal-Mogul Bower’s Arrowhead division manufactured components for NASA’s Saturn launch vehicle.[7]
In April 1965, Federal-Mogul Bower merged with Sterling Aluminum Products. The combined company was renamed the Federal-Mogul Corporation.[6][8]
In 1966, Federal-Mogul Corporation relocated from downtown Detroit, establishing its corporate headquarters in Southfield, Michigan.[7]
In 1981, Federal-Mogul Arrowhead parts were implemented in the NASA space shuttle launch.[7]
In 1981, the company attempted to patent a process for curing rubber based on the mathematical equation written by Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius in 1889. The US Patent Office rejected Federal-Mogul's claim, on the basis that neither a formula, as a law of nature, nor a computer program based on such a formula, could be patented.[9] That same year, the company won a claim in the Supreme Court to the patent.
In 1998, the company acquired Cooper Industries and brands including Anco wiper blades, Champion ignition, MOOG chassis, Wagner and Abex friction, and Wagner and Blazer lighting.[10]
That same year, Federal-Mogul also acquired Turner & Newall, a building materials company based in Manchester, UK. Turner & Newall was one of the world's largest manufacturers of asbestos-related products, including those made with blue crocidolite asbestos mined in South Africa. Turner & Newall was responsible for the Armley asbestos disaster in Leeds, UK. After the acquisition, Federal-Mogul set aside approximately $2.1 billion to cover asbestos-related claims but that amount provide insufficient.[11] The large number of products liability claims that came with this acquisition were largely responsible for Federal-Mogul's federal Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in 2002.[12]
During the company’s restructuring, Federal-Mogul Corporation acquired multiple companies including Robert G. Evans Co., Hanauer Machine Works, Inc., Metaltec, Inc., Mather Co. and Fel-Pro, Inc.[13] The company emerged from Chapter 11 reorganization in January 2008 and in April 2008, the company listed Class A common stock on NASDAQ under the trading symbol FDML.[13]
In June 2010, Federal-Mogul expanded further into Asia by opening a headquarters and technical center in Shanghai, China.[14] The Asia Pacific headquarters and technical center facility contains powertrain dynamometers and vehicle braking test cells among other processes.[14] The location allows for increased technical support to powertrain and vehicle customers as well as technology development.[14]
Federal-Mogul acquired Daros Group in June 2010, a privately owned supplier of pistons for large bore engines used in industrial energy generation and commercial shipping.[15] The acquisition of the group included operations in China, Sweden and Germany.[15] The purchase of Daros added two-stroke and four-stroke piston ring products to Federal-Mogul’s portfolio of industrial piston rings.[15]

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Lyon as the Muzzy Lyon Company.[3] Muzzy and Lyon went into business together producing mill supplies and rubber goods.[3] In addition, the partners formed a subsidiary called Mogul Metal Company where they launched various bearing innovations.[4][3][5][unreliable source?] Muzzy Lyon began producing bearings made from their own Babbitt metal called Mogul, an alloy of tin, antimony and copper.[4][3][5] The product was trademarked under “Mogul” and “Duro”.[4][3][5] In addition to Babbitt metal, Muzzy and Lyon invented a process of custom die-casting bearings.[5]
The Muzzy Lyon Company bearings business proved successful in the early 1900s and became the pair's main concern, with Buick as one of their earliest customers.[3] The Muzzy Lyon Company later merged with an engine bearings and bushings manufacturing company, Federal Bearings and Bushings Corporation.[5] Federal Bearings & Bushings Co. was founded in 1915 by a group of Detroit businessmen.[4] In 1924, the Muzzy Lyon Company and Federal Bearings and Bushing merged to become Federal-Mogul Corporation.[5] The combined company also manufactured bronze bearings, a product the Muzzy Lyon Company did not supply.
Federal Mogul established a research division in 1929, with the help of Battelle Memorial Institute.[5] During the depression, Federal-Mogul invested in the Equi-Poise propeller division.[5]
In 1932, the company developed a new alloy called C-100, one of the first new bearing materials since the discovery of Babbitt metal.[5] The Federal-Mogul research team revamped the C-100 in 1934 to create a C-50 alloy.[5]
In 1955, the company acquired National Motor Bearing Company, resulting in a company name change to Federal-Mogul Bower.[6]
In the late 1950s, the company opened business operations in Switzerland.[5] In 1962, the company opened established an overseas service center in Antwerp, Belgium.[7] In 1963, Federal-Mogul Bower’s Arrowhead division manufactured components for NASA’s Saturn launch vehicle.[7]
In April 1965, Federal-Mogul Bower merged with Sterling Aluminum Products. The combined company was renamed the Federal-Mogul Corporation.[6][8]
In 1966, Federal-Mogul Corporation relocated from downtown Detroit, establishing its corporate headquarters in Southfield, Michigan.[7]
In 1981, Federal-Mogul Arrowhead parts were implemented in the NASA space shuttle launch.[7]
In 1981, the company attempted to patent a process for curing rubber based on the mathematical equation written by Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius in 1889. The US Patent Office rejected Federal-Mogul's claim, on the basis that neither a formula, as a law of nature, nor a computer program based on such a formula, could be patented.[9] That same year, the company won a claim in the Supreme Court to the patent.
In 1998, the company acquired Cooper Industries and brands including Anco wiper blades, Champion ignition, MOOG chassis, Wagner and Abex friction, and Wagner and Blazer lighting.[10]
That same year, Federal-Mogul also acquired Turner & Newall, a building materials company based in Manchester, UK. Turner & Newall was one of the world's largest manufacturers of asbestos-related products, including those made with blue crocidolite asbestos mined in South Africa. Turner & Newall was responsible for the Armley asbestos disaster in Leeds, UK. After the acquisition, Federal-Mogul set aside approximately $2.1 billion to cover asbestos-related claims but that amount provide insufficient.[11] The large number of products liability claims that came with this acquisition were largely responsible for Federal-Mogul's federal Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in 2002.[12]
During the company’s restructuring, Federal-Mogul Corporation acquired multiple companies including Robert G. Evans Co., Hanauer Machine Works, Inc., Metaltec, Inc., Mather Co. and Fel-Pro, Inc.[13] The company emerged from Chapter 11 reorganization in January 2008 and in April 2008, the company listed Class A common stock on NASDAQ under the trading symbol FDML.[13]
In June 2010, Federal-Mogul expanded further into Asia by opening a headquarters and technical center in Shanghai, China.[14] The Asia Pacific headquarters and technical center facility contains powertrain dynamometers and vehicle braking test cells among other processes.[14] The location allows for increased technical support to powertrain and vehicle customers as well as technology development.[14]
Federal-Mogul acquired Daros Group in June 2010, a privately owned supplier of pistons for large bore engines used in industrial energy generation and commercial shipping.[15] The acquisition of the group included operations in China, Sweden and Germany.[15] The purchase of Daros added two-stroke and four-stroke piston ring products to Federal-Mogul’s portfolio of industrial piston rings.[15]




Technical Center, Ann Arbor, Michigan


In December 2010 Barcelona (Spain) warehouse was shut down and moved to Madrid.
In March 2012, Federal-Mogul’s board of directors announced its decision to modify the company’s corporate structure to create separate Powertrain and Vehicle Components segments, each with its own CEO.[16] Rainer Jueckstock, former senior vice president of the company's Powertrain Energy business, was named CEO for the Powertrain segment effective April 1, 2012.[16] In February 2014, Daniel A. Ninivaggi was appointed CEO of the Federal-Mogul Vehicle Components segment (VCS).
In July 2012, Federal-Mogul announced a definitive agreement to purchase the BERU spark-plug business from BorgWarner Inc.[17]
In September 2014, the company formally announced the long pending modification to the company's corporate structure would be a split into two separate companies, Federal-Mogul Powertrain, and Federal-Mogul Motorparts. The Powertrain division will focus on the manufacturing and selling of OEM auto parts while the Motorparts division focuses on selling aftermarket parts. Each individual company has their own CEO and corporate level staff that will continue to report to the board of directors of Federal-Mogul Holding Corporation. The company expects the split to be completed in the first half of 2015 pending regulatory approval.[18]
In 2014, Honeywell completed the $155 million sale of its friction materials business to Federal Mogul Corp.
In February 2017, Ninivaggi was promoted to CEO of the Icahn Automotive Group, LLC. Brad Norton was promoted to CEO of Federal-Mogul Motorparts as his replacement.
Company divisions[edit]
Federal-Mogul Powertrain designs and manufacturers original equipment powertrain components and system protection products in the United States and internationally, its diversified production line consists of various products, ranging from powdered metal parts to space suits, including engine bearings, pistons, piston pins, piston rings, cylinder liners, valve seats and guides, spark plugs, ignition coils, transmission products, technical textiles and connecting rods.[4] Bower Roller Bearing Division was a major supplier of bearings for missiles and aircraft, and for many other industries — automotive, construction machinery, machine tool and farm equipment.[19]
Federal-Mogul Motorparts sells and distributes products under more than 20 brands in the global vehicle aftermarket, including ANCO wiper blades; Bentley-Harris protection solutions; Champion spark plugs, wipers and filters, BERU glow plugs; AE, Fel-Pro, Goetze, Nural, Glyco and Payen engine products; MOOG steering and suspension parts; and Ferodo and Wagner brake products.[2]
