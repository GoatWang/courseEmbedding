From anxiety to depression and chemical dependence, A New Direction Recovery provided each of those services as well as offering health and wellness classes and consultations. I wanted alternative solutions to drugs, and something other than "talk therapy". A New Direction Recovery provided additional alternatives by offering both psychotherapy as well as standard therapy, and medication as well as nutritional and herbal counseling. Thanks A New Direction Recovery with helping me with all my needs!Salt Lake Mental Health IncBecky E. ratedSince meeting Frank Clayton, I have been taught, to recognize the things in my life that needed to be addressed. How to feel the emotions that I never let myself feel. And most importantly, how to cope with all the people, "some loved, most not even liked" in my life. With the guidance and support, I've received from Frank, Clayton. I've learned to appreciate the consequences of my action's. (Before they become a detriment to my own well being).SincerelyMs, Becky, Eatmon

JOIN THE LISTClickFIND A STOREWhile The City Sleeps: A History Of Pistoleros, Policemen, And The Crime Beat In Buenos Aires Before Peronby Caimari, Lila/ Andrade, Lisa Ubelaker (Trn)/ Shindell, Richard (Trn)While the City Sleeps is an extraordinary work of scholarship from one of Argentina's leading historians about modern Buenos Aires society and culture. In the late nineteenth century, the city saw a massive population boom and urban development on a large scale. These changes came along with rampant crime, a chaotic environment in the streets and intense class conflict. In the two decades before the advent of Peronism, once this cycle was declining, the state expanded institutions intended to bring about social order and control. Caimari mined both police records and true crime reporting, bringing to life the underworld pistoleros, the policemen who fought them, and the crime journalists who brought their conflicts to light. In the process, she has crafted an incredible portrait of the rise of one of the world's greatest cities.

Would a Trump Self-Pardon Precipitate a Constitutional Crisis?



Cornell University law professor Michael C. Dorf argues that if President Trump were to pardon himself, that action itself would not cause a constitutional crisis, but other actions Trump has already taken have already placed us far along a road to a constitutional crisis.
