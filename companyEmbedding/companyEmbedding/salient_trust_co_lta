                            MLPs and Energy                        


The Houston-based MLP Team is led by seasoned MLP portfolio managers Greg Reid and Ted Gardner, and director of research Parag Sanghani. Houston is the home for many MLPs. In fact, corporate headquarters for 65% of the total market capitalization of the midstream MLP universe is within minutes of our offices. Salient’s MLP strategies are designed to provide the opportunity to potentially capture attractive total returns driven by a combination of distribution yield plus prospective distribution growth. MLP returns have historically had a low correlation to the S&P 500, REITs, high yield, and bonds.

MLP returns have historically had a low correlation to the S&P 500, REITs, high yield, and bonds.

Income Report Card | July 2017

Author: Nathan J. Rowader				Date: July 10, 2017								
				Category: Asset Allocation, Financial Planning  
				Tags: carry, currency appreciation, economic growth, equity, fiscal policy, fixed income, global sovereigns, income, momentum, monetary policy, rotation, sell-off, volatility 
June was a bit mixed for foreign stocks. Emerging market (EM) stocks led the way with a gain of 1.04% for the month followed by Japanese stocks, which increased by 0.96%. U.S. stocks pulled ahead of Europe this month, posting a gain of 0.62% while European stocks declined by -0.45%. Currency continued to play a vital role in performance as the U.S. dollar declined relative other major currencies. In fact, European stocks did far worse in their local currency, posting a decline of -2.53% in euro terms. Bonds had a wild ride in June with the 10-year Treasury beginning the month at 2.21% and gradually sliding down to 2.14% (a year-to-date low), but jumping back up to 2.31% in the final trading days of the month. The move pushes the yield back into an earlier trading range that, if sustained, may see rates increase as much as 0.30%. For the month of June, global bonds fell 0.09% because of the increase in rates, U.S. high-yield corporate bonds increased 0.14% and EM corporate bonds were flat.

May was another positive month for international stocks, which increased by 3.75%, driven by the increasing value of the euro relative the U.S. dollar. In fact, the MSCI Europe Index increased by 4.79% in U.S. dollars, but only 1.65% in euros. Emerging markets (EM) also posted gains, with an increase of 2.97%, although this growth was as bit more organic as currency movement detracted from performance. U.S. stocks increased by 1.41%, bucking the typical “sell in May” mantra. International and EM sovereigns increased by 2.28% and 0.76%, respectively, while U.S. Treasurys increased by 0.83%. Currency also played an important role for international sovereign bonds, as the increase in the value of the euro accounted for nearly 1.50% of the monthly gains. Credit-sensitive sectors gained, but trailed the robust gains in global sovereign markets. U.S. corporate high-yield bonds increased by 1.03% and EM corporate bonds increased by 0.11%.

April once again favored foreign stocks over domestic stocks. International stocks increased by 2.61%, outperforming emerging market (EM) stocks, which increased by 2.21%. U.S. stocks managed to finish the month with a positive return of 1.03%. Global bonds increased by 1.13% during the month with foreign bonds outperforming domestic bonds driven by appreciation of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, particularly the euro. International and EM sovereign bonds increased by 1.79% and 1.70%, respectively, while U.S. Treasurys increased by 1.70%. Credit-sensitive sectors gained, but trailed the robust gains in global sovereign markets. U.S. high-yield corporate bonds increased by 0.81% and EM corporate bonds increased by 1.48%.

March strongly favored foreign stocks over domestic stocks. International developed stocks increased by 2.8%, slightly outperforming emerging market (EM) stocks, which increased by 2.5%. U.S. stocks managed to finish the month with a slightly positive return of 0.1%. Overall, U.S. markets didn’t favor income-producing stocks, as utilities, U.S. real estate and MLPs all declined during March. Global bonds increased by 0.2% during the month with foreign bonds outperforming domestic bonds. International and emerging market sovereign bonds increased by 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively, while U.S. Treasurys fell -0.1%. Even credit-sensitive sectors such as high-yield corporate bonds fell -0.2%.



Income Investing in an Uncertain World | Part 4

Author: Nathan J. Rowader				Date: March 10, 2017								
				Category: Alternatives, Financial Planning  
				Tags: bonds, interest rates, momentum, portfolio, risk targeting, stocks, volatility, yield 
In the third part of this series, we extended our simple ranking system to include risk targeting. This extended analysis produced a portfolio that could deliver higher risk-adjusted returns than a simple ranking system and still deliver a yield in excess of the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Bond Index. In the final part of this series we will look at the same strategy and examine its sensitivity to changes in interest rates.



Income Investing in an Uncertain World | Part 3

Author: Nathan J. Rowader				Date: March 10, 2017								
				Category: Alternatives, Financial Planning  
				Tags: momentum, portfolio, risk targeting, volatility, yield 
In the second part of this series, we outlined how a simple ranking system, using yield and momentum as ranking data points, can provide current income in excess of Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Bond Index with a level of risk similar to the index. This process solved the problem of excess risk in a simple buy and hold strategy of high current income asset classes. For the most part, an investor could simply stop at the ranking system and likely get what they need to achieve their financial objectives. But can we improve on the simple ranking system? Yes we can!

U.S. stocks led global markets in February with the S&P 500 Index increasing by 3.97% and the Russell 2000 Index gaining 1.93%. This disparity could mark the end to a period of very strong relative performance for small-cap stocks versus large-cap stocks, or it could just be a lull in an otherwise strong trend.

				Tags: alternatives, equity, fixed income, income, income report card, momentum, outlook, value, volatility 
Emerging market (EM) stocks increased by 5.48% during the month of January, as measured by the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. This gain is a continuation of the strong performance in 2016 and helps bolster the case that the emerging markets may be heading toward a better return cycle relative other markets.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 03/17/2015
            

                BBB has determined that Salient Trust Company, LTA meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

About Us
Strategies
Team



Salient Capital Advisors, LLC is positioned as a leader in Master Limited Partnership (“MLP”) and midstream energy infrastructure investing for institutional and high net worth investors. We’re capitalizing on the North American Energy Renaissance with fundamentals-based, total return investing combined with best-in-class service.




MLPs are entities structured as master limited partnerships, and their affiliates. Master limited partnerships are limited partnerships and limited liability companies that are publicly traded and are treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes.
Our Strategies will invest primarily in companies located in North America, but they may invest in companies located anywhere in the world.
MLPs are subject to certain MLP tax risks and risks associated with accounting for their deferred tax liability which could materially reduce their value.

Capital Markets are Now Open for Energy
Salient Capital Advisors, LLC (the “Advisor”) is positioned as a leader in Master Limited Partnership (“MLP”) and midstream energy infrastructure investing for institutional and high net worth investors. We’re capitalizing on the North American Energy Renaissance with fundamentals-based, total return investing combined with best-in-class service.
The Salient MLP business currently manages over $5.0 billion in assets* across registered investment funds, separately managed accounts and other product offerings. The entire Salient MLP business is located in Houston and strives to not only provide our investors with exceptional investment management, but also quality and timely investor service.
As a steward of capital, we serve investors by prudently managing their capital as if it was our own capital while placing an emphasis on delivering growing streams of cash flows from real assets that provide a potential hedge against inflation and may be difficult to replace.
We strive to offer first-class investor service, while acting with strong integrity and a grateful attitude in serving our investors.
The Salient MLP team offers its investors ongoing events such as conferences and webinars that are designed to involve attendees through in-depth, practical, content-rich discussions that address critically important topics. The information provided through these events help our investors stay current and confident in the MLP and midstream markets, as well as providing timely performance updates.
Salient Partners, L.P., the parent company of the Advisor to the Salient MLP Business, is a Houston-based investment firm employing over 200 professionals and managing approximately $13.8 billion in assets*. Salient is an innovative asset management firm offering a comprehensive suite of single-asset and multi-asset solutions designed to serve as powerful building blocks for smarter, more efficient portfolios.
Learn more about us »

*As of December 31, 2016.





The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission allows certain tariff-based MLPs to increase their pipeline fees according to the Producer Price Index (PPI), and many storage contracts adjust to the Consumer Price Index (CPI), so a rise in inflation may be partially offset by these pricing abilities.
MLPs are entities structured as master limited partnerships, and their affiliates. Master limited partnerships are limited partnerships and limited liability companies that are publicly traded and are treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes.
Our Strategies will invest primarily in companies located in North America, but they may invest in companies located anywhere in the world.
MLPs are subject to certain MLP tax risks and risks associated with accounting for their deferred tax liability which could materially reduce their value.
