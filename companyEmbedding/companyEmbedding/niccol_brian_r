How I Made It: Taco Bell CEO Brian Niccol

The gig: Since Jan. 1, Brian Niccol has been chief executive of Taco Bell Corp., the Irvine-based fast-food chain known for menu creations such as Doritos Locos Tacos and Crunchwrap Supremes. Since the first restaurant opened in 1962 in Downey, Taco Bell has expanded to about 6,000 locations and 180,000 employees nationwide.First business: Niccol, 41, learned some of his earliest lessons while running a lawn-mowing business as a teenager with some friends. The group would get contracts to mow lawns that included residential yards and office park expanses. Early on, he learned that pricing varied by location, and to get a contract, marketing was a must. Niccol would take this idea with him to future jobs. "At the time you do it, you don't realize how it's influencing you going forward," he said. "I think it carries on with you in the subconscious."Tech savvy: Technology changed rapidly in the early to mid-1990s while Niccol attended Ohio's Miami University. During his freshman year, he used a Brother word processor. By his senior year, he had an email address and could make a website. The quickly evolving tools made an impression on him and eventually played a major role at each of his companies. "Technology, if it provides a service and can solve the stress points or anxiety points, people will adopt it in a big way," Niccol said.Fresh take: After graduating from college in 1996 with an engineering degree, Niccol took a job at Procter & Gamble Co. to work in brand management. One of his more memorable projects was a Scope mouthwash campaign to send an animated kiss via email — something that had never been done. From that campaign, he said he learned the necessity of taking risks to keep brands young and relevant. "What I've always seen is the brands that have a youthful mindset, a youthful vigor, they have a great value proposition," he said. While working at Procter & Gamble, Niccol earned an MBA from the University of Chicago.

The pizza business: In 2005, Niccol moved to Yum Brands, the parent company of Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and KFC. Two years later, he was named chief marketing officer of Pizza Hut and eventually rose to general manager for Pizza Hut USA. At the time, the company was mulling the idea of selling pizzas online, something done only by a company in New Zealand. Niccol thought online ordering had two big benefits — convenience and accuracy — and decided to try it out. "Today, all the big pizza companies are huge in the online space," he said. "It just shows the power of technology."Forever young: Niccol joined Taco Bell in 2011 as its chief marketing and innovation officer. From the beginning, he said he thought it was a brand with a "youthful spirit that was ripe to unlock." He started by changing the company's slogan from "Think outside the bun" to "Live mas." Just by changing a few words, the company repositioned itself from "food is fuel" to "food is an experience," which has since been a "rallying cry" for innovation, he said. From there, he improved Taco Bell's digital marketing, and the budget increased from $1 million when he started at the company to $70 million today.With items such as the Quesarito and XXL Grilled Stuft Burritos, as well as the addition of breakfast foods to the menu, the company has gained a reputation for attracting millennials — a profitable demographic craved by many fast-food chains. "If you let the brand get old, you will die," Niccol said. "That means you deliver experiences that really matter to the current generation."Favorite food: Of all the menu items, Niccol's favorite is the Cheesy Gordita Crunch, a flatbread slathered in cheese and wrapped around a crunchy taco. He usually orders two. "It's got everything that's great about Taco Bell," Niccol said. "It has cheesy, beefy, crunchy, it's melted, it's just awesome."

What's next: Niccol said the company would continue to innovate and plans to release new products including the Quesalupa and Cap'n Crunch Delights, which he described as cereal in a doughnut hole. The company also plans to launch a loyalty program and get into the delivery space. "You'll see the Taco Bell brand starting to evolve even in the restaurants we build," he said. "We want to be accessible to everybody whether you're in an urban or suburban world."Family fans: Niccol lives in Newport Beach with Jennifer, his wife of 14 years, and their three children, ages 4, 8 and 10. He said it's too early to tell whether any of them will follow him into the food industry, though his 8-year-old son loves Chicken Quesaritos. "I think they all have a very creative spirit," Niccol said. "If you've got a creative spirit, it definitely is a great place to find your trade."samantha.masunaga@latimes.comTwitter: @smasunaga

Taco Bell Names Next CEO: Brian Niccol, Marketing Chief for Doritos Tacos Launch
Fills Role Vacated By Greg Creed, Who Moves to CEO at Yum Brands


	By  

Maureen Morrison.
	

	
	
 Published on May 20, 2014. 









		Brian Niccol 
 	








Most Popular






 


Taco Bell has promoted Brian Niccol, its president and former chief marketing and innovation officer, to CEO.
The move comes about three weeks after Taco Bell CEO Greg Creed was elevated to CEO of parent company, Yum Brands, effective in January. Mr. Niccol will also assume his new role at the beginning of 2015.
As CEO of Taco Bell, Mr. Niccol will be responsible for driving overall brand strategy and performance of the business in the U.S. and internationally, the company said. Part of that responsibility will be making good on the company's goal of doubling system sales to $14 billion by 2022 and opening 2,000 new restaurants, a strategy that includes focusing on organic growth through innovation, expanding sales at various times of the day, restaurant development and operations.
Mr. Niccol was marketing chief at Taco Bell as the chain introduced its more upscale product line, the Cantina Menu, as well as its massive Doritos Locos Taco line.
"Brian has extraordinary leadership skills that make him the ideal candidate for our next CEO," said Mr. Creed in a statement. "He is a dynamic leader who genuinely cares about this brand, its people and the culture of the organization. He has a proven track record and the necessary vision to deliver our growth objectives, having overseen multiple breakthrough initiatives including the brand's game-changing breakfast launch earlier this year."
Mr. Niccol's relatively brief term as president now appears to have be part of some succession planning at Yum. Just a year ago, Mr. Niccol was named president after serving as Taco Bell's chief marketing and innovation officer since 2011. Chris Brandt, a Taco Bell marketing executive, succeeded him as the chain's chief marketing officer. The company does not plan to fill the president's post.
Prior to his marketing role at Taco Bell, Mr. Niccol was general manager at sibling brand Pizza Hut and its CMO before that.
In March, Taco Bell introduced a breakfast menu, its largest menu addition and marketing push to date. In the first set of ads, the chain enlisted an army of real-life Ronald McDonald's to profess their love for Taco Bell breakfast. Subsequent TV spots have all gone directly against McDonald's, painting its patrons and signature breakfast item, the Egg McMuffin, as hopelessly outdated.
