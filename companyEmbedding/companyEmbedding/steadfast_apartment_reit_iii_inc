Prior to reviewing information specific to Steadfast Apartment REIT III, you must first receive and carefully review a copy of the prospectus. You may download a copy of the prospectus via the following link: download prospectus.
An investment in Steadfast Apartment REIT III involves a high degree of risk. You should purchase shares only if you can afford a loss of some or all of your investment.
Past performance is no indication of future results and there can be no assurance that Steadfast Apartment REIT III, Inc. (“Steadfast Apartment REIT III”) will be able to execute the business plan for the properties or the offering.

You should carefully consider the information set forth in the “Risk Factors” section of the prospectus for a discussion of material risk factors relevant to an investment in our common stock, including, but not limited to, the following:

We have a limited prior operating history; there is no assurance that we will successfully achieve our investment objectives. 
There is no public market for our shares and we are not obligated to effectuate a liquidity event by a certain date or at all. It will be difficult for you to sell your shares of common stock. If you are able to sell your shares, you will likely sell them at a substantial discount. 
This is a “blind pool” offering. You will not have the opportunity to evaluate our investments before we make them. 
You are limited in your ability to have all or any portion of your shares of our common stock repurchased under our share repurchase program, and, if you are able to have your shares repurchased, you may receive less than the price you paid for the shares and the then-current value of the shares. 
The repurchase of shares pursuant to our share repurchase program will have a dilutive effect on our existing stockholders. 
The amount of distributions we may make is uncertain. We have paid and may continue to pay distributions from sources other than our cash flow from operations. Distributions paid from sources other than our cash flow from operations represent a return of capital. We have not established a limit on the amount of proceeds from our public offering that we may use to fund distributions. This could result in fewer funds available for investments and your overall return may be reduced. 
The offering price of our shares was not established based upon appraisals of assets we own or may own; therefore, the offering price may not accurately reflect the value of our assets when you invest. 
We will depend upon our advisor to conduct our operations. Adverse changes in the financial health of our advisor could cause our operations to suffer. 
All of our executive officers and some of our directors are also officers, managers, directors and/or holders of a controlling interest in our advisor, the dealer manager and other sponsor-affiliated entities. They will face conflicts of interest, including conflicts created by compensation arrangements, time constraints and competition for investments. 
We pay substantial fees to our advisor and its affiliates, including the dealer manager. These fees were not negotiated at arm’s length and may be higher than fees payable to unaffiliated third parties. 
We may be obligated to pay our advisor a subordinated distribution upon termination or non-renewal of the advisory agreement, with or without cause, which may be substantial and therefore may discourage us from terminating the advisor. 
The success of our public offering depends on the ability of the dealer manager to successfully market our offering. If we raise substantially less than the maximum offering amount, we may not be able to invest in a diverse portfolio of assets and the value of your investment may vary more widely with the performance of specific assets. 
We may incur debt exceeding 75% of the aggregate cost of our assets. High debt levels increase the risk of your investment. Loans we obtain may be collateralized by some or all of our investments, which will put those investments at risk of forfeiture if we are unable to pay our debts. Principal and interest payments on these loans reduce the amount of money that would otherwise be available for other purposes. 
Failure to qualify as a REIT would adversely affect our operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders because we would be subject to U.S. federal income tax and applicable state and local income taxes at regular corporate rates and would be unable to deduct distributions made to our stockholders.


The underlying assumptions and any forward looking statements herein may not be accurate, the projections herein shown may not occur, and your performance may vary significantly. To the extent the information in this brochure conflicts with the information in the prospectus, the information in the prospectus shall govern.

Please acknowledge that you have received a copy of the prospectus and have had an opportunity to review the summary risk factors above

Total assets of the Company grew from $0.2 million at December 31, 2015 to $117.4 million at December 31, 2016. The Company commenced operations with its first property acquisition on May 19, 2016.
Highlights:
The Company:

Reported modified funds from operations (“MFFO”), as defined by the Investment Program Association, of negative $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.

(See the reconciliation of FFO to net loss and accompanying notes contained within this release for additional information on how the Company calculates FFO.)
Reported net operating income (“NOI”) of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. (See the reconciliation of NOI to net loss and accompanying notes contained within this release for additional information on how the Company calculates NOI.)
Acquired three multifamily properties with a total of 632 apartment homes for an aggregate purchase price of $99.4 million, exclusive of closing costs, during the year ended December 31, 2016.
Had $72.0 million of variable rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 3.20% as of December 31, 2016, which represented the Company’s total outstanding debt as of December 31, 2016.

Reported net cash provided by financing activities of $119.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which included $286,624 of distributions paid, net of $292,818 in non-cash distributions paid pursuant to the Company’s distribution reinvestment plan.

“The apartment story for ‘GenerationALL’ continues as we increasingly become a nation of renters for all generations,” said Ella Neyland, president of the Company. “The Millennials are the largest living demographic and are delaying home ownership for the convenience and flexibility of apartment living. Baby Boomers are moving back into apartments at an increasing rate for the very same convenience and life-style.”

STEADFAST APARTMENT REIT III, INC. ACQUIRES    DALLAS-AREA APARTMENT COMMUNITY FOR $44 MILLION
Monday, June 5th, 2017 1:01 pm

DALLAS, June 1, 2017 – Steadfast Apartment REIT III, Inc. (STAR III) announced that it has acquired The Pointe at Vista Ridge (formerly known as Enclave at Vista Ridge), a 300-apartment-home community located in the Northern Dallas submarket of Lewisville. The purchase price was approximately $44 million.
“Dallas is a growing region with demographic trends that are a good fit for the investment objectives of Steadfast Apartment REIT III, which targets mid-tier multifamily properties in growing communities,” said Ella Neyland, president of Steadfast Apartment REIT III, Inc. “Additionally, The Pointe at Vista Ridge enjoys an ideal location in the midst of a thriving neighborhood with numerous lifestyle amenities for our current and future residents.”
Completed in 2003, The Pointe at Vista Ridge includes 11 three-story buildings with one-, two- and three-bedroom apartment homes that average 1,080 square feet. In-place rents average $1,187 per month and the community is currently 94.3 percent occupied.
The Pointe at Vista Ridge’s amenities include a resort-style pool with an outdoor kitchen, 24-hour fitness center, playground, clubhouse with resident lounge and theater, outdoor BBQ grills, business center, a sand volleyball court, walking trail, game room with billiards and game station, a pet park and washing area, a tanning bed, car-washing station and covered carports. Every apartment home in the community features nine-foot ceilings, washer/dryer connections, crown molding, faux granite countertops, ceiling fans and private balconies or patios.
As part of the Steadfast Value Enhancement Strategy, STAR III plans to renovate all unit interiors to include an upgraded appliance package, new laminate countertops, new plumbing fixtures, new vinyl wood flooring and carpeting, and upgraded lighting when turning apartments between residents.
Located in Lewisville, 20 miles north of downtown Dallas, the community offers easy access to many Dallas-area business parks including Frisco Business Parks, Legacy West Development, Legacy and Granite Business Parks, and the Platinum Corridor. The Pointe at Vista Ridge is also located adjacent to Vista Ridge Mall and is just minutes from Stonebriar Centre.
STAR III believes the Dallas area is well-positioned for long-term success as it continues to benefit from a diverse range of industries and growth including the anticipated completion of Toyota’s U.S. headquarters later this year.
With the acquisition of The Pointe at Vista Ridge, STAR III has invested approximately $176 million with five multi-family properties, totaling 1,212 apartment homes, in Colorado, Georgia, Illinois and Texas.
About Steadfast Apartment REIT III
Steadfast Apartment REIT III intends to acquire a diverse portfolio of middle-market apartments and senior living facilities located throughout the United States.
STAR III is sponsored by Steadfast REIT Investments, LLC, an affiliate of Steadfast Companies, an Orange County, Calif.-based group of affiliated real estate investment and operating companies that acquire, develop and manage real estate in the U.S. and Mexico.

Ella Shaw Neyland, of Steadfast Income REIT
Fresh off the success of its first multi-family REIT, Steadfast REIT Investments L.L.C. is launching its second, Steadfast Apartment REIT, Inc., and beginning an initial public offering of $1.1 billion in common stock for the new REIT.
Steadfast Apartment REIT, Inc., is offering up to $1 billion in shares of its common stock for sale at $15 per share and up to an additional $100 million in shares of its common stock under its distribution reinvestment plan at $14.25 per share, according to a news release.
The Irvine, Calif.,-based REIT intends to use the proceeds from the continuous IPO to acquire and operate “a diverse portfolio of well-positioned, institutional-quality apartment communities in targeted markets throughout the United States that have demonstrated high occupancy and income levels across market cycles,” according to the REIT’s release.
An affiliate of the Steadfast Cos., Steadfast REIT Investments is the sponsor of Steadfast Apartment REIT and the first multi-family REIT – Steadfast Income REIT, Inc. Steadfast Capital Markets Group, the securities and financial services division of Steadfast Companies, is the deal manager and will distribute the product through retail broker-dealers and investment advisors.
Steadfast Income REIT closed to new investors on Dec. 20, 2013. As of Dec. 31, the REIT’s portfolio included 63 properties acquired for more than $1.5 billion, a Steadfast spokesperson told Commercial Property Executive. The REIT had nearly 16,000 units in 11 Midwestern and Southern states, the spokesperson added.
The REIT had been active in Texas, Alabama, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Oklahoma, Ohio and Tennessee.
In November, Steadfast Income REIT acquired a six-property portfolio in Houston that consisted of 1,692 units. The price was not disclosed for those assets but the REIT had paid $97 million for apartment communities in Houston, Dallas and Nashville in October.
Ella Shaw Neyland, president of Steadfast Income REIT, told CPE in a recent interview the firm preferred to focus on the central corridor of the United States rather than go after assets in higher-priced coastal communities or urban infill locations. Neyland said the REIT seeks multi-family communities in locations that have above-average job growth, limited new construction, good quality of life, and a strong local and diversified economy.
The new Steadfast Apartment REIT intends to follow a similar strategy, according to a prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC document also noted that Steadfast Apartment REIT plans to execute a “value-enhancement” strategy with about 30 to 40 percent of its portfolio. Those properties would be under-managed assets in high-demand neighborhoods that Steadfast would invest capital and reposition for better rents and resale values, the SEC filing stated.
“Although our primary focus will be the acquisition of multi-family properties, we may also selectively acquire debt collaterized by multi-family properties and securities of other companies owning multi-family properties, which we collectively refer to as real estate-related assets,” the REIT added in the SEC document.
