K B
GROUP, INC.


Kahn Brothers Group is an investment firm serving institutional and high-net-worth clients. The firm provides investment management through its registered investment advisor, Kahn Brothers Advisors LLC, and brokerage services through Kahn Brothers LLC, Member New York Stock Exchange.
Kahn Brothers Group was founded in 1978 by Irving Kahn, Thomas Graham Kahn and Alan Kahn. The firm's executive team has over one hundred years of aggregate experience in the investment business. The firm’s founding chairman, Irving Kahn, began his career in the value investing business shortly before the stock market crash of 1929, and, in the 1930s, he served as Benjamin Graham's teaching assistant at Columbia Business School.
Over time, Kahn Brothers’ investment philosophy has evolved from Graham's original "discount to net asset purchase" model into a contrarian value strategy focusing on margin of safety and capital appreciation over long periods of time. We believe these goals go hand in hand, and it is our mission to deliver superior returns on investment while limiting the risk of permanent loss of capital.
				
				Beyond our stated mission, we focus deeply on the needs and wellbeing of our clients. Our clients receive an unusual degree of customization and personal attention, akin to a family office. We purchase the same stocks for our clients as we do for ourselves and our families. Our clients rest assured knowing that our interests are always aligned with theirs.
Kahn Brothers welcomes new clients but choose to grow at a measured pace, adding those who share our long-term value investing goals. If you would like to begin a discussion about a new relationship, we welcome your call.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60)

      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):
Starting Quarter

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.
