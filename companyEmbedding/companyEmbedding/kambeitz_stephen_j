The Nominating Committee and the full Board of Directors believe that the attributes, skills and qualifications Mr. Kambeitz has developed through more than 36 years of executive sales and financial management, team building and restructuring and SEC reporting and public accounting experience, including working in the financial services industry through the savings and loan challenges in the 1980s, allow him to provide a valuable perspective on operating a financial services institution to the Board of Directors and he should continue as a Park director.
