	National Fuel Gas Company - For Investors - StockInformation - Dividend History













































Direct Stock Purchase and
Dividend Reinvestment Plan





Commentary on this conference call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.  National Fuel Gas Company (the “Company”) is providing this cautionary statement to make applicable and take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 for any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, the Company.
Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements regarding future prospects, plans, objectives, goals, projections, estimates of oil and gas quantities, strategies, future events or performance and underlying assumptions, capital structure, anticipated capital expenditures, completion of construction projects, projections for pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations, impacts of the adoption of new accounting rules, and possible outcomes of litigation or regulatory proceedings, as well as statements that are identified by the use of the words "anticipates," "estimates," "expects," "forecasts," "intends," "plans," "predicts," "projects," "believes," "seeks," "will," "may" and similar expressions.  All forward-looking statements, whether written or oral and whether made by or on behalf of the Company, are expressly qualified by these cautionary statements. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. 
The Company's expectations, beliefs and projections are expressed in good faith and are believed by the Company to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that management's expectations, beliefs or projections will result or be achieved or accomplished. 
In addition to other factors, the following are important factors that, in the view of the Company, could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements: 

Delays or changes in costs or plans with respect to Company projects or related projects of other companies, including difficulties or delays in obtaining necessary governmental approvals, permits or orders or in obtaining the cooperation of interconnecting facility operators;
Governmental/regulatory actions, initiatives and proceedings, including those involving rate cases (which address, among other things, target rates of return, rate design and retained natural gas), environmental/safety requirements, affiliate relationships, industry structure, and franchise renewal;
Changes in laws, regulations or judicial interpretations to which the Company is subject, including those involving derivatives, taxes, safety, employment, climate change, other environmental matters, real property, and exploration and production activities such as hydraulic fracturing;
Impairments under the SEC’s full cost ceiling test for natural gas and oil reserves;
Changes in the price of natural gas or oil;
Financial and economic conditions, including the availability of credit, and occurrences affecting the Company’s ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms for working capital, capital expenditures and other investments, including any downgrades in the Company’s credit ratings and changes in interest rates and other capital market conditions;
Factors affecting the Company’s ability to successfully identify, drill for and produce economically viable natural gas and oil reserves, including among others geology, lease availability, title disputes, weather conditions, shortages, delays or unavailability of equipment and services required in drilling operations, insufficient gathering, processing and transportation capacity, the need to obtain governmental approvals and permits, and compliance with environmental laws and regulations;
Increasing health care costs and the resulting effect on health insurance premiums and on the obligation to provide other post-retirement benefits;
Changes in price differentials between similar quantities of natural gas or oil at different geographic locations, and the effect of such changes on commodity production, revenues and demand for pipeline transportation capacity to or from such locations;
Other changes in price differentials between similar quantities of natural gas or oil having different quality, heating value, hydrocarbon mix or delivery date;
The cost and effects of legal and administrative claims against the Company or activist shareholder campaigns to effect changes at the Company;
Uncertainty of oil and gas reserve estimates;
Significant differences between the Company’s projected and actual production levels for natural gas or oil;
Changes in demographic patterns and weather conditions; 
Changes in the availability, price or accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments;
Changes in economic conditions, including global, national or regional recessions, and their effect on the demand for, and customers’ ability to pay for, the Company’s products and services; 
The creditworthiness or performance of the Company’s key suppliers, customers and counterparties;
Economic disruptions or uninsured losses resulting from major accidents, fires, severe weather, natural disasters, terrorist activities, acts of war, cyber attacks or pest infestation;
Significant differences between the Company’s projected and actual capital expenditures and operating expenses;
Changes in laws, actuarial assumptions, the interest rate environment and the return on plan/trust assets related to the Company’s pension and other post-retirement benefits, which can affect future funding obligations and costs and plan liabilities; or
Increasing costs of insurance, changes in coverage and the ability to obtain insurance.

Forward-looking statements include estimates of oil and gas quantities. Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. Other estimates of oil and gas quantities, including estimates of probable reserves, possible reserves, and resource potential, are by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved reserves. Accordingly, estimates other than proved reserves are subject to substantially greater risk of being actually realized. 
Any forward-looking statements contained in this conference call speak only as of the date of this call. The Company disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this conference call. Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in our Form 10-K and Forms 10-Q, available at www.nationalfuelgas.com. You can also obtain these forms on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.

Disclosure: Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements


National Fuel Gas Company is including the following cautionary statement in this corporate website to make applicable and take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 for any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, the Company.
Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements regarding future prospects, plans, objectives, goals, projections, estimates of oil and gas quantities, strategies, future events or performance and underlying assumptions, capital structure, anticipated capital expenditures, completion of construction projects, projections for pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations, impacts of the adoption of new accounting rules, and possible outcomes of litigation or regulatory proceedings, as well as statements that are identified by the use of the words "anticipates," "estimates," "expects," "forecasts," "intends," "plans," "predicts," "projects," "believes," "seeks," "will," "may" and similar expressions.  All forward-looking statements, whether written or oral and whether made by or on behalf of the Company, are expressly qualified by these cautionary statements. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. 
The Company's expectations, beliefs and projections are expressed in good faith and are believed by the Company to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that management's expectations, beliefs or projections will result or be achieved or accomplished. 
In addition to other factors and matters discussed elsewhere in this website, the following are important factors that, in the view of the Company, could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements:

Delays or changes in costs or plans with respect to Company projects or related projects of other companies, including difficulties or delays in obtaining necessary governmental approvals, permits or orders or in obtaining the cooperation of interconnecting facility operators;
Governmental/regulatory actions, initiatives and proceedings, including those involving rate cases (which address, among other things, target rates of return, rate design and retained natural gas), environmental/safety requirements, affiliate relationships, industry structure, and franchise renewal;
Changes in laws, regulations or judicial interpretations to which the Company is subject, including those involving derivatives, taxes, safety, employment, climate change, other environmental matters, real property, and exploration and production activities such as hydraulic fracturing;
Impairments under the SEC’s full cost ceiling test for natural gas and oil reserves;
Changes in the price of natural gas or oil;
Financial and economic conditions, including the availability of credit, and occurrences affecting the Company’s ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms for working capital, capital expenditures and other investments, including any downgrades in the Company’s credit ratings and changes in interest rates and other capital market conditions;
Factors affecting the Company’s ability to successfully identify, drill for and produce economically viable natural gas and oil reserves, including among others geology, lease availability, title disputes, weather conditions, shortages, delays or unavailability of equipment and services required in drilling operations, insufficient gathering, processing and transportation capacity, the need to obtain governmental approvals and permits, and compliance with environmental laws and regulations;
Increasing health care costs and the resulting effect on health insurance premiums and on the obligation to provide other post-retirement benefits;
Changes in price differentials between similar quantities of natural gas or oil at different geographic locations, and the effect of such changes on commodity production, revenues and demand for pipeline transportation capacity to or from such locations;
Other changes in price differentials between similar quantities of natural gas or oil having different quality, heating value, hydrocarbon mix or delivery date;
The cost and effects of legal and administrative claims against the Company or activist shareholder campaigns to effect changes at the Company;
Uncertainty of oil and gas reserve estimates;
Significant differences between the Company’s projected and actual production levels for natural gas or oil;
Changes in demographic patterns and weather conditions; 
Changes in the availability, price or accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments;
Changes in economic conditions, including global, national or regional recessions, and their effect on the demand for, and customers’ ability to pay for, the Company’s products and services; 
The creditworthiness or performance of the Company’s key suppliers, customers and counterparties;
Economic disruptions or uninsured losses resulting from major accidents, fires, severe weather, natural disasters, terrorist activities, acts of war, cyber attacks or pest infestation;
Significant differences between the Company’s projected and actual capital expenditures and operating expenses;
Changes in laws, actuarial assumptions, the interest rate environment and the return on plan/trust assets related to the Company’s pension and other post-retirement benefits, which can affect future funding obligations and costs and plan liabilities; or
Increasing costs of insurance, changes in coverage and the ability to obtain insurance.

The Company disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date thereof.

Forward-looking statements include estimates of oil and gas quantities. Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. Other estimates of oil and gas quantities, including estimates of probable reserves, possible reserves, and resource potential, are by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved reserves. Accordingly, estimates other than proved reserves are subject to substantially greater risk of being actually realized. 
Any forward-looking statements contained in this conference call speak only as of the date of this call. The Company disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this conference call. Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in our Form 10-K and Forms 10-Q, available at www.nationalfuelgas.com. You can also obtain these forms on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.

Disclosure: Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements


National Fuel Gas Company is including the following cautionary statement in this corporate website to make applicable and take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 for any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, the Company.
Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements regarding future prospects, plans, objectives, goals, projections, estimates of oil and gas quantities, strategies, future events or performance and underlying assumptions, capital structure, anticipated capital expenditures, completion of construction projects, projections for pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations, impacts of the adoption of new accounting rules, and possible outcomes of litigation or regulatory proceedings, as well as statements that are identified by the use of the words "anticipates," "estimates," "expects," "forecasts," "intends," "plans," "predicts," "projects," "believes," "seeks," "will," "may" and similar expressions.  All forward-looking statements, whether written or oral and whether made by or on behalf of the Company, are expressly qualified by these cautionary statements. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. 
The Company's expectations, beliefs and projections are expressed in good faith and are believed by the Company to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that management's expectations, beliefs or projections will result or be achieved or accomplished. 
In addition to other factors and matters discussed elsewhere in this website, the following are important factors that, in the view of the Company, could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements:

Delays or changes in costs or plans with respect to Company projects or related projects of other companies, including difficulties or delays in obtaining necessary governmental approvals, permits or orders or in obtaining the cooperation of interconnecting facility operators;
Governmental/regulatory actions, initiatives and proceedings, including those involving rate cases (which address, among other things, target rates of return, rate design and retained natural gas), environmental/safety requirements, affiliate relationships, industry structure, and franchise renewal;
Changes in laws, regulations or judicial interpretations to which the Company is subject, including those involving derivatives, taxes, safety, employment, climate change, other environmental matters, real property, and exploration and production activities such as hydraulic fracturing;
Impairments under the SEC’s full cost ceiling test for natural gas and oil reserves;
Changes in the price of natural gas or oil;
Financial and economic conditions, including the availability of credit, and occurrences affecting the Company’s ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms for working capital, capital expenditures and other investments, including any downgrades in the Company’s credit ratings and changes in interest rates and other capital market conditions;
Factors affecting the Company’s ability to successfully identify, drill for and produce economically viable natural gas and oil reserves, including among others geology, lease availability, title disputes, weather conditions, shortages, delays or unavailability of equipment and services required in drilling operations, insufficient gathering, processing and transportation capacity, the need to obtain governmental approvals and permits, and compliance with environmental laws and regulations;
Increasing health care costs and the resulting effect on health insurance premiums and on the obligation to provide other post-retirement benefits;
Changes in price differentials between similar quantities of natural gas or oil at different geographic locations, and the effect of such changes on commodity production, revenues and demand for pipeline transportation capacity to or from such locations;
Other changes in price differentials between similar quantities of natural gas or oil having different quality, heating value, hydrocarbon mix or delivery date;
The cost and effects of legal and administrative claims against the Company or activist shareholder campaigns to effect changes at the Company;
Uncertainty of oil and gas reserve estimates;
Significant differences between the Company’s projected and actual production levels for natural gas or oil;
Changes in demographic patterns and weather conditions; 
Changes in the availability, price or accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments;
Changes in economic conditions, including global, national or regional recessions, and their effect on the demand for, and customers’ ability to pay for, the Company’s products and services; 
The creditworthiness or performance of the Company’s key suppliers, customers and counterparties;
Economic disruptions or uninsured losses resulting from major accidents, fires, severe weather, natural disasters, terrorist activities, acts of war, cyber attacks or pest infestation;
Significant differences between the Company’s projected and actual capital expenditures and operating expenses;
Changes in laws, actuarial assumptions, the interest rate environment and the return on plan/trust assets related to the Company’s pension and other post-retirement benefits, which can affect future funding obligations and costs and plan liabilities; or
Increasing costs of insurance, changes in coverage and the ability to obtain insurance.

The Company disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date thereof.

Direct Stock Purchase and
Dividend Reinvestment Plan





Commentary on this conference call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.  National Fuel Gas Company (the “Company”) is providing this cautionary statement to make applicable and take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 for any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, the Company.
Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements regarding future prospects, plans, objectives, goals, projections, estimates of oil and gas quantities, strategies, future events or performance and underlying assumptions, capital structure, anticipated capital expenditures, completion of construction projects, projections for pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations, impacts of the adoption of new accounting rules, and possible outcomes of litigation or regulatory proceedings, as well as statements that are identified by the use of the words "anticipates," "estimates," "expects," "forecasts," "intends," "plans," "predicts," "projects," "believes," "seeks," "will," "may" and similar expressions.  All forward-looking statements, whether written or oral and whether made by or on behalf of the Company, are expressly qualified by these cautionary statements. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. 
The Company's expectations, beliefs and projections are expressed in good faith and are believed by the Company to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that management's expectations, beliefs or projections will result or be achieved or accomplished. 
In addition to other factors, the following are important factors that, in the view of the Company, could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements: 

Delays or changes in costs or plans with respect to Company projects or related projects of other companies, including difficulties or delays in obtaining necessary governmental approvals, permits or orders or in obtaining the cooperation of interconnecting facility operators;
Governmental/regulatory actions, initiatives and proceedings, including those involving rate cases (which address, among other things, target rates of return, rate design and retained natural gas), environmental/safety requirements, affiliate relationships, industry structure, and franchise renewal;
Changes in laws, regulations or judicial interpretations to which the Company is subject, including those involving derivatives, taxes, safety, employment, climate change, other environmental matters, real property, and exploration and production activities such as hydraulic fracturing;
Impairments under the SEC’s full cost ceiling test for natural gas and oil reserves;
Changes in the price of natural gas or oil;
Financial and economic conditions, including the availability of credit, and occurrences affecting the Company’s ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms for working capital, capital expenditures and other investments, including any downgrades in the Company’s credit ratings and changes in interest rates and other capital market conditions;
Factors affecting the Company’s ability to successfully identify, drill for and produce economically viable natural gas and oil reserves, including among others geology, lease availability, title disputes, weather conditions, shortages, delays or unavailability of equipment and services required in drilling operations, insufficient gathering, processing and transportation capacity, the need to obtain governmental approvals and permits, and compliance with environmental laws and regulations;
Increasing health care costs and the resulting effect on health insurance premiums and on the obligation to provide other post-retirement benefits;
Changes in price differentials between similar quantities of natural gas or oil at different geographic locations, and the effect of such changes on commodity production, revenues and demand for pipeline transportation capacity to or from such locations;
Other changes in price differentials between similar quantities of natural gas or oil having different quality, heating value, hydrocarbon mix or delivery date;
The cost and effects of legal and administrative claims against the Company or activist shareholder campaigns to effect changes at the Company;
Uncertainty of oil and gas reserve estimates;
Significant differences between the Company’s projected and actual production levels for natural gas or oil;
Changes in demographic patterns and weather conditions; 
Changes in the availability, price or accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments;
Changes in economic conditions, including global, national or regional recessions, and their effect on the demand for, and customers’ ability to pay for, the Company’s products and services; 
The creditworthiness or performance of the Company’s key suppliers, customers and counterparties;
Economic disruptions or uninsured losses resulting from major accidents, fires, severe weather, natural disasters, terrorist activities, acts of war, cyber attacks or pest infestation;
Significant differences between the Company’s projected and actual capital expenditures and operating expenses;
Changes in laws, actuarial assumptions, the interest rate environment and the return on plan/trust assets related to the Company’s pension and other post-retirement benefits, which can affect future funding obligations and costs and plan liabilities; or
Increasing costs of insurance, changes in coverage and the ability to obtain insurance.

Forward-looking statements include estimates of oil and gas quantities. Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. Other estimates of oil and gas quantities, including estimates of probable reserves, possible reserves, and resource potential, are by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved reserves. Accordingly, estimates other than proved reserves are subject to substantially greater risk of being actually realized. 
Any forward-looking statements contained in this conference call speak only as of the date of this call. The Company disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this conference call. Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in our Form 10-K and Forms 10-Q, available at www.nationalfuelgas.com. You can also obtain these forms on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.

National Fuel Increases Dividend Rate for 47th Consecutive Year





More














Seneca Resources, NFG's Upstream subsidiary, has grown annual production by more than 200% since 2010. Seneca has one of the largest positions in the Marcellus Shale, controlling the mineral interests associated with approximately 780,000 net acres, a majority of which are held in fee, carrying no royalty and no lease expirations. 



NFG's Midstream subsidiaries are uniquely positioned to serve producers looking to transport rapidly growing natural gas production out of the Appalachian basin. Since 2009, NFG has built three non-regulated gathering systems for Seneca and added over 1 Bcf of contracted daily capacity on its FERC-regulated interstate pipelines, with plans for further expansion over the next 3 years. 



NFG's Downstream subsidiaries serve more than 737,000 residential, commercial and industrial customers in western NY and northwest PA, providing
a stable base of earnings and cash flows that has allowed the Company to increase its dividend for 44 consecutive years.

National Fuel Gas: A Natural Gas Utility With Pipelines, Exploration And Production - National Fuel Gas Co. (NYSE:NFG) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»National Fuel Gas: A Natural Gas Utility With Pipelines, Exploration And ProductionSep.18.12 | About: National Fuel (NFG) George Fisher Utilities, industrials, newsletter provider, valueGuiding Mast InvestmentsFounded in 1902, National Fuel Gas (NYSE:NFG) is often overlooked by most utility and natural gas investors. This mid-cap company has all the natural gas bases covered - natural gas regulated utility, natural gas E&P, natural gas pipelines, and natural gas storage. If you like natural gas as a long-term investment, NFG should be strongly considered for your portfolio. NFG offers pipelines and E&P diversification for gas utility investors and utility exposure for pipeline and E&P investors.
Natural Fuel Gas serves 732,000 customers through its regulated gas utility in the greater Buffalo area, down the eastern shore of Lake Erie to Erie, PA, and over to Jamestown, NY, and Sharron, PA. The utility segment will contribute about 25% of anticipated 2012 earnings. There is not much exciting about the utility segment, except for the traditional stability of earnings and investor returns. Like many natural gas utilities, NFG is expected to suffer a decline in utility operation profits as warm weather has reduced demand - not a new story and one that is happening throughout the natural gas industry.
The Pipeline and Storage segment is another steady-Eddie, contributing about 23% of anticipated 2012 earnings. The expansion of this segment should generate a bit of excitement. The segment uses the name National Fuel Gas Supply and Empire State Pipelines. Combined, these two units own almost 3,000 miles of pipeline along with 27 wholly owned and four jointly-owned storage facilities in Upstate New York. The pipelines extend from southwestern Pennsylvania, to the Canadian border and from the Canadian border to Syracuse, where it connects with pipelines traveling south to NYC. With its physical location in the northern Marcellus, NFG is primed to provide transportation and storage for an increasing production footprint. Management will continue to expand its gathering pipeline and processing assets in unison with growth in overall Marcellus production.
Natural gas marketing is a very minor segment, generating about 2% of anticipated 2012 production.

Natural gas exploration and production will generate the balance of 2012 earnings, or about 50%. NFG operates two E&P businesses, Seneca East and Seneca West. Seneca East drills for natural gas, both wet and dry, in the Marcellus and onshore Gulf Coast, and Seneca West focuses on California oil assets. This segment should register high on investor's excitement meter.
NFG reported FY3rd-quarter production numbers of 22.1 Bcf, representing 20% sequential and 31% year-over-year growth. Seneca West produced 9.7 MBbls/d at a realized price of $99.81.
The largest E&P opportunity is NFG's acreage in the Marcellus. The firm currently owns the mineral rights on 975,000 acres outright, mainly in NY, and PA, and leases another 30,000 acres. Since there is no pressure to produce, Seneca can delay drilling without affecting ownership of the mineral rights. In times of low natural gas prices and oversupply, this differentiation allows for better management of assets for the long term.
There are 84 million shares outstanding and NFG has a market cap of $4.5 billion with long-term debt of $3.3 billion. Earnings per share for the FY3rd quarter were $0.52, down slightly from last year. According to its recent conference call, management has provided EPS guidance for this year and next year, with a midpoint of $2.40 for 2012 and $2.60 for 2013. NFG pays a dividend of $1.46 for a yield of 2.7%, in line with other gas utilities and higher than most natural gas E&Ps. With a reduced capital expenditure budget for 2013 due to weak gas prices, operating cash flow should just about cover cap ex including drilling about 110 wells.
As assets increase over time in the Pipeline and Storage segment, there is the opportunity for National Fuel Gas to join the trend of spinning off MLP-like assets. EQT recently spun off its pipeline assets into a MLP, EQT Midstream Partners (NYSE:EQM) and Plains All American (NYSE:PAA) continue to drop-down assets into PAA Natural Gas Storage (NYSE:PNG). For longer-term investors, this could unlock additional shareholder value. However, the segment doesn't currently have the critical mass needed to be an attractive stand-alone MLP.

Mario Gabelli's Gabelli Utility Fund (MUTF:GABUX) owns 5.6% of NFG shares, and the fund keeps buying. From the fund's 2nd-quarter report:
NFG is a diversified natural gas company. NFG owns a regulated gas utility serving the region around Buffalo, NY, gas pipelines that move gas between the Midwest and Canada and from the Marcellus to the Northeast, and an oil and gas exploration and production business. NFG's regulated utility and pipeline businesses, as well as its California oil production business, provide stable earnings and cash flows to support the dividend while the natural gas production business offers significant upside potential. NFG's ownership of 800,000 acres in the Marcellus shale, including 745,000 acres in the shale fairway of Pennsylvania, holds enormous natural gas reserve potential and we believe the position could be worth $3.6 billion based on recent comparable transactions. Despite the decline in natural gas prices leading to lower production levels, we continue to expect significant long-term earnings and cash flow growth from gas production and remain excited about the expansion potential of the strategically located pipeline network. The Company has increased its dividend for over forty consecutive years.
The last line is worth repeating - "The Company has increased its dividend for over forty consecutive years."
In the fall of 2010, the company began floating the concept of bringing along a money partner to hasten development of its Marcellus E&P opportunities and speculation drove share prices up to the $75 range. In the summer of 2011, the company announced it had decided to go it alone, causing the speculative bubble to burst and share prices fell precipitously to below $55. With the recent collapse of natural gas pricing, share prices continued their decline to below $45, but have recovered a bit to the low $50s. A three-year chart:


More conservative natural gas E&P investors should like the stability of NFG's utility and pipeline businesses. More speculative utility and pipeline investors should like the upside provided by the E&P business. National Fuel Gas should be worthy of both types of investor's time and effort for further research.

National Fuel Gas Company is an integrated energy company with $6.2 billion in assets distributed among the following five operating segments: Exploration and Production (Seneca Resources Corporation), Pipeline and Storage, Gathering, Utility, and Energy Marketing (National Fuel Resources, Inc. - NFR). National Fuel Gas was incorporated in 1902 and is based in Williamsville, New York.
The Utility segment sells natural gas or provides natural gas transportation services to more than 732,000 customers through a local distribution system located in western New York and northwestern Pennsylvania. The Pipeline and Storage segment provides interstate natural gas transportation and storage services for affiliated and non-affiliated companies through an integrated system of 2,972 miles of pipeline and 31 underground natural gas storage fields (including 4 storage fields co-owned with nonaffiliated companies). The Exploration and Production segment, headquartered in Houston, Texas, explores for, develops and produces natural gas and oil reserves in California, Kansas and the Appalachia Region. Seneca’s primary focus is now the Marcellus and Utica Shales in Pennsylvania, where the company controls 780,000 net prospective acres. The Energy Marketing segment markets natural gas to industrial, commercial, public authority and residential end users located in New York and Pennsylvania.

History[edit]
As one of the earliest gas utility companies in the United States, National Fuel Gas witnessed a number of technological firsts at its company or its subsidiaries. Engineers at the company discovered that depleted underground gas fields could be modified to act as storage reservoirs. Thus, the first such storage facility in the US was implemented at Zoar Field, about forty miles south of Buffalo. This turned out to be a great financial asset to NFG in the 1940s and 1950s, when skyrocketing demand for natural gas led to extensive pipelines in the eastern states being connected to new pipelines and fields in the southwestern states. NFG could thereby purchase huge quantities of cheaper summer gas from the southwest, pipe it to its New York storage fields, inject it into the ground, then retrieve it when demand and prices rose in the winter months.[3]
The company was also the first in the industry to develop a gas-fired generator to produce electricity for cathodic protection to fight corrosion on pipelines.[4]
In 1975, with the introduction of "Balanced Billing", the company claimed that it was "the only gas utility in the country" with a flexible plan for customers to pay bills in eleven equal monthly payments, with settlement of any overpayment or underpayment in the twelfth month. This is a modified system of installment credit.[5]
Its headquarters was located at 10 Lafayette Square until 2002 when the company relocated to 6363 Main St in the Buffalo suburb, Williamsville.
National Fuel Gas Co. is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol NFG.[6] Its fiscal year ends September 30.
Subsidiaries[edit]
National Fuel's direct, wholly owned subsidiaries include Horizon Energy Development, Inc.; Horizon LFG, Inc.; Leidy Hub, Inc.; Data-Track Account Services, Inc.; Horizon Power, Inc.; Empire Pipeline, Inc. and Seneca Resources, Inc.

Certificate Vignette
National Fuel Gas Company (NYSE: NFG), was incorporated in 1902.  It is a diversified energy company with its headquarters in Buffalo, New York. The Company�s assets are distributed among six business segments: Exploration and Production, Pipeline and Storage, Utility, International, Energy Marketing and Timber.National Fuel�s history dates to the earliest days of the natural gas and oil industry in the United States and the Company has been responsible for many industry firsts.The history of National Fuel closely parallels the history of the natural gas industry in the United States. Beginning in 1821, its predecessor companies were involved in many historic firsts. Today National Fuel Gas Company is managed with the same innovative and entrepreneurial spirit of its past. The following chronicles some of the historic firsts in which National Fuel and its predecessor companies participated.The first documented commercial use of natural gas in our country occurred in 1821 in the Village of Fredonia, New York. Local citizens drilled the nation�s first gas well to a depth of 27 feet and later laid lead pipe along the main street to illuminate 100 street lights.Not far from Fredonia is the hamlet of Barcelona, located on the shores of Lake Erie. In 1830, the Barcelona lighthouse became the world�s first navigational beacon lighted by natural gas.In 1870, a company in Bloomfield, New York bored pine logs and banded them together with iron, creating the industry�s first natural gas pipeline. It stretched 25 miles to Rochester, New York.Then, in 1872, the first metal natural gas transmission line was constructed carrying gas from a well in Newton, Pa. to Titusville, Pa.In 1886, United Natural Gas Company, which later became a subsidiary of National Fuel Gas Company, constructed an 87-mile wrought-iron gas transmission line from gas producing areas in McKean County, Pennsylvania to Buffalo, New York. This was recognized as the world�s longest natural gas pipeline and was considered one of the construction marvels of the time.In 1899, the world�s first 1,000 horsepower gas engine-driven compressor was installed by United Natural Gas Company. These compressors were able to effectively raise and lower gas pressures and control gas flow, allowing gas pipelines to handle increasingly large quantities of gas.By the early 1900s, natural gas had proved to be an ideal fuel for cooking, heating water, heating homes and lighting and many communities had developed independent gas systems to supply the demand of local citizens. However, when the original wells were exhausted or when the demand for gas became greater than the local wells could supply, troubles began. The need for a coordinated gas supply effort became apparent.In 1902, National Fuel Gas Company was formed. It eventually merged with or acquired assets of many companies. These subsidiaries laid interconnecting pipelines, tying the many isolated systems into one big network.In 1916, Iroquois Gas Corporation, a National Fuel subsidiary, proved that significant quantities of natural gas could be stored in tight formations of depleted gas reservoirs. The first underground natural gas storage reservoir in the United States was therefore developed by National Fuel at Zoar Field, just 40 miles south of Buffalo.The development of underground natural gas storage in depleted gas fields became a significant economic asset of National Fuel. After World War II, in order to accommodate the skyrocketing demand for this economic fuel, the gas pipelines in the east were connected with the vast gas reserves being discovered in the southwest. Companies like National Fuel with storage capacity could buy southwest supplies to supplement locally produced gas, inject some of this gas into its storage fields and pull it back out during the winter when gas demand peaked. This allowed National Fuel to maximize the efficiency of its pipeline system, increasing the economics of an already economically attractive fuel.Other firsts followed: the first gas-fired generator to produce electricity for pipeline protection; in 1973, the first meter-order system to provide computerized scheduling and routing; in 1993, operation of one of the first state-of-the-art computerized one-call centers to increase the efficiency of customer responses by telephone.Today, natural gas is the most popular, environmentally sound and economic fuel choice of homeowners and businesses in the country. National Fuel is proud to have been an innovative leader in the development of this industry.The company history is from Natural Fuel's website.

History[edit]
As one of the earliest gas utility companies in the United States, National Fuel Gas witnessed a number of technological firsts at its company or its subsidiaries. Engineers at the company discovered that depleted underground gas fields could be modified to act as storage reservoirs. Thus, the first such storage facility in the US was implemented at Zoar Field, about forty miles south of Buffalo. This turned out to be a great financial asset to NFG in the 1940s and 1950s, when skyrocketing demand for natural gas led to extensive pipelines in the eastern states being connected to new pipelines and fields in the southwestern states. NFG could thereby purchase huge quantities of cheaper summer gas from the southwest, pipe it to its New York storage fields, inject it into the ground, then retrieve it when demand and prices rose in the winter months.[3]
The company was also the first in the industry to develop a gas-fired generator to produce electricity for cathodic protection to fight corrosion on pipelines.[4]
In 1975, with the introduction of "Balanced Billing", the company claimed that it was "the only gas utility in the country" with a flexible plan for customers to pay bills in eleven equal monthly payments, with settlement of any overpayment or underpayment in the twelfth month. This is a modified system of installment credit.[5]
Its headquarters was located at 10 Lafayette Square until 2002 when the company relocated to 6363 Main St in the Buffalo suburb, Williamsville.
National Fuel Gas Co. is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol NFG.[6] Its fiscal year ends September 30.

History[edit]
As one of the earliest gas utility companies in the United States, National Fuel Gas witnessed a number of technological firsts at its company or its subsidiaries. Engineers at the company discovered that depleted underground gas fields could be modified to act as storage reservoirs. Thus, the first such storage facility in the US was implemented at Zoar Field, about forty miles south of Buffalo. This turned out to be a great financial asset to NFG in the 1940s and 1950s, when skyrocketing demand for natural gas led to extensive pipelines in the eastern states being connected to new pipelines and fields in the southwestern states. NFG could thereby purchase huge quantities of cheaper summer gas from the southwest, pipe it to its New York storage fields, inject it into the ground, then retrieve it when demand and prices rose in the winter months.[3]
The company was also the first in the industry to develop a gas-fired generator to produce electricity for cathodic protection to fight corrosion on pipelines.[4]
In 1975, with the introduction of "Balanced Billing", the company claimed that it was "the only gas utility in the country" with a flexible plan for customers to pay bills in eleven equal monthly payments, with settlement of any overpayment or underpayment in the twelfth month. This is a modified system of installment credit.[5]
Its headquarters was located at 10 Lafayette Square until 2002 when the company relocated to 6363 Main St in the Buffalo suburb, Williamsville.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:
