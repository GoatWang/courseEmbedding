Clear court records: In Court Records inquiries, data is not displayed (i.e., "No Records Found" "Clear") when the databases US SEARCH accesses do not have any civil or criminal records pertaining to the subject of your search. A "Clear" court record constitutes results and this limited guarantee does not apply. Please note that court records and criminal conviction records are searched going back seven years from the date of the last disposition on the case.
Court Record inquiries include:

State criminal search
On premise County courthouse search
Onsite civil lawsuit search
Sex offender
Department of Corrections
Court Record Search
1-State Criminal Search
Instant Nationwide Criminal Search

Clear Deceased and Real Property searches:
Please also be aware that our Deceased and Real Property searches may return "no records found" as your search result. This means, respectively, that, according to the databases we access, the individual is not deceased or does not own any real property in the coverage area

US SEARCH delivers best-in-class data. Because we access more data points than our competitors, not only do we provide more data, we provide more accurate data. Compare us to the competition - rest assured, you will NOT find superior data and the level of customer support that US Search provides elsewhere.
