PRESS RELEASE
Bayer HealthCare will invest up to USD 25 million as a strategic investor in Versant Ventures’ newly formed “Versant Venture Capital V” fund to support the development of new therapies in areas of high unmet medical need. Versant Ventures is a global healthcare venture capital firm investing in biotech and medical device companies throughout the U.S., Europe, and Canada.
Bayer, along with other limited partners of the fund, will be a member of the advisory board to Versant’s “Venture Capital V” fund, contributing its longstanding expertise in drug discovery and development. Versant’s fund management team maintains full decision making rights as to investments in portfolio companies.
“Versant Ventures has an excellent track record promoting entrepreneurship in life sciences and healthcare, driven by a team of experts with a global reach,” said Prof. Dr. Andreas Busch, Member of the Bayer HealthCare Executive Committee and Head of Global Drug Discovery. “Bayer’s mission is science for a better life. Our commitment parallels Versant’s vision to advance early medical innovation and patient care. We are looking forward to supporting promising early stage companies that are addressing disease areas of high unmet medical need.” 





“We are excited about Bayer’s support for our latest fund and look forward to sharing our expertise in drug discovery and development,” said Brad Bolzon, Managing Director at Versant Ventures. “We share similar goals of stimulating and promoting innovation in healthcare to eventually affect patient outcome.”
Bayer and Versant Ventures have already joined forces in ophthalmology research. In November 2013, Bayer HealthCare announced an exclusive collaboration with Inception Sciences – a drug discovery incubator exclusively backed by Versant Ventures – to conduct early research in the area of retinal eye diseases. For this purpose, Versant Ventures established “Inception 4” – a company with the aim to develop innovative treatment options for patients suffering from eye diseases, such as wet age-related macular degeneration and geographic atrophy. Bayer holds an exclusive option to acquire “Inception 4” under certain undisclosed conditions.

PRESS RELEASE
Versant Ventures Closes $305 Million Healthcare Fund
SAN FRANCISCO–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Versant Ventures, a global healthcare investment firm, today announced the close of Versant Venture Capital V L.P. at $305 million and in excess of the initial fund target of $250 million. Since its inception, Versant has raised $1.9 billion to invest in innovative biopharmaceutical, medical device, and healthcare services/HCIT companies. The firm invests from offices in North America and Europe, and it has assembled a team with deep investment, operating, and scientific expertise that enables a hands-on approach to company building. 





“It’s an exciting time to be launching Versant V, and we look forward to working with talented teams, co-investors, and industry partners to advance important therapies and technologies that have the potential to substantially impact the industry.”
The Versant V portfolio will be diversified with investments made across the healthcare sector and at all stages of company development. Consistent with recent strategy, a primary focus will be the discovery and development of novel therapeutics. Many of these companies will be launched by Versant and will enter into “build-to-buy” structured acquisitions with strategic partners at the outset. Key to that strategy are the firm’s company creation engines, Inception Sciences and Blueline Bioscience, which in recent years have collectively spawned seven companies and executed almost as many strategic partnerships. The remainder of the fund will be devoted to high potential companies in other healthcare sectors that are in need of growth capital to develop or commercialize their products. Investments out of Versant V began earlier this year and a number of commitments have already been made, including to Northern Biologics, a company launched by Blueline Bioscience that will develop novel therapeutic antibodies in a strategic partnership with Celgene.
“We are grateful for the support of our limited partners, who allow us to pursue our mission of helping exceptional entrepreneurs build the next generation of great healthcare companies,” said Brad Bolzon, Managing Director. “It’s an exciting time to be launching Versant V, and we look forward to working with talented teams, co-investors, and industry partners to advance important therapies and technologies that have the potential to substantially impact the industry.” 





About Versant Ventures
Versant Ventures is a leading healthcare investment firm committed to helping exceptional entrepreneurs build the next generation of great healthcare companies. The firm invests across the healthcare sector and at all stages of company development, with an emphasis on the discovery and development of novel therapeutics. With $1.9 billion under management and offices in North America and Europe, Versant has built a team with deep investment, operating, and scientific expertise that enables a hands-on approach to company building. Since the firm’s founding in 1999, nearly 40 Versant companies have achieved successful acquisitions or IPOs. For more information, please visit www.versantventures.com.
