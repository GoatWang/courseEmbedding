 The ResellerRatings Elite Program Recognizes Excellence in Customer Satisfaction
Our Elite Program recognizes excellence in customer satisfaction.  To display the
        ResellerRatings Elite badge, companies must meet stringent ratings standards,
        and they must subscribe to the ResellerRatings Merchant Member program to actively
        participate in resolving customer issues at ResellerRatings.
    



Minimum Ratings Requirements 

The ResellerRatings seal must pass a series of requirements based upon review acquisition recency, volume and maintained ratings.  From time to time
        these requirements are slightly modulated as to ensure it makes sense with our changing algorithms.  We always try to ensure stability of seals, and make sure massive input of negative or positive customer reviews
        from deals, fulfillment issues, etc, does not create a series of highs and lows.  The Elite Seal represents a high caliber merchant.
    .

    
 Merchant must be a merchant member 
 They must have at least 30 reviews in the last 6 months 
 Their average rating across ALL the reviews used to calculate their rating must be 8.0




 Your merchant store front is adorned with the logo for all the incoming direct traffic and from Shopping Channels to see! 



 You can place the Elite Seal on your own store front which pops up information about your store, thus not interrupting with the shopper funnel. 







 Click on the Seal above 



ResellerRatings Elite is not a guarantee or  a warranty that you will receive excellent service, but companies that qualify for ResellerRatings Elite have the highest customer satisfaction ratings of any companies listed on our site.

 "the purchasing experience was very good. I found my item quickly and was able to check out very easily. If I had the item already delivered and it worked I would have been able to provide 5 stars. However because I have only just made the purchase and have not net received the product I have to reserve my rating to a more conservative choice. "
