DALLAS, March 15, 2016 /PRNewswire-iReach/ -- Nuviant Medical, Inc. ("Nuviant" or "the Company"), a medical device development and manufacturing company with proprietary closed-loop neuromodulation systems, announced today that Brian Blischak has joined the Company as Chief Commercial Officer (CCO).  Mr. Blischak has over 20 years of experience in the medical device field and 16 years of experience in neuromodulation serving in senior commercial operations and executive roles for ImThera Medical and St. Jude Medical.
"Nuviant's innovative technology platform and rapid clinical development programs have enabled us to attract top talent," said Nuviant Chief Executive Officer Will Rosellini.  "Brian brings with him invaluable experience in leading global commercialization strategies and operations, specifically for deep brain stimulation therapies."
Mr. Blischak joins from ImThera Medical, Inc., developer of an implantable neurostimulation system for sleep apnea, where he served for four years as Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing.  Prior to that, Mr. Blischak spent twelve years in the St. Jude Medical Neuromodulation Division (SJM), where he led the commercialization and launch of two major deep brain stimulation (DBS) product families consisting of over 20 products in more than 15 countries, including the patient recruitment efforts for two pivotal Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) studies for Parkinson's disease and essential tremor and two IDE feasibility studies for major depressive disorder.  Mr. Blischak has a Bachelor of Science in Engineering Physics degree from the University of Saskatchewan, and a Master of Science in Biomedical Engineering and MBA degrees from The University of Texas at Austin. He is an inventor on nine issued US patents for neuromodulation devices.
"Nuviant's team is to be commended for developing and obtaining the CE Mark for the world's first rechargeable DBS system with both stimulating and sensing capabilities," said newly-appointed Nuviant CCO Brian Blischak. "I look forward to introducing this exciting new technology. Clinicians have waited a long time for a device like this." 
About Nuviant Medical, Inc.: Nuviant Medical is a medical device company that has developed an innovative, closed-loop neuromodulation platform for the treatment of chronic neurological diseases.  The Synapse™ system is currently the only system that can deliver up to 32 channels of stimulation while simultaneously recording neural signals, opening new possibilities for closed-loop neuromodulation therapies.  The Synapse™ system previously received a CE Mark for adjunctive alleviation therapy of movement disorder symptoms and is being further developed for commercialization in Europe and the US.  For more information on Nuviant Medical, please visit our website at www.nuviantmedical.com.
