PRODUCT  INSTRUCTIONS
Wash your hair every two to three days. You can go longer if your scalp is very dry. Our Shampoos are very concentrated, use a little bit but lather up twice.
Next choose your conditioner…
The 12 Minute Conditioner can be used once a month as a deep conditioner, between the shampoo and the cream rinse. Apply a teaspoon amount or more for thicker or longer hair, concentrating on the ponytail area, work it in a bit. Put a hot wet towel over your hair for at least 12 mins. Rinse out and use cream rinse. Or… use the 60 Second Conditioner- as a daily conditioner, apply the same as above, no need for a towel.
Detangle your hair......then rinse the Cream Rinse.
Detangle your hair using a wide tooth comb while you have the cream rinse in your hair.
Cream rinse – Put mostly on ponytail area, then apply what is left on your hands on the top layer of your hair.
Never brush your hair when it’s wet.
When your hair is dry comb out with a wide tooth comb before you brush.
Never use blowdryers or heating implements!
Roller setting is best to dry long hair.

Every song holds its own and still holds up today.  I remember the album as a young kid but wasn't old enough to understand it fully.  Now that I have it and I know the history behind it I have a new appreciation for it and why it was so big at the time and why George wanted to get away from his sex symbol image and all of the success.  It was too much for him.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsSo good you'll melt.ByAdrian Cooperon December 13, 2011Format: Audio CD|Verified PurchaseGay or not this man has got oodles of freakin' talent. This album is amazing (and beyond!) no matter how you look at it. George produced, wrote and composed all the tracks but one (he co-wrote "Look At Your Hands" with producer/songwriter David Austin) and there was absolutely no stopping him. Just coming off of the few years of success with Wham! from the early 80's with his old friend Andrew Ridgeley, George Michael decided he wanted to be taken a little more seriously and dropped this bombshell of a record. It has some pop, a lot of R&B and Funk overtones, some dance tunes and ballads. I swear, it's really diverse without being unfocused. It rides by pretty smoothly and after it's over you are likely to play it all again.And I stand corrected. As much as I loved Corinne Bailey Rae's masterpiece Corinne Bailey Rae from 2006, this album totally trumps it. Not only is this a damn fine album but it is my favorite from the 80's and favorite overall that I've heard so far. Great, great vocal work, production is amazing, hardly sounding dated and George often comes off as a gentleman on these songs which is quite endearing.4.8 stars.DOWNLOAD:"Kissing A Fool""Father Figure""One More Try""I Want Your Sex" (Parts. 1+2) &"Hard Day"HONORABLE MENTION(s):"I Want Your Sex" (Part 3)Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsFaith is the Epitome of What Good Pop Music isByGabeon July 11, 2012Format: Audio CD|Verified PurchaseThis album was nothing new when I bought it because I had already heard most of the tracks on the internet.  I liked the music so much that I decided to add it to my collection.I listen to this album a lot now, and it is one of my favorite albums.  Every track on this album compliments each other and it seems that there is no filler on this track list.  The arrangements; the vocals; the lyrics.  They are all molded into a soul/pop masterpiece.  Each track deserves its own recognition:Faith (5/5): This track is very simple, but it is also very enjoyable.  It has a great guitar rhythm and a hook that is really catchy.Father Figure (5/5): This is one of my favorite tracks.  Even though the lyrics may point towards a more discretionary and inappropriate affair, I think it is a work of art and fits this album perfectly.  It has a way of showing that love can be dark and misunderstood and it matches the theme of the album.  It has religious allusions in the title, but it goes on to a more human experience.I want your sex (Part 1&2) (4/5): This track s fun.  You can dance to it.  It also maintains a subtle theme in the album, "I don't need a bible, just look in my eyes." Its a clever, catchy6 song with some new instruments brought in like horns to give it more of a funk feel.  I like it, but it is not one of my favorites on the album.One more try (5/5): I'll admit, this track took a couple of times to get into it.  It seemed to be the same, mellow and repetitive melody and vocals.  After awhile though, I actually found it a really great track.  The lyrics are so powerful here.  listen to feel the sadness and request for redemption for yourself.Hard day (3/5): I like this song a lot.  On itunes I tend to put it on playlists, but sometimes it throws me off when I listen to the full album.  It just didn't seem to have many themes of religious allusions and topics that made the album really worth listening to as a whole.Look at your hands (5/5): I feel that this is a very underrated track.  It is my second favorite on the album.  It has this nice ambient feel and the vocals are soft yet outstanding, in my opinion.Monkey (4/5):  If you can get past the corny hook, than it is actually a really fun track.  I really like the version on the music video, but this was different on the album.  Nonetheless, great track.  Having a "monkey on your back" means to me that there is a person who has an addiction (whether it be drugs or a lover) and though this monkey is harmful, the attention that it demands is given.Kissing a fool (5/5): I can't even begin to describe my admiration for this track.  IT is my favorite.  The lyrics, the music, and the vocals:  it is all perfect.  The track maintains this lovely melody throughout and then it picks up and takes you up, but just as it does, it settles you back down.  Everything seems timed so precisely.  It is a very good track and even of you don't buy the album (which you should do), at least get this track.  You won't regret it.Hard day (2/5): I could handle the track once, and I don't mind it.  Two times though?  As I said, good song to shuffle in a playlist, but in this album it just gets repetitive and awkward because it just doesn't fit with the rest of the tracks well.  It isn't a bad remix though there are not many differences from the original.I want your sex (part 3) (4/5): It wasn't a bad way to end the album.  It is more subtle and sensual than parts 1 and 2.  Its actually a pretty good track.  Its also good that parts 1&2 and 3 were separated because it could have gotten very boring, but they avoided the problem well.Overall, it is a great album.  I really enjoy it, and I recommend it to anyone who likes pop/soul music.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsExcelent music from a MOST EXCELLENT MUSICIANBy&quot;Lonesome George&quot; Andrewson May 15, 2011Format: Audio CD|Verified PurchaseFaithHello again from the licensed radio on-air personality.. This time I want to tell you about a most excellent music CDalbum "FAITH" by George Michael. I bought the CD as soon as I saw it in the store. [I know the clerks got tired of measking, "When will it be out? When will you have it? When can I buy it here?"]I was living in Las Vegas the first time I heard this music and I instantly connected to it all. Listening to it over,and over; I'm amazed some of my friends and family didn't kick me out of the house. (Actually, I think they liked italso.) And because I had it, they didn't have to buy it.I believe most of these songs {if not all of them} are also on the "Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. George Michael" DOUBLE CDalbum it you want to get a wider assortment of George Michael's music. I know it's got a few extra songs I'd like tohave on this one.Anyway, whether you're a George Michael fan; or just want some good relaxing music, this album is for you. It's espec-ially nice on those HOT SUMMER nights when the sun is setting, and you're having a drink on the patio or deck and youwant some good music to go with the mood of the ending day; THIS IS MOST DEFINITELY IT!!.. Take a sample listen; thenBUY IT....."Lonesome George" AndrewsRead more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsFive StarsByCarla D.on March 9, 2017Format: Audio CD|Verified PurchaseLove me some George 💕Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseSee all verified purchase reviews (newest first)Write a customer review

Review Of George Michael 12 Minute Conditioner
Karen Marie Shelton Date: 5/18/1999
Introduction When it comes to George Michael's (GM) hair care           products, my hair has a very long memory. The GM products were the very first            that I used for the specific care and           feeding of my budding long hair. (Photo: Jeff Hines,            Hairboutique.com, all rights reserved)                       A little history would probably help. In 1988 I made my way to a long hair specialist in           Dallas, Texas for help growing my over-processed, totally damaged,           broken hair.  The specialist had studied with the great long hair           expert, George Michael, in his           original New York shop.  My specialist insisted that I buy and use all of           the GM hair care products.            At that particular time the only GM products that were           available for "at home use" was the orange colored cream shampoo, the pink cream rinse           and the 12 Minute Conditioner.            I was a very obedient long hair client.  I faithfully used the GM           products for almost two years.  I have to confess, even though I           might get lynched by true blue GM fans, the results were           less than wonderful for my hair. (Yes, I know, everyone's hair is           different and everyone's hair will react differently.)  The product was           just not the best for my hair.            Even though I had disappointing           results,  I continued to use the products religiously at the           urging of my Dallas long hair consultant.             Continued below ↓

Switching           From George Michael            
						 After two years had passed I decided that the GM products were just not working for me or my hair.  I tried           several other products including Bain de Terre, Giovanni and           Biolage.  They all worked OK for awhile.  The key was           that I felt they were better than the GM products for my hair.            Eventually I discovered Aveda to the great joy of my           hair. Immediately I became a devout Aveda fan           and never looked back.              I tucked my abandoned half empty bottles of           the GM orange shampoo and pink cream rinse under my sink           where it sat for years nestled next to the 12 Minute Conditioner.           Although I never again used the products, I am not exactly sure why I           kept them.  Maybe I felt guilty throwing away GM products or           maybe I just loved the picture of the longed hair lady on the outside           of the bottle.            I was always fond of the GM orange and pink hair           product colors.  The orange cream shampoo reminded me of my           favorite orangesicle ice cream treats that I enjoyed as a child.            The pink cream rinse reminded me of those bright pink spongy hair           rollers that are now mostly gone from the planet.            Years went buy and GM products became just a distant           memory until a trip to New York City three years ago.           
Returning           To George Michael In 1997           
						 In 1997 I traveled to New York City on           one of my regular hair product buying trip.  As part of my hair pilgrimage I found my way to the           original George Michael salon on Madison Avenue.                       Although the           shop was still fully operational, George was long gone, having sold his           business to his partner, Maria. (Photo: Jeff Hines,            Hairboutique.com, all rights reserved)             During my visit I decided that it was only fitting           that I again purchase a bottle of the orange shampoo, the pink cream rinse           and the 12 Minute Conditioner.            After all, I reasoned, products constantly           change.  I figured that the shampoo, cream rinse and conditioner           had certainly been overhauled since the last time I abandoned           them.   I had bright new visions of a great new George           Michael relationship.            It was not to be. The formulas, as far as I could           tell from comparing the new bottles with the old, was unchanged.            The effect on my very long hair, was also unchanged.            I tried for two weeks to get my hair to fall in love           with the GM products.  After two weeks of rebellious hair, I           again tucked the new 1997 versions under the bathroom sink next to the           original 80s GM bottles.  Yep, they were still there.            I tend to suffer from "pack-rat-itis".            Please don't get me wrong.  I have nothing but           the utmost respect for George Michael and his expertise for long hair.  My hair           just doesn't thrive under the GM products.            Year 2000 - Karen Retries George Michael's 12 Minute           Conditioner Maybe I am stubborn or maybe I am unwilling to give up on some           things.  Recently my dear friend Dave Tichnor from The           International Long Hair Club interviewed George Michael at his home in           the South.  Once again there was a stirring in my bones to try           the George Michael products. I had a good friend buy and ship me the 12 Minute Conditioner           along with a fresh new (2000 version) bottle of the cream shampoo and cream rinse. I           decided to give all three of the products another concentrated effort           with my hair. I had high hopes that I could get some great results with the 12           Minute Conditioner.  This product has always been touted to be a           deep conditioning formula designed to add new life to long hair. It is           designed to be used as either a pre-conditioner or as for a more           intensive 12 minute treatment.  I compared my three different jars of 12 Minute           Conditioner and alas, there appeared to be no change from the 80s           version to the 2000 version. Some people would say that if you find something           that works, don't change it.  Others would say that you need to           constantly refine and improve products. Coming from the engineering and software world I           tend to believe that a product can always be improved.  I admit           that is my own prejudice and may not be the best opinion on the           planet. It just work for me.
Salon Application of 12 Minute           Conditioner I have some interesting memories of my first every 12 Minute           Conditioning treatment. The very first time that my original long hair specialist applied           the 12 Minute Conditioner he followed a very specific and detailed           process.  In fact, I had to talk him into doing the conditioning           treatment in his salon.  He cautioned me that it took quite a long time           and was a very involved process. I bribed my long hair stylist with hot Chinese carryout.  That           softened him to the point where I was able to convince him to apply the George Michael           treatment. First he brushed all the tangles out of my hair and then washed my           hair with the George Michael orange colored cream shampoo.  He           applied two applications of the shampoo and then rinsed my hair with           warm water. After carefully towel blotting my hair, he picked all the knots out           very carefully.  After removing the knots and tangles he very           carefully separated my hair into approximately 2 inch sections and           applied a generous glob of the 12 Minute Conditioner from root to           end.  Then he pinned each section into a type of weird pin curl. He carefully applied a good blob of conditioner to every inch of my           hair being careful to avoid the scalp area. Once my entire head was heavily coated in the 12 Minute Conditioner           he put a special plastic cap on my hair and then added a special heat           retention cap on top of the plastic.  My duty at that point was           to sit under a hood dryer set on medium heat for one hour. When he told me that I had to sit still for one hour I           freaked.  I am not one to hang out and do nothing for more than           about 5 minutes. Even at Starbucks after 10 minutes I start fidgeting           and cleaning           off the surrounding tables. Since I really wanted to give this treatment a fair shot, I           controlled my antsiness for a solid hour while my hair           "baked" under the dryer.  
Initial Results When the timer went off, he removed all the pin curls.  Then           he washed my hair with the GM cream shampoo.  He applied a           generous amount of GM cream rinse, two full warm water rinses and a           final blast of artic cold water. After carefully detangling my hair, he rolled my hair in huge           spongy curlers.  I looked like an alien from a UFO.  Once           again I succumbed to a session under           the dryer.  My penance was 75 minutes while my hair           dried under a moderate heat. When I was finally finished, I had spent close to 3 1/2 hours in           the salon.  I was so stir crazy that I was loony tunes.   Did my hair look great?  Sort of.  It looked soft and very           shiny.  Was it worth almost 4 hours of treatment?  Absolutely not. Was it           worth the price I paid for the treatment ($75)?  Probably not. Don't get me wrong.  My long hair specialist spent a lot of           time on my hair.  I spent even more time on my rear end under a           dryer.   Did my stylist deserve the fee?  Yes, he did.  Was it           worth it for my hair.  Not really, in my opinion. I thought that           the Aveda conditioners (Cherry Almond Bark, Curessence) did a great           job on my hair and I accomplished similar results in just minutes, not           hours.
Using the 12 Minute Conditioner           At Home Since I tend to be outspoken, I told my long hair specialist, as           politely as I could, that I really didn't think the results were equal           to the time and money that I had spent.  Not that I was           complaining.  I just didn't think it was a good value. He understood my position and suggested that it would be best if I bought the GM           12 Minute Conditioner and tried a modified version of the treatment at home. When I applied the "at home" treatment, I got almost           identical results as my long hair stylist did at the salon.  I           again invested a lot of time under my home bonnet dryer.   By doing the treatment at home I saved time, money and           hassles.  I still did not think, in my opinion, that the condition of my hair           after the treatment was worth all the time that I spent. Yes, it did look soft, shiny and silky.  However, I was able           to achieve the same soft, shiny and silky look with other conditioners           that took a lot less time and trouble and did not require the bonnet           hairdryer.
The 2000 Version Of The 12 Minute Conditioner  I decided to re-create my original in-salon conditioning experience as closely as           possible when I recently cracked open a 2000 version of the GM 12           Minute Conditioner. I followed all the same steps.  I washed my hair with the GM           cream shampoo and then towel blotted my hair.  I carefully picked           all the knots out and applied the GM 12 Minute conditioner with my           fingers to 2 inch individual sections of my hair. After wrapping my           hair in plastic I plopped down under a hood dryer for 75           minutes.  I took my notebook computer and got quite a bit of work           done.  Luckily the dryer drowned out the sound of my cell phone           and any interruptions. I have to admit that I enjoyed 1 hour of peace, and not so much           quiet, to concentrate on business while my hair           "cooked".   I decided that hanging out under           hairdryers where I could have some quality work time was a nice new           business discovery. Unfortunately, I also decided that the 12 Minute Conditioner and my           hair were never going to be soul mates. Yes, my hair was soft and silky.  However, it was not any           softer or more silky than when I used Edwin Paul's Deep Conditioner, Aveda's           Curessence, or any of the Phytologie           deep conditioning products.  Actually, the GM comes in lower on           the softness scale compared to all the other products. When I used Aveda           or Phytologie or Edwin Paul I don't have to sit under a dryer           (using the dryer will intensify the results) for           any extended period of time.    Yes, I enjoyed the peace and quiet,           but I really can't give up that much time on a regular basis to           condition my hair under a hairdryer. 
Ingredients - 12 Minute           Conditioner The 12 Minute Conditioner always reminds me of Clariol's           Conditioner product.  The jars are similar is size and shape and           the conditioners are both a white waxy texture. I carefully compared the old bottles from under the sink with the           1997 and 2000 versions.  They were identical.  Same packaging, same           ingredients.  I have never figured out how to describe the aroma of the 12 Minute           Conditioner.  It actually smells waxy to me.  Almost like           Turtle wax for my car.  That is the closest I can come to           describing this product.
 The ingredients included:  Water, Glyceryl Stearate, Glycerine, Quaternium 70,           Quaternium 60, Myristal Myristate, C12-15 Alcohols Lactate, Quaternium           18, Cetyl Alcohol, Diethyl Amino Ethyl Stearate, Phosphoric Acid,           Hydroxy Ethyl Cellulose, Propylene Glycol, Diazolidinyl Urea,           Methylparaben, Propylparaben. Contains no artificial color or perfume. This cost of this product currently ranges from approximately           $15.95 - $17.95 (USD).  Tax may be an additional cost.

					Zanna,
I have never tried it, but once I use up what I have in my stash of products, I would be open to check it out. If you use them and get good results, let me know.
Your hair sure is purrdy

					I've been looking at them for awhile, but to be very honest they are a little expensive for me.  I don't like starting things that I can't continue. Good luck with his products, and please let us know how they work for you.

I agree. I'm cheap I just think there's other products that may be just as good. It couldn't have any ingredients thats not in anything else, right?

I don't think his products have any magic ingredients, but some products are more effective than others.  I'm curious to know if his products would be beneficial for my hair, but I won't be finding out anytime soon.  Gotta save those pennies.

					Dr. George Michael was known as the "King of Long Hair" and his products are famous everywhere in the Extremely long hair community. Unfortunately he died in 2009 at the age of 90 years old. But his products live on through the MADORA GEORGE MICHAEL SALON in New York City. The products are pricey and is the reason I have never tried them....

Thanks for the links!  

Interestingly, I found this e-how that breaks down his system.  Simply put his suggestions are right in alignment with much that we have learned here.  Moisture and gentle detangling are key.

					Just one other thing... JJJlonghair whose hair is almost floor length, uses his products and highly recommends them. You can read her haircare routine here: http://jjjlonghairphotopage.zoomshare.com/6.html

I talk to her sometimes on the floor length hair boards...

Candy828, I used to stalk JJJ. She's one of the extreme length chicks whose ends are not sickly thin.

Blondey McCoy on How Thames Is a Product of His Environment

                                “I can’t help but be inspired by what’s around me.”

Thames recently dropped its 2017 spring/summer lookbook, which founder Blondey McCoy used as not only a homage to fellow Brit George Michael but also as a continuation of his relationship with the city of London. McCoy recreated the Katharine Hamnett T-shirt that Michael wore in the music video for “Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go” to read “CHOOSE THAMES,” with all profits being donated to KAYANY charity, which helps Syrians who face conflict. Channeling this energy, the skater turned artist/designer sits down with Dazed Digital to talk about how the brand is a product of his environment and the importance of charity.
Check out some select excerpts below and read the full interview here. The first release will drop March 24 on the Thames website and at the London Palace store.
On what was on his mind during this design process:
I can’t help but be inspired by what’s around me. One of my favorite graphics in the line was inspired by the Raymond Revue Bar sign on the corner of Walkers Court and Brewer Street. Whenever I go on long trips I come back and see that and feel okay again. That’s my “Green Green grass of Home” (the Elvis version, not Tom Jones). I don’t need to be away from home to appreciate it. I’ve referenced Thames Television, an old franchise holder for a region of ITV, its end credits seem to haunt anyone that can remember it… Also pages of ‘smut’ from ’70s Men Only Mags, that Paul Raymond published. They’re from a time when British porn shoots had to be big doolally productions to disguise their obvious purpose in more prudish times. But yes, as I’ve said before, it’s almost all an homage to the square mile I spend my day wandering around in.
On “CHOOSE THAMES” and KAYANY:
George Michael and Wham! was and still is a constant source of inspiration for me. The T-shirt was originally set to be released with the autumn line, but after he passed at Christmas it seemed obvious to bring it forward, so the tees were screen printed last minute while I was in Los Angeles. The “Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go’” video, which he wears the Katharine Hamnett “CHOOSE LIFE” tee in is so brilliant. It’s after he gained a lot of confidence as a performer, but before he realized that fame and fortune weren’t the key to happiness and became a bit of a recluse and not really featuring in his solo videos like “Freedom ‘90’” and “Too Funky.” The way he is in “Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go” is so genuine – he had totally realized his talent as a singer by that point. He always looked back on it and said that the director never asked him to roll his eyes, or suggested any of his mannerisms or aesthetic, so he found it baffling that, despite him not holding back on being himself, people didn’t realist he was gay, even then. I get down when I think about how he is the most recent of my heroes to have died at such an early age, and after all the charities and individuals whom he anonymously donated to came forward, I woke up the other morning thinking it’s only right to donate the profits of this homage to a current and urgent cause. I don’t want to be making my living off his death, Thames is my passion project, not my money machine. I keep my money machine elsewhere.
On what’s important to him right now:
I did two charity sales and an art show last year for the charity Together for Mental Wellbeing which raised about 20k all-in-all. Unfortunately, there’s just so much to do and I’ve already wasted so much time… I really think you have to be shaking the tree from the word go. I see it as the duty of any influential person, be they an artist or musician or designer – whatever. You’re there to change people’s outlook on life, and in this case, I want to draw attention towards the very urgent matter of Syria. These children are eternally literally shaking from seeing their hometowns and families getting bombed. It’s an absolute tragedy, and it forces me to put my ten-times-a-year breakdowns into perspective. KAYANY have built schools in refugee camps, offering over three and a half thousand of these kids not just meals but psycho-social support, which they need now, not just whenever someone can get round to it. But there are so many of them. There’s too much to say here but please look at their site before you look at the Thames website.

George Michael\'s Secret for long hair

George Micheal is this popular long hair guru that has a system that promotes long hair. I haven't been able to find his actual secrets but there's a George Michael salon in New York called 'Madora' that uses his products and caters to women with long hair and those that want long hair. I was thinking..."gosh, I wish there was a salon in my area that catered to women who want long hair/have long hair and used his techniques". 

Surprise...There is one! Now I'm thinking maybe I should call to let these people know that I'm black before I walk up in there for my free consultation. I wonder if his techniques apply to 4a/b hair instead of just the type 1 hair. Do you guys know anymore information about his system and is it universal to all hair types?

Re: George Michael\'s Secret for long hair

Jennifer, 
The guy who trims (dusts) my hair is affiliated with the George Michael (GM) salon.  It's really not rocket science, he stresses you have to sacrifice style for length i.e. no bangs, layers, etc.  He thinks you should have your hair at one-length because according to the GM theory hair sheds more if you have varying lengths.  The GM treatment consists of deep conditioners that suposedly strengthen your, I think it's done twice a year.  I personally don't feel comfortable with him washing my hair so I just let him timr it.  I think I am his only AA client and his white clients have exteremely long hair.  My hair has collected a tremendous amount of growth since I have started going to him.  I can't give him all of the credit b/c I learned other things like from this website. His website discusses the "GM" philisophy. http://www.lovelonghair.com/news.htm

There is someone in the D.C. area that does the dusting trims if my memory serves me correctly she is in Northern Virginia. I never went to her but I did call her and she confirmed that she used the dusting technique.  Let me look around to see if I can find her number.

Re: George Michael\'s Secret for long hair

There's a salon in Atlanta that actually has an AA stylist. They recently hired her to cater to AA clientele. I thought about going there for a hot minute but I just don't feel comfortable letting anyone else touch my head (except my SIL).

Re: George Michael\'s Secret for long hair

Oh, Scasey how come you don't feel comfortable with letting him wash your hair? You only go to him for trims (dusting)? How often is that? Do you get the feeling that he is just as confident that you can achieve great lengths like his white clients?

Re: George Michael\'s Secret for long hair

Yeah it's called "George Michael's Secrets for Beautiful Hair".  I'm still looking up information and I'm getting more and more interested. I emailed the lady who uses his system in my area and if she has experience with AA hair then I will go for a consultation. I've never had a white person do my hair before so I'm going to drill her in the consultation.

[/ QUOTE ]

When I first met him as a result of an internet search in about 2001, he was telling me that there was an AA stylists in the building that could do my hair (that made me think he was clueless about styling my hair).  At the time I was very satisfied with my stylist except for the fact she used to overlap my perms and trim too much off my ends. Needless to say, I did not allow her to continue and I started going to him for trims whenever my hair gets ragedy looking, I guess I could say on average I go about 3-4 times a year.  After Supergirl's post about ends my feelings changed about getting them trimmed so often.  

I can't say if he thought that I could acheive the same lengths as his white clients b/c the last time I went he asked me if this was all my hair.  I was thinking no I am going to pay you $30 to cut some weave.  

As for the girl in D.C., I was moving to D.C. and lined up stylists and found the lady in Woodbridge.  I eventually did not move so I never went to her. Let me know how your visit goes.

Re: George Michael\'s Secret for long hair

Ok the lady in my area emailed me back and this is what she wrote:

Jennifer,
I have two example to share with you, both African American, hair touching shoulders.
Client 1- has been alternating relaxers and treatments for over three years although length is not what she is after she loves the condition her hair feels after a treatment.
Client 2- has been having treatments every three months, for two years. She is going for length, and has notice her hair becoming healthier, easier to manage, less breakage, and longer. 

The one hour treatment puts moisture into each strand of hair. Of course I believe in the treatment. It certainly wouldn't hurt to give it a try.

Give me a call when your ready, 703-494-5445. Remember the whole Treatment takes about 3 to 4 hours. Shampoo, One Hour Treatment, Set to dry, Trim, price $50.00.
Also consider trying GM's products, especial the 12 min conditioner to be used at home.

Look forward to speaking to you,
Catherine
---------------------------------------

Ok, $50 isn't bad, but I'm not feeling her two examples. Why is it that client #2 has been doing treatments for 2 years and is only has shoulder length hair?

Re: George Michael\'s Secret for long hair

Jennifer,
Thanks so much for adding this. I live in Rosslyn and am in desperate need of a trim. By the way, for Client 2, she does not list the length. I would hope the client has hair longer than shoulder length after 2 years, though!

Re: George Michael\'s Secret for long hair

She said "I have two example to share with you, both African American, hair touching shoulders". I'm like you, I hope this lady doesn't have hair touching shoulders after two years, but it seems as so.

I'm still interested though because $50 for a 3-4 hour treatment--that's not bad.

					There were 5 reviews and everybody else loved the book. I pulled this one out because it included a lot more detail about the contents than the positives ones. I'm not trying to be a naysayer. 


10 of 14 people found the following review helpful:
 He Won't Tell His Secrets, August 6, 2001
Reviewer:Anne G. Risa "Anne Risa" (Pittsburgh, PA) - See all my reviews
I have 37 inches of shiny, healthy hair, and this book was very little use to me. Although the book is easy to read, I believe many of the ideas could actually be harmful to your hair (There are whole chapters on bleaching and permanents.) There is some very basic, common sense advice in the book (eat right, keep the sun off of your hair)but they are lost in a sea of pseudo-science and anecdotes. The author dresses-up his opinions with scientific sounding jargon, but does not present real evidence to justify his claims. He continually refers to his "training as a medical doctor in Russia," but he is not a doctor. Not that doctors really know anything about long hair-care, anyway. He tells a lot of long-winded stories to support his claims: "Try this 'laboratory' test yourself...take a poodle dog, and shave one leg...He will begin to drop the hair on the other leg." (p 121) As a dog groomer with 8 years experience, I consider this a rediculous assertion. He also does a lot of self-aggrandizing name-dropping, and the majority of the long hair photos in the book are credited to Clarol Incorporated, not George Michael. The sections on styling don't really help you to control your hair, although they may give you some ideas if you already know how to style your hair. In sum, although it was easy to read, this book was really a waste of time.

					I found some of george michael's hair secrets online:

Exclusive Interview With Dr. George Michael   By Jennifer Bahney
http://www.longhairlovers.com/gm_interview.html

While talking with long hair guru Dr. George Michael by phone from his home in Florida, I found that it was important to understand the man first before trying to understand his passion for long hair.
George Michael Selisky was born to Russian nobility long before Lenin, Stalin, and communism took over his beloved land. His mother was an opera singer with incredible floor-length hair.

As a child, he would watch his mother and his aunts brush out their magnificent manes and create intricate updos before entertaining in their extravagant halls. But, the Russian Revolution soon caught up with them and George's entire family was killed by the ruthless Stalin. Somehow, young George was the only one to escape.
George attended medical school and was drafted into the Russian Army. He moved up to lieutenant commander and then became a major at the age of 23. But George was captured by the Nazis during World War II and spent two years as a prisoner of war in a Nazi concentration camp.

The years 1943 to 1945 were some of the most difficult of young George's life. He watched beautiful European women with waist-length and longer hair forced into warehouses only to emerge with completely shaven heads. According to Dr. Michael, it was the Nazis way of "breaking" their prisoners and taking away their identities. But, Dr. Michael told me, the women still held their heads high, unwilling to succumb to the Nazi's attempts at humiliation.

American troops eventually freed George and he decided to move to the United States with just the clothes on his back. It was at this point that George Michael Selisky decided to drop his last name. He also decided to use his medical training to help women around the world grow the beautiful hair he had seen destroyed during the war.

Dr. Michael enrolled in beauty school and was told that as a doctor, he was much too overqualified to work on women's hair. He persisted, however, graduated, and rented two chairs at a New York City salon. He developed his own system, based on medical science, for growing and maintaining beautiful long hair. In time, he had made enough money to buy his own salon. Dr. Michael's empire has grown ever since and today, at the age of 81, he owns some 2,000 salons around the world dedicated to long hair.

One of the major questions I asked Dr. Michael during our phone conversation was, "Is it possible to have long, healthy hair in your 30s, 40s, 50s, and beyond?" His answer was a qualified "yes!", but he explained that there are conditions attached.
First of all, Dr. Michael explained that the most important step for growing the longest, healthiest hair possible is to have hair that's all one length. That means absolutely no bangs (or "fringe", to our European friends). Dr. Michael told me, "Bangs are like worms!", which I took to mean they're a pretty bad thing. Fortunately, he explained what he meant.

"Hair is not at its strongest with bangs or layers," Dr. Michael said. "Because humans are mammals, nature will try to equalize the hair by excessively shedding in order to even out all the shorter hairs. This creates an abnormal loss of hair which leads to unhealthy, straggly locks."

Dr. Michael also explained that people, especially women, with blunt-cut long hair have the strongest, healthiest hair possible.
"The longer the hair, the stronger the root," Dr. Michael said. "That's because the root has to work more to support the length. And stronger hair is healthier hair that falls out less."

To prove this point, Dr. Michael says hair that's cut in a 4-inch style may lose up to 87 hairs a day; hair that's 12-inches long loses up to 26 hairs a day; waist-length hair loses 16 hairs a day, and floor-length hair loses just two hairs a day.

As far as growing hair faster, Dr. Michael says, "Hair typically grows just 6 inches per year. I know of just three places in the world where women grow more than half-an-inch per month: Tehuantepec, Mexico; the Piedmont Province of northern Italy, and in parts of Minnesota. Those areas lack iodine in the water, which causes severe thyroid dysfunctions including bulging eyes and horrible weight gain. But, their hair is known to grow up to 6 inches per month."

They also shed their hair 60 times during their lifetime, as opposed to healthy people who shed most during six periods in our lifetimes: from birth to age three; at 10, 22, 26, 36, and 54. These "shedding times" are all related to hormonal changes in our bodies and are the body's way of ensuring a six-inch growth rate per year; no more, no less.

So, how does one go about growing out those pesky bangs?
"The hair grows from left to right on your forehead. Part your hair on the left as your bangs grow out. Once they're long enough, part your hair on the right so your hair does 'push-ups' and doesn't appear flat. Once your bangs reach chin-length, you'll notice a serious reduction in fall-out."

As for my question about long hair and age, Dr. Michael told me, "Age is irrelevant. With long hair, a woman's beauty is timeless."

					A Visit With Dr. George Michael By Jennifer Bahney

http://www.longhairlovers.com/gmvisit.html


After many phone conversations with Dr. George Michael, the premiere long hair guru in the world, I had the honor of being invited to his home in West Palm Beach, Florida to discuss all things having to do with long hair.

The walls in Dr. Michael's office are filled with photographs of some of the most incredible long-haired beauties in the world -- all of them his clients.

They included singer Crystal Gayle, Playboy Playmate Debra Jo Fondren, Guinness Book of World Records holder Dianne Witt, and countless models, actresses, and European nobles. Model-of-the moment Giselle Bundchen was also featured - she regularly visits the George Michael Salon in Beverly Hills.

I was extremely fortunate to have Dr. Michael give me my own one-hour consultation, during which he explained the principles of his system. It was all very scientific, yet Dr. Michael explained it in language that anyone could understand. Some of his most interesting points were: We inherit our hair from our father's mother and our mother's father.

Hair becomes "adult" when we reach age 10.
Women go through three major stages of hair loss that coincide with stages of menopause at ages 26, 36, and 54.
Most women can grow their hair to tailbone length with proper care.
Dr. Michael then sent me off to prepare my hair for a 12-minute conditioning. I first applied a little of his conditioner to the outside of my hair to balance the pH-factor. Dr. Michael explained that pH is the measure used to determine the amount of acid and alkiline in hair. (Water's pH is 7). He also explained that I should always use a spoon or spatula to scoop the creamy conditioner out of the container to prevent bacteria from tainting the unused product. Once I had about a teaspoon of conditioner smoothed on the outside layer of my hair, Dr. Michael instructed me to wash and rinse twice with his Cream Shampoo. He then showed me how to apply the 12-minute Conditioner to my damp hair from the length at my shoulders down to the tips.

True to its name, the conditioner sat on my hair for 12 minutes. Dr. Michael did not apply heat, explaining that it wasn't necessary for the 12-minute conditioning. Although he wouldn't tell me the ingredients in the conditioner, he did say that it contained special proteins that "filled in" any gaps in the hair shaft, making it smooth and silky.

After the 12 minutes were up, I rinsed my hair thoroughly and was ready to be combed out. Dr. Michael used a wide-tooth comb that literally slid through my hair. I found this amazing since I usually have to apply detangler right after washing. But the 12-minute conditioner had done its job so well that none was needed.

Dr. Michael then roller set my hair and applied a hair net to secure it.

I sat under a professional dryer that Dr. Michael explained got no hotter than 108 degrees... the perfect temperature for drying long hair. It took about an hour and a half to fully dry my mid-back length hair this way.

After removing the rollers, Dr. Michael had me flip my head upside down to brush 50 strokes from the nape of my neck to the tips. I was to follow each stroke with my other hand to prevent static from building. Dr. Michael explained that I should brush my hair this way each morning right when I got up to get the circulation properly moving to my scalp, which promotes hair growth.

Next, Dr. Michael assessed my cut. He considered it too "blunt", or straight, across the bottom and explained how tapering the cut like a half-circle was best for hair growth. He left the middle part of my hair its full 25 inches and tapered the sides to achieve the roundness.

When he was finished, my hair felt incredibly silky and swung beautifully when I shook my head.

Some of Dr. Michael's tips for my hair growth, which can be applied to most anyone include:

 0. Don't wash hair every day. Think of hair like a piece of fine silk that begins to fade after repeated washing. In addition, overwashing hair can actually make it greasier.

 0. Properly brushing hair every morning will distribute the scalp's sebum to the thirsty ends.

 0. Don't color long hair - it's very damaging and should be avoided if possible. Surprisingly, highlights are much better for long hair since only the roots are touched up each time.

 0. Use only a boar bristle brush with a wooden base. Dr. Michael explained that natural materials are least likely to cause hair damage.

					his ideas sound great, especially the layers theory.

but its all down to the inside of your body. it has to be in TIP TOP form to get ultimate growth. i'm lazy and east junk, but take vitamins...my hair grows 1/2-1inch per month (now its longer, its grows slower)...so imagine if i was eating great food, being fit AND taking vits....ultimate growth.

					Dr. George Michael's Method of Long Hair Care
http://www.longhairlovers.com/george_michael.html

 Dr. George Michael was a plastic surgeon who developed products and a special process for caring for long hair. He is considered the "guru" of long hair care, and his clients have included famous long-haired beauties such as Crystal Gayle.

Hair Washing Tips:
One doesn't lose hair through washing, but rather through friction and tangling.

With shorter hair, how one massages the scalp is not so important. You can move your fingers back and forth, zigzag, in circles, figure eights or sideways -- it doesn't matter because it hardly tangles. In contrast, long hair gets tangled when the scalp is massaged in circles or zigzag lines. By trying to untangle, it tears or falls out completely.

1. The best place to wash your hair is in the shower. Although some women prefer the wash basin or more especially, bending over the bathtub.

2. Stand bent over with your head tucked downwards. This relaxes the scalp and promotes blood circulation. If your head is higher than your elbows, the muscles in your scalp may cramp up. Try it yourself to see the difference.

3. All the dirt and oil particles should be expelled during the first shampoo, which serves as the purification of the hair. During the SECOND shampoo the scalp should be massaged and NOT THE HAIR!

4. For the correct massage, begin at the hairline and work towards the top massaging the scalp. Keep your hands beneath your hair and move them back and forth. Donâ€™t use your hair as a scrub brush. When youâ€™re finished massaging the scalp, shampoo the rest of your hair to the ends. Treat it like silk and try to avoid knots.

5. Finally, rinse out your hair thoroughly with warm water. If any of the bubbles remain, the hair will be dull and sticky. Feel the hair after cleansing and make sure the slightest trace of shampoo canâ€™t be found.

6. If you can stand it, rinse hair in cold water. This allows the hair molecules to shrink and carries away all unnecessary layers. The hair will be easier to comb.

7. Pour a dab of rinse into your palm and apply with strokes to the length of your hair. Then rinse once more but with lukewarm water.

8. When you step out of the shower, use a hand towel to get rid of excess water.

9. Try to comb through the hair with your fingers, as long as it remains wet. Never brush when wet. Hair has a certain elasticity and can stretch fron 1/8 to 1/6 of its original length. Luckily the hair normalizes itself when dry. When wet, it behaves like an over stretched rubber band and breaks. Use instead a wide-toothed tortoise shell comb to untangled and smooth out your hair.

10. Part the hair in small sections and begin 5cm above the ends to comb it out. When the entire lower section is untangled, go approximately 20cm up from the bottom and comb the hair in narrow strands through to the underside. Continue until you reach the scalp and all is tangle-free.

There are four different washing methods for you to use at different times and for different types of hair.

WASHING METHOD #1 _A METHOD FOR MEDIUM TO BRA LENGTH HAIR WASHING THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF HAIR (no more than twice a week) ORDER: (A) shampoo, (B) cream rinse

(A) Wet hair with warm water. Apply shampoo and swoosh around the hair on the first lather. Rinse with warm water. Apply shampoo a second time and massage scalp. Avoid rigorous scrubbing. Gently wash the hair from the scalp down using re-grasping motions to avoid tangling. Rinse well until no suds appear in the water.

(B) Apply Madora George Michael Cream Rinse to the outer layers and ends only. Rinse well - you may want to finish with a final cold rinse to add additional shine to your hair.

WASHING METHOD #2 _A METHOD FOR VERY LONG HAIR WASHING THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF HAIR (no more than once a week)

ORDER: _(A) "Pre-wash conditioner": While your hair is still dry, take _ tablespoon of 12 Minute Conditioner. Apply conditioner to the ends and the top layer of your hair. Be sure only these trouble areas are well-coated. At this time, do not apply "pre-wash conditioner" to your scalp or the remaining area of hair, wash hair immediately.

(B) Shampoo: After applying our "pre-wash conditioner", wet your hair and apply a tablespoon of shampoo until a rich lather develops. Remember to wash the ends of your hair as well as your scalp. Rinse and always shampoo again. The first wash removes superficial dirt and oils; the second deep cleans.

(C) Cream Rinse: Use Madora George Michael Creme Rinse after you condition and shampoo. Pour one teaspoon into your hand and apply only to the ends of your hair and halfway up the hair's shaft.

THEN: _Rinse, rinse, and rinse! See those tiny bubbles at the drain? Rinse until they are reduced to just a few.

Finish with a cold water rinse. Cold water eliminates residue, closes scalp pores, and reduces the stretch in the hair created by hot water.

					WASHING METHOD #3 _12 MINUTE CONDITIONING (two to four times a month)

ORDER: _(A) Shampoo: Wet your hair and apply a tablespoon of shampoo until a rich lather develops. Remember to wash the ends of your hair as well as your scalp. Rinse and always shampoo again. The first wash removes superficial dirt and oils; the second deep cleans. Towel dry excess water.

(B) Condition: Apply one tablespoon of conditioner to entire head and leave on twelve minutes. Rinse well. The 12 Minute Conditioner will work well at room temperature.

(C) Cream Rinse: Pour one teaspoon into your hand. Apply only to the ends of your hair and half way up the hairâ€™s shaft, not on the scalp. Rinse well.

WASHING METHOD #4 _WASH SCALP ONLY
(Every day or every other day, in between regular shampoos which should be once a week)

Many of us wash our hair daily. However, shampooing once a week is best for the delicate ends of the hair. The solution is to wash the scalp daily or every two days in between. The three methods listed below will keep your hair clean and fresh smelling while protecting the ends.

(A) Have a friend hold up the ends of your hair. While bending over the sink, wash and rinse your scalp only. Then gently pat the wet portion of your hair dry with a towel.

(B) With one hand hold the ends of your hair away from the water. Wash and rinse your scalp with your other hand. Then gently towel dry your hair.

(C) Loosely pull your hair back into a braid at the nape of your neck and secure well. Bend over the sink and wash and rinse your scalp only. Towel off, and you have clean hair!

Always be sure to rinse well. Any residue will collect oil and dirt faster. When washing the scalp only, the Madora George Michael "pre - wash conditioner" and the Madora George Michael Cream Rinse are not necessary.

IF AND WHEN YOUR SHAMPOO STOPS WORKING.....
and they all eventually do, build up will occur. Use the Blue Shampoo which acts as a stripper of build up and yet remains gentle to the hair. Use it when you start to notice that the Cream Shampoo is less effective. Two washings with the Blue Shampoo should be sufficient, and then go back to the Cream Shampoo. Be sure to use the pre - wash conditioner on the ends and outer layer of hair when using the Blue Shampoo. Sometimes when you feel you still have residues left use three sudsings.

DRYING YOUR HAIR
Air-drying is always best. If you would rather dry your hair artificially, first set your hair with plastic rollers. Then sit under a hood dryer. To prevent damage to your hair, keep the dryer at a constant temperature (about 42 degrees centigrade or 108 degrees Fahrenheit).

Another gentle way to artificially dry your hair is to attach a diffuser to your blow dryer. This device spreads the hot air evenly, making the heat far less intense. If you would like to air dry your hair without getting the "frizzles" wait until your hair is 95% dry and then roll it on curlers. Apply a hairnet and dry your hair completely under a hair dryer - the warmth of the dryer will smooth out the hair. Depending on the richness of your hair it will take 15 - 30 minutes. You'll be surprised at the results. Never use heated rollers or curling tongs. These devices dry and break long hair. If you must blow dry use a diffuser. Dry roots first then dry lengths with gentle temperature. Once your hair is dry, you may brush it to a glorious shine.

BRUSHING
For a healthy head of beautiful hair you must treat, nourish, strengthen and stimulate the living part of the hair - the root. Brushing is an essential part of hair treatment. It keeps the scalp supple and accelerates the blood circulation which feeds the roots and distributes needed fatty acids along the length of the hair, assuring smoother combing without breaking, since lubricants also serve as moisturizers. We advise our clients to brush their hair as soon as they get up in the morning and only to use a natural bristle with a wooden base.

WHY BRUSH IN THE MORNING?
Brushing stimulates the circulation to the scalp and fluffs the hair. Don't think for a minute that this will make your hair more oily. Brushing actually distributes the oils to the ends of your hair. Which in turn is a natural protection for the hair against weather conditions and other stressful occurrences.

NEVER BRUSH WET HAIR!
Hair is more elastic when wet than when dry, and it will stretch when wet to the point of snapping if you use a brush. Instead use a wide tooth tortoise - shell comb. Start with the ends and slowly work your way up to the scalp. Never use a metal or rubber comb.

USE A NATURAL BRISTLE BRUSH WITH A WOODEN BASE
The natural bristles are closest to the hair structure itself, and therefore are less likely to produce tangles on long hair. The wooden base reduces static electricity.

METHOD
Stand with feet slightly apart and bend down from the waist until the hair falls in a curtain before your face. Brush your hair gently, starting from the roots at the nape of your neck and moving toward the end of the hair Follow each brush stroke with the open palm of your other hand. (This counteracts a build - up of static electricity). Start the first day with 20 brush strokes. Then, add 10 strokes each day. For oily condition or fine hair start with 10 strokes. Then add 5 strokes each day. Your goal: fifty brush strokes a day. Remember that morning brushing produces the best results!

					PARTING THE HAIR
You probably part your hair on the left side or use a center part. We suggest that you part your hair on the right side. Hair follicles along the forehead grow from the left to the right. A right side part adds height and has your hair doing "push-ups". The middle part is definitely out. It puts additional stress on the weakest hairs on the top of the head, which results in hair thinning and the part spreading wider.

A center part forms a line that goes down the middle of the face, which accentuates the nose and any irregularities that exist between the left and the right side of the face. There are only a very, very few people in the entire world who literally look good with a center part.

Re: George Michael\'s Secret for long hair

Seriously, it is probably so simple you do not need to pay anyone for it.

George Micheal is this popular long hair guru that has a system that promotes long hair. I haven't been able to find his actual secrets but there's a George Michael salon in New York called 'Madora' that uses his products and caters to women with long hair and those that want long hair. I was thinking..."gosh, I wish there was a salon in my area that catered to women who want long hair/have long hair and used his techniques". 

Surprise...There is one! Now I'm thinking maybe I should call to let these people know that I'm black before I walk up in there for my free consultation. I wonder if his techniques apply to 4a/b hair instead of just the type 1 hair. Do you guys know anymore information about his system and is it universal to all hair types?Click to expand...
