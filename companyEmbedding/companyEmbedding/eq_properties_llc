Within a day of administering a syringe of GastroEase Rescue, his manure was firmer and he seemed less uncomfortable over all. I like to keep a few tubes on hand around the barn for those inevitable "is he feeling okay?" days when something seems not quite right about a horse's intestinal comfort. Horse people know what I'm talking about! Great product.Page 1 of 6: « ‹ 123› »

Administration

Suggested Use
 
GastroEase Rescue Paste
Preventative use: Feed 30cc (one half oral syringe) to 60cc (one full oral syringe) per day during stressful situations. Ideal to administer while tacking up before performance or training. For horses in gastric distress: Feed 60cc immediately. Repeat in 90 minutes if condition persists. All horses in gastric distress should receive prompt veterinary attention. Flows best at room temperature. GastroEase EQ is also available in powder form.
 
Tips for Best Results
GastroEase EQ is great to use alongside UlcerGard and GastroGard (medications that your vet may prescribe). GastroEase EQ may be used continually afterwards to maintain digestive support.
 

Ingredients 


Active Ingredients
Ingredients in Detail
 
￼￼Probiotics
Aspergillus Niger Probiotic bacterium complex that provides lipase, a digestive enzyme that works in a broad spec- trum of gastro intestinal pH to enhance efficient digestion or nutrients.
E. Faecium Probiotic that enhances efficient digestion of nutrients and controls diarrhea
E. Lactis Probiotic that is part of the bacteria flora in the gut that digests protein. High levels of E. Lactis are protec- tive against E. Coli colonization.
Aspergillus Oryzae Enhances flora and provides enzymes to increase digestive efficiency.
Bacillus Subtillus Enhances flora and provides enzymes to increase digestive efficiency.
Lactobacillus Acidophilus Synthesizes hydrogen peroxide and suppresses the growth of pathogens in the gut.
 
Prebiotics
FOS Inulin Fructo oligosaccharide: prebiotic nondigestible ingredient that enhances the growth of healthy gut flora. Prebiotics are destructive to pathogens that set up in the gut.
MOS Mannan oligosaccharide (MOS) a prebiotic, effective in controlling the growth of harmful bacteria in the gut. Pathogens bind with MOS instead of the mucous membrane, and are excreted from the digestive system along with toxins they would have produced. MOS can be digested by the enzymes of certain beneficial bacteria, so in addition to discouraging harmful bacteria, MOS also improves the growth of beneficial bacteria. MOS is also an immunostim- ulant. Some animal studies suggest it improves digestion and absorption of nutrients.
 
Hindgut Specific
Leucine Amino Acid
Pancrealipase Pancreatic enzymes that are specific for digestion of certain foodstuffs. Cuts down hind gut inflammation and enhances digestion of food particles.
Phenylalanine Amino acid
Psyllium Fiber Lengthens the time of exposure of the ingesta to tissues and makes digestion more efficient.
Threonine An important amino acid that assists nutrient absorption and metabolism, and aids function of the GI tract.
Live Yeast (including Lactobacillus Acidophilus, Enterococcus Lactis, Enterococcus Faecium, Saccharomyces Boulardii) 34.4 billion CFU – a very aggressive level of organisms that will maintain and restore hind gut flora. The yeast population in GastroEase EQ will help restore both stomach and hind gut health.
 
Healing Agents
Alanine Amino Acid that supports gastric tissue regeneration and healing.
Arginine An Amino Acid that aids in tissue regeneration and healing.
Inositol B Vitamin that is a cell signaler to aid communication of cells in promoting tissue healing.
Isolecine Leucine Helpful in hemoglobin synthesis: tissue recovery.
L-Glutamine An amino acid that is key in regenerating damaged mucosal tissue.
L-Lysine Amino Acid that aids in healing gastric lesions.
Proline An important amino acid in the rebuilding of damaged tissue, Proline is one of the building blocks of collagen, the main constituent of connective tissue and mucosa.
Choline A chemical with similar properties to a B Vitamin; precursor to acetylcholine; enhances communication between cells to promote healing.
Cystine An amino acid that is essential in formation of healthy gastric tissue healing.
Glycine Glycine is essential for a healthy, normally functioning digestive system. It helps regulate the synthesis of the bile acid used to digest fats and is beneficial in protecting and repairing gastric mucosa. Glycine also makes the stomach more alkaline and lowers the stomach acid.
Hydrolyzed Collagen Digestive tissue is supported by collagen molecules.
Hydrolyzed collagen is more easily absorbed, and supports and repairs gastric mucosal lining.
Silica Mineral that is essential in tissue regrowth and Ulcer regeneration.
Valine An amino acid that is essential for repair and growth of tissue.
 
Buffering Agents
Calcium A Buffering Agent to help regulate stomach pH.
Phosphorus Mineral that aids buffering of stomach acid.
Magnesium Buffering Agent to help reduce acidity in stomach.
Tyrosine An Amino Acid helpful in managing the symptoms of stress.
Gamma Oryzanol Rich in antioxidant compounds derived from rice bran oil.
 
Soothing and Comforting Agents
DGL Deglycyrrhizinated Licorice Relieves discomfort and inflammation related to gastric ulcers.
Quercetin Phyto Chemical (found in onions and garlic) that is useful in promoting anti-inflammatory and healing effects in gastric ulcers.
Methyl Methionine Sulfonium Chloride from brassica oleracea italica Also known as Vitamin U: Provides quick acting anti-inflammatory and pain relieving effects. Human studies confirm relief in hours.
Sodium Copper Chlorophyllin Effective in helping to heal ulcerations and inflammations.
 

FAQ 

Frequently Asked Questions 
Q: Is GastroEase EQ a replacement for UlcerGard or GastroGard?
A: No. UlcerGard and GastroGard are Proton Pump Inhibitors that reduce the production of stomach acid, prescribed by a vet for a specific condition. They create an environment where ulcers can begin to heal. GastroEase EQ supports the healing process and maintains peak digestive function during and after the administration of omeprazole.
 
Q: Should my horse stay on GastroEase EQ all the time or only when he needs it?
A: GastroEase EQ will help support the digestive condition of every horse and may be used continually. GastroEase Rescue paste is great to keep on hand in case of gastric distress. You may choose to use GastroEase EQ intermittently, but most horse owners who start their horses on GastroEase EQ see such great improvement that they continue feeding it daily.
 
Q: Does GastroEase contain any prohibited substances?
A: As leaders in the management and preparation of top performance horses, we create the most effective formulas while avoiding all prohibited substances.

"Her condition has dramatically improved since making the switch, and she will be maintained on GastroEase from now on."

"I’m managing a mare that had been used to lots of turnout. Now that she is stabled and in work, I’ve been struggling to manage her gut. Probios was working okay, but I was recommended GastroEase as a more complete solution and decided to see if it would make a difference. Her condition has dramatically improved since making the switch, and she will be maintained on GastroEase from now on. I’m very impressed!"

Kelly Gage
Team EnGaged Dressage




"It has proved to be very helpful to my horse's gut with all the traveling and showing we have been doing."

"I wanted to write you a thank you for the tub of GastroEase EQ you sent me. It has proved to be very helpful to my horse's gut with all the traveling and showing we have been doing. I have seen a change in his demeanor at shows. He is much calmer and more like the horse I usually have while at home."

Elizabeth Huntley




"I saw improvement within days...three months later his back is great, his topline is contoured, his coat is gorgeous, his eyes are bright, and he's lively and playful."

"Two Sox is a 10 year old range-born American Mustang who roamed free until he was five; he is a great horse who is easy going and loves to please. He adapted to stall living and had no obvious GI symptoms for a long time. Then his back developed spasms to the point he could barely walk downhill; changing saddles, time off from riding, changing feed and treating for muscle and skeletal issues had no effect on the hind end spasms. After identifying the GI situation and medicating with good results, I needed a continuing GI supplement; GastroEase is the only product I found that specifically mentioned relieving back pain, and is the only one I came across that has oat glucan, which I knew to be an effective healing ingredient. Soxi tried eating it from the container and licked it from my hand. I saw improvement within days, and steady results over the next month; three months later his back is great, his topline is contoured, his coat is gorgeous, his eyes are bright, and he's lively and playful. GastroEase is keeping Soxi pain free and it's affordable; it's a great product and I recommend it all the time. "

"I attribute GastroEase Rescue with saving both us and our young horse a long night at the clinic."

"One of our young jumpers had an episode of colic brought on by dehydration even though we had been using electrolytes religiously. Having used every product made by Perfect Products, I put GastroEase Rescue to the test. Within thirty minutes of administration my young gelding was noticeably more comfortable and acting like himself. By the time the vet arrived he was only in need of a small dose of Banamine. I attribute GastroEase Rescue with saving both us and our young horse a long night at the clinic."

Christina Parker

"We started him on GastroEase and he immediately began gaining weight. We've continued to maintain him on GastroEase and now his body condition is great!"

"We have a hard keeper that would not keep weight on no matter what we tried. He was always on the thin side. We started him on GastroEase and he immediately began gaining weight. We've continued to maintain him on GastroEase and now his body condition is great! This product has made a world of a difference."

Anne Thornbury

"...once he was on GastroEase he now eats all of his grain, and begs for more!"

"GastroEase EQ has helped immensely with my horses. I have a horse who used to be a slow and picky eater, but once he was on GastroEase he now eats all of his grain, and begs for more! It is a great product for a competition horse that may have trouble eating in a high stress environment."

Lauren Knopp
Regalia Farm




"He's put loads of weight on and finally has a good appetite."

"My horse Ken, Kinnordy Rivaldo, has been on GastroEase EQ since December and has changed unbelievably. He's put loads of weight on and finally has a good appetite. His old groom saw him last weekend at an event and couldn't believe how good he looks and that he was actually eating on the lorry. She said he used to live on GastroGard and even then wouldn't eat!"

Tiana Coudray
Eventer




"They are eating well and maintaining their weight and muscle tone as well as feeling more at ease."

"I have put all of my competition horses on GastroEase and am very happy with the results. They are eating well and maintaining their weight and muscle tone as well as feeling more at ease. All of my horses are happy and content in their work. I would recommend this product to anyone who would like to alleviate the stress of travel and showing on the regular competition horse. I'm impressed with yet another great product from the team at Perfect Products! Thank you!"

Betsy Steiner

Lee McKeever

"Since he’s been on it, he’s gained weight, looks great and is riding better than ever."

"Traveling a great deal with a horse that has a history of GI problems can be a real challenge. A friend of mine saw the several products I was using to help my horse and suggested GastroEase EQ. Since he’s been on it, he’s gained weight, looks great and is riding better than ever. And we only have to pack one product! We’ve traveled everywhere from Illinois to Texas and he’s staying comfortable and performing great!"

Jennifer Buchanan

"GastroEase offers me an effective, inexpensive way to maintain my hard keepers."

"GastroEase offers me an effective, inexpensive way to maintain my hard keepers. I use and recommend it to my clients to manage the everyday gastro intestinal stresses caused by a demanding show schedule."

Chris Gillman

"Ten days on GastroEase turned both horses into great eaters, their attitudes have turned around and I am already seeing an improvement in condition."

"We are using GastroEase on 2 halter horses that we are fitting to show at the Congress and World Show. One had been on vet prescribed NSAIDS, and was acting depressed and not eating well. The second horse simply had no appetite. Ten days on GastroEase turned both horses into great eaters, their attitudes have turned around and I am already seeing an improvement in condition. We plan to continue to feed GastroEase to all our show horses."

Karen Johnson
Johnson Quarter Horses




"...we started her on GastroEase, and she has completely changed."

"My mare was frowny and ear pinny. Sometimes I really got discouraged because she was so nervous and hard to ride. We kind of knew she had ulcers, because she stayed thin no matter how much we fed her, but the cost of having our vet treat her was so high. Finally, 6 weeks ago we started her on GastroEase, and she has completely changed. She eats all her hay and feed, looks FAT, even over her withers and back, and she has become nicer. She keeps her head down and tries to do what I ask her to do when we are riding. We are keeping her on GastroEase every day."

Megan Hughes
Ohio State 4H Fair Winner




"Our customers appreciate the peace of mind of knowing that we are using a preventative to help minimize the chance of digestive upset and ulcers in their valuable horses."

"Send us enough GastroEase to keep our show horses on for Congress and the World Show. We have noticed an obvious improvement in attitude and condition in our show string. Our customers appreciate the peace of mind of knowing that we are using a preventative to help minimize the chance of digestive upset and ulcers in their valuable horses."

Curtis Reynolds

"GastroEase returned them to the feed tub, and their attitude and condition quickly improved."

"We had a few 2 year olds getting ready for the big futurities this summer. They stopped eating well and my vet said he thought they may have low grade ulcers. GastroEase returned them to the feed tub, and their attitude and condition quickly improved."

Tracy Willis
AQHA Judge and Western Pleasure Trainer




"...my difficult horse’s condition got better. Even my vet noticed the quick results."

"Thanks for suggesting GastroEase. We began using it with a few horses that had occasional diarrhea and we saw results begin in days. Not only that, but even my difficult horse’s condition got better. Even my vet noticed the quick results. We plan to feed it as a daily supplement. I think it will save us money in feed and vet visits."

Jill Knowles
Hidden Knoll Farm




"We feel a certain amount of comfort in knowing that our horses stomach health is being treated daily by a great product at a reasonable price."

"GastroEase is a wonderful product that we use daily for the gastrointestinal health of our horses. We feel a certain amount of comfort in knowing that our horses stomach health is being treated daily by a great product at a reasonable price."

"My horses with chronic GI sensitivity eat and maintain weight better with fewer signs of GI discomfort."

"Feeding GastroEase Daily Formula has proven to be a simple way to protect my show horses from the GI stress I know results from training and showing activities. Ulcers and colic can significantly interfere with our training and showing schedule. My horses with chronic GI sensitivity eat and maintain weight better with fewer signs of GI discomfort. I use and recommend GastroEase!"

Ashton Kiesner

"The obvious improvement in my ulcer suspect's attitude and condition was impressive."

"I tried GastroEase at a horse show. The obvious improvement in my ulcer suspect's attitude and condition was impressive. My vet is now recommending GastroEase to many of her clients and uses it on her own horses."

Christa Baldwin

"...since he has been on GastroEase EQ we haven’t had any problems at all, even with the change of seasons and temperature."

"My Belgian warmblood Vito was always a chronic mild colicker. But since he has been on GastroEase EQ we haven’t had any problems at all, even with the change of seasons and temperature. GastroEase is so great that most of my barn is using it now!"

Katie Sippel, DVM




"GastroEase has become our mainstay GI daily supplement and I couldn't be more pleased."

"GastroEase is much less expensive and effectively supports the complete digestive system."

"I used to use GastroGuard or UlcerGuard as part of my program until I discovered GastroEase. GastroEase is much less expensive and effectively supports the complete digestive system."

Leslie Emerson
Marigot Bay Farm




"...she not only had no symptoms, but she actually gained a little weight on the road."

"Tried GastroEase on a horse that always gets diarrhea when we haul her. By the time she gets home from a big circuit, she has usually lost weight and is exhausted. Took her to the Select World last month, and she not only had no symptoms, but she actually gained a little weight on the road. Now our vets are interested in GastroEase for some of their hard to manage horses."

Cathy Hanson 
Hanson Quarter Horses




    “...he still continued to have flare-ups with no apparent cause. After starting him on GastroEase EQ, the diarrhea quickly stopped...”

    "I have an older Congress and World Champion gelding who had on and off diarrhea for several years. I had veterinarians assess him and between prescribed meds and trying "many different supplements he still continued to have flare-ups with no apparent cause. After starting him on GastroEase the diarrhea quickly stopped and his stool returned to normal. Now, several months later, whether I'm riding at home or showing he's consistently comfortable and the diarrhea has not returned. I'm so excited to finally have found a solution with GastroEase!"

Lauren Kasnet




    "I highly recommend GastroEase EQ to all of my therapy clients, and I feed it to my own horses at home."

    "My practice includes a number of high-level west coast dressage and Grand Prix horses, including the stable of Steffen and Shannon Peters. I highly recommend GastroEase to all of my therapy clients, and I feed it to my own horses at home. I find that even long-term GI problems resolve quickly on a scoop or two daily."

Ingredients 


Active Ingredients
Ingredients in Detail
 
￼￼Probiotics
Aspergillus Niger Probiotic bacterium complex that provides lipase, a digestive enzyme that works in a broad spec- trum of gastro intestinal pH to enhance efficient digestion or nutrients.
E. Faecium Probiotic that enhances efficient digestion of nutrients and controls diarrhea
E. Lactis Probiotic that is part of the bacteria flora in the gut that digests protein. High levels of E. Lactis are protec- tive against E. Coli colonization.
Aspergillus Oryzae Enhances flora and provides enzymes to increase digestive efficiency.
Bacillus Subtillus Enhances flora and provides enzymes to increase digestive efficiency.
Lactobacillus Acidophilus Synthesizes hydrogen peroxide and suppresses the growth of pathogens in the gut.
 
Prebiotics
FOS Inulin Fructo oligosaccharide: prebiotic nondigestible ingredient that enhances the growth of healthy gut flora. Prebiotics are destructive to pathogens that set up in the gut.
MOS Mannan oligosaccharide (MOS) a prebiotic, effective in controlling the growth of harmful bacteria in the gut. Pathogens bind with MOS instead of the mucous membrane, and are excreted from the digestive system along with toxins they would have produced. MOS can be digested by the enzymes of certain beneficial bacteria, so in addition to discouraging harmful bacteria, MOS also improves the growth of beneficial bacteria. MOS is also an immunostim- ulant. Some animal studies suggest it improves digestion and absorption of nutrients.
 
Hindgut Specific
Leucine Amino Acid
Pancrealipase Pancreatic enzymes that are specific for digestion of certain foodstuffs. Cuts down hind gut inflammation and enhances digestion of food particles.
Phenylalanine Amino acid
Psyllium Fiber Lengthens the time of exposure of the ingesta to tissues and makes digestion more efficient.
Threonine An important amino acid that assists nutrient absorption and metabolism, and aids function of the GI tract.
Live Yeast (including Lactobacillus Acidophilus, Enterococcus Lactis, Enterococcus Faecium, Saccharomyces Boulardii) 34.4 billion CFU – a very aggressive level of organisms that will maintain and restore hind gut flora. The yeast population in GastroEase EQ will help restore both stomach and hind gut health.
 
Healing Agents
Alanine Amino Acid that supports gastric tissue regeneration and healing.
Arginine An Amino Acid that aids in tissue regeneration and healing.
Inositol B Vitamin that is a cell signaler to aid communication of cells in promoting tissue healing.
Isolecine Leucine Helpful in hemoglobin synthesis: tissue recovery.
L-Glutamine An amino acid that is key in regenerating damaged mucosal tissue.
L-Lysine Amino Acid that aids in healing gastric lesions.
Proline An important amino acid in the rebuilding of damaged tissue, Proline is one of the building blocks of collagen, the main constituent of connective tissue and mucosa.
Choline A chemical with similar properties to a B Vitamin; precursor to acetylcholine; enhances communication between cells to promote healing.
Cystine An amino acid that is essential in formation of healthy gastric tissue healing.
Glycine Glycine is essential for a healthy, normally functioning digestive system. It helps regulate the synthesis of the bile acid used to digest fats and is beneficial in protecting and repairing gastric mucosa. Glycine also makes the stomach more alkaline and lowers the stomach acid.
Hydrolyzed Collagen Digestive tissue is supported by collagen molecules.
Hydrolyzed collagen is more easily absorbed, and supports and repairs gastric mucosal lining.
Silica Mineral that is essential in tissue regrowth and Ulcer regeneration.
Valine An amino acid that is essential for repair and growth of tissue.
 
Buffering Agents
Calcium A Buffering Agent to help regulate stomach pH.
Phosphorus Mineral that aids buffering of stomach acid.
Magnesium Buffering Agent to help reduce acidity in stomach.
Tyrosine An Amino Acid helpful in managing the symptoms of stress.
Gamma Oryzanol Rich in antioxidant compounds derived from rice bran oil.
 
Soothing and Comforting Agents
DGL Deglycyrrhizinated Licorice Relieves discomfort and inflammation related to gastric ulcers.
Quercetin Phyto Chemical (found in onions and garlic) that is useful in promoting anti-inflammatory and healing effects in gastric ulcers.
Methyl Methionine Sulfonium Chloride from brassica oleracea italica Also known as Vitamin U: Provides quick acting anti-inflammatory and pain relieving effects. Human studies confirm relief in hours.
Sodium Copper Chlorophyllin Effective in helping to heal ulcerations and inflammations.
 

FAQ 

Frequently Asked Questions
 
Q: Is GastroEase EQ a replacement for UlcerGard or GastroGard?
A: No. UlcerGard and GastroGard are Proton Pump Inhibitors that reduce the production of stomach acid, prescribed by a vet for a specific condition. They create an environment where ulcers can begin to heal. GastroEase EQ supports the healing process and maintains peak digestive function during and after the administration of omeprazole.
 
Q: Should my horse stay on GastroEase EQ all the time or only when he needs it?
A: GastroEase EQ will help support the digestive condition of every horse and may be used continually. GastroEase Rescue paste is great to keep on hand in case of gastric distress. You may choose to use GastroEase EQ intermittently, but most horse owners who start their horses on GastroEase EQ see such great improvement that they continue feeding it daily.
 
Q: Goes GastroEase contain any prohibited substances?
A: As leaders in the management and preparation of top performance horses, we create the most effective formulas while avoiding all prohibited substances.

"Her condition has dramatically improved since making the switch, and she will be maintained on GastroEase from now on."

"I’m managing a mare that had been used to lots of turnout. Now that she is stabled and in work, I’ve been struggling to manage her gut. Probios was working okay, but I was recommended GastroEase as a more complete solution and decided to see if it would make a difference. Her condition has dramatically improved since making the switch, and she will be maintained on GastroEase from now on. I’m very impressed!"

"It has proved to be very helpful to my horse's gut with all the traveling and showing we have been doing."

"I wanted to write you a thank you for the tub of GastroEase EQ you sent me. It has proved to be very helpful to my horse's gut with all the traveling and showing we have been doing. I have seen a change in his demeanor at shows. He is much calmer and more like the horse I usually have while at home."

Elizabeth Huntley




"I saw improvement within days...three months later his back is great, his topline is contoured, his coat is gorgeous, his eyes are bright, and he's lively and playful."

"Two Sox is a 10 year old range-born American Mustang who roamed free until he was five; he is a great horse who is easy going and loves to please. He adapted to stall living and had no obvious GI symptoms for a long time. Then his back developed spasms to the point he could barely walk downhill; changing saddles, time off from riding, changing feed and treating for muscle and skeletal issues had no effect on the hind end spasms. After identifying the GI situation and medicating with good results, I needed a continuing GI supplement; GastroEase is the only product I found that specifically mentioned relieving back pain, and is the only one I came across that has oat glucan, which I knew to be an effective healing ingredient. Soxi tried eating it from the container and licked it from my hand. I saw improvement within days, and steady results over the next month; three months later his back is great, his topline is contoured, his coat is gorgeous, his eyes are bright, and he's lively and playful. GastroEase is keeping Soxi pain free and it's affordable; it's a great product and I recommend it all the time. "

"I attribute GastroEase Rescue with saving both us and our young horse a long night at the clinic."

"One of our young jumpers had an episode of colic brought on by dehydration even though we had been using electrolytes religiously. Having used every product made by Perfect Products, I put GastroEase Rescue to the test. Within thirty minutes of administration my young gelding was noticeably more comfortable and acting like himself. By the time the vet arrived he was only in need of a small dose of Banamine. I attribute GastroEase Rescue with saving both us and our young horse a long night at the clinic."

"We started him on GastroEase and he immediately began gaining weight. We've continued to maintain him on GastroEase and now his body condition is great!"

"We have a hard keeper that would not keep weight on no matter what we tried. He was always on the thin side. We started him on GastroEase and he immediately began gaining weight. We've continued to maintain him on GastroEase and now his body condition is great! This product has made a world of a difference."

"...once he was on GastroEase he now eats all of his grain, and begs for more!"

"GastroEase EQ has helped immensely with my horses. I have a horse who used to be a slow and picky eater, but once he was on GastroEase he now eats all of his grain, and begs for more! It is a great product for a competition horse that may have trouble eating in a high stress environment."

Lauren Knopp

"He's put loads of weight on and finally has a good appetite."

"My horse Ken, Kinnordy Rivaldo, has been on GastroEase EQ since December and has changed unbelievably. He's put loads of weight on and finally has a good appetite. His old groom saw him last weekend at an event and couldn't believe how good he looks and that he was actually eating on the lorry. She said he used to live on GastroGard and even then wouldn't eat!"

"They are eating well and maintaining their weight and muscle tone as well as feeling more at ease."

"I have put all of my competition horses on GastroEase and am very happy with the results. They are eating well and maintaining their weight and muscle tone as well as feeling more at ease. All of my horses are happy and content in their work. I would recommend this product to anyone who would like to alleviate the stress of travel and showing on the regular competition horse. I'm impressed with yet another great product from the team at Perfect Products! Thank you!"

"Since he’s been on it, he’s gained weight, looks great and is riding better than ever."

"Traveling a great deal with a horse that has a history of GI problems can be a real challenge. A friend of mine saw the several products I was using to help my horse and suggested GastroEase EQ. Since he’s been on it, he’s gained weight, looks great and is riding better than ever. And we only have to pack one product! We’ve traveled everywhere from Illinois to Texas and he’s staying comfortable and performing great!"

"Ten days on GastroEase turned both horses into great eaters, their attitudes have turned around and I am already seeing an improvement in condition."

"We are using GastroEase on 2 halter horses that we are fitting to show at the Congress and World Show. One had been on vet prescribed NSAIDS, and was acting depressed and not eating well. The second horse simply had no appetite. Ten days on GastroEase turned both horses into great eaters, their attitudes have turned around and I am already seeing an improvement in condition. We plan to continue to feed GastroEase to all our show horses."

Karen Johnson

"...we started her on GastroEase, and she has completely changed."

"My mare was frowny and ear pinny. Sometimes I really got discouraged because she was so nervous and hard to ride. We kind of knew she had ulcers, because she stayed thin no matter how much we fed her, but the cost of having our vet treat her was so high. Finally, 6 weeks ago we started her on GastroEase, and she has completely changed. She eats all her hay and feed, looks FAT, even over her withers and back, and she has become nicer. She keeps her head down and tries to do what I ask her to do when we are riding. We are keeping her on GastroEase every day."

Megan Hughes
Ohio State 4H Fair Winner




"Our customers appreciate the peace of mind of knowing that we are using a preventative to help minimize the chance of digestive upset and ulcers in their valuable horses."

Our customers appreciate the peace of mind of knowing that we are using a preventative to help minimize the chance of digestive upset and ulcers in their valuable horses."

"GastroEase returned them to the feed tub, and their attitude and condition quickly improved."

"We had a few 2 year olds getting ready for the big futurities this summer. They stopped eating well and my vet said he thought they may have low grade ulcers. GastroEase returned them to the feed tub, and their attitude and condition quickly improved."

Tracy Willis
AQHA Judge and Western Pleasure Trainer




"...my difficult horse’s condition got better. Even my vet noticed the quick results."

"Thanks for suggesting GastroEase. We began using it with a few horses that had occasional diarrhea and we saw results begin in days. Not only that, but even my difficult horse’s condition got better. Even my vet noticed the quick results. We plan to feed it as a daily supplement. I think it will save us money in feed and vet visits."

Jill Knowles

"My horses with chronic GI sensitivity eat and maintain weight better with fewer signs of GI discomfort."

"Feeding GastroEase Daily Formula has proven to be a simple way to protect my show horses from the GI stress I know results from training and showing activities. Ulcers and colic can significantly interfere with our training and showing schedule. My horses with chronic GI sensitivity eat and maintain weight better with fewer signs of GI discomfort. I use and recommend GastroEase!"

"GastroEase has become our mainstay GI daily supplement and I couldn't be more pleased."

"GastroEase has become our mainstay GI daily supplement and I couldn't be more pleased. We find that all of your formulas are wonderfully effective and competition safe, and they make our job of maintaining and preparing our champion hunters easier."

"GastroEase is much less expensive and effectively supports the complete digestive system."

"I used to use GastroGuard or UlcerGuard as part of my program until I discovered GastroEase. GastroEase is much less expensive and effectively supports the complete digestive system."

Marigot Bay Farm




"...she not only had no symptoms, but she actually gained a little weight on the road."

"Tried GastroEase on a horse that always gets diarrhea when we haul her. By the time she gets home from a big circuit, she has usually lost weight and is exhausted. Took her to the Select World last month, and she not only had no symptoms, but she actually gained a little weight on the road. Now our vets are interested in GastroEase for some of their hard to manage horses."

Cathy Hanson 
Hanson Quarter Horses




    “...he still continued to have flare-ups with no apparent cause. After starting him on GastroEase EQ, the diarrhea quickly stopped...”

    "I have an older Congress and World Champion gelding who had on and off diarrhea for several years. I had veterinarians assess him and between prescribed meds and trying "many different supplements he still continued to have flare-ups with no apparent cause. After starting him on GastroEase the diarrhea quickly stopped and his stool returned to normal. Now, several months later, whether I'm riding at home or showing he's consistently comfortable and the diarrhea has not returned. I'm so excited to finally have found a solution with GastroEase!"

Lauren Kasnet




    "I highly recommend GastroEase EQ to all of my therapy clients, and I feed it to my own horses at home."

    "My practice includes a number of high-level west coast dressage and Grand Prix horses, including the stable of Steffen and Shannon Peters. I highly recommend GastroEase to all of my therapy clients, and I feed it to my own horses at home. I find that even long-term GI problems resolve quickly on a scoop or two daily."
