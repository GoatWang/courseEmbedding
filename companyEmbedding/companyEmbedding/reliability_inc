Reliability (semiconductor)

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Reliability of semiconductor devices can be summarized as follows:

Semiconductor devices are very sensitive to impurities and particles. Therefore, to manufacture these devices it is necessary to manage many processes while accurately controlling the level of impurities and particles. The finished product quality depends upon the many layered relationship of each interacting substance in the semiconductor, including metallization, chip material (list of semiconductor materials) and package.
The problems of micro-processes, and thin films and must be fully understood as they apply to metallization and wire bonding. It is also necessary to analyze surface phenomena from the aspect of thin films.
Due to the rapid advances in technology, many new devices are developed using new materials and processes, and design calendar time is limited due to non-recurring engineering constraints, plus time to market concerns. Consequently, it is not possible to base new designs on the reliability of existing devices.
To achieve economy of scale, semiconductor products are manufactured in high volume. Furthermore, repair of finished semiconductor products is impractical. Therefore, incorporation of reliability at the design stage and reduction of variation in the production stage have become essential.
Reliability of semiconductor devices may depend on assembly, use, and environmental conditions. Stress factors affecting device reliability include gas, dust, contamination, voltage, current density, temperature, humidity, mechanical stress, vibration, shock, radiation, pressure, and intensity of magnetic and electrical fields.

Design factors affecting semiconductor reliability include: voltage derating, power derating, current derating, metastability, logic timing margins (logic simulation), timing analysis, temperature derating, and process control.

Methods of improvement[edit]
Reliability of semiconductors is kept high through several methods. Cleanrooms control impurities, process control controls processing, and burn-in (short term operation at extremes) and probe and test reduce escapes. Probe (wafer prober) tests the semiconductor die, prior to packaging, via micro-probes connected to test equipment. Wafer testing tests the packaged device, often pre-, and post burn-in for a set of parameters that assure operation. Process and design weaknesses are identified by applying a set of stress tests in the qualification phase of the semiconductors before their market introduction e. g. according to the AEC Q100 and Q101 stress qualifications.[1] Parts Average Testing is a statistical method for recognizing and quarantining semiconductor die that have a higher probability of reliability failures. This technique identifies characteristics that are within specification but outside of a normal distribution for that population as at-risk outliers not suitable for high reliability applications. Tester-based Parts Average Testing varieties include Parametric Parts Average Testing (P-PAT) and Geographical Parts Average Testing (G-PAT), among others. Inline Parts Average Testing (I-PAT) uses data from production process control inspection and metrology to perform the outlier recognition function.[2][3]
Bond strength measurement is performed in two basic types: pull testing and shear testing. Both can be done destructively, which is more common, or non destructively. Non destructive tests are normally used when extreme reliability is required such as in military or aerospace applications.[4]
Failure mechanisms[edit]
Failure mechanisms of electronic semiconductor devices fall in the following categories

Material-interaction-induced mechanisms.
Stress-induced mechanisms.
Mechanically induced failure mechanisms.
Environmentally induced failure mechanisms.

Material-interaction-induced mechanisms[edit]

Field-effect transistor gate-metal sinking
Ohmic contact degradation
Channel degradation
Surface-state effects
Package molding contamination—impurities in packaging compounds cause electrical failure

Stress-induced failure mechanisms[edit]

Electromigration – electrically induced movement of the materials in the chip
Burnout – localized overstress
Hot Electron Trapping – due to overdrive in power RF circuits
Electrical Stress – Electrostatic discharge, High Electro-Magnetic Fields (HIRF), Latch-up overvoltage, overcurrent

Mechanically induced failure mechanisms[edit]

Die fracture – due to mis-match of thermal expansion coefficients
Die-attach voids – manufacturing defect—screenable with Scanning Acoustic Microscopy.
Solder joint failure by creep fatigue or intermetallics cracks.
Die-pad/molding compound delamination due to thermal cycling

Environmentally induced failure mechanisms[edit]

Humidity effects – moisture absorption by the package and circuit
Hydrogen effects – Hydrogen induced breakdown of portions of the circuit (Metal)
Other Temperature Effects—Accelerated Aging, Increased Electro-migration with temperature, Increased Burn-Out

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Reliability (semiconductor)

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Reliability of semiconductor devices can be summarized as follows:

Semiconductor devices are very sensitive to impurities and particles. Therefore, to manufacture these devices it is necessary to manage many processes while accurately controlling the level of impurities and particles. The finished product quality depends upon the many layered relationship of each interacting substance in the semiconductor, including metallization, chip material (list of semiconductor materials) and package.
The problems of micro-processes, and thin films and must be fully understood as they apply to metallization and wire bonding. It is also necessary to analyze surface phenomena from the aspect of thin films.
Due to the rapid advances in technology, many new devices are developed using new materials and processes, and design calendar time is limited due to non-recurring engineering constraints, plus time to market concerns. Consequently, it is not possible to base new designs on the reliability of existing devices.
To achieve economy of scale, semiconductor products are manufactured in high volume. Furthermore, repair of finished semiconductor products is impractical. Therefore, incorporation of reliability at the design stage and reduction of variation in the production stage have become essential.
Reliability of semiconductor devices may depend on assembly, use, and environmental conditions. Stress factors affecting device reliability include gas, dust, contamination, voltage, current density, temperature, humidity, mechanical stress, vibration, shock, radiation, pressure, and intensity of magnetic and electrical fields.

Design factors affecting semiconductor reliability include: voltage derating, power derating, current derating, metastability, logic timing margins (logic simulation), timing analysis, temperature derating, and process control.

Methods of improvement[edit]
Reliability of semiconductors is kept high through several methods. Cleanrooms control impurities, process control controls processing, and burn-in (short term operation at extremes) and probe and test reduce escapes. Probe (wafer prober) tests the semiconductor die, prior to packaging, via micro-probes connected to test equipment. Wafer testing tests the packaged device, often pre-, and post burn-in for a set of parameters that assure operation. Process and design weaknesses are identified by applying a set of stress tests in the qualification phase of the semiconductors before their market introduction e. g. according to the AEC Q100 and Q101 stress qualifications.[1] Parts Average Testing is a statistical method for recognizing and quarantining semiconductor die that have a higher probability of reliability failures. This technique identifies characteristics that are within specification but outside of a normal distribution for that population as at-risk outliers not suitable for high reliability applications. Tester-based Parts Average Testing varieties include Parametric Parts Average Testing (P-PAT) and Geographical Parts Average Testing (G-PAT), among others. Inline Parts Average Testing (I-PAT) uses data from production process control inspection and metrology to perform the outlier recognition function.[2][3]
Bond strength measurement is performed in two basic types: pull testing and shear testing. Both can be done destructively, which is more common, or non destructively. Non destructive tests are normally used when extreme reliability is required such as in military or aerospace applications.[4]
Failure mechanisms[edit]
Failure mechanisms of electronic semiconductor devices fall in the following categories

Material-interaction-induced mechanisms.
Stress-induced mechanisms.
Mechanically induced failure mechanisms.
Environmentally induced failure mechanisms.

Material-interaction-induced mechanisms[edit]

Field-effect transistor gate-metal sinking
Ohmic contact degradation
Channel degradation
Surface-state effects
Package molding contamination—impurities in packaging compounds cause electrical failure

Stress-induced failure mechanisms[edit]

Electromigration – electrically induced movement of the materials in the chip
Burnout – localized overstress
Hot Electron Trapping – due to overdrive in power RF circuits
Electrical Stress – Electrostatic discharge, High Electro-Magnetic Fields (HIRF), Latch-up overvoltage, overcurrent

Mechanically induced failure mechanisms[edit]

Die fracture – due to mis-match of thermal expansion coefficients
Die-attach voids – manufacturing defect—screenable with Scanning Acoustic Microscopy.
Solder joint failure by creep fatigue or intermetallics cracks.
Die-pad/molding compound delamination due to thermal cycling

Environmentally induced failure mechanisms[edit]

Humidity effects – moisture absorption by the package and circuit
Hydrogen effects – Hydrogen induced breakdown of portions of the circuit (Metal)
Other Temperature Effects—Accelerated Aging, Increased Electro-migration with temperature, Increased Burn-Out

Reliability - ASQ








 










 
Reliability 



 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 Quality = Does it perform its intended function? 
 Reliability = How long will it do so? 
 Reliability can be defined as the probability that a product, system or service will perform its intended function adequately for a specified period of time, operating in a defined operating environment without failure. 
 Components of this definition: 

 Probability: the likelihood of mission success. 
 Intended function: for example, to light, cut, rotate or heat. 
 Satisfactory: perform according to a specification, with an acceptable degree of compliance. 
 Specific period of time: minutes, days, months or number of cycles. 
 Specified conditions: for example, temperature, speed or pressure. 

 Stated another way, reliability is 

 Probability of success 
 Durability 
 Dependability 
 Quality over time 
 Availability to perform a function 

 Common examples: 

 “This car is under warranty for 40,000 miles or 3 years, whichever comes first.” 
 “This mower has a lifetime guarantee.” 

Excerpted from Mark L. Crossley, The Desk Reference of Statistical Quality  Methods, page  391.

Consumer Reports: Apple still tops in reliability
In its recently-released holiday buying issue, Consumer Reports says that iMac and MacBook lines still reign over PC competitors. But a close reading of the results show a mixed result for Cupertino. 







                                   By David Morgenstern
            
                    
                    for The Apple Core
        
                                        |            November 22, 2012 -- 06:58 GMT (22:58 PST)

The Consumer Reports cover story looked at best brands in electronics. The reliability section was based on Consumer Reports' annual Product Reliability Survey, and reported on computers from Acer, Apple, Dell, eMachines, Gateway, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, Sony and Toshiba.
In the ranking of consumer satisfaction, Apple gets a reader score of 78 percent. Dell and Lenovo tied at 59 percent, with Acer, Asus, eMachines, HP, Gateway, and Toshiba grouped together between 56 to 54 percent. That's a significant difference in customer perception.
The reasons still appear to bewilder PC makers. These vendors have spent years driving to the bottom of a commodity market, where brands vie almost totally on cost. However, over the past five or so years, customers have increasingly accepted Apple's value proposition: higher-quality machines with leading industrial design, a tightly-integrated operating system, and the introduction of new technologies that come with higher price tags. Apple sold over 4.9 million Macs last quarter and 80 percent of them were MacBooks.
And then there are the provision of tech support and its costs.

Tech support in general is among the lowest-rated services in all of the surveys conducted by the Consumer Reports National Research Center. But that doesn't apply to Apple, which beat all the makers of Windows-based PCs covered in our most recent survey.

CR said that Apple solved three-quarters of user problems compared with Dell's 61 percent, its nearest competitor. So, the others must have scored worse.


In the reliability ratings for desktop computers, Apple's iMac repair rate (7 percent) scored significantly better than HP (10), Dell (11) and Gateway (13).
This score can't be a surprise to anyone. If you spend years removing cost — read quality — out of any system, here desktop systems, there will come a point where all the little things add up to a big whole, which, in this case, stinks.
Meanwhile, Apple has made its iMac all-in-one desktop the focus of its performance computing strategy. Apple's "traditional" desktop computer, the Mac Pro, is missing in action right now, way overdue for a refresh.


There's no way of knowing if these quality reports are just about hardware failures or are also software related. Is it related to the crapware that comes with PCs in an attempt to eke out a bit more margin in a commodity product? Hard to tell.
Here's an interesting piece about iMac from Apple CEO Tim Cook during the Oct. 25 Apple Q4 earnings call with analysts:

In terms of general shortages, the iMac will be constrained for the full quarter in a significant way. Part of that is that we're beginning shipping the 21.5-inch iMac in November and the 27-inch in December So, there will be a short amount of time during the quarter to manufacturer and ramp those and I expect the demand to be robust. So, we will have a significant shortage there.

However, in CR's laptop computer ratings, Apple only edged out the many PC competitors by a couple of percentage points. The worst was Dell with a 12 percent rating compared to Apple's 8 percent.
So, I see these figures in two ways: Firstly, that PC makers have put more effort into their laptops and they've done a good job getting closer to Apple in quality. On the other hand, we could say that all laptop makers, Apple included, may be having some QA issues with their recent mobile computers. This might have something to do to the increasingly thinner and smaller enclosures that make laptops difficult to assemble as well as to repair.
Anecdotal observation: I recently spoke to several Mac buyers who are on a replacement machine. They bought a new MacBook and problems started happening. They took the laptop into get it repaired and were given another machine. That's good customer service (see above) but not so good on the repair reliability front.

Accelerometer sensors accurately measure vibration, shock, acceleration, and motion for monitoring, control, and testing applications. Accelerometers in Industry are primarily used to monitor the condition of rolling element bearings or ball bearings on rotating machinery such as fans, pumps, gears, compressors, turbines, paper machines, cooling tower fans and many other types of machinery. Accelerometers typically provide a dynamic signal output for use by condition monitoring systems including monitors, transmitters, analyzers and portable data collectors. Accelerometers are crystal based and convert mechanical motion to an electrical signal in the plane that they are mounted using the piezoelectric principal. Care must be taken with installation to insure proper operation to specifications. RDI offers General Purpose, Low Frequency, High Frequency and High Temperature Accelerometers in many different configurations. All Accelerometers are field proven. Accelerometers are also available in explosion proof (XP/IS) versions for hazardous area installations.

Infrared Thermometers(IR Thermometer, Raytek, Thermometer Infrared, Infrared Temperature, IR Gun, Temperature Gun)Reliability Direct offers a wide selection of Professional Infrared Thermometers from several manufactures including, Ecom, Extech, Raytek, RDI, SKF and TPI. They are also sometimes called IR Thermometers, Infrared Temperature Guns or Laser Thermometers as many use a laser for targeting. Infrared Thermometers are portable battery powered hand held instruments that provide a non-contact temperature measurement by measuring the infrared energy emitted by the target. The distance to spot ratio (D:S) determines the target size measured as a ratio to the distance the device is held from the target. If a Infrared thermometer has a D:S of 12:1 then at 12" measuring distance the measurement will be the average of a spot 1" in diameter.Please Visit our Knowledge Base for more Information on Thermography!

										Learn Root Cause Analysis from the Leaders In RCA Technology.
Root Cause Analysis Training, Consulting, & Software Since 1985




PROACTOnDemand® RCA System
Sales Brochure   Press Release








BFA - Basic Failure Analysis + Train The Trainer
3 - 5 Day Scheduled Workshops (per enrolled students) On-site or at Reliability Center
Basic Failure Analysis (BFA) is intended to provide facility personnel the requisite skills and knowledge to eliminate the problems and chronic failures that they are experiencing everyday on the job. Attendees are provided instruction on a unique 4-step process that guides them through the technique of solving chronic problems down to their root cause(s) using real world examples. In addition, BFA details guidelines for the support mechanisms necessary to implement countermeasures to identified root causes. 
Course Outline:

Because of its modular design, BFA exercises utilize examples of the different types of failures that exists at various organizations (safety, maintenance, environmental, administrative, process, operational, etc.). This enables BFA to be tailored to meet the specific needs of company facilities and operations

This BFA Train-the-Trainer workshop is designed to teach the student how to deliver the BFA (1 day) workshop to others at their organization. The BFA Train-the-Trainer workshop is a 5 day* intense workshop. On the first day the RCI instructor will teach the 1 day workshop to the TTT student. The other days the student will be trained on the techniques for delivering the 1 day workshop to to co-workers in their own facility. The RCI instructor will observe and mentor them while they learn to teach the BFA course. The RCI instructor will offer guidance and tips to ensure their students are successful in presenting the course material.

Learn How To:

Deliver the BFA training to students in a 1 day format.
Identify different Problem Solving Methods
Identify the process used for structured problem solving.
Devise a data collection strategy for the analysis effort.
LEAP qualifies events that are the best candidates for Root Cause Analysis by using justification techniques
Define the elements that comprise a RCA logic tree.
Use logic trees to solve chronic problems down to their root cause(s.)
Generate countermeasures to eliminate identified root causes of failures.
Obtain the required support to implement recommendations that will eliminate failure.

                            Upon completion and final exam - Successful Analysts are awarded plaques for Certified PROACT® Lead Investigators.
Workshops are available on client sites or RCI Training center.


The following workshops in this series must be completed to fulfill the requirements for the PROACT® Root Cause Analysis Lead Investigator Series. 




PROACT® Root Cause Analysis Methodology


PROACT® Root Cause Analysis (RCA) ® RCA facilitators will learn to lead teams to analyze why undesirable events occur, all the way down to their systems root causes. The goal is not to pinpoint WHO makes poor decisions, but WHY such decisions are made. The end result is usually deficient organizational systems that promote poor decision-making. This methodology is applicable to anyone in EH&S, Quality, Reliability, Maintenance, Engineering and Administration. 



Justification Tools and Techniques

This course provides an in-depth understanding of RCI's Failure Modes & Effects Analysis (FMEA) & Opportunity Analysis (OA) approach to identifying the most significant opportunities in any system. The course is designed to provide a vehicle to comb existing weak operating systems in order to find the details associated with the weaknesses thereby exposing the opportunities for improvement. A detailed comprehension of how to perform FMEA/OA on the weak systems will be applied so the maximum bottom-line results can be achieved.  The attendees will learn how to physically perform an FMEA/OA, as well as, how to develop a report that details the FMEA results, and how to present their findings to management for review and action.
The course will also cover Force Field Analysis & Decision by Pairs which is a technique used to prioritize a list of items in their order of importance to the decision makers. The technique measures each item with all the other items to provide a structured model for determining their order of importance in the overall scope of the decision making process. 



Human Error Reduction

Human Error Reduction is designed to provide students with the requisite skills and knowledge necessary to effectively reduce human error in the workplace. With fewer errors made by your staff, you will spend less time correcting human errors and responding to consequences of human errors, thus strengthening your facility's safety culture. This workshop provides the students an acute awareness to the conditions that increase the risk of human error. This workshop is intended to be proactive in nature because students will be able to identify environment health and safety conditions that are high risk, and implement countermeasures to reduce those risks. 



 Failure Scene Investigation for Mechanical

This course provides an in-depth understanding of how to verify hypotheses developed in RCA. Hands on presentations are made to teach students how to identify mechanical failure modes by reading fracture surfaces. This workshop can be customized per client interest and focus. For instance, the client can chose to focus on bearings, gears and fans or they may wish to focus on seals, shafts and fasteners. Many of the root causes of failures and risks lie in the mechanical reliability of equipment and components. This workshop will educate the students with a much deeper understanding of the material sciences and their role in failure.



Lead Investigator Facilitation & Mentoring

This workshop will take all the knowledge learned from the past 4 workshops and put them together to solve specific issues. These issues will be identified using the FMEA and OA tools learned. The most important and highest ROI events will then be analyzed using the PROACT RCA methodology and software. The result will be an instant pay back for the investment in the training itself.



PROACT® Software and Knowledge Management Templates

Failure analysts require a consistent, structured approach to conducting their investigations. Including a software component in this process will guide the analyst through the analysis and also prepare management reports of the findings and recommendations. Additionally it will cut analysis time by as much as 50%. The PROACT Suite contains the following:

 LEAP® FMEA/OA Software ® This software provides a disciplined approach to documenting and communicating a Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and an Opportunity Analysis (OA). While the FMEA allows for compliance to regulatory guidelines. OA will allow the users to explore trends for chronic events that are the most prudent to conduct Root Cause Analyses on. LEAP also will record all of these analyses in a common database that can be searched and used for future investigations.

 
PROACT® RCA Software ® This software guides and helps facilitate the disciplined RCA process taught in the facilitator training. This software eliminates the need for multiple programs to attain the end result. PROACT RCA software documents the RCA process while dynamically compiling the report behind the scenes. It also includes a built-in presentation mode. PROACT RCA Software serves as a knowledge management system by storing successful RCA's and their associated logic, and allowing users to search and learn from them. Special securities allow the analyst the ability to limit permissions to the ongoing analysis and to publish the analysis for all to see when approved by legal.
The PROACT® Logic Tree Knowledge Base ® is an aggregation of over 38 years of experience associated with hundreds of field investigations. The analyses have been thoroughly reviewed and their results compiled to form this unique, single knowledge base of +300 RCA templates encompassing five main areas: operational, mechanical, electrical, quality, & human. As analysts use RCI's PROACT ® Software and have exhausted their ideas for developing hypotheses, there are more opportunities available with the PROACT ® Logic Tree Knowledge Base templates. These templates provide the analyst the ability to see if there may be something they could have missed. The PROACT ® templates provide learning based on past experience and also a system of "checks-and-balances" for the comprehensiveness of the analysis. While no knowledge base can ever cover all of the potential variables of all potential events, analysts can learn from past experience to assist with preventing recurrences of similar events.
