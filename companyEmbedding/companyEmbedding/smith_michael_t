            I have purchased the Michael W. Smith CD 'Worship' and it was just beautiful and wonderfully orchestrated.  However; this CD was just not done with the same priorities and professional artists.  I was really disappointed to hear one section of 'talking' and too many sections with children singing.  I believe I counted a total of four songs that fell into what I was hoping for in a worship CD by  Michael W. Smith.  I  will pay much more attention in the future and try U-tube prior to purchase to make sure I do not waste my money.

            The CD arrived in a timely manner and was well packaged. It played flawlessly on my system with no distortion or need to play with the equalizer. Technically, a perfect CD. The style of music was not quite what I was expecting.

Featured Music- Hills and Valleys- Tauren Wells More
Michigan native Tauren Wells started his music career at Indiana Bible College, forming the group Royal Tailor with a trio of classmate friends. From their two albums, the group earned two Grammy nominations, and won the Dove Award for New Artist of the Year. However, when life on the road began to take it's toll on the group, Tauren persevered, and launched his solo career with Essential Records. 
After landing a key spot in the multi-million-view Dude Perfect series with his "Undefeated" KB collaboration, Wells returns with a full length collection of electrifying pop-rock anthems and heartfelt songs of faith.  Read More

            I just got this CD last week and it is awesome, so uplifting.  I have the Christmas one also but have not listened to it yet, and the new Hallelujah one is just incredible!!! God has really blessed Michael Smith with the ability and voice gift to do this and us with being able to purchase it and have it fill us with God's love, promises, joy and peace that flows from the words and heartfelt songs!!!

            this is truly a upbeat album...I had not heard a lot of these songs so it was like new releases to me. I have several meaningful songs that keep me in revered state that deeply convicts and witnesses with the Holy Spirit. Each song MWS sings is a gift from heaven !

            What can one say? First it is Smitty. Then he is doing his old hits that really take you back, far enough to feel like you just found another treasure before you realize, Oh geez, it's Smitty! Never boring or wasting time with lyrics and music. Always an adventure with such inspiration to guide you.
