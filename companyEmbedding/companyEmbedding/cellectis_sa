					http://www.cellectis.com/en/press/cellectis-granted-patent-for-crispr-use-in-t-cells/#When:20:30:00Z
July 24, 2017 – New York (N.Y.) – Cellectis (Alternext: ALCLS; Nasdaq: CLLS), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing immunotherapies based on gene-edited CAR T-cells (UCART), today announced the grant by the European Patent Office of patent No. EP3004337 for the invention of using RNA-guided endonucleases, such as Cas9 or Cpf1 for the genetic engineering of T-cells. The patent will be issued on August 2, 2017.

This therapeutic-focused patent follows previous intellectual property that Cellectis has obtained over the two last decades for major gene editing technologies including meganucleases, TALEN®, MegaTAL and CRISPR.
“Cellectis is a pioneering gene editing company that has always been at the forefront of all gene editing technologies,” said Dr. André Choulika, Cellectis Chairman & CEO. “We have been the first to explore the potential of CRISPR in its early days in various applications, including therapeutics and food, and these early findings ultimately led to the grant of this new patent. While Cellectis has selected TALEN® as the most robust and adaptable technology for human therapeutic use and for the Company’s product pipeline, our team does sometimes use CRISPR-based nucleases for T-cell research, as it is a less-expensive option and convenient for gene discovery purposes. As such, this patent only further reinforces Cellectis’ leadership position in the gene editing industry, with more patents coming down the pike for the Company in the near future.”
Convinced of its strong value for future development of engineered CAR T-cells, Cellectis will make this patent available for licensing to companies that are willing to use this technology in T-cells.
The inventors of this patent are Dr. André Choulika, Chairman & CEO of Cellectis and one of the pioneers in the development of nuclease-based genome editing technologies; Dr. Philippe Duchateau, Cellectis Chief Scientific Officer and seasoned gene editing expert and Dr. Laurent Poirot, Cellectis Head of Early Discovery and expert of gene functions in immune cells.
Claim 1 of the EP3004337 patent 
1) A method of preparing T-cells for immunotherapy comprising the steps of:
(a) Genetically modifying T-cells by introduction into the cells and/or expression in the cells of at least:
- a RNA-guided endonuclease; and
- a specific guide RNA that directs said endonuclease to at least one targeted locus in the T-cell genome,
wherein said RNA-guided endonuclease is expressed from transfected mRNA,
and said guide RNA is expressed in the cells as a transcript from a DNA vector;
(b) expanding the resulting cells in vitro.

UCART123 is the First U.S. Gene Edited, Off-the-Shelf CAR T-Cell Program
June 27, 2017 – New York (N.Y.) – Cellectis (Alternext: ALCLS; Nasdaq: CLLS), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing immunotherapies based on gene-edited CAR T-cells (UCART), announced today the first administration in the Phase I clinical study in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) for its investigational product UCART123, one of the Company’s wholly-controlled TALEN® gene-edited product candidates. This marks the first allogeneic, “off-the-shelf” gene-edited CAR T-cell product candidate targeting CD123 to be investigated in clinical trials.
This clinical research in AML is led by Principal Investigator Dr. Gail J. Roboz, Professor of Medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine and Director of the Clinical and Translational Leukemia Programs at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital.
The clinical trial will investigate the safety and efficacy of UCART123 in patients with AML. AML is a devastating clonal hematopoietic stem cell neoplasm which is characterized by uncontrolled proliferation and accumulation of leukemic blasts in bone marrow, peripheral blood and, occasionally, in other tissues. These cells disrupt normal hematopoiesis and rapidly cause bone marrow failure. In the U.S., there are an estimated 19,950 new AML cases per year, with 10,430 estimated deaths per year. While complete response rates can be as high as 80 percent in younger patients who undergo initial induction cytotoxic chemotherapy, the majority of AML patients relapse and die from the disease. AML patients with high-risk genetic features have an especially urgent unmet medical need, as their outcomes are dismal with all existing treatment modalities, including allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
“After being granted rapid approval from Regulatory Authorities and Institutional Review Boards to initiate UCART123 studies, the enrollment and treatment of the first patient represents a major milestone for Cellectis, and we are eager to hit the ground running with the recruitment of our first patient for our second UCART123 Phase I study in BPDCN soon,” said Dr. Loan Hoang-Sayag, Cellectis Chief Medical Officer. “This first program targeting CD123 will be a paradigm shift for our Company, as it will provide a wealth of valuable additional knowledge and data to drive our gene-edited allogeneic CAR T-cell platform.”
“We are excited to be enrolling our first patient with UCART123 and are hopeful that this novel immunotherapy modality will prove to be a significant and effective weapon against AML,” said Dr. Roboz.
The clinical trial is part of a strategic translational research alliance that was formed between Cellectis and Weill Cornell Medicine in 2015. Dr. Monica Guzman, an associate professor of pharmacology in medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine, is co-principal investigator whose work focuses on preclinical and early-stage testing to optimize the development of stem cell-targeted cancer drugs.]]>

U.S. Patent 8,921,332 Refers to the Use of Chimeric Endonucleases, such as Zinc Finger Nucleases, TAL-effector Nucleases, Mega-TALs and CRISPR-Cas9 to Perform Gene Insertion into Cell Genomes
 
May 10, 2017 – New York (N.Y.) – Cellectis (Alternext: ALCLS; Nasdaq: CLLS), a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing immunotherapies based on gene edited CAR T-cells (UCART), today announced that U.S. patent 8,921,332, which claims the use of chimeric restriction endonucleases for directing chromosomal gene editing in cells by homologous recombination (HR), initially issued on Dec. 30, 2014, has been upheld by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) after a reexamination initiated in October 2015.
U.S. patent 8,921,332 claims a general method for modifying chromosomal DNA sequences at a genomic site of interest within a cell by using a chimeric restriction endonuclease such as zing finger nucleases, TAL-effector nucleases, Mega-TALs and CRISPR/Cas9. This technique, commonly referred to as gene targeting or targeted insertion, is now frequently used to modify the genome within plants, animals and cell lines.
The inventors of this patent are Dr. André Choulika, Cellectis’ Chairman and CEO, and Dr. Richard C. Mulligan, a Harvard Medical School Professor. Institut Pasteur and Boston Children’s Hospital, the owners of the patent, have granted exclusive rights to Cellectis under this patent. It belongs to a patent family that claims the basic uses of chimeric restriction nucleases for gene editing in cells.
Following the patent’s reexamination, the USPTO issued a Notice to Issue Reexamination Certificate in which it is stated that all 55 claims of the patent are maintained, asserting that: "The '632 patent, Smith et al., the '150 patent, Kim et al. and the '261 patent individually or in combination neither teach or suggest the method of modifying a specific sequence in a chromosomal DNA of a cell in vitro by contacting the cell with a chimeric restriction endonuclease and a targeted DNA as recited in the present claims."

Financial Results
Cellectis’ consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, or IFRS, as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”).
First quarter 2017 Financial Results
Cash: As of March 31, 2017 Cellectis had €258.5 million in total cash, cash equivalents and current financial assets compared to €276.2 million as of December 31, 2016. This decrease of €17.7 million reflects (i) net cash flows used by operating activities of €15.3 million, (ii) capital expenditures of €0.5 million and (iii) the unrealized negative translation effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our U.S. dollar cash, cash equivalents and current financial assets of €1.9 million.
Cellectis expects that its cash, cash equivalents and current financial assets of €258.5 million as of March 31, 2017 will be sufficient to fund its current operations to 2019.
Revenues and Other Income: During the quarters ended March 31, 2016 and 2017, we recorded €9.5 million and €9.7 million, respectively, in revenues and other income. This increase primarily reflects (i) an increase of €0.8 million in research tax credit, (ii) a decrease of €0.4 million in collaboration revenues, due primarily to a decrease of €1.4 million in upfront recognition and a decrease of €0.3 million in R&D costs reimbursement, been partially offset by an increase of €1.3 million in supply agreements with Servier, and (iii) a decrease in revenue from licenses of €0.2 million.
Total Operating Expenses: Total operating expenses for the first quarter of 2017 were €28.2 million, compared to €29.9 million for the first quarter of 2016. The non-cash stock-based compensation expenses included in these amounts were €12.8 million and €13.4 million, respectively.
R&D Expenses: For the quarters ended March 31, 2016 and 2017, research and development expenses decreased by €0.5 million from €18.9 million in 2016 to €18.4 million in 2017. Personnel expenses decreased by € 2.1 million from €11.9 million in 2016 to €9.8 million in 2017, primarily due to a €1.7 million decrease in social charges on stock option grants and a €0.5 million decrease in non-cash stock based compensation expense, partly offset by a €0.1 million increase in wages and salaries. Purchases and external expenses increased by €1.5 million from €6.6 million in 2016 to €8.2 million in 2017, mainly due to increased expenses related to UCART123 and the development of other product candidates, including payments to third parties, purchases of biological materials and expenses associated with the use of laboratories and other facilities.
SG&A Expenses: During the quarters ended March 31, 2016 and 2017, we recorded €10.5 million and €9.1 million, respectively, of selling, general and administrative expenses. The increase of €1.4 million primarily reflects (i) a decrease of €1.1 million in personnel expenses from €8.3 million to €7.2 million, attributable, to a decrease of €1.5 million of social charges on stock options grants and a decrease of €0.1 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, partly offset by a €0.5 million increase in wages and salaries, and (ii) a decrease of €0.4 million in purchases and external expenses.
Financial Gain (Loss): The financial loss was €9.1 million for the first quarter of 2016 compared with an almost nil financial result for the first quarter of 2017. The change in financial result was primarily attributable to a decrease in net foreign exchange loss of €7.6 million due to the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our USD cash and cash equivalent accounts, an increase of €1.0 million in fair value adjustment income on our foreign exchange derivatives and current financial assets and a €0.2 million net gain realized on the repositioning of foreign exchange derivative instruments.
Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Shareholders of Cellectis: During the quarters ended March 31, 2016 and 2017, we recorded a net loss of €29.5 million (or €0.84 per share on both a basic and a diluted basis) and a net loss of €18.6 million (or €0.53 per share on both a basic and a diluted basis), respectively. Adjusted loss attributable to shareholders of Cellectis for the first quarter of 2017 was €5.8 million (€0.16 per share on both a basic and a diluted basis) compared to adjusted income attributable to shareholders of Cellectis of €16.1 million (€0.46 per share on both a basic and a diluted basis), for the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis excludes non-cash stock-based compensation expense of €12.8 million and €13.4 million, respectively. Please see "Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for reconciliation of GAAP net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis to Adjusted income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis.

Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Cellectis S.A. presents Adjusted Income (Loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis in this press release. Adjusted Income (Loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis is not a measure calculated in accordance with IFRS. We have included in this press release a reconciliation of this figure to Net Income (Loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with IFRS. Because Adjusted Income (Loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis excludes Non-cash stock-based compensation expense—a non-cash expense, we believe that this financial measure, when considered together with our IFRS financial statements, can enhance an overall understanding of Cellectis’ financial performance. Moreover, our management views the Company’s operations, and manages its business, based, in part, on this financial measure. In particular, we believe that the elimination of Non-cash stock-based expenses from Net Income (Loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core businesses. Our use of Adjusted Income (Loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under IFRS. Some of these limitations are: (a) other companies, including companies in our industry which use similar stock-based compensation, may address the impact of Non-cash stock-based compensation expense differently; and (b) other companies may report Adjusted Income (Loss) attributable to shareholders or similarly titled measures but calculate them differently, which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these and other limitations, you should consider Adjusted Income (Loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis alongside our IFRS financial results, including Net Income (Loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis.

Dr. André Choulika to Serve as Panelist for “Humankind vs. Cancer: The Scorecard”
 
New York, N.Y. – April 27, 2017 – Cellectis (Alternext: ALCLS; Nasdaq: CLLS), a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing immunotherapies based on gene edited CAR T-cells (UCART), today announced that the Company’s founder, Chairman and CEO, Dr. André Choulika, has been selected as a speaker for the 2017 Milken Institute Global Conference. Dr. Choulika will participate as a panelist for a session titled, “Humankind vs. Cancer: The Scorecard” on Wednesday, May 3, 2017, at 10 a.m. local time.
This panel will focus on both the opportunities and challenges that come with fighting cancer using new targeted therapies and breakthrough immuno-oncology drugs, addressing questions such as: Why do many breakthrough treatments work for some patients but not others? What are some of the risks that are associated with emerging treatments? Can patients, governments and insurers continue to meet the rising costs of cancer treatment? Will the changes in administration impact commitments that are made through the Cancer MoonShot and 21st Century Cures Act?
Dr. Choulika’s selection as a speaker was based on his contribution to and impact on the global healthcare and life sciences industries through Cellectis’ development and therapeutic application of allogeneic, off-the-shelf CAR T-cell immunotherapies that target cancer. With this process, T-cells from healthy donors are genetically edited with Cellectis’ proprietary TALEN® technology to seek and destroy cancer cells.
The 20th Annual Milken Institute Global Conference will take place on Sunday, April 30, to Wednesday, May 3, 2017, in Los Angeles, California.

9 March 2017 – Servier, together with Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and Cellectis (Alternext: ALCLS; Nasdaq: CLLS), announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Servier with an Investigational New Drug (IND) clearance to proceed in the U.S. with the clinical development of UCART19, an allogeneic, gene-edited cellular therapy candidate to treat relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Servier is sponsoring the CALM Phase 1 study on UCART19. In 2015, Servier acquired exclusive rights from Cellectis for UCART19, which is being co-developed by Servier and Pfizer.
The CALM study was initiated in the UK in August 2016. CALM is an open label, dose-escalation study designed to evaluate safety, tolerability and antileukemic activity of UCART19 in patients with relapsed or refractory CD19-positive B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL).
The allogeneic UCART19 candidate and CALM protocol were reviewed at the National Institutes of Health's Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC) meeting on December 14, 2016. Servier submitted an IND application on February 1, 2017, with Pfizer’s support. With this IND clearance, the CALM study will be expanded to include several centers in the U.S., including the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston (Texas).
“We are very pleased that Servier’s first IND approval has been granted for such an innovative approach as allogeneic CAR T therapy”, said Dr Patrick Thérasse, Director of Clinical Development Oncology at Servier. “B-ALL is a devastating disease and this study is key to gaining greater insight into the efficacy and safety profile of this new immune-oncology approach in patients with B-ALL.”
“Pfizer is excited by the potential of this investigational CAR T approach to treating ALL and other B-Cell malignancies,” said Barbara Sasu, Vice President, CAR T Research at Pfizer. “We are looking forward to having the opportunity to investigate this approach in the U.S.”
About UCART19
UCART19 is an allogeneic CAR T-cell product candidate being developed for treatment of CD19-expressing hematological malignancies, gene edited with TALEN®. UCART19 is initially being developed in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and is currently in Phase I. The current approach with UCART19 is based on the preliminary positive results from clinical trials using autologous products based on the CAR technology. UCART19 has the potential to overcome the limitation of the current autologous approach by providing an allogeneic, frozen, “off-the-shelf” T cell based medicinal product.
In November 2015, Servier acquired the exclusive rights to UCART19 from Cellectis. Following further agreements, Servier and Pfizer began collaborating on a joint clinical development program for this cancer immunotherapy. Pfizer has been granted exclusive rights by Servier to develop and commercialize UCART19 in the United States, while Servier retains exclusive rights for all other countries.]]>

The audit procedures have been carried out by the independent auditors and their audit report relating to the certification of the financials is in the process of being issued. The audited report for Cellectis’ consolidated financial statements will be included in the Company’s annual report.
Fourth quarter 2016 Financial Results
Cash: As of December 31, 2016 Cellectis had €276.2 million in total cash, cash equivalents and current financial assets compared to €264.0 million as of September 30, 2016. This increase of €12.2 million notably reflects (i) the receipt of R&D tax credits of €9.2 million, (ii) proceeds of €7.0 million related to the supply agreement with Servier, (iii) the unrealized positive translation effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our U.S. dollar cash, cash equivalents and current financial assets of €12.1 million, partially offset by (iv) other net cash flows used by operating activities of €15.0 million and (v) fixed assets expenditures of €1.1 million.
Revenues and Other Income: During the quarters ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, we recorded €29.2 million and €12.1 million, respectively, in revenues and other income. This decrease is mainly due to the decrease of €20.0 million in collaboration revenues, notably due to the €18.8 million revenue recorded in 2015 in relation to early exercise by Servier of its option to acquire the exclusive worldwide rights to further develop and commercialize UCART19, partially offset by increases of €1.0 million in research tax credit and €1.3 million in subsidies.
Total Operating Expenses: Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2016 were €30.9 million, compared to €28.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. The non-cash stock-based compensation expenses included in these amounts were €13.1 million and €12.6 million, respectively.
R&D Expenses: For the quarters ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, research and development expenses increased by €2.6 million from €16.0 million in 2015 to €18.7 million in 2016. Personnel expenses increased by €0.5 million from €11.2 million in 2015 to €11.6 million in 2016, due to a €1.8 million increase in social charges on stock options, partially offset by a €1.1 million decrease in non-cash stock based compensation expense and a €0.2 million decrease in wages and salaries. Purchases, external expenses and other expenses increased by €2.2 million from €4.3 million in 2015 to €6.5 million in 2016.
SG&A Expenses: During the quarters ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, we recorded €8.1 million and €11.4 million, respectively, of selling, general and administrative expenses. The increase of €3.3 million primarily reflects the increase in personnel expenses from €5.6 million to €8.9 million, attributable to the increase of €1.5 million in non-cash stock-based compensation expense, €1.4 million in social charges on stock options, and €0.4 million in wages and salaries. No material variance has been identified on purchases, external expenses and other expenses.
Financial Gain (Loss): The financial gain was €7.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with a financial gain of €6.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The change in financial result was primarily attributable to the increase of €1.3 million in fair value adjustment expense on our foreign exchange derivatives and current financial assets, partially offset by the gain of €0.8 million due to the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our U.S. dollar cash and cash equivalent accounts.
Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Shareholders of Cellectis: During the quarters ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, we recorded a net gain of €8.2 million (or €0.23 per share on both a basic and a diluted basis) and net loss of €12.5 million (or €0.35 per share on both a basic and a diluted basis), respectively. Adjusted income attributable to shareholders of Cellectis for the fourth quarter of 2016 was €0.6 million (€0.02 per share on both a basic and a diluted basis) compared to adjusted income attributable to shareholders of Cellectis of €20.9 million (€0.59 per share on both a basic and a diluted basis), for the fourth quarter of 2015. Adjusted income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis for the fourth quarter of 2016 and 2015 excludes non-cash stock-based compensation expense of €13.1 million and €12.6 million, respectively. Please see "Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for reconciliation of GAAP net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis to Adjusted income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis.
Full year 2016 Financial Results
Cash: As of December 31, 2016 Cellectis had €276.2 million in total cash, cash equivalents and current financial assets compared to € 314.2 million as of December 31, 2015. This decrease of €38.0 million was primarily driven by (i) €29.6 million of cash used in operating activities, related to our research and development and manufacturing efforts, including the advancement of UCART123, for which an IND was filed in the United States in early 2017, partially offset by payments received from Servier and Pfizer pursuant to our collaboration agreements and R&D tax credit, and (ii) €12.5 million of cash used in investment activities, primarily through Calyxt’s land acquisition and greenhouse construction in an aggregate amount of €9.5 million. The decrease was also partially offset by the positive unrealized translation effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our U.S. dollar cash, cash equivalents and current financial assets of €4.4 million.
Cellectis expects that its cash, cash equivalents and Current financial assets of €276.2 million as of December 31, 2016 will be sufficient to fund its current operations to 2019.
Revenues and Other Income: During the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, we recorded €56.4 million and €51.0 million, respectively, in revenues and other income. This decrease is mainly due (i) to the decrease of €10.4 million in collaboration revenues notably due to revenue recorded in 2015 in relation to early exercise by Servier of its option to acquire the exclusive worldwide rights to further develop and commercialize UCART19 (€18.8 million) partially offset by the revenue from an agreement to provide Servier with raw materials and additional batches of UCART19 products and the achievement of two milestones in 2016 (totaling €11.9 million), (ii) increases of €4.0 million in research tax credit, €0.5 million in licenses fees and €0.4 million in research subsidies.
Total Operating Expenses: Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were €111.8 million, compared to €84.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The non-cash stock-based compensation expenses included in these amounts were €53.0 million and €30.1 million, respectively.
R&D Expenses: For the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, research and development expenses increased by €18.5 million from €52.4 million in 2015 to €70.9 million in 2016. Personnel expenses increased by €8.8 million from €35.5 million in 2015 to €44.3 million in 2016, notably due to a €1.6 million increase in wages and salaries, and a €11.5 million increase in non-cash stock based compensation expense, partially offset by a €4.3 million decrease in social charges on stock options and free share grants. Purchases and external expenses increased by €9.8 million from €15.2 million in 2015 to €25.0 million in 2016, due to increased expenses related to UCART123 and other product candidates’ development, including payments to third parties and costs related to preparation of UCART123 clinical trials, purchases of biological materials and expenses associated with the use of laboratories and other facilities.
SG&A Expenses: During the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, we recorded €27.2 million and €39.2 million, respectively, of selling, general and administrative expenses. The increase of €12.0 million primarily reflects (i) an increase of €10.7 million in personnel expenses from €19.6 million to €30.3 million attributable to a €0.9 million increase in wages and salaries, an increase of €11.4 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by a decrease of €1.6 million of social charges on stock options and free share grants, (ii) an increase of €1.9 million in purchases and external expenses and (iii) a decrease of €0.6 in other expenses due to lower business taxes and lower provisions.
Financial Gain (Loss): The financial gain was €7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the financial gain was null for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in financial income and expenses between 2016 and 2015 was mainly attributable to the decrease of €5.9 million in net foreign exchange gain, €1.6 million foreign exchange derivatives fair value expense, and €0.9 million current financial assets fair value expenses, partially offset by an increase of €0.5 million in interest income.
Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Shareholders of Cellectis: During the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, we recorded a net loss of €20.5 million (or € 0.60 per share on both a basic and a diluted basis) and a net loss of €60.8 million (or €1.72 per share on both a basic and diluted basis), respectively. Adjusted loss attributable to shareholders of Cellectis for the year ended December 31, 2016 was €7.8 million (€0.22 per share on both a basic and a diluted basis) compared to Adjusted income attributable to shareholders of Cellectis of € 9.6 million (€0.28 per share on both a basic and a diluted basis), for the year ended December 31, 2015. Adjusted income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 excludes non-cash stock-based compensation expense of €53.0 million and €30.1 million, respectively.

UCART123 is a gene-edited T-cell investigational drug that targets CD123, an antigen expressed at the surface of leukemic cells in AML, tumoral cells in BPDCN. The clinical research for AML will be led, at Weill Cornell, by principal investigator Dr. Gail J. Roboz, Director of the Clinical and Translational Leukemia Programs and Professor of Medicine. The UCART123 clinical program for BPDCN will be led, at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, by Dr. Naveen Pemmaraju, MD, Assistant Professor, and Professor Hagop Kantarjian, MD, Department Chair, Department of Leukemia, Division of Cancer Medicine.
AML is a devastating clonal hematopoietic stem cell neoplasm that is characterized by uncontrolled proliferation and accumulation of leukemic blasts in bone marrow, peripheral blood and, occasionally, in other tissues. These cells disrupt normal hematopoiesis and rapidly cause bone marrow failure and death. In the U.S. alone, there are an estimated 19,950 new AML cases per year, with 10,430 estimated deaths per year.
BPDCN is a very rare and aggressive hematological malignancy that is derived from plasmacytoid dendritic cell precursors. BPDCN is a disease of bone marrow and blood cells but also often affects skin and lymph nodes.
“The FDA’s approval of Cellectis’ UCART123 – the first “off-the-shelf” CAR T-cell product candidate to enter clinical trials in the U.S. – is a major milestone not only for the Company but also for the medical community, global biotech and pharmaceutical industries at large,” said Dr. Loan Hoang-Sayag, Cellectis Chief Medical Officer. “Cellectis’ allogeneic UCART products have the potential to create an important shift with regard to availability, and cost-effectiveness, to make these therapies widely accessible to patient population across the world.”
“After the National Institutes of Health's Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC)’s unanimous approval of two Phase 1 study protocols for Cellectis’ UCART123 in December 2016, the FDA’s approval of Cellectis’ IND is a new major regulatory milestone achieved, for having UCART123 proceed into clinical development and reaching cancer patients in need,” added Stephan Reynier, Chief Regulatory and Compliance Officer, Cellectis.

Publication in Scientific Reports, a Nature Publishing Group Journal

January 23, 2017 – New York (N.Y.) – Cellectis (Alternext: ALCLS; Nasdaq: CLLS), a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing immunotherapies based on gene edited CAR T-cells (UCART), today announced the publication of a study in Scientific Reports, a Nature Publishing Group journal, describing a novel approach to a CAR design with an integrated environmental signal utilizing oxygen concentration to manipulate the CAR T-cell response.
In this report, Alexandre Juillerat, Ph.D. and his collaborators from the Cellectis innovation team designed a new CAR architecture that contains an integrated microenvironment sensor. Low oxygen concentration is recognized as a hallmark of the microenvironment of certain solid tumors. The implementation of the novel oxygen sensitive CAR architecture empowers CAR T-cells with the possibility to auto-regulate (switch on or tune-up) their functions in low oxygen (hypoxic) environments.
With the primary purpose of implementing additional levels of safety to the CAR T-cell technologies, in particular to minimize "on-target / off-tumor” effects, this study demonstrated the possibility to use peculiarities of the tumor microenvironment to create self-decision making CAR T-cells with impaired functions at high oxygen concentration. The results showed that this system also possessed the key feature to be prone to quickly return to its off state in the absence of the inducing signal (hypoxia), a characteristic that is of prime interest to protect healthy tissues distant from the tumor site. Beyond this first in vitro proof of concept, additional studies are expected to fully assess the therapeutic potential of this approach.
Alexandre Juillerat, Ph.D. Innovation Senior Scientist
Dr. Alexandre Juillerat, Ph.D., graduated in Chemistry from the University of Lausanne, Switzerland. After receiving in 2006 his Ph.D. in protein engineering from the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL, Switzerland), he moved to the laboratory of Structural Immunology at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, France, performing structure-function studies on a major adhesin of plasmodium falciparum. In 2010, he joined the R&D department of Cellectis in Paris, France, working on the development and implementation of sequence specific designer nucleases including the transcription activator-like effector nucleases TALEN®. He then joined the Cellectis facility based in New York, NY, USA, leading projects associated with the development of the T-cell chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) technology.

January 3, 2017 – New York (N.Y.) – Cellectis (Alternext: ALCLS; Nasdaq: CLLS), a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing immunotherapies based on gene edited CAR T-cells (UCART), today announced the submission of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requesting approval to initiate Phase 1 clinical trials of UCART123 the Company’s most advanced, wholly owned TALEN® gene edited product candidate in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN).

Pending regulatory clearance, Cellectis plans to initiate Phase 1 clinical trials in the first half of 2017. This is the first IND filing for human clinical applications of a gene edited allogeneic “off-the-shelf” product candidate in the U.S. UCART123 is a gene edited T-cell investigational drug that targets CD123, an antigen expressed at the surface of leukemic cells in AML, as well as on leukemic and other tumoral cells in BPDCN.
The UCART123 program was subject to a public hearing by the National Institutes of Health's Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC) in December 2016, where it received the unanimous approval of the RAC committee members.
AML is a devastating clonal hematopoietic stem cell neoplasm that is characterized by uncontrolled proliferation and accumulation of leukemic blasts in bone marrow, peripheral blood and, occasionally, in other tissues. These cells disrupt normal hematopoiesis and rapidly cause bone marrow failure and death. In the U.S. alone, there are an estimated 19,950 new AML cases per year, with 10,430 estimated deaths per year.
The clinical research at Weill Cornell will be led by principal investigator Dr. Gail J. Roboz, Director of the Clinical and Translational Leukemia Programs and Professor of Medicine. BPDCN is a very rare and aggressive hematological malignancy that is derived from plasmacytoid dendritic cell precursors. BPDCN is a disease of bone marrow and blood cells but also often affects skin and lymph nodes.
The UCART123 clinical program at MD Anderson will be led by Dr Naveen Pemmaraju, MD, Assistant Professor, and Professor Hagop Kantarjian, MD, Department Chair, Department of Leukemia, Division of Cancer Medicine.
The manufacturing process of Cellectis’ allogeneic CAR T-cell product line, Universal CARTs or UCARTs, yields frozen, off-the-shelf, engineered CAR T-cells. UCARTs are meant to be readily available CAR T-cells for a large patient population. Their production can be industrialized and standardized with defined pharmaceutical release criteria.
“Following a Pre-IND meeting with the FDA in August 2016 and a NIH-RAC public hearing in December 2016, filing this IND is an important regulatory milestone for the Company. It represents many years of research and development by a dedicated team focused on developing highly innovative UCART products for the benefit of patients”, stated Stephan Reynier, Chief Regulatory and Compliance Officer, Cellectis.
Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Loan Hoang-Sayag, commented: “UCART123 represents a unique therapeutic approach for patients with unmet medical needs such as relapsed or refractory AML, high risk AML and BPDCN and we are excited to move this experimental product into clinical development. We have designed robust Phase 1 clinical trials to better understand the potential of UCART123 to address the needs of different patient populations.”

(Alternext: ALCLS - Nasdaq: CLLS), a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing immunotherapies based on gene edited CAR T-cells (UCART), today announced its results for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 and for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016.Recent Corporate HighlightsUCART19 in collaboration with Servier / Pfizer• On June 20, 2016, Cellectis announced that the first patient in Servier’s UCART19 Phase 1 clinical trial had been dosed. The UCART19 Phase 1 clinical trial in ALL and CLL patients is conducted at two clinical sites in the UK – at the Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH), part of UCL, for the pediatric arm of the trial, and at Kings College London for the adult arm of the study.• Interim data from the UCART19 Phase 1 clinical trial is expected to be announced at a scientific meeting in H1 2017.UCART123• On November 15, 2016, Cellectis announced the successful completion of large scale production runs of UCART123, according to cGMP standards. Cellectis is planning to file an IND for a Phase 1 clinical trial in AML and BPDCN patients by YE 2016 in collaboration with the Weill Cornell Medical College and the MD Anderson Cancer Center.• Weill Cornell will present pre-clinical data on UCART123 in an oral presentation at the 58th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition. The meeting will be held from December 3 to 6, 2016 in San Diego.Pfizer Partnership• Cellectis and Pfizer are making advances in their partnered programs. Notably, Pfizer will present on the “Preclinical Evaluation of Allogeneic Anti-BCMA Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cells with Safety Switch Domains and Lymphodepletion Resistance for the Treatment of Multiple Myeloma” in an oral presentation at ASH in December 2016.IP / Patent Portfolio• Issuance of U.S. patent 9,458,439 – which claims gene inactivation by use of chimeric restriction endonucleases. This patent, granted by the USPTO to the Institut Pasteur and Boston Children's Hospital, naming Dr. André Choulika and Pr. Richard C. Mulligan as co-inventors, is exclusively licensed to Cellectis.Award• Cellectis won EuropaBio’s 2016 Most Innovative European Biotech SME Award for the healthcare category. The Awards program is a unique annual initiative that recognizes innovative biotech small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Europe and the crucial role that they play in answering some of society’s greatest challenges through biotechnology.Conferences• Cellectis will participate in the upcoming Oppenheimer Life Sciences Summit being held in NYC on November 29, 2016 and will be presenting at the Piper Jaffray 28th Annual Health Care Conference on November 30, 2016 in NYC.Calyxt – Cellectis’ plant science subsidiary• Calyxt expanded its patent portfolio with U.S. patent 9,458,439, which encompasses broad uses of technologies such as CRISPR/Cas9, Zinc Finger Nucleases and TAL-effector Nucleases for plant gene editing.• On October 20, 2016 Cellectis hosted, along with its agricultural biotech subsidiary Calyxt, the world’s first dinner made with gene edited foods in New York.• Calyxt has completed the 2016 expansion of its high-oleic/no trans-fat soybean variety (CAL1501) in the U.S. with a production of 1,200 tons of beans. In Spring 2016, Calyxt planted 942 acres (381 hectares) in six U.S. states – Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, South Dakota and Wisconsin. To date, the Company has harvested approximately 45,000 bushels with the intent to use a substantial portion of the harvest for its first industrial scale crush.Financial ResultsCellectis’ consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, or IFRS, as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“GAAP”).Third Quarter 2016 Financial ResultsCash: As of September 30, 2016, Cellectis had €264.0 million in total cash, cash equivalents and current financial assets compared to €269.7 million as of June 30, 2016. This decrease of €5.7 million notably reflects (i) the net cash flows used in operating activities of €1.7 million, which includes €9.2 million of cash receipts in the third quarter of 2016 in connection with the achievement of two milestones under our collaboration agreement with Servier that occurred during the second quarter of 2016, and (ii) capital expenditures of €2.2 million. The change was also attributable to the unrealized negative translation effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our U.S. dollar cash, cash equivalents and current financial assets of €1.6 million.Revenues and Other Income: During the quarters ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, we recorded €10.0 million and €11.3 million, respectively, in revenues and other income. This is mainly due to (i) the increase of €2.5 million in collaboration revenues, notably due to the agreement to provide Servier with raw materials and batches of UCART19 products, partly offset by (ii) the decrease of €0.3 million in research tax credit and €0.8 million in subsidies.Total Operating Expenses and Other Operating Income: Total operating expenses and other operating income for the third quarter of 2016 were €22.9 million, compared to €23.4 million for the third quarter of 2015. The non-cash stock-based compensation expenses included in these amounts were €12.1 million and €9.5 million, respectively.R&D Expenses: For the quarters ended 2015 and 2016, research and development expenses decreased by €2.3 million from €16.2 million in 2015 to €13.8 million in 2016. Personnel expenses decreased by €1.1 million from €10.3 million in 2015 to €9.2 million in 2016, notably due to a €2.5 million decrease in social charges on stock options and free share grants, partly offset by a €0.4 million increase in wages and salaries, and a €0.9 million increase in non-cash stock based compensation expense. Purchases and external expenses and other expenses decreased by €1.2 million from €5.8 million in 2015 to €4.6 million in 2016.SG&A Expenses: During the quarters ended 2015 and 2016, we recorded €6.9 million and €8.7 million, respectively, of selling, general and administrative expenses. The increase of €1.8 million primarily reflects (i) an increase of €0.9 million in personnel expenses from €5.7 million to €6.7 million, attributable, among other things, to an increase of €1.7 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, partly offset by a decrease of €1.0 million of social charges on stock options and free share grants, and (ii) an increase of €0.9 million in purchases and external expenses and other charges.Financial Gain (Loss): The financial gain was €0.7 million for the third quarter of 2015 compared with a financial loss of €1.0 million for the third quarter of 2016. The change in financial result was primarily attributable to the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our U.S. dollar cash and cash equivalent accounts.Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Shareholders of Cellectis: During the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, we recorded a net loss of €12.8 million (or €0.36 per share on both a basic and a diluted basis) and net loss of €12.6 million (or €0.36 per share on both a basic and a diluted basis), respectively. Adjusted loss attributable to shareholders of Cellectis for the third quarter of 2016 was €0.5 million (€0.01 per share on both a basic and a diluted basis) compared to adjusted loss attributable to shareholders of Cellectis of €3.3 million (€0.09 per share on both a basic and a diluted basis), for the third quarter of 2015. Adjusted loss attributable to shareholders of Cellectis for the third quarter of 2016 and 2015 excludes non-cash stock-based compensation expense of €12.1 million and €9.5 million, respectively. Please see "Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for reconciliation of GAAP net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis to Adjusted income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis.First Nine Months 2016 Financial ResultsCash: As of September 30, 2016, Cellectis had €264.0 million in total cash, cash equivalents and current financial assets compared to € 314.2 million as of December 31, 2015. This decrease of €50.3 million was primarily driven by (i) €30.8 million of cash used in operating activities, notably in connection with the initiation of industrial Good Manufacturing Practice (“GMP”) production of UCART123, increased expenses in materials required of GMP production of UCART 123 and other targets, a payment of €7.2 million of value added taxes related to proceeds received in the fourth quarter of 2015 from Servier, partly offset by cash receipts of €9.2 million in connection with the achievement of two milestones under our collaboration agreement with Servier that occurred during the second quarter of 2016 and (ii) €11.3 million of cash used in investment activities, primarily through Calyxt’s land acquisition and greenhouse construction in an aggregate amount of €8.9 million. The decrease was also partially attributable to the negative unrealized translation effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our U.S. dollar cash, cash equivalents and current financial assets accounts of €7.4 million.Cellectis expects that its cash, cash equivalents and Current financial assets of €264.0 million as of September 30, 2016 will be sufficient to fund its current operations through the end of 2018.Revenues and Other Income: During the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, we recorded €27.2 million and €38.9 million, respectively, in revenues and other income. This is mainly due to the increase of (i) €9.6 million in collaboration revenues mainly due to both the agreement to provide Servier with raw materials and additional batches of UCART19 products and the achievement of two milestones (totaling €11.7 million) under our collaboration agreement with Servier and (ii) €3.1 million in research tax credit, partly offset by a decrease of €0.9 million in research subsidies, resulting from the termination of research programs.Total Operating Expenses and Other Operating Income: Total operating expenses and other operating income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 were €80.9 million, compared to €56.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The non-cash stock-based compensation expenses included in these amounts were €39.9 million and €17.5 million, respectively.R&D Expenses: For the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, research and development expenses increased by €15.8 million from €36.4 million in 2015 to €52.2 million in 2016. Personnel expenses increased by €8.4 million from €24.3 million in 2015 to €32.7 million in 2016, notably due to a €1.9 million increase in wages and salaries, and a €12.6 million increase in non-cash stock based compensation expense, partly offset by a €6.1 million decrease in social charges on stock options and free share grants. Purchases and external expenses increased by €7.6 million from €11.0 million in 2015 to €18.6 million in 2016, due to increased expenses related to innovation and platform development, including payments to third parties participating in product development, purchases of biological raw materials and expenses associated with the use of laboratories and other facilities.SG&A Expenses: During the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, we recorded €19.1 million and €27.8 million, respectively, of selling, general and administrative expenses. The increase of €8.7 million primarily reflects (i) an increase of €7.4 million in personnel expenses from €14.0 million to €21.4 million, attributable, among other things, to a €0.5 million increase in wages and salaries, and an increase of €9.9 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, partly offset by a decrease of €3.0 million of social charges on stock options and free share grants, and (ii) an increase of €1.0 million in purchases and external expenses.Financial Gain (Loss): The financial gain was €0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared with financial loss of €6.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The change in financial result was primarily attributable to the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our U.S. dollar cash and cash equivalent accounts.Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Shareholders of Cellectis: During the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, we recorded a net loss of €28.8 million (or € 0.85 per share on both a basic and a diluted basis) and a net loss of €48.3 million (or €1.37 per share on both a basic and diluted basis), respectively. Adjusted loss attributable to shareholders of Cellectis for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was €8.4 million (€0.24 per share on both a basic and a diluted basis) compared to adjusted loss attributable to shareholders of Cellectis of € 11.3 million (€0.33 per share on both a basic and a diluted basis), for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Adjusted loss attributable to shareholders of Cellectis for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 excludes a non-cash stock-based compensation expense of €39.9 million and €17.5 million, respectively.

November 15, 2016 – New York (N.Y.) – Cellectis (Alternext: ALCLS; Nasdaq: CLLS), a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing immunotherapies based on gene edited CAR T-cells (UCART), today announced that a series of production runs of UCART123, a Company’s wholly-owned TALEN® gene edited product candidate, was successfully performed in large scale, according to cGMP standards, for the purpose of conducting two Phase 1 clinical trials in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN).

The cGMP manufacturing of UCART123 clinical batches has been operated with CELLforCURE, a LFB group company and the largest industrial facility for clinical and commercial production of innovative cell and gene therapies in Europe. CELLforCURE is in charge of implementing cGMP manufacturing processes that are designed and developed by Cellectis.
The manufacturing process for Cellectis’ allogeneic CAR T-cell product line, Universal CARTs or UCARTs, yields frozen, off-the-shelf, engineered CAR T-cells. UCARTs are meant to be readily available CAR T-cells for a large patient population. Their production can be industrialized and standardized with defined pharmaceutical release criteria.
UCART123 is an engineered T-cell product candidate that targets CD123, an antigen that is located on CD123-expressing leukemic cells in AML as well as leukemic and other tumoral cells in BPDCN. We are planning to file an Investigational New Drug application (IND) with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in order to initiate clinical studies. AML is a devastating clonal hematopoietic stem cell neoplasm characterized by uncontrolled proliferation and accumulation of leukemic blasts in the bone marrow, peripheral blood, and occasionally in other tissues. These cells disrupt normal hematopoiesis and rapidly cause bone marrow failure and death. In the U.S. alone, there are an estimated 19,950 new AML cases per year, with 10,430 estimated deaths per year.
Preclinical and translational activities on UCART123 in AML are performed in collaboration with Dr. Monica Guzman, Associate Professor of Pharmacology in Medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College. The clinical research at Weill Cornell will be led by principal investigator Dr. Gail J. Roboz, Director of the Clinical and Translational Leukemia Programs and Professor of Medicine.
BPDCN is a very rare and aggressive hematological malignancy that is derived from plasmacytoid dendritic cell precursors. BPDCN is primarily a disease of the bone marrow and blood cells, but also often affects skin and lymph nodes.
Cellectis collaborates with the MD Anderson Cancer Center on the preclinical development of UCART123 in BPDCN preliminary to the Phase I clinical trial in BPDCN to be activated. The UCART123 clinical program at MD Anderson will be led by Professor Hagop Kantarjian, MD, Department Chair, Department of Leukemia, Division of Cancer Medicine.
“We are proud of achieving this important milestone for UCART123, our first wholly owned product candidate. The successful translation of an R&D concept into a cGMP clinical grade industrial product is one of the key gating factors for us to move into clinical trials,” said Arjan Roozen, Vice President, GMP Solutions and Manufacturing.
“With this work and Cellectis’ breakthrough TALEN®-based gene editing technology, we continue building upon the Company’s milestones as a pioneer in the field, strengthening our pipeline and bringing us closer and closer to finding efficient and cost-effective products for cancer patients across the globe,” added David J.D. Sourdive, Executive Vice President, Corporate Development, Cellectis.]]>

Two Patents of a Family Claiming the Basic Uses of Chimeric Restriction Nucleases for Gene Editing in Any Type of Cells

October 4, 2016 – New York (NY) – Cellectis (Alternext: ALCLS; Nasdaq: CLLS), a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing immunotherapies based on gene edited CAR T-cells (UCART), today announced the issuance of U.S. patent 9,458,439 – which claims gene inactivation by use of chimeric restriction endonucleases. This patent granted by the USPTO to the Institut Pasteur and Boston Children's Hospital naming Dr. André Choulika and Pr. Richard C. Mulligan as co-inventors, is exclusively licensed to Cellectis.
This issued U.S. patent 9,458,439 claims the method of introducing chromosomal modifications at a locus by induction of double-stranded DNA cleavage using a chimeric restriction endonuclease and non-homologous end joining recombination (NHEJ). This pivotal invention is at the basis of current nuclease-based precise gene inactivation techniques using chimeric restriction endonuclease such as Cas9/CRISPR (and related families), Zinc finger Nucleases, TAL-Effector Nucleases, Mega-TALEs, some Meganucleases i.e. endonucleases generated by the juxtaposition of specific DNA binding sequences and DNA cleavage domains with a recognition site of at least 12 base pairs. This technology is universal as it can be applied to any types of cells, including human, animal, plant cells or microorganisms.
This new patent follows U.S. patent 8,921,332 issued on December 30th, 2014, which claims the use of chimeric restriction endonucleases for directing chromosomal gene editing in cells by homologous recombination.
This new patent complements Cellectis’ strong portfolio of gene editing technologies that are implemented in its CAR T-cell product candidates, as well as within its Minnesota-based agricultural biotechnology subsidiary, Calyxt, which develops food products with healthier characteristics.
The inventors of this patent are Dr. André Choulika, Chairman & CEO of Cellectis and one of the pioneers in the development of nuclease-based genome editing technologies, and Professor Richard C. Mulligan, Mallinckrodt Professor of Genetics, Emeritus, at Harvard Medical School and a Founding Partner of Sarissa Capital Management. Professor Mulligan is a world-renowned scientist and former member of Cellectis’ Board of Directors whose laboratory has made seminal contributions to the development of fundamental gene transfer and gene therapy technologies.
Claim 1 of the U.S. patent 9,458,439: “A method for attenuating or inactivating an endogenous gene of interest in a cell in vitro comprising: inducing in the cell double stranded cleavage of chromosomal DNA at a genomic site of interest in the specific sequence to be modified, wherein the inducing comprises contacting the genomic site of interest with a chimeric restriction endonuclease, said chimeric restriction endonuclease comprising a DNA binding sequence and a DNA cleavage domain, and said restriction endonuclease recognizing a DNA sequence of at least 12 bp, wherein said restriction endonuclease is introduced as a protein or is encoded by a nucleic acid vector that is expressed, thereby inducing a cellular repair mechanism which leads to highly efficient recombinational events at said genomic site of interest, wherein said recombinational events introduce a mutation into said genomic site of interest, thereby modifying the specific sequence in the chromosomal DNA of the cell and thereby attenuating or inactivating an endogenous gene of interest in said cell.”
Claim 1 of the U.S. patent 8,921,332: “A method of modifying a specific sequence in chromosomal DNA of a cell in vitro comprising: inducing in the cell double stranded cleavage of chromosomal DNA at a genomic site of interest in the specific sequence to be modified, wherein the inducing comprises contacting the genomic site of interest with a chimeric restriction endonuclease, said chimeric restriction endonuclease comprising a DNA binding sequence and a DNA cleavage domain, and said restriction endonuclease recognizing a DNA sequence of at least 12 bp, wherein said restriction endonuclease is introduced as a protein or is encoded by a nucleic acid vector that is expressed; and contacting said cell with a targeting DNA or a nucleic acid vector encoding said targeting DNA in an amount sufficient to produce recombination between said targeting DNA and said chromosomal DNA at the site of interest, wherein said targeting DNA comprises (1) DNA homologous to the region surrounding the genomic site of interest and (2) DNA which modifies the specific sequence upon recombination between said targeting DNA and said chromosomal DNA, thereby modifying the specific sequence in the chromosomal DNA of the cell.”]]>

New York, N.Y. – June 20, 2016 – Cellectis (Alternext: ALCLS – Nasdaq: CLLS), a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing immunotherapies based on gene edited CAR T-cells (UCART), today announced that the first patient has been treated in the Phase I study of UCART19 in pediatric acute B lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) at the University College of London (UCL). This UCART19 clinical trial is sponsored by Servier in close collaboration with Pfizer.

The pediatric Phase I is an open label, non-comparative, monocenter study to evaluate the safety and ability of UCART19 to induce molecular remission in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory CD19 positive B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ahead of planned allogeneic haematopoeitic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT).
Cellectis will receive a milestone payment from Servier of an undisclosed amount.
About UCART19
UCART19 is an allogeneic CAR T-cell product candidate developed for treatment of CD19-expressing hematological malignancies, gene edited with TALEN®. UCART19 is initially being developed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Cellectis’ approach with UCART19 is based on the preliminary positive results from clinical trials using autologous products based on the CAR technology, and has the potential to overcome the limitation of the current autologous approach by providing an allogeneic, frozen, “off-the-shelf” T cell based medicinal product.
In November 2015, Servier acquired the exclusive rights to UCART19 from Cellectis. Following further agreements, Servier and Pfizer began collaborating on a joint clinical development program for this cancer immunotherapy. Pfizer has exclusive rights from Servier to develop and commercialize UCART19 in the United States, while Servier retains exclusive rights for all other countries.]]>

This notably reflects (i) the initiation of industrial GMP UCART123 production, (ii) increased expenses in GMP materials (iii) payment of €7.2 million of Value Added Taxes related to the proceeds received in the fourth quarter of 2015 from Servier and (iv) Calyxt’s acquisition of a 10-acre parcel for €5.2 million. The change was also attributable to the unrealized translation effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our U.S. dollar cash and cash equivalent accounts.Revenues and Other Income: During the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2016, we recorded €9.2 million and €9.5 million, respectively, in revenues and other income.Total Operating Expenses and Other Operating Income: Total operating expenses and other operating income for the first quarter of 2016 were €29.9 million, compared to €12.8 million for the first quarter of 2015. The non-cash stock-based compensation expenses included in these amounts were €13.4 million and €0.8 million, respectively.R&D Expenses: For the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2016, research and development expenses increased by €11.4 million from €7.4 million in 2015 to €18.9 million in 2016. Personnel expenses increased by €7.2 million from €4.7 million in 2015 to €11.9 million in 2016, notably due to a €1.0 million increase in wages and salaries, and a €7.2 million increase in non-cash stock based compensation expense, partly offset by a €1.0 million decrease in social charges on stock option and free shares grants. Purchases and external expenses increased by €4.2 million from €2.4 million in 2015 to €6.6 million in 2016, due to increased expenses related to innovation and platform development, including payments to third parties participating in product development, purchases of biological raw materials and expenses associated with the use of laboratories and other facilities.SG&A Expenses: During the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2016, we recorded €5.4 million and €10.5 million, respectively, of selling, general and administrative expenses. The increase of €5.2 million primarily reflects (i) an increase of €4.5 million in personnel expenses from €3.7 million to €8.3 million, attributable, among other things, to an increase of €5.4 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, partly offset by a decrease of €1.1 million of social charges on stock options and free share grants, and (ii) an increase of €0.8 million in purchases and external expenses.Financial gain (loss): The financial gain was €9.9 million for the first quarter of 2015 compared with financial loss of €9.1 million for the first quarter of 2016, which does not reflect actions undertaken to mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations that were adopted at the end of the first quarter of 2016. The change in financial result was primarily attributable to the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our U.S. dollar cash and cash equivalent accounts.Net Loss Attributable to Shareholders of Cellectis: During the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2016, we recorded a net income of €6.3 million (or €0.20 per share on a basic basis and €0.19 per share on a diluted basis) and a loss of €29.5 million (or €0.84 per share on both a basic and diluted basis), respectively. Adjusted net loss attributable to shareholders of Cellectis for the first quarter of 2016 was €16.1 million (€0.46 per share on both a basic and a diluted basis) compared to adjusted net income attributable to shareholders of Cellectis of €7.0 million (€0.22 per share on both a basic and a diluted basis), for the first quarter of 2015. Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis for the first quarter of 2016 and 2015 excludes a non-cash stock-based compensation expense of €13.4 million and €0.8 million, respectively. Please see "Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for a reconciliation of GAAP net income to adjusted net income.Financial Guidance: Cellectis expects that its cash, cash equivalents and Current financial assets of €276.5 million as of March 31, 2016 will be sufficient to fund its current operations through 2018. ]]>

					http://www.cellectis.com/en/press/cellectis-and-mabquest-announce-immunotherapy-partnership-on-new-class-of-pd-1-antagonist-monoclonal-antibodies/#When:20:30:00Z
New York, N.Y. & Pully, Switzerland – March 16, 2016 – Cellectis (Alternext: ALCLS – Nasdaq: CLLS), a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing immunotherapies based on gene edited CAR T-cells (UCART), and MabQuest SA, a biotech company focused on the development of antibody-based therapeutic interventions, announced that they have entered into a research collaboration and license agreement pertaining to the development of a new class of monoclonal antibodies targeting PD-1.
The action of these PD-1 antibodies is to promote the recovery of T-cells from exhaustion through a new mechanism of action. This new class of antibodies differs from currently approved anti-PD-1 mAbs in that they do not block the PD-1-PD-L1 interaction. These anti-PD-1 mAbs have potential uses for multiple indications in immunotherapy, including notably treatments for a variety of cancers. Cellectis plans to use this new class of anti-PD-1 antibodies either in combination therapy with its gene-edited UCART product candidates or single-agent or in combination with other already approved immunotherapy drugs.In vitro studies have shown that the combination of these novel PD-1 mAbs with currently approved anti-PD-1 mAbs enhances the recovery of T-cells from exhaustion. Due to their new mechanism of action, these anti-PD-1 mAbs may be used in combination with other PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, such as Nivolumab and Pembrolizumab, or other checkpoints inhibitors and immunotherapy approaches for boosting the therapeutic effects of single therapy. Furthermore, this novel class of anti-PD-1 mAbs may represent an alternative and effective therapeutic intervention in those cancer patients with tumors expressing low levels of PD-L1, with respect to the currently approved anti-PD-1 mAbs. In addition, Cellectis intend to combine these PD-1 mAbs with its gene-edited UCART product candidates to enhance their activity and increase their half-life.The agreement includes a collaboration phase funded by Cellectis whereby Cellectis and MabQuest will jointly pursue preclinical research on several candidate antibodies; and a clinical development and commercialization phase of the best selected antibodies which will be led by Cellectis.Under the agreement, MabQuest has granted an exclusive option to Cellectis. Upon exercise of the option, Cellectis would be granted worldwide exclusive rights over the family of PD-1 antagonist antibodies developed under the collaboration for all fields, and further potential derivatives of these antibodies.“We are very pleased to have signed this agreement with MabQuest, with founders and lead scientists who have great expertise in the field of immunology and monoclonal antibodies,” said André Choulika, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Cellectis. “This collaboration is an important building block for our gene-edited UCART product candidates and for our immunotherapy franchise. This new partnership fits perfectly into Cellectis’ strategy of expanding our focus in the cancer immunotherapy space with our CAR T-cell based approaches.”“The collaboration agreement with Cellectis is a tremendous opportunity for MabQuest to move into clinical development with this new class of anti-PD-1 mAbs. This collaboration will also boost MabQuest’s discovery program to develop additional antibody-based strategies to modulate the host immune system,” said Dr. Giuseppe Pantaleo, President of MabQuest and Professor of Medicine and Chief of the Service of Immunology and Allergy at the Lausanne University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland.]]>

Cellectis reclassified certain expenses related to the year ended December 31, 2015 from SG&A expenses to R&D expenses in the fourth quarter of 2015. Personnel and other costs related to information technology, human resources, business development, legal, intellectual property and general management that were initially reported during the first three quarters of 2015 in SG&A have been reclassified as R&D costs based on the time that employees spent contributing to R&D activities versus general and administrative activities. This allocation change is effective starting in 2015, and is due to the increased level of efforts towards our R&D activities in order to develop product candidates and work toward clinical phases. We approved the reallocation in the fourth quarter of 2015 and assess the performance of the Group based on this new classification.
Except for information related to the year ended December 31, 2014, which is based on reported figures, all 2015 information below is based on these reclassified figures.
Fourth Quarter 2015 Financial Results
Cash Position: As of December 31, 2015 Cellectis had €314.2 million in cash and cash equivalents compared to €112.3 million as of December 31, 2014. This increase is primarily attributable to the $228 million of proceeds from Cellectis’ U.S. initial public offering in March 2015 and €42.8 million proceeds in the fourth quarter of 2015 received from Servier in connection with the early exercise of its option to acquire the exclusive worldwide rights to further develop and commercialize UCART19 (including €7.2 million of Value Added Taxes which were repaid in January 2016), partly offset by €39.5 million of net cash flows used in operating activities (excluding the €42.8 million of proceeds from Servier mentioned above), €3.9 million of acquisitions of tangible assets, and the repurchase for €3.5 million of 25% of the minority shares of Cellectis Bioresearch S.A.S, in each case during 2015.

					http://www.cellectis.com/en/press/cellectis-enters-into-new-agreement-with-cellforcure-for-the-cgmp-manufacturing-of-ucart123-for-hematological-malignancies/#When:21:30:00Z
January 19, 2016 – New York, N.Y. & Les Ulis, France – Cellectis (Alternext: ALCLS – Nasdaq: CLLS), a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing immunotherapies based on gene edited CAR T-cells (UCART), announced that it entered into a new agreement for the cGMP manufacturing of UCART123 clinical batches, Cellectis’ lead product candidate, with CELLforCURE, an LFB group company and the largest industrial facility for clinical and commercial production of innovative cell therapies in Europe. CELLforCURE will be in charge of implementing cGMP manufacturing processes designed and developed by Cellectis.

Following the recent successful production of UCART19, pursuant to this second agreement CELLforCURE will be responsible for the manufacturing of cGMP clinical batches for UCART123, the lead engineered T-cell product candidate in Cellectis’ wholly owned portfolio. UCART123 targets CD123, an antigen expressed on the surface of cancer cells in malignancies, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cells neoplasm (BPDCN).
UCARTs (Universal Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cells) are “off-the-shelf” allogeneic product candidates. Their production can be industrialized and standardized with consistent pharmaceutical release criteria, over time and from batch to batch.
Peripheral Blood Monoculear Cells from healthy donors are transduced and genetically edited with Cellectis’ TALEN® technology to seek and destroy cancer cells. This approach could lead to a drug that would be cost-effective, made readily available - “off the shelf” - to broad patient populations in hospitals without need for local CAR-T processing facilities and easily distributed across all geographies.
Dr. David J.D. Sourdive, Executive Vice President Corporate Development, Cellectis, stated: “The manufacturing campaign for UCART123 consolidates Cellectis’ GMP processes and our expertise in its industrialization while allowing Cellectis to further enhance and improve the manufacturing of its UCART product candidates.”
Dr. André Choulika, Chairman & CEO, Cellectis, added: “We are very pleased with our continued collaboration with CELLforCURE, a unique industrial platform dedicated to cell and gene therapies and equipped with a state-of-the-art cGMP manufacturing facility to foster the clinical development of UCART123. Cellectis’ cGMP manufacturing of allogeneic CAR T-cells is a paradigm change in cancer adoptive immunotherapies, for the patient's benefit.”
Pierre-Noël Lirsac, CEO of CELLforCURE stated: “The technical and pharmaceutical experience of the CELLforCURE team is a real asset, bringing its expertise to manufacture Cellectis’ cost-effectively CAR T-cell products, thus helping to make them broadly and immediately available to patients.”
Leopold Bertea, Head of the Global bioproduction division of the LFB group, added: “This new agreement confirms the excellence of the collaboration between Cellectis and CELLforCURE. We are proud to contribute to such an exciting challenge.”]]>

					http://www.cellectis.com/en/press/cellectis-announces-a-new-car-architecture-controlling-car-t-cell-functions/#When:21:30:00Z
Publication in Scientific Reports, a Nature Publishing Group Journal New York, January 11, 2016 – Cellectis (Alternext: ALCLS – Nasdaq: CLLS) today announced the publication of a study in Scientific Reports, a Nature Publishing Group journal, describing the design and development of a new CAR architecture with an integrated switch-on system that permits control over CAR T-cell functions.
This integrated switch-on system offers the advantages of controllable CAR T-cells for safety while allowing for the possibility of multiple cytotoxicity cycles using a small molecule drug.The possibility to control spatially and temporally the CAR T activity is very desirable to mitigate potential unwanted risks, such as cytokine-release syndrome (CRS)1 and the “on-target, off-tumor” effect2. To date, few strategies are available and mostly rely on suicide mechanisms that ultimately lead to a complete eradication of the engineered T-cells, thus resulting in a premature end of the treatment. Consequently, implementing non-lethal, spatio-temporal control of gene edited CAR T-cells represents an important advancement in improving the CAR T-cell technology.In this report, Alexandre Juillerat, Ph.D., and his collaborators engineered a system directly integrated within the CAR architecture. In particular, they showed that such system turns a CAR T-cell from an off-state to an on-state upon addition of a small molecule, inducing the cytolytic properties of the gene edited T-cell. Overall, this non-lethal system not only offers the advantage of a temporal control of activation to mitigate the risk of CAR-induced toxicities but also enables opportunities for spatial activation of the engineered CAR T-cells using local targeted drug delivery.Alexandre Juillerat, Ph.D. Innovation Senior ScientistDr. Alexandre Juillerat, Ph.D., graduated in Chemistry of the University of Lausanne, Switzerland. After receiving in 2006 his Ph.D. in protein engineering from the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL, Switzerland), he moved to the laboratory of Structural Immunology at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, France, performing structure-function studies on a major adhesin of plasmodium falciparum. In 2010, he joined the R&D department of Cellectis in Paris, France, working on the development and implementation of sequence specific designer nucleases including the transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN®). He then joined the Cellectis facility based in New York, NY, USA, leading projects associated with the development of the T-cell chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) technology.Design of chimeric antigen receptors with integrated controllable transient functionsAlexandre Juillerat, Alan Marechal, Jean-Marie Filhol, Julien Valton, Aymeric Duclert, Laurent Poirot and Philippe Duchateauhttp://www.nature.com/articles/srep189501 CAR T-cell therapy can cause several worrisome side effects, including the cytokine-release syndrome. The infused T-cells release cytokines, which are chemical messengers that help the T-cells carry out their duties. With cytokine-release syndrome, there is a rapid and massive release of cytokines into the bloodstream, which can lead to dangerously high fevers and precipitous drops in blood pressure.2 Off-tumor/on-target toxicities are the recognition of normal tissues expressing the tumor-associated antigen.]]>

New York, December 23, 2015 – Cellectis (Alternext: ALCLS – Nasdaq: CLLS) today announced the submission of a clinical trial application (CTA) to the Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) requesting approval to initiate UCART19 First-in-Human clinical investigation in leukemia in the United Kingdom.
This study aims to include CD19-positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) patients. Other eligibility criteria to enter clinical trials will be assessed by the investigators.
“It has been a privilege preparing this application with our team, partners, investigators and subcontractors, in close interaction with MHRA, rewarding many years of intense work to overcome the challenges that are inherent to advanced therapy medicinal products. This achievement marks an important step toward making UCART19 available to patients,” said Stephan Reynier, Chief Regulatory and Compliance Officer, Cellectis.
"The UCART19 CTA filing is a great recognition for the Company’s preclinical and manufacturing accomplishments in developing a therapeutic for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. We are all pleased with Cellectis’ progress to date with UCART19, including the filing of this CTA, and we look forward to following the progress of this program through the course of its clinical development," said Dr. Mathieu Simon, EVP, Chief Operating Officer, Cellectis.
About UCART19
UCART19 is a potential best-in-class allogeneic TALEN® gene edited T-cell product for treatment of CD19 expressing hematological malignancies, initially developed in Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Engineered allogeneic CD19 CAR T-cells currently stand out as a real therapeutic innovation for treating various types of leukemia and lymphoma. Cellectis’ approach with UCART19 is based on the preliminary positive results from clinical trials using products based on the CAR technology and has the potential to overcome the limitation of the autologous current approach by providing an allogeneic frozen, “off the shelf” T-cell based medicinal product.
On November 18, 2015 Servier exercised its worldwide option to license UCART19 and entered into a global development and commercialization collaboration with Pfizer on UCART19. According to their recent agreement, Cellectis will hand over the clinical development of UCART19 to Servier and their US partner Pfizer. Due to the early exercise, Cellectis is no longer responsible for funding the UCART19 Phase I clinical program.

Servier Also Enters Into Exclusive Global License and Collaboration Agreement with Pfizer to Co-Develop and Commercialize Therapy November 19, 2015 – New York (USA) and Suresnes (France) – Cellectis (Alternext: ALCLS; Nasdaq: CLLS) and Servier today announced that they signed an amendment to their existing collaboration agreement from February 2014 especially for UCART19, a TALEN® gene-edited allogeneic Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell (CAR-T) immunotherapy.
Under this amendment, Servier early exercises its option to acquire the exclusive worldwide rights to further develop and commercialize UCART19, which is about to enter Phase 1 development for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).In addition, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and Servier have entered into an exclusive global license and collaboration agreement to co-develop and commercialize UCART19. Under the terms of the agreement, Pfizer and Servier will work together on a joint clinical development program for UCART19 and share development costs. Pfizer will be responsible for potential commercialization of UCART19 in the United States, and Servier will retain marketing rights in countries outside the United States. Pfizer’s collaboration with Servier on UCART19 is distinct from the collaboration with Cellectis that Pfizer announced in June 2014, which did not include UCART19.UCART19 utilizes Cellectis’ proprietary, allogeneic approach to develop CAR-T therapies that engineer T-cells from non-patient donors for use in multiple patients. This is different from autologous approaches, which engineer a patient’s own T-cells.Cellectis will receive from Servier a payment of $38.2 million upon signature. In addition, Cellectis is eligible for over $300 million of milestone payments, R&D financing, and royalties on sales from Servier, based on annual net sales of commercialized products. Financial terms for the Servier agreement with Pfizer were not disclosed.“Servier’s early option exercise is a strong recognition of the potential value of UCART19 for patients, as the first allogeneic CAR-T therapy expected to move into clinical development that utilizes Cellectis’ TALEN® gene editing technologies,” said Dr. André Choulika, Ph.D., chairman and chief executive officer of Cellectis. “Cellectis aims to provide cancer patients with highly innovative best-in-class allogeneic CAR-T therapies across all geographies, and we are proud to collaborate on this license agreement with Servier and Pfizer to foster access for patients.”“The partnership between Pfizer and Servier is a major step in the development of UCART19 and our ambition to provide innovative drugs for patients in oncology, as it has been envisioned by Servier’s president, Olivier Laureau,” said Emmanuel Canet, M.D., president, Research and Development at Servier.“This collaboration on the development of the UCART19 asset builds on Pfizer’s position in the CAR-T space and our growing portfolio of investigational immuno-oncology assets, which is a major priority for our oncology business,” said Mikael Dolsten, M.D., Ph.D., president, Worldwide Research and Development at Pfizer. “This work with Servier and Cellectis underscores our companies’ shared commitment to developing unique cancer therapies that may benefit patients around the world.”]]>

New York, November 5, 2015 – Cellectis (Alternext: ALCLS – Nasdaq: CLLS) today announced that Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) and University College London (UCL)  will present encouraging data from a first in man clinical use of UCART19, at the 57th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting in Orlando during the poster session.
GOSH has treated in June 2015 a young leukemia patient under a special license from the Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) with Cellectis’ TALEN® gene edited allogeneic UCART19 product candidate because no other therapies were available for refractory relapsed Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) following mismatched allogeneic stem cell transplantation. In response to an unsolicited request from Professor Waseem Qasim, Consultant Immunologist at GOSH and Professor of Cell and Gene Therapy at University College London (UCL) Institute of Child Health, Cellectis gave its approval for the use of its UCART19 product candidate and technologies under GOSH’s "Specials" license and responsibility, for the particular clinical needs of that individual patient. Professor Qasim says: “The successful treatment of a patient with UCART19 cells represents a landmark in the use of new gene engineering technology. If replicated in other patients, it could represent a huge step forward in treating leukaemia and other cancers.” “We are very glad for this young patient to have benefited from our highly innovative TALEN® gene edited allogeneic CAR T therapy UCART19. We expect to accelerate our clinical development of TALEN® gene-edited allogeneic CAR-T therapies to further confirm this encouraging clinical proof of concept,” said Doctor Mathieu Simon, MD, Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer at Cellectis. “Our team aims to provide to patients, with unmet medical needs, access to the first allogeneic CAR-T therapy, UCART19 made with Cellectis’ TALEN® gene-editing technologies,” said Doctor André Choulika, Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Cellectis. “Cellectis had, is and will invest significant amounts of energy and creativity to provide cancer patients with an accessible, cost-effective, off-the-shelf allogeneic CAR-T therapies across all geographies. UCART19 has been provided for to a patientwho could not undergo an autologousCAR-T therapy. Our goal is to make our product candidates accessible to anyone.”  First Clinical Application of Talen Engineered Universal CAR19 T Cells in B-ALLGene Therapy and TransferProgram: Oral and Poster AbstractsSession: 801.

					http://www.cellectis.com/en/press/successful-gmp-production-process-for-ucart19/#When:20:30:00Z
New York, October 28, 2015 – Cellectis (Alternext: ALCLS – Nasdaq: CLLS) today announced that a series of three production runs of UCART19, its lead TALEN® gene edited product candidate, was performed, confirming the implementation of Cellectis’ manufacturing process in GMP conditions.
The manufacturing process for Cellectis’ allogeneic CAR T-cell product line, Universal CARTs or UCARTs, yields frozen, off-the-shelf, allogeneic, engineered CAR T-cells. UCARTs are meant to be readily available CAR T-cells for a large patient population. The TALEN®-based gene editing (knock-out of the TCR-alpha and CD52 genes) is designed to suppress T-cell alloreactivity and confer resistance to alemtuzumab to the T-cells. This important milestone shows that UCARTs can be manufactured in GMP conditions. It also demonstrates the industrial production of UCART19, as well as the capacity of Cellectis’ pipeline of UCART product candidates to be manufactured for clinical investigations.“It is very exciting to lead a novel allogeneic gene therapy platform at the critical time when a R&D concept is translated into a GMP clinical grade industrial product to be investigated in clinical studies,” said Arjan Roozen, Vice President, GMP Solutions and Manufacturing.“Cellectis has reached a critical milestone both for the Company and our industry, creating new opportunities for patients. Historically, cell-based therapies have grown in the world of individual grafts. With TALEN®-based gene editing they have now started moving toward that of industrial pharmaceutical products broadly available to patients, and Cellectis, as a leading company in the field of gene editing, is at the forefront of this evolution,” added David J.D. Sourdive, Executive Vice President, Corporate Development.About UCART19UCART19 is a potential best-in-class allogeneic engineered T-cell product for treatment of CD19 expressing hematologic malignancies, initially developed in Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

New York, July 16, 2015  – Cellectis (Alternext: ALCLS – Nasdaq Global Market: CLLS), the gene-editing company employing proprietary technologies to develop best-in-class CAR T-cell products in adoptive immunotherapy for cancer, today announced the publication of a study in Cancer Research describing the applicability of TALEN®-mediated genome editing to a scalable process, which enables the manufacturing of third-party CAR T-cell immunotherapies.
Adoptive immunotherapy using autologous T-cells endowed with chimeric antigen receptors or CARs has emerged as a powerful means of treating cancer. However, a limitation of this approach is that autologous CAR T-cells must be generated on a custom-made basis. To overcome the limitations of patient-derived CAR T-cell therapies, TALEN® mediated gene inactivation can be used to generate non-alloreactive T-cells from third-party donors in a robust, scalable manufacturing process, thus allowing "off-the-shelf" CAR T-cell immunotherapies.Laurent Poirot Ph.D. and his collaborators use this TALEN®-mediated editing approach to develop a process for the large-scale manufacturing of T-cells deficient in expression of both their T-cell receptor (TCR) and CD52, a protein targeted by alemtuzumab, a chemotherapeutic agent. Functionally, T-cells manufactured with this process do not mediate graft-versus-host reactions, and are rendered resistant to destruction by alemtuzumab. These characteristics enable the administration of alemtuzumab concurrently or prior to engineered T-cells, supporting their engraftment. Furthermore, endowing the TALEN®-engineered cells with a CD19 CAR led to efficient destruction of CD19+ tumor targets even in the presence of the chemotherapeutic agent. CAR T-cell immunotherapies can therefore be used in an “off-the-shelf” manner akin to other biological immunopharmaceuticals.Laurent Poirot, Ph.D., Head of Early DiscoveryDr. Laurent Poirot studied physics and biology at the Ecole Polytechnique in France, before earning his Ph.D. at the Strasbourg University (France) and the Harvard Medical School in Boston. He then joined the Genomics Institute of the Novartis research foundation in San Diego as a postdoctoral fellow, where he studied the development of high throughput in vivo and in vitro approaches for the study of gene functions in immune cells. He joined Cellectis in 2009 as a Project Leader, and has been working as Head of Early Discovery since 2013.Multiplex genome edited T-cell manufacturing platform for “off-the-shelf” adoptive T-cell immunotherapies Laurent Poirot1, Brian Philip2, Cécile Schiffer Mannioui1, Diane Le Clerre1, Isabelle Chion-Sotinel1, Sophie Derniame1, Pierrick Potrel1, Cécile Bas1, Laetitia Lemaire1, Roman Galetto1, Céline Lebuhotel1, Justin Eyquem1,3, Gordon Weng-Kit Cheung2, Aymeric Duclert1, Agnès Gouble1, Sylvain Arnould1, Karl Peggs2, Martin Pule2, Andrew M.

Publication in Molecular Therapy, a Nature Publishing Group JournalNew York, June 10, 2015 – Cellectis (Alternext: ALCLS – Nasdaq Global Market: CLLS), the gene-editing company employing proprietary technologies to develop best-in-class CAR T-cell products in adoptive immunotherapy for cancer, today announced the publication of a study in Molecular Therapy, a Nature Publishing Group Journal, describing the development of the next generation of engineered CAR T-cells compatible with allogeneic adoptive transfer immunotherapy.
Study Highlights• The adoptive transfer of allogeneic CAR T-cells represents a promising strategy to fight multiple cancers worldwide.• Cellectis has streamlined an engineering process to generate CAR T-cells that could be compatible with allogeneic adoptive transfer in combination with nucleoside analogues lymphodepleting drugs.When allogeneic CAR T-cell infusion is considered, host versus graft and graft versus host reactions must be avoided to prevent rejection of adoptively transferred cells, host tissue damages and to elicit significant antitumoral outcome. In this report, Julien Valton Ph.D. and his collaborators addressed these requirements by developing a multidrug resistant TCRαβ-deficient CAR T-cell. This engineered T-cell displayed efficient antitumor activity and significant resistance to purine and pyrimidine nucleoside analogues, which are currently used clinically in preconditioning lymphodepleting regimens. Their properties could prevent their alloreactivity and enable control over engraftment in patients. In addition, they are compatible in combination therapy, an approach likely to improve clinical outcomes. By providing a basic framework to develop a universal T-cell compatible with allogeneic adoptive transfer, Cellectis is laying the foundation for the large-scale utilization of CAR T-cell immunotherapies.Julien Valton, Ph.D. Innovation Senior ScientistDr. Julien Valton obtained his Ph.D. degree at Université Joseph Fourier in Grenoble (France) where he was trained as enzymologist. He then joined the Yale School of Medicine to apply his knowledge to therapeutic research, by investigating the mechanism of inhibition of receptor tyrosine kinases involved in the development of gastrointestinal cancer. In 2009, he moved a step further into the field of applied science by joining the R&D Department of Cellectis, where he actively participated to set, improve and use meganucleases and TALEN® for targeted gene therapy and genome engineering purposes.

Collaboration Will Focus on Improving Patient Outcomes in AML Using Targeted Cellular Therapy Developed by Cellectis
NEW YORK (June 2, 2015) – Weill Cornell Medical College and Cellectis have entered into a strategic translational research alliance to accelerate the development of a targeted immunotherapy for patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), a deadly blood cancer. The alliance will foster the development of Cellectis’ lead product candidate in AML, called UCART123.
The collaboration combines Weill Cornell’s broad expertise and resources in translational stem cell science and developmental therapeutics with Cellectis’ work in development and manufacturing of gene edited CAR-T cell product candidates, a special kind of immune cell that includes an antibody-derived receptor. The research will be led by co-principal investigators Dr. Gail J. Roboz, director of the leukemia program and an associate professor of medicine at Weill Cornell, and Dr. Monica Guzman, an assistant professor of pharmacology in medicine at Weill Cornell. Dr. Roboz is an internationally recognized leader in the field of acute leukemia and will design and implement clinical testing of UCART123 in patients with AML. Dr. Guzman is a renowned leukemia stem cell biologist who specializes in preclinical and early-stage testing to optimize the development of stem cell-targeted cancer drugs.
The alliance will seek to accelerate the development of Cellectis’ UCART123 in AML. Cellectis’ proprietary allogeneic CAR T-cell platform utilizes T-cells (immune cells) from healthy donors. The T-cells are engineered with a Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR), which enables them to detect specific proteins (antigens) expressed on malignant tumors. Large numbers of allogeneic CAR-modified T-cells are grown in the laboratory and then infused into a patient. The enhanced cells are designed to recognize and attack stem cells harboring the CD123 antigen, which is present on AML blast and stem cells. To enhance safety and minimize toxicity for patients, the company’s gene-editing process features customized control properties that seek to prevent the T cells from inappropriately attacking healthy tissues. Cellectis hopes to develop a cost-effective, “off-the-shelf” allogeneic CAR T-cell product, designed for efficient storage and distribution to patients around the globe.
Cellectis in April opened a new research and development facility in New York City, located in close proximity to the Weill Cornell campus.
“We are pleased to collaborate with Cellectis to develop and advance next-generation treatments for patients with this devastating form of leukemia,” said Dr. Laurie H. Glimcher, the Stephen and Suzanne Weiss Dean of Weill Cornell Medical College. “Cellectis’ proficiency in genome engineering and our complementary expertise in translational research will help us realize our common goal of improving human health in New York and around the globe.”
“CAR-T cells have shown remarkable promise in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia,” Dr. Roboz said. “Cellectis has interesting preclinical data on UCART123 and our alliance will seek to build on these findings to better understand the clinical potential of this therapy. Our patients are anxiously awaiting the start of clinical trials.”
“Weill Cornell offers unsurpassed expertise in translational research, with a wealth of leading-edge technologies and resources to help advance our pipeline of unique CAR-T product candidates,” said Dr. Mathieu Simon, executive vice president and chief operating officer at Cellectis. “We are excited by the prospect of working with Dr. Roboz, Dr. Guzman and other premier investigators in leukemia stem cell research.”
Weill Cornell’s Office of BioPharma Alliances and Research Collaborations negotiated the three-year alliance. In the program’s pre-clinical phase, Weill Cornell researchers will perform multiple analyses, including data mining of primary AML samples, immune profiling of AML patients and in vitro evaluation of allogeneically derived anti-CD123 CAR-T cells. In the alliance’s second phase, Weill Cornell and Cellectis will jointly develop protocols to facilitate early-phase testing, including phase 1 clinical trials.
“Cellectis believes the CAR-T platform has the potential to transform the way cancer patients are treated. We are confident that our broad, cross-discipline collaboration with Weill Cornell will foster creativity and speed in drug development for the benefit of clinicians and patients living with AML,” said Dr. André Choulika, chief executive officer of Cellectis.
The mission of Weill Cornell’s Office of BioPharma Alliances and Research Collaborations is to proactively generate, structure and market translational research alliances with industry in order to advance promising research projects that have commercial potential.

Paris, September 30, 2014 - Cellectis SA (Alternext: ALCLS.PA), an expert in developing immunotherapies based on engineered allogeneic CART cells (UCART), presents its first-half 2014 consolidated financial statements to June 30, 2014, approved by the Board of Directors at its meeting held on September 29.
A successful therapeutic focusA drastic reduction of its operating expensesAs of September 30, available cash stands at €103 million  • Total operating revenue is €13.8 M (as compared to €6.9 M for the first six months of 2013), i.e. an increase of 100%. Total operating revenue does not include revenue arising from the agreement signed with Pfizer, which will come into effect only from the second half of 2014.• Operating results are notably improved, with losses limited to €2.1 M (excluding Cellectis AB) as compared to €16.5 M for the first six months of 2013.• Net results show a loss of €5 M, which is in sharp contrast to the loss recorded for the first half of 2013, which amounted to €18.5 M.• As at the date of this release, available cash stands at €103 million.Limited examination procedures have been applied to the summary half-year consolidated accounts to June 30, 2014. The limited examination report is currently being issued.Group results for the first half of 2014 demonstrate the relevance of the Group’s focused therapy strategy and, as a consequence, its structural reorganization undertaken in early 2013.A successful implementation of its strategy to focus on therapeutics• Cellectis is a major player in oncology by way of its groundbreaking approach based on CART cells. With 15 years of experience of technological developments at the frontiers of science, Cellectis is able to engineer T cells with TALEN™ and to develop completely new CARs (Chimeric Antigen Receptors).• Servier and the biopharmaceutical company Pfizer are Cellectis’ two exclusive partners in the area of CARTs in oncology. The work of the three companies relates to a set of 33 targets (markers of cancerous cells), of which 6 are for Servier, 15 for Pfizer and 12 for Cellectis.• For each of the six product candidates potentially developed for Servier, Cellectis could receive more than 105 million euros of milestone payments as well as royalties on the sales of products. Likewise, for each of the product candidates potentially developed in relation to the 15 Pfizer targets, Cellectis could receive more than 145 million euros of milestone payments as well as royalties on the sales of products. In addition, Pfizer is covering all of Cellectis’ R&D costs incurred within the scope of its collaboration.• With 103 million euros of cash at present and on the back of a drastic reduction in its operating costs, the impact of which is starting to be felt in the first half of 2014, Cellectis is in a strong position to face the challenges of the coming years and to complete its transformation to being a market leader in the biopharmaceuticals sector. The company’s cash position is likely to improve by October 28, 2014, the closing date for the exercise of the share subscription warrants issued in 2011. The exercise of these share subscription warrants could contribute an additional approximately 20 million euros to the company’s cash position in case of exercise of all the warrants.• The first-in-man clinical study with its first product UCART19 for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), will begin in the second half of 2015. Servier has an exclusive option on this product.• Cellectis’ first proprietary product (outside of partnerships), UCART123 for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemias, should enter into clinical development in the course of 2016.• Without making any forecasts, Cellectis is optimistic about the offering to the general public of Scéil, dedicated to the storage of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells.• The sale of Cellectis AB marked the final stage of the Company’s therapeutic refocusing, while strengthening its high-potential subsidiary Cellectis plant sciences Inc., based in New Brighton in Minnesota.• In 7 years, by virtue of its Tools and Services business line, Cellectis has put in place the fundamentals for a worldwide reputation in genome engineering and in iPS cells. It is by means of the development of its expertise in research tools that Cellectis has been successful in developing groundbreaking technology both in therapeutics and in biotechnological agriculture. A new page in the history of Cellectis is being written.Key highlights of the first 9 months of 2014• On February 17, Cellectis signed a strategic collaboration agreement with Servier to develop and market six product candidates, paying €7.55 M on signature and up to €105 M for each of those product candidates that might be developed.• On March 24, Cellectis implemented a capital increase of €20.52 M underwritten by sector-specialist institutional investors based in the United States, in particular to speed up development of its individual (non-collaborative) portfolio of CART Cell products for treating leukemias and solid tumors.• On March 25, Cellectis received a recommendation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA), in consultation with the European Commission, for the Cellectis UCART19 product candidate in the field of adoptive immunotherapy against CD19 expressing leukemias and lymphomas. UCART19 fulfils the definition of an Advanced Therapy medicinal Product (ATmP) and is thus eligible for Scientific Advices and Assessment from the EMA Committee for Advanced Therapies and a possible European Union centralized marketing authorization.• On June 5, Cellectis concluded a series of agreements with Life Technologies in connection with applications of TALEN.• On June 5, Cellectis signed an agreement with Accelera (Nerviano Medical Sciences Group) to perform preclinical studies on its flagship product, UCART19.• On June 9, the Company announced the signature of an agreement with CELLforCURE, Europe’s largest commercial industrial facility manufacturing innovative cell therapies and a subsidiary of the LFB biopharmaceuticals group. This partnership relates to the production of clinical batches from Cellectis allogeneic CART cells, with CELLforCURE being responsible for manufacturing clinical batches of product candidates for Cellectis’ UCART range.• On June 18, Cellectis and Pfizer entered into a global collaboration agreement in the field of oncology to develop immunotherapies based on engineered T cells with Chimeric Antigen Receptors (CAR-T) directed at select targets. This agreement involves an upfront payment of $80 million and funding to cover research and development costs associated with Pfizer-selected targets and the four Cellectis-selected targets within the collaboration. Cellectis could receive development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments of up to €145 million per Pfizer product. Furthermore, Pfizer signed an investment contract to purchase around 10% of Cellectis’ capital through a reserved capital increase without preferred subscription right, and the subscription of 2,786,924 newly issued shares at a price of €9.25 per share.• Furthermore, on August 29, Cellectis sold its Swedish subsidiary, Cellectis AB, to the Japanese company Takara Bio Inc. This operation is a continuation of its focusing on therapeutics reflected in the concentration of its business in the field of oncology.The restructuring announced in 2013 and strategic refocusing on therapeutics and agro industrial areas implemented over the last 18 months have significantly reduced Group charges and its cash requirements, thereby markedly enhancing its financial situation and making the Company’s structure more agile, efficient and competitive.]]>

Collaboration to utilize Cellectis’ proprietary allogeneic CAR-T platform technology to develop immunotherapies against select targets in the field of oncology
NEW YORK and PARIS, June 18 – Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and Cellectis (Alternext: ALCLS.PA) today announced that they have entered into a global strategic collaboration to develop Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell (CAR-T) immunotherapies in the field of oncology directed at select targets. Cellectis’ CAR-T platform technology provides a proprietary, allogeneic approach (utilizing engineered T-cells from a single donor for use in multiple patients) to developing CAR-T therapies that is distinct from other autologous approaches (engineering a patient’s own T-cells to target tumor cells).
Under the terms of the agreement, Pfizer has exclusive rights to pursue development and commercialization of CAR-T therapies, in the field of oncology, directed at a total of fifteen targets selected by Pfizer. Both companies will work together on preclinical research and Pfizer will be responsible for the development and potential commercialization of any CAR-T therapies for the Pfizer-selected targets. In addition, the agreement provides for a total of twelve targets selected by Cellectis. Both companies will work together on preclinical research on four Cellectis-selected targets and Cellectis will work independently on eight additional targets. Cellectis will be responsible for clinical development and commercialization of CAR-T therapeutics for the Cellectis-selected targets. Pfizer has right of first refusal to the four Cellectis-selected targets.
Cellectis will receive an upfront payment of $80 million, as well as funding for research and development costs associated with Pfizer-selected targets and the four Cellectis-selected targets within the collaboration. Cellectis is eligible to receive development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments of up to $185 million per Pfizer product. Cellectis is also eligible to receive tiered royalties on net sales of any products that are commercialized by Pfizer.
Additionally, Pfizer will be entering into an equity agreement to purchase approximately 10% of the Cellectis capital through newly issued shares at 9.25 Euro per share, pending Cellectis shareholder approval. Approval by two-thirds of the votes cast by voting Cellectis shareholders is required for the issuance. Shareholders of Cellectis representing 52.8% of its voting rights have already undertaken to vote in favor of the issuance. In the event the sale of equity is not approved by the Cellectis shareholders, Pfizer has the option to terminate the collaboration agreement.
Cellectis expects to open a site in the United States to work more closely with scientists at Pfizer.
“We believe our CAR-T platform technology has the potential to offer a real advantage over other approaches to T-cell receptor engineering and this collaboration with Pfizer is an important step towards realizing the full potential of this technology in harnessing the body’s own immune system to fight cancer,” said Andre Choulika, PhD, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at Cellectis. “This alliance provides access to Pfizer’s state-of-the-art therapeutic development capabilities and provides a unique opportunity to advance this innovative work with the goal of developing best-in-class CAR-T therapeutics. We look forward to working closely with the team at Pfizer on researching and developing novel CAR-T therapies that could potentially change the way cancer is treated.”
“This leading immuno-oncology collaboration aimed at delivering immunotherapies is built upon Cellectis’ advanced genome editing and cell engineering capability and Pfizer’s cutting-edge biotherapeutic cancer therapy platform," said Mikael Dolsten, MD, PhD, President of R&D at Pfizer. "Combining the innovation and scientific expertise of Cellectis with Pfizer’s deep oncology and immunology experience creates a world-class partnership designed to deliver a new generation of CAR-T immunotherapies for cancer patients with urgent medical needs."

About CAR-Ts
Allogeneic CAR-Ts are “off-the-shelf” products which have the potential to be industrialized and thereby standardized, with consistent pharmaceutical release criteria, over time and from batch to batch. Each potential future patient may thus be treated by immediately receiving a single dose of a standard product with consistent quality. In addition, it is expected that such allogeneic products may be shipped in advance and would be accessible to any cancer center in the world without the need to invest in a local CAR-T processing facility.]]>

June 9, 2014 – Paris & Les Ulis, France – Cellectis (Alternext: ALCLS.PA), a leader in the development of adoptive immunotherapies based on engineered allogeneic CART cells (UCART) and CELLforCURE, the largest commercial industrial facility for the production of innovative therapeutic cell therapies in Europe, a subsidiary of the biopharmaceutical group LFB, announce that they have entered into an agreement for the cGMP manufacturing of clinical batches of Cellectis’ allogeneic CART cells.

Pursuant to this agreement, CELLforCURE will be responsible for the manufacturing of cGMP clinical batches for candidates from Cellectis’ UCART product family.
The candidates from UCART (for Universal Chimeric Antigen Receptor – T cells) product family are allogeneic cell therapy products based on the CAR (Chimeric Antigen Receptor) technology combined with genome engineering. Engineered allogeneic T-lymphocytes bearing a CAR directed at a tumor antigen stand out as a genuine therapeutic innovation in the treatment of various forms of leukemias, lymphomas and solid tumors.
UCARTs are special in that they are “off-the-shelf” allogeneic products. This brings major advantages over the autologous procedures currently undergoing clinical testing. UCARTs’ production can be industrialized and thereby standardized, with consistent pharmaceutical release criteria, over time and from batch to batch. Each future patient may thus be treated by immediately receiving a single dose of a standard product with consistent quality. The favorable cost of such industrially manufactured treatments may help making them available to a broad patient population and avoiding risks associated with the processing and the timing required for an autologous CART process. In addition, such allogeneic products may be shipped in advance and would be accessible to any cancer center in the world without the need to invest on a local CART processing facility.
Dr Mathieu Simon, MD, Executive Vice President at Cellectis stated: “We are very pleased of this partnership with CELLforCURE, a unique brand-new industrial platform dedicated to cell therapies and equipped with a state-of-the-art GMP manufacturing facility. It will ensure that Cellectis will have, in the long term, the means for the clinical development of its UCART product family and will add robustness to our ongoing regulatory applications. Moreover, it is a new way to manufacture cost-effectively CART cell products, and thus making them broadly and immediately available to patients. cGMP manufacturing of allogeneic CART cells is a paradigm change in cancer adoptive immunotherapies.”
Pierre-Noël Lirsac, CEO of CELLforCURE declared: “This partnership, signed with a company such as Cellectis, confirms the fast development of innovative therapies and the relevance of an industrial platform to manufacture these new treatments. We are proud to contribute to Cellectis’ efforts, thanks to the flexibility of our large scale facility, aiming at developing this innovative treatment in oncology based on a brand new technology."]]>

New Brighton (Minnesota, USA), May 23, 2014 – Cellectis plant sciences, the plant genome engineering company, today announced the peer-reviewed publication in the Journal of Plant Biotechnology of results demonstrating the generation of a high oleic soybean variety created by the targeted gene editing of 4 alleles of the FAD2 gene family.
The high oleic soybean line engineered by Cellectis plant sciences shows an oleic acid content of >80%.Soybean oil with elevated oleic acid is desirable for improved shelf life, enhanced oxidative stability and better nutritional quality. The health issues raised by trans-fatty acids have severely limited the use of soybean oil in fried food. Raising the level of oleic acid to ~80%, from ~20% found in commodity oil, reduces the need for hydrogenation and the resulting production of trans-fatty acids in processed soybean oil. The United Soybean Board has projected acreage of high oleic soybean to reach 18-23 million acres in the U.S. by 2023. To meet this demand, Cellectis plant sciences has now created non-transgenic high oleic soybean plants.“The generation of Non Transgenic High Oleic Soybean in less than 15 months positions Cellectis plant sciences as a key trait provider in the field of AgBiotech,” commented Luc Mathis CEO of Cellectis plant sciences. “The generation of non-transgenic traits has the potential to lower regulation costs, while providing products that show stable oil profiles over multiple generation, something that may be a challenge for transgenic technologies. With the technical success met in all our in-house programs in potato and oil crops, such as soybean and canola, the development of new commercial products relevant for the food industry has become the focus of our company.”References: Journal of Plant Biotechnology Improved soybean oil quality by targeted mutagenesis of the fatty acid desaturase 2 gene family William Haun, Andrew Coffman, Benjamin M.

New Brighton, May 19, 2014 – Cellectis (NYSE PA: ALCLS), the global genome engineering specialist, announces the issuance by the USPTO of a 4th US patent (US 8,697,853) directed to TAL-effector nucleases.

On April 15, 2014, the USPTO issued a fourth patent to the University of Minnesota and the Iowa State University for the TALENTM technology developed by Cellectis.
This patent US 8,697,853 is more particularly drawn to the genomic sequences encoding TAL-effector nucleases. These proteins developed jointly by researchers at the University of Minnesota and Iowa State University can “read” DNA and make pinpoint cuts in targeted genes.
This fourth issued patent, like the previous ones, is part of a patent portfolio owned by the Regents of the University of Minnesota and Iowa State University Research Foundation and licensed exclusively to Cellectis as per a license agreement of January 2011.
The inventors of these patents are Pr. Daniel Voytas, from the University of Minnesota who is also acting as Chief Scientific Officer of Cellectis Plant Sciences in New Brighton (MN), Pr. Adam Bogdanove formerly of Iowa State University and currently of Cornell University, and Dr. Feng Zhang, who is now Chief Operating Officer of Cellectis Plant Sciences.]]>

A transitional year
 
Paris, France, 11 April 2014 – Cellectis SA (Alternext: ALCLS) presented its consolidated financial statements for 2013, as approved by the Board of Directors at their meeting on April 10, 2014 *.
2013 Financial Statements

Operating revenue decreased by 21% in comparison with 2012, directly impacted by the brutal collapse of the tools and services market in 2013.
The operating loss mainly corresponds to an expense structure (prior to restructuring) that became inadequate in a context of weakened turnover related to the drop in tools and services sales.
The acceleration of the therapeutic focus implemented in the second semester of 2013 caused a significant adjustment in the valuation of certain assets that became non-strategic for the Group, and led to an impairment of more than €29 M. 
The global loss of €62.1 M, including €1.9 M due to redundancy plan, reflects the accounting impact of the restructuring that took place during the second semester of 2013.
As of December 31 2013, Cellectis' equity was €5M, and net cash position was €7.6M.

Future therapy developments confirmed during the first few months of 2014
The relevance of the Cellectis economic model is based on two major events:
On February 17, Cellectis signed a strategic cooperation agreement with Servier Laboratories to develop and commercialize 6 product candidates. The financial terms of the collaboration include an upfront payment of €7.55 M and up to €105 M for each of the six product candidates potentially developed.
On March 24, Cellectis closed a €20.52M share capital increase subscribed by U.S. biotechnology specialist institutional investors. The increase in share capital will be used to accelerate in-house development of the company’s proprietary T cell CAR portfolio dedicated to the treatment of leukemia and solid tumors.
As a result of an improved operating cost structure, Cellectis is currently focusing on its therapeutic activities, particularly in developing cancer immuno-adoptive therapies, while maintaining its agribusiness division, Cellectis plant sciences, dedicated to the in-house development, or development with partners, of traits for biotech crops.
As of the publication date of its financial statements for 2013, the Company estimates that its available net cash will be sufficient to finance its activity over the next 18 months.
* Audit procedures on the 2013 financial statements have been performed by the statutory auditors and their certification report will be issued after verification of the annual report. 2013 financial statements will be posted on Cellectis’ website on April 30, 2014.]]>

throughout this website










ABCDEFGHIKLMNPRTU











Adoptive immunotherapy
					Adoptive immunotherapy is based on infusing a patient with extra functioning immune cells grown from his/her own body (autologous cell therapy) or taken from a donor (allogeneic cell therapy). In the fight against cancer, allogeneic cell therapy offers something the conventional autologous approach cannot: the potential to treat large numbers of patients using a standardized, off the shelf therapeutic product.






Allogeneic
					Derived from a genetically different donor. Cellectis’ gene-editing technologies allow us to create allogeneic CAR T-cells, meaning they are derived from healthy donors rather than the patients themselves.






Autologous
					Derived from part of the same individual.







Biotechnology
					The OECD defines biotechnology as “the application of science and technology to living organisms, as well as parts, products and models thereof, to alter living or non-living materials for the production of knowledge, goods and services.” Biotechnology, or “biological technology” in full, is a cross between biology – the study of life – and a range of technological breakthroughs from specific disciplines such as microbiology, biochemistry, biophysics, genetics, molecular biology, computer science, and more.







CAR
					CARs or Chimeric Antigen Receptors are engineered molecules that, when present at the surface of T-cells, enable them to recognize specific proteins or antigens that are present on the surface of other cells. These receptors are typically used to graft the specificity of an antibody derived from a single cell, or a monoclonal antibody, onto a T-cell and provide it with a specific targeting mechanism to seek, identify, interact with and destroy the tumor cells bearing a selected antigen associated with that tumor also known as the tumor-associated antigen, or TAA.






CTA
					In Europe, the Clinical Trial Application (CTA) filing is the regulatory step consisting in submitting the required study documentation package to the health authority to obtain the authorization to perform clinical investigation.







DNA
					DNA is a molecule that occurs in every living cell. It contains all the information necessary for an organism to develop and function. It is also the basis of heredity in that it is passed on, either partially or in full, during reproduction. The genetic blueprint carried by DNA constitutes an organism’s genome.






DNA sequencing
					Invented in the second half of the 1970s, DNA sequencing involves determining the sequence of the nucleotides in a given DNA fragment. The DNA sequence contains all of the information a living organism needs to survive and reproduce. DNA sequencing can be used in medicine to identify, diagnose and possibly find cures for inherited or acquired genetic diseases. In biology, the study of DNA sequences has become a key tool, for example, in detecting defective genes.






Drug candidate
					After identification of a new potential target, a product candidate or drug candidate is developed based on compounds with strong therapeutic potential.







Electroporation
					Or electropermeabilization, is a microbiology technique in which an electrical field is applied to cells in order to increase the permeability of the cell membrane, allowing chemicals, drugs, RNA or DNA to be introduced into the cell.






EMA
					The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is a European Union agency whose main responsibility is the protection and promotion of public and animal health, through the evaluation and supervision of medicines for human and veterinary use.






Endonuclease
					An endonuclease is a type of nuclease. Nucleases cut nucleic acids into shorter fragments. Endonucleases can cut through the center of a polynucleotide chain, as opposed to exonucleases which only cleave nucleotides from the ends of the chain.






Enzyme
					Enzymes are proteins that speed up (catalyze) reactions inside organisms while themselves remaining unchanged and without altering the substances taking part in the reaction. Without enzymes, certain basic biological reactions would not happen fast enough. Enzymes enable new substances to be synthesized so that cells can form and grow (anabolism). They also help break substances down to provide the body with energy (catabolism).







FDA
					The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is a federal agency of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, responsible for protecting and promoting public health, including through the regulation and supervision of biopharmaceuticals.







Gene
					A gene is a segment of DNA that provides the blueprint for making some part of a living organism. DNA is the basic constituent of chromosomes, by which all creatures pass on their hereditary traits from parent to offspring. The stretch of DNA that makes up a gene is itself composed of nucleotides. There are 4 types of nucleotides, abbreviated as follows: A (for adenine), T (for thymine), G (for guanine), and C (for cytosine).






Genome
					A genome is the full genetic make up of an individual or species, encoded in its DNA (except for certain viruses which genome is carried by RNA molecules). The genome provides the layout for how cells should function and how hereditary traits should be passed down from one generation to the next. It contains all the coding sequences of DNA (which are transcribed via messenger RNA and translated into proteins) as well as the non coding sequences (which are not translated).






GMP
					Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) are a set of regulations applicable to the manufacturing of health products, especially medicines intended for human use, such as UCART product candidates for example. A company is required to comply with GMP regulations, in order to be granted from governmental regulatory agencies, its license to manufacture pharmaceutical products.






GvHD
					Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) is a complication which follows an allogeneic tissue transplant, consisting in immune cells in the graft recognizing the recipient as "non-self" and attacking its cells.







Homologous recombination
					A genetic recombination event between two identical sequences located on two different DNA molecules or separated from each other on the same molecule.







IND
					In the U.S., the Investigational New Drug (IND) filing is the regulatory step consisting in submitting the required study documentation package to the health authority to obtain the authorization to perform clinical investigation.







Knock-in
					In molecular biology, a knock-in is the introduction of a gene of interest into a given locus. After homologous recombination, the gene of interest is controlled by the target gene’s promoter and regulatory sequences and is therefore synthesized in lieu of the target gene.






Knock-out
					In molecular biology, a knock-out (or KO) is the complete inactivation of a gene. Knock-out is generally used when performing research on mammalian model species, such as mice or rats, or on human cell lines.







Lentivirus
					Lentivirus is a genus of retroviruses that cause chronic and deadly diseases characterized by long incubation periods, in man and other mammalian species. The best known lentivirus is the Human Immunodeficiency Virus HIV, which causes AIDS.






Lymphocyte
					Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell. As part of the immune system, they play a major role in defending the body against infection. They are produced in the bone marrow and circulate through the bloodstream and lymphatic tissues (spleen, lymph nodes).
There are two main types of lymphocyte: B cells and T cells. The difference between them is both molecular (they bear different receptors on the surface of the cell) and functional (B lymphocytes produce antibodies while T lymphocytes kill or organize the fight against abnormal or infected cells.






Lymphodepletion (via chemotherapy)
					Lymphodepletion is a medical procedure in which certain immune cells are eliminated, e.g. via chemotherapy, to prevent the body from rejecting a transplant of engineered T cells.







Meganucleases
					Meganucleases are "molecular DNA scissors" that can be used to replace, remove or modify sequences in a highly targeted way. These proteins are the perfect tools for genome engineering because they are specific enough to home in on and splice a single site per genome. meganucleases are used to modify all genome types and open up wide avenues for innovation, particularly in the field of human health (for example by removing viral genetic material or "repairing" damaged genes) and in agricultural biotechnology. meganucleases can be found in many organisms, such as archaea (also archaebacteria), bacteria, phages, fungi, yeasts, algae and certain plants.







Nuclease
					An enzyme capable of catalyzing nucleic acids—RNA (ribonucleic acid) and DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid)—into nucleotides and various components of these nucleic acids. They cut between two nucleotides in a nucleic acid strand.






Nucleotide
					A nucleotide is a basic component of DNA and RNA. It is a molecule composed of a sugar (ribose or deoxyribose), one to three phosphates and a nucleobase, also known as a nitrogenous base. Certain nucleotides combine to form the basis of DNA and RNA, while others are cofactors or coenzymes.For DNA, there are four different nucleotides, each with a different nitrogenous base:
- dAMP, a purine, which nitrogenous base is adenine (A)
- dGMP, a purine, which nitrogenous base is guanine (G)
- TMP, a pyrimidine, which nitrogenous base is thymine (T)
- dCMP, a pyrimidine, which nitrogenous base is cytosine (C).







Product candidate
					After identification of a new potential target, a product candidate or drug candidate is developed based on compounds with strong therapeutic potential.






Protein
					This is one of the most important types of molecules and is present in all living organisms and viruses. Proteins perform essential cellular functions, such as the formation of cell architecture and the modulation of cell activity. Proteins are macromolecules that are composed of long chains of amino acids (basic building blocks) and come in various forms, such as enzymes, hormones, receptors and neurotransmitters. Proteins are built from the genetic information contained in a gene.







RNA (ribonucleic acid)
					RNA is a biological molecule that occurs in virtually all living organisms, including some viruses. Chemically, it is very closely related to DNA. In fact, RNA is synthesized inside cells by copying DNA strands. Living cells use RNA especially as a messenger to convey genetic information so that our genes can make the proteins they need. RNA may also fulfill a number of other functions, taking part in many chemical reactions at the cellular level, for example.







T-cell
					A T-cell, or T lymphocyte, is a type of white blood cell that helps trigger immune responses. T-cells find and destroy foreign pathogens such as bacteria and viruses, but they will also attack the body’s own cells if those cells have undergone abnormal (e.g. cancerous) transformations.






TALEN®
					TALEN® is designed by fusing the DNA-cutting domain of a nuclease to TALE domains, which can be tailored to specifically recognize a unique DNA sequence. These fusion proteins serve as readily targetable “DNA scissors” for gene editing applications that enable us to perform targeted genome modifications such as sequence insertion, deletion, repair and replacement in living cells.
TALEN® is a registered trademark owned by the Cellectis Group.







UCART
					UCART (Universal Chimeric Antigene Receptor T-cells) are “off-the-shelf” allogeneic product candidates, whose production can be industrialized and thereby standardized with consistent pharmaceutical release criteria, over time and from batch to batch.

Cellectis a French biopharmaceutical company. It develops genome-edited chimeric antigen receptor T-cell technologies for cancer immunotherapy.[1] It was founded by André Choulika in 1999.[2]
History[edit]
Cellectis was founded by André Choulika in 1999. It built up a successful business based on the use of meganucleases in genome engineering. It made a stock offering on EuroNext in 2007, raising €21 million. In 2010 it acquired Cyto Pulse, which had developed a new electroporation technology,[3] and in 2011 it paid €26 million for Cellartis, a Swedish biotechnology company.[2] The company employed nearly 300 people.[2]
With the advent of the CRISPR – clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat – genome editing technique, the Cellectis meganuclease technology became uneconomic, and by 2013 the company was close to bankruptcy. It responded by restructuring, closing laboratories and reducing staff, and re-focusing on research into CAR-T technologies for cancer immunotherapy. Early in 2014 it reached a substantial financing deal with Servier, and later in the same year made a much larger agreement with Pfizer.[2]
In December 2015, proof-of-concept evidence for the viability of the company's TALEN-engineered T-cell technology was provided when experimental treatment of a baby with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia showed promising results.[4]

Cellectis a French biopharmaceutical company. It develops genome-edited chimeric antigen receptor T-cell technologies for cancer immunotherapy.[1] It was founded by André Choulika in 1999.[2]
History[edit]
Cellectis was founded by André Choulika in 1999. It built up a successful business based on the use of meganucleases in genome engineering. It made a stock offering on EuroNext in 2007, raising €21 million. In 2010 it acquired Cyto Pulse, which had developed a new electroporation technology,[3] and in 2011 it paid €26 million for Cellartis, a Swedish biotechnology company.[2] The company employed nearly 300 people.[2]
With the advent of the CRISPR – clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat – genome editing technique, the Cellectis meganuclease technology became uneconomic, and by 2013 the company was close to bankruptcy. It responded by restructuring, closing laboratories and reducing staff, and re-focusing on research into CAR-T technologies for cancer immunotherapy. Early in 2014 it reached a substantial financing deal with Servier, and later in the same year made a much larger agreement with Pfizer.[2]
In December 2015, proof-of-concept evidence for the viability of the company's TALEN-engineered T-cell technology was provided when experimental treatment of a baby with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia showed promising results.[4]

Cellectis a French biopharmaceutical company. It develops genome-edited chimeric antigen receptor T-cell technologies for cancer immunotherapy.[1] It was founded by André Choulika in 1999.[2]
History[edit]
Cellectis was founded by André Choulika in 1999. It built up a successful business based on the use of meganucleases in genome engineering. It made a stock offering on EuroNext in 2007, raising €21 million. In 2010 it acquired Cyto Pulse, which had developed a new electroporation technology,[3] and in 2011 it paid €26 million for Cellartis, a Swedish biotechnology company.[2] The company employed nearly 300 people.[2]
With the advent of the CRISPR – clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat – genome editing technique, the Cellectis meganuclease technology became uneconomic, and by 2013 the company was close to bankruptcy. It responded by restructuring, closing laboratories and reducing staff, and re-focusing on research into CAR-T technologies for cancer immunotherapy. Early in 2014 it reached a substantial financing deal with Servier, and later in the same year made a much larger agreement with Pfizer.[2]
In December 2015, proof-of-concept evidence for the viability of the company's TALEN-engineered T-cell technology was provided when experimental treatment of a baby with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia showed promising results.[4]
