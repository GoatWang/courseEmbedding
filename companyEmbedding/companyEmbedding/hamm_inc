Aggregate
Many types of rock material can be used on your driveway.  Hamm is available to help you pick the stone you want and calculate the volume needed for your project.
There are three basic rock products available to be placed on a driveway.  For a new driveway on a dirt base, a 3: lift of rock base material should be placed as a foundation layer.  Although the 3” base material is “big” to drive a car on, it provides the foundation needed for your driveway to ensure it will be there for many years to come.  Over the base material, we recommend a layer of 1 1/2” Road Stone in order to provide a smooth driving surface.  At this point your driveway is ready for general purpose use.  If you want a cleaner look to your new driveway add a finish layer of 1” Washed on the top of the other layer to give it a finished and clean look.  
To estimate the amount of stone needed, simply enter the dimensions of your project into the calculator below.  The calculator will total the tons necessary for your project:

Hamm |     Hamm Construction and Excavation 















Hamm Construction









Hamm, Inc. has been providing quality construction services since the early 1950’s. From small culvert replacement jobs to complex highway interchange projects, we have completed projects for cities, counties, and State agencies all over Eastern Kansas. Our experienced teams of project personnel and our extensive construction equipment fleet are well-positioned to handle grading projects of any size.

Recent Projects

Mars Chocolate Factory, Topeka, KS - earthwork and rock excavation for building pad sites, base and asphalt for parking lots and roads
National Bio & Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF), Manhattan, KS - earthwork and rock excavation for building pad site and roads
Westar Energy Center, Emporia, KS - excavation, fill, storm sewer installation, erosion control management, asphalt surfacing




 


 


Earthwork Excavation
Moving mass quantities of dirt has been a trademark of Hamm, Inc. for almost 60 years.  Hamm’s extensive fleet of earthwork equipment has moved hundreds of thousands of cubic yards of earth on different projects all over Northeast Kansas.
 




 


Rock Excavation
Hamm Inc.’s skilled rock excavation crews make the drilling, blasting, removing, and transportation of even the toughest rock ledges look easy.  Hamm takes every precaution available to make sure that no person or structure in the surrounding areas is affected by blasting operations.
 




 


Subgrade Treatment
Hamm, Inc. takes pride in building roads that last and have a smooth ride.  Both of these qualities are dependent on first building a solid base foundation.  Hamm excels at laying base rock: we know our rock provides an ideal surface on which to pave, and our base rock laying crews have placed countless tons of road rock on projects all over Northeast Kansas.  When the soils are soft and require extra manipulation, we can mix soil stabilizing products, such as fly ash and lime, into the subgrade to create a firm foundation for our pavement construction.
 




 


Stormwater Drainage
All of our projects require a quick and clean movement of water both through and off the construction area.  Hamm performs the construction and installation of storm water pipes, culverts, and inlets for storm water management.  We also develop a project-specific Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan to control soil erosion and ensure the water leaving the project meets the environmental standards for construction projects.
 



Hamm is proud to be a member and have employees which are active in industry and professional organizations:

Kansas Contractors Association (KCA)
Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT)
Kansas Turnpike Authority (KTA)

								HAMM: A pioneer that's always
						



								a roller's length ahead
						



















First-class technology for soil and asphalt compaction
HAMM offers a wide range of products for all aspects of soil and asphalt compaction, utilizing leading machine and compaction technology. Along with the technical requirements, ergonomic design and simple operation are prime concerns. And thus, HAMM finds a perfect balance of technology and ergonomic design.
In 1911, Hans Hamm set a milestone when he designed and built the world's first diesel engine driven road roller. At its headquarters in Tirschenreuth, HAMM continues to set new standards, even today, with regards to the design and ergonomics of its compactors, tandem and rubber-tired rollers as well as compaction with oscillation.
