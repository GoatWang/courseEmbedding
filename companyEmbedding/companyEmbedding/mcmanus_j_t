Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri

Grand Cru White Burgundy: Best Price in the Nation
This striking 2012 Louis Latour Corton Charlemagne Grand Cru earned 93 points from Wine Spectator, which called it “vibrant and long.” Released at $165, our last 120 bottles are available to Wine Access clients at just $99 per bottle — the best price in the nation. Latour’s son, Louis-Fabrice, who is now running the family business, cites 2012 as his favorite vintage of the last three decades. Rich, ripe, and marvelously juicy, finishing with tremendous length and persistence, the 2012 is a benchmark wine for one of Burgundy’s most historic producers. This is its story.
It wouldn’t be until mid-July that summer really began on the Côte de Beaune. Following a cold, wet winter, the 2012 growing season ushered in a challenging spring. Flash frosts in the middle of April and May made for a very small fruit set.
Of particular importance, Louis-Fabrice explained over dinner on the Rue D’Alsace in Beaune, were the breezy last days of August and first days of September. The wind cleansed bunches and ushered in a series of dry days and cool nights. Sugars climbed even as acids stayed firm. At harvest, skins were thick like 2008, yet grapes were sweet and juicy like those in the terrific 2009 vintage.
Only 120 bottles remain of our allocation of one of the greatest wines to come off this estate, available direct from Latour’s cellars at the best price in the country — will you be one of those fast enough to ensure some of them end up in your cellars?








Tasting Notes


2012 Louis Latour Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru
93 Points Wine Spectator
Tropical notes of pineapple, mango, grapefruit peel and spice combine in this fleshy white. Stays vibrant and long, if still a little raw on the finish. Best from 2017 through 2028. 1,647 cases made.

WineAccess Travel Log
The 2012 Louis Latour Corton-Charlemagne, while delicious out of the gate, is a baby in a cradle. Pale green-gold in hue, infused with piercingly mineral aromas of ripe citrus, apple, honeysuckle, and anise, high-toned and refined. Rich, ripe, and marvelously juicy, filled with tropical fruits, mango, beeswax, and apple, finishing with tremendous length and persistence. Drink now-2032.

Wine Growing Regions




Across the wine world, different regions are known for both producing different grapes and different styles of wine.
The distinction between Old World wine regions and New World wine regions is particularly important: as a sweeping generalization, Old World regions are known for producing wines that are more austere and terroir driven, while New World regions are known for producing wines with greater intensity. For example, Cabernet Sauvignon grapes grown in France will likely produce wines marked by earthiness and subtle fruit flavors, while Cabernet Sauvignon grapes grown in California will likely produce wines that are more fruit-forward.
But different wine regions are also often associated with the production of different grapes. For example, within France, Bordeaux is associated with red wines made primarily from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Cabernet Franc grapes, while Burgundy is associated with red wines made from the Pinot Noir grape. Use this page to find top-rated wines from wine regions throughout the world and learn about each region’s wine-making profile.
