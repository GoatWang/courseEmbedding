 Amkor Completes NANIUM Aquisition
With the acquisition of NANIUM, Amkor will have an equally compelling value proposition in the low-density fan-out area. NANIUM is widely viewed as the fan-out technology leader as well as a very capable manufacturer, having shipped more than one billion WLFO packages utilizing a state-of-the-art 300mm wafer-level packaging production line. The acquisition of NANIUM will strengthen Amkor’s position in the fast growing market of wafer-level packaging for smartphones, tablets & other applications. NANIUM is based near Porto, Portugal, with offices in Germany & USA.

 SiP Packaging Solutions
By assembling, testing and shipping more than one million SiP devices per day, Amkor Technology has a proven track record as the industry leader in SiP design, assembly and test. Similar to a System on Chip (SoC) approach, Amkor's SiP technology is an ideal solution in markets that demand smaller size with increased functionality. However, SiP has the added benefit of compatibility with die design changes and integration of various die technologies (e.g., Si, GaAs, SiGe, SOI, MEMS) without the high cost and lead time associated with SoC development and manufacturing.

Final Test Services
Company: Amkor Technology
Amkor's final test spans a range of rigor and complexity depending on the device and end market application (testing multiple times under different electrical and temperature conditions, and before and after device reliability stresses, such as burn-in). In addition to electrical testing, specialized solutions are required for sensors that require non-electrical stimuli (acceleration, angular velocity, and atmospheric pressure, magnetic or acoustical stimulus). The electrical tests are a mix of functional, structural and system-level depending on the customer's requirements and cost and reliability parameters. The equipment we use includes commercially available automated test equipment, customized and proprietary system level test equipment and innovative types of low-cost test equipment developed by Amkor. System level experience and capabilities cover: 802.11, 802.16, cellular, graphics and gaming.

Strip  Test
Company: Amkor Technology
Amkor  is the first contract manufacturer to implement a high density,  pre-singulated test process for many of the semiconductor industry's most  common IC packages. By utilizing Amkor's high density leadframe (HDLF)  assembly process, we are able to achieve high parallelism and throughput,  thereby reducing the overall cost of test. Small outline and low lead count  packages in high volume are the optimum product type for this process.

Test Services for Sensors & MEMS
Company: Amkor Technology
As sensors have expanded into consumer applications and more standard packages a much greater focus has been placed on reducing the cost and complexity of test. At the same time there has been a large increase in the types of devices (Low-G inertial sensors, microphones, tire pressure monitoring, electronic stability control, safety systems, e-compass, altimeters and barometers).

Amkor Completes Product Qualification of SWIFT™ Packaging for Advanced Mobile, Networking and SiP Applications | Business Wire
























































Amkor Completes Product Qualification of SWIFT™ 
      Packaging for Advanced Mobile, Networking and SiP Applications






December 14, 2016 09:30 AM Eastern Standard Time



TEMPE, Ariz.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amkor Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: AMKR) today announced completion of 
      product qualification for its innovative new Silicon Wafer Integrated 
      Fan-Out Technology (SWIFT™). SWIFT is designed to handle the demanding 
      requirements of today’s advanced mobile, networking and 
      system-in-package (SiP) applications.
    


      With its fine-feature photolithography and thin film dielectrics, SWIFT 
      bridges the gap between through silicon via (TSV) and traditional wafer 
      level fan-out (WLFO) packages. Compared to laminate-based substrate 
      technologies, SWIFT offers dramatic improvements in form factor, signal 
      integrity, power distribution and thermal performance. SWIFT 
      incorporates an “RDL first” process that allows SWIFT wafers to be built 
      and yielded ahead of the assembly process - accelerating production 
      cycles and optimizing overall assembly yield.
    

      “The semiconductor industry requires much higher levels of integration 
      in a significantly reduced form factor,” said Ron Huemoeller, Amkor’s 
      corporate vice president, Research & Development. “Completing the 
      product qualification stage of SWIFT is an important milestone. We 
      achieved success by leveraging our significant fan-out development 
      experience and using our existing cutting-edge equipment. Our package 
      and board-level reliability results demonstrate that SWIFT is ready for 
      sampling by customers.”
    

      SWIFT was named the “Device of the Year” at the 3D InCites Awards 
      ceremony earlier this year. It was recognized for being “uniquely 
      developed to deliver a high yielding, high-performance package with the 
      thinnest profile in the industry.” SWIFT was also noted for its ability 
      to deliver 2µm line/space lithography (with up to four layers of RDL) 
      and a very dense network of memory interface vias at a very competitive 
      price.
    

      SWIFT is targeted for production in the second half of 2017 at K5, 
      Amkor’s state-of-the-art manufacturing, research and development center 
      in Incheon, South Korea.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Amkor Technology: Semiconductor IC Test | Wafer Level Packaging | Wafer Probe | Wafer Bumping | Flip Chip | RF Design | RF Test






















































 

 Amkor Completes NANIUM Aquisition
With the acquisition of NANIUM, Amkor will have an equally compelling value proposition in the low-density fan-out area. NANIUM is widely viewed as the fan-out technology leader as well as a very capable manufacturer, having shipped more than one billion WLFO packages utilizing a state-of-the-art 300mm wafer-level packaging production line. The acquisition of NANIUM will strengthen Amkor’s position in the fast growing market of wafer-level packaging for smartphones, tablets & other applications. NANIUM is based near Porto, Portugal, with offices in Germany & USA.

 SiP Packaging Solutions
By assembling, testing and shipping more than one million SiP devices per day, Amkor Technology has a proven track record as the industry leader in SiP design, assembly and test. Similar to a System on Chip (SoC) approach, Amkor's SiP technology is an ideal solution in markets that demand smaller size with increased functionality. However, SiP has the added benefit of compatibility with die design changes and integration of various die technologies (e.g., Si, GaAs, SiGe, SOI, MEMS) without the high cost and lead time associated with SoC development and manufacturing.
