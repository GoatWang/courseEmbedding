                        Timberlane was started in 2009, and has since grown to manage hundreds of investment positions across dozens of real estate investments. We’ve been able to scale AUM without scaling headcount, thanks to Juniper Square. It saves us money on the back office, it’s easy enough for me to use, and our investors love it. I can’t imagine going back to the old way of doing things.

INFORMATION STATEMENT

Important Notice Regarding
Internet Availability of this Information
Statement:
This Information Statement is available
at
https://wwws.tiff.org/MutualFunds/reports/prospectus/InfoStatement.pdf
 
This Information Statement
is being furnished to all persons owning shares (“members”) of TIFF Multi-Asset Fund (“Multi-Asset Fund”
or the “Fund”), a series of TIFF Investment Program, Inc. (“TIP”), to provide members with information
regarding an amended and restated money manager agreement (the “amended agreement”) between TIP, on behalf of Multi-Asset
Fund, and Smith Breeden Associates, Inc. (“Smith Breeden”). This Information Statement explains why the board of directors
of TIP, all of whom are not “interested persons” of TIP (the “board” or the “directors”), as
such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”), approved the amended agreement
in connection with a proposal to fund new investment mandates with Smith Breeden. Among other things, this Information Statement
describes generally the terms of the amended agreement and provides information about Smith Breeden.
 
This Information Statement
is being delivered on or about August 29, 2012 to members of record as of August 3, 2012.
 
Multi-Asset Fund is
providing this Information Statement solely for your information as required by an exemptive order issued by the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), as described herein. WE ARE NOT ASKING YOU FOR A PROXY AND YOU ARE REQUESTED NOT
TO SEND US A PROXY.
 
This Information Statement
consists of two parts:
 
PART I
contains information relating to Multi-Asset Fund, the amended agreement, the multi-manager method employed by TIP and its investment
adviser, TIFF Advisory Services, Inc. (“TAS” or the “Adviser”), and TIP’s advisory agreement with
TAS.
 
PART II
contains information about TIP, TAS, Smith Breeden, and other miscellaneous items.

I.

AMENDED AND RESTATED MONEY
  MANAGER AGREEMENT
BETWEEN TIP AND SMITH BREEDEN

 
Multi-Asset Fund operates on a “multi-manager”
basis, which means that its assets are divided into multiple segments and those segments are managed by different money management
firms as money managers to TIP.  TAS manages a portion of Multi-Asset Fund’s assets directly and is also responsible
for determining the appropriate manner in which to allocate assets among money managers, supervising money managers, and making
recommendations to the TIP board about new money managers, investment mandates, and the Fund’s investment policies and strategies.  There
is no pre-specified target allocation of assets to any particular money manager. Each money manager manages a segment of Multi-Asset
Fund pursuant to a money manager agreement.
 
During an in-person meeting held on June
27, 2012, the board evaluated and approved an amended and restated money manager agreement (“amended agreement”), effective
July 1, 2012, with Smith Breeden on behalf of Multi-Asset Fund.
 
In general, a mutual fund cannot enter
into new investment advisory agreements or materially amend existing investment advisory agreements unless the members of that
mutual fund vote to approve the agreements.  Multi-Asset Fund, however, has entered into the amended agreement with Smith
Breeden without seeking the votes of members in accordance with an exemptive order issued by the SEC (the “Exemptive Order”).  The
Exemptive Order permits TAS and the TIP funds, subject to board approval, to enter into and materially amend contracts with money
managers not affiliated with TAS without seeking or receiving member approval of those contracts.  The Exemptive Order
does not apply to the advisory agreements with TIP’s investment adviser, TAS, or any amendments to those agreements.  This
Information Statement is being provided to all members of Multi-Asset Fund to provide information relating to the amended agreement
with Smith Breeden as required by one of the conditions of the Exemptive Order.
 
Description of the Advisory Agreement with TAS
 
TAS acts as investment adviser to Multi-Asset
Fund pursuant to an Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement dated June 1, 2011 (the “Advisory Agreement”). The Advisory
Agreement, which was initially approved by the directors of TIP at a meeting held on March 21, 2011, was last submitted for a vote
and approved by Multi-Asset Fund’s members at a special meeting of the members held on May 23, 2011.  The purpose
of submission of the Advisory Agreement to the Fund’s members was to seek approval of the Advisory Agreement, including an
increase in the advisory fee paid by Multi-Asset Fund to TAS. The board last approved continuance of the Advisory Agreement for
Multi-Asset Fund at a meeting held on June 27, 2012. The previous advisory agreement between TAS and the Fund, dated as of March
31, 1995, as amended, was superseded by the new Advisory Agreement upon its effectiveness.  
 
Under the Advisory Agreement, TAS manages
the investment program of Multi-Asset Fund and performs such duties as the board and TAS agree are appropriate to support and enhance
the investment program of the Fund.  The Advisory Agreement provides that TAS will seek to achieve the Fund’s investment
and performance objectives by identifying and recommending to the board independent money managers for Multi-Asset Fund, managing
and allocating cash among asset classes and money managers, as applicable, monitoring the money managers’ and the Fund’s
performance, and employing certain risk management and other investment techniques.

Under Multi-Asset Fund’s Advisory
Agreement, the Fund pays TAS on a monthly basis an annualized fee of 0.25% on the first $1 billion of Multi-Asset Fund’s
average daily net assets; 0.23% on the next $1 billion of assets; 0.20% on the next $1 billion; and 0.18% on assets exceeding $3
billion.  Prior to June 1, 2011, the Fund paid TAS an annualized fee of 0.20% on the first $500 million of Multi-Asset
Fund’s average daily net assets; 0.18% on the next $500 million of assets; 0.15% on the next $500 million of assets; 0.13%
on the next $500 million of assets; 0.11% on the next $500 million of assets; and 0.09% on assets exceeding $2.5 billion in accordance
with the previous advisory agreement between TAS and the Fund. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, Multi-Asset Fund paid
TAS for its services to the Fund under the Advisory Agreement and the previous advisory agreement, as applicable, advisory fees
of $7,328,206.  For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, Multi-Asset Fund paid directly to the Fund’s money
managers management fees of $12,067,022.
 
TAS also provides certain administrative
and other services to TIP pursuant to a services agreement. Under the services agreement, TAS receives 0.02% per annum of the Fund’s
daily net assets for such services provided to Multi-Asset Fund. For the year ended December 31, 2011, the fees paid to TAS by
Multi-Asset Fund under the services agreement were $816,636.
  
The Amended Agreement between TIP and Smith Breeden
 
Multi-Asset Fund has engaged TAS and eleven
independent money managers, including Smith Breeden, to oversee Multi-Asset Fund’s investment decisions. Prior to July 1,
2012, Smith Breeden managed certain assets of Multi-Asset Fund pursuant to a form of money manager agreement that was dated July
1, 2009 (“previous agreement”). The directors initially approved the previous agreement with Smith Breeden at a meeting
held on June 16-17, 2009, and last approved the continuance of the previous agreement with Smith Breeden at a meeting held on June
15-16, 2011. Because Multi-Asset Fund operates pursuant to the Exemptive Order, the previous agreement was not required to be,
and has not been, submitted to a vote of members. Smith Breeden has managed assets for Multi-Asset Fund since 2003 pursuant to
an earlier form of money manager agreement. At a meeting held on June 27, 2012, the directors evaluated and approved the amended
agreement with Smith Breeden to enable Smith Breeden to manage new investment mandates for Multi-Asset Fund in addition to the
mandate that was being managed pursuant to the previous agreement.
 
The previous agreement provided for money
manager fees payable to Smith Breeden based on performance. The fee formula entailed a floor of 10 basis points on the first $200
million of net assets managed for Multi-Asset Fund (5 basis points on the net assets over $200 million), a cap of 85 basis points,
and a fulcrum fee of 48 basis points. The portfolio had to earn 205 basis points over the total return of Barclays US Government
Inflation-Linked Bond Index, measured over rolling 12-month periods, in order for Smith Breeden to earn the fulcrum fee. During
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, the aggregate money manager fees earned by Smith Breeden were $848,696.
 
TAS recommended that the board approve
the amended agreement in connection with a proposal to engage Smith Breeden to manage additional investment mandates for the Fund.
Under the amended agreement, Smith Breeden will continue to manage assets under the existing mandate, combining a portfolio of
US Treasury inflation-protected securities with a variety of active management techniques, including the selection and active trading
of high grade bonds, including corporate bonds, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, and bond futures contracts (“US
Treasury inflation-protected securities mandate”). As of July 1, 2012, Smith Breeden will manage two or more additional portfolios:
1) a portfolio focused on US Treasury obligations, including US Treasury inflation-protected securities, US Treasury bonds, notes,
or bills, or other US Treasury or agency obligations and related derivatives, as from time to time determined by Smith Breeden
in consultation with TAS (“US Treasury obligations mandate”); and 2) one or more additional fixed income investment
mandates that will be used opportunistically in an effort to generate equity-like returns with instruments that offer diversification
from Multi-Asset Fund’s other equity holdings or less downside risk than equities. Such mandates may involve the use of long
positions and/or short positions with primary emphasis on agency and non-agency mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities backed
by residential and commercial mortgages and consumer receivables (“additional equity-like return mandates”). In recommending
the additional investment mandates, TAS was seeking to enhance Multi-Asset Fund’s risk-adjusted returns and facilitate TAS’s
management of Multi-Asset Fund’s market exposures. The previous agreement and the amended agreement are substantially identical
in all material respects except for the addition of new fee schedules related to the new investment mandates and related conforming
changes.

Upon the recommendation of TAS and after
considering a variety of factors (as described below under “Consideration of the Amended Agreement by the Board”),
the directors voted on June 27, 2012, to approve the amended agreement with Smith Breeden to become effective as of July 1, 2012.  The
terms of the amended agreement are more fully described below under “Description of the Amended Agreement.”
 
Consideration of the Amended Agreement
by the Board
 
The board considered the amended agreement
with Smith Breeden as part of its annual review of TIP’s advisory agreements and fees at the meeting held on June 27, 2012.
In connection with the meeting, the board requested and received information from TAS and Smith Breeden in advance of the meeting,
which the board reviewed separately in executive sessions with its independent counsel. The materials provided included information
regarding personnel and services, investment process and strategies, portfolio holdings, portfolio management, fees and expenses,
and performance. Information about brokerage practices was also supplied, including allocation methodologies, best execution, commission
rates, and commission recapture or soft dollar arrangements. It was noted that Smith Breeden generally does not participate in
soft dollar programs. Extensive information with respect to compliance, administration, and risk management was supplied, such
as information on Smith Breeden’s compliance programs, including its code of ethics and business continuity procedures, as
well as information concerning any material violations of such programs, chief compliance officer background, disclosure about
regulatory examinations or other inquiries, and litigation proceedings affecting Smith Breeden. In addition, the board considered
the following: (1) a memorandum from the board’s independent counsel setting forth the board’s fiduciary duties and
responsibilities under the 1940 Act and the factors the board should consider in its evaluation of the advisory agreements; (2)
Smith Breeden’s responses to a questionnaire prepared by the board’s independent counsel requesting information necessary
for the directors’ evaluation of the amended agreement; (3) a Lipper Inc. (“Lipper”) report comparing the performance
of the Fund to the performance of its applicable peer groups, and comparing the Fund’s advisory fees and expenses to those
of its peer groups; and (4) information detailing the individual portfolio managers of Smith Breeden, the current and proposed
fee schedules, fees paid to Smith Breeden, and the terms of the amended agreement as compared to the previous agreement.
 
In approving the amended agreement with
Smith Breeden, the board considered the information provided by Smith Breeden, the information provided in connection with the
annual review of TIP’s advisory agreements and fees at the June 27, 2012 meeting, as well as such other information as the
board considered appropriate. The board noted that it receives information at regular meetings throughout the year related to services
rendered by TAS and Smith Breeden, as well as Multi-Asset Fund’s and Smith Breeden’s performance. It also noted that
it receives information between regular meetings as the need arises. The board’s evaluation of the services provided by Smith
Breeden took into account the board’s knowledge of and familiarity with Smith Breeden gained as board members, including
the scope and quality of Smith Breeden’s investment management capabilities. The board also considered Smith Breeden’s
skills and experience in managing the existing portfolio and portfolios similar in nature to the proposed new investment mandates.
The board concluded that, overall, it was satisfied with the nature, extent, and quality of the services currently being provided,
and expected to be provided, by Smith Breeden. The board did not specifically consider the profitability of Smith Breeden resulting
from its relationship with Multi-Asset Fund because Smith Breeden is not affiliated with TAS or TIP except by virtue of as serving
as a money manager, and the fees to be paid to Smith Breeden were negotiated on an arm’s length basis in a competitive market
place. The board noted that the proposed new mandates for Smith Breeden had been recommended by TAS.

In evaluating the amended agreement with
Smith Breeden at the June 27, 2012 meeting, the board considered a number of additional factors. The board based its evaluation
on the material factors presented to it at the meeting and described above, including: (1) the terms of the amended agreement;
(2) the reasonableness of the money manager’s fees in light of the nature, quality, and extent of the money manager services
provided and expected to be provided by Smith Breeden and any additional benefits received by Smith Breeden in connection with
providing services to Multi-Asset Fund; (3) the nature, quality, and extent of the services performed by Smith Breeden; (4) the
contribution of Smith Breeden towards the overall performance of Multi-Asset Fund; (5) the fees charged and to be charged by Smith
Breeden; and (6) the overall organization, skills, and experience of Smith Breeden in managing the existing portfolio for Multi-Asset
Fund and portfolios similar in nature to the proposed new investment mandates. The board noted that each of the three fee schedules
in the amended agreement included breakpoints and that two of the three fee schedules in the amended agreement provided for performance-adjusted
compensation arrangements in keeping with Multi-Asset Fund’s performance goals. In arriving at its decision to approve the
amended agreement, the board did not single out any one factor or group of factors as being more important than the other factors,
but considered all of these factors together with a view toward past and future long-term considerations.
 
After carefully considering the information
summarized above, including Smith Breeden’s responses to the questionnaire prepared on behalf of the board, and all factors
deemed to be relevant, and after further discussion, the board unanimously voted to approve the amended agreement with Smith Breeden
for Multi-Asset Fund. Prior to a vote being taken to approve the amended agreement, the board met separately in executive session
to discuss the appropriateness of the agreement and other considerations. In their deliberations with respect to these matters,
the directors were advised by their independent legal counsel. The directors weighed the foregoing matters in light of the advice
given to them by their independent legal counsel as to the law applicable to the review of investment advisory contracts. The board
concluded that the amended agreement with Smith Breeden was reasonable, fair, and in the best interests of Multi-Asset Fund and
its members, and that the fees provided in such agreement were fair and reasonable.
 
Description of the Amended Agreement
 
The amended agreement with Smith Breeden
for Multi-Asset Fund is included as Appendix A to this Information Statement. The following description of the amended agreement
is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the amended agreement as set forth in Appendix A.
 
Both the previous agreement and the amended
agreement with Smith Breeden provide that Smith Breeden will manage the investment and reinvestment of certain assets of Multi-Asset
Fund allocated to it from time to time by TAS, subject to the supervision of the board and TAS. Both the previous agreement and
the amended agreement require Smith Breeden to give primary consideration to obtaining the most favorable price and efficient execution
reasonably available under the circumstances and in accordance with applicable law when placing orders for the purchase and sale
of securities on behalf of the Fund. In evaluating the terms available for executing particular transactions and in selecting broker-dealers,
Smith Breeden may consider those factors it deems relevant, including brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined
in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) provided by such broker-dealers. Smith Breeden is authorized to pay a
broker-dealer who provides such brokerage and research services a commission for executing a transaction which is higher than the
commission another broker-dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction if the money manager determines in good faith
that the commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided. In addition, both the
previous agreement and the amended agreement include provisions relating to the confidentiality of the information and recommendations
supplied by either party to the agreement and restrict Smith Breeden from consulting with other money managers for Multi-Asset
Fund about transactions in securities or other assets of that Fund, except under certain circumstances.
 

5
 

The amended agreement provides that Smith
Breeden will be compensated in part based on assets and in part based on performance. For assets managed by Smith Breeden in the
US Treasury obligations mandate, the manager will receive 0.03% per year on the first $500 million of net assets comprising the
mandate, and 0.02% per year on amounts above $500 million. For assets managed by Smith Breeden in the US Treasury inflation-protected
securities mandate, Smith Breeden’s fee formula entails a floor of 10 basis points on the first $200 million of net assets
comprising the mandate (5 basis points on the net assets over $200 million), a cap of 85 basis points, and a fulcrum fee of 48
basis points. The portfolio must earn 205 basis points over the total return of a benchmark, measured over rolling 12-month periods,
in order for the manager to earn the fulcrum fee. The benchmark for purposes of determining excess return is the total return of
the Barclays US Government Inflation-Linked Bond Index. This fee schedule is identical to the fee schedule in the previous agreement.
For assets managed by Smith Breeden in the additional equity-like returns mandates, the fee formula entails an asset-based component
and a performance-based component. The asset-based fee consists of 0.30% per year on the first $200 million of all assets comprising
the mandate, and 0.25% per year on amounts above $200 million. The performance-based fee is determined by first calculating an
“incentive” by (i) determining the net appreciation or net depreciation of the portfolio for the applicable calendar
month; (ii) subtracting from that result the asset-based fee for the month and a hurdle, where the hurdle is the total return of
1-month LIBOR for the applicable month plus 1/12th of 2.35%; and (iii) multiplying the result by 20%. The incentive, whether positive
or negative, is accumulated in a memo account from which 2.5% or 10% is paid to the manager for the month depending on whether
the value of the memo account is less than or equal to/greater than 4.8% of value of the assets managed under this mandate.
 
The amended agreement, like the previous
agreement, provides that it (i) will continue in effect for a period of one (1) year from the date of the agreement, and thereafter
from year to year if the continuance of the agreement is approved at least annually in conformity with the requirements of the
1940 Act; (ii) may be further amended by mutual consent of the parties thereto, but the consent of Multi-Asset Fund must be approved
in conformity with the requirements of the 1940 Act and any order of the SEC that may address the applicability of such requirements
in the case of the Fund; (iii) may be terminated without payment of any penalty by (a) the Fund, if a decision to terminate is
made by the board of directors of TIP or by a vote of a majority of that Fund’s outstanding voting securities (as defined
in the 1940 Act), or (b) by Smith Breeden with at least 30 days’ written notice; and (iv) will terminate automatically in
the event of its “assignment,” as defined in the 1940 Act.
 
The amended agreement, like the previous
agreement, provides that Smith Breeden shall not be liable to Multi-Asset Fund, TIP, or TAS for any error of judgment, but shall
be liable to the Fund for any loss resulting from willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence by Smith Breeden in providing
services under the applicable amended agreement or from reckless disregard by Smith Breeden of its obligations and duties under
the amended agreement.
 
Additional Fee Information
 
The following table summarizes Multi-Asset
Fund’s expenses for its 2011 fiscal year. The table also shows a pro forma estimate of what such 2011 expenses would have
been had Smith Breeden served as a money manager for Multi-Asset Fund during that year under the new fee arrangements described
in this information statement. The table assumes that, in addition to its existing mandate, Smith Breeden managed throughout 2011
a portfolio of US Treasury obligations and one equity-like returns portfolio for Multi-Asset Fund, and that the assets managed
in the two new portfolios were re-allocated in part from assets managed by TAS and in part from Smith Breeden’s existing
portfolio. The pro forma expenses do not reflect the performance component of the equity-like returns mandate fee schedule because
it is not known how such a portfolio would have performed during the period. The table is designed to facilitate an understanding
of the potential impact of Smith Breeden’s new fee schedules on Multi-Asset Fund’s fees and expenses. Actual fund fees
and expenses will differ from those presented here due in part to factors such as the money manager’s performance and the
Fund’s average net assets during relevant periods.

Cost of Investing Example
 
This example is intended to help members
compare the cost of investing in Multi-Asset Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. In calculating the example,
the actual expenses of Multi-Asset Fund during 2011 (restated as described above) are used, as are pro forma estimates of what
2011 expenses would have been had the new arrangements with Smith Breeden been in effect during 2011, as shown in the expense table
above. The pro forma examples do not reflect the performance fee component of Smith Breeden’s equity-like returns mandate
fee schedule. The actual and pro forma examples assume that a member invests $10,000 in Multi-Asset Fund for the time periods indicated.
The examples also assume that the investment has a 5% return each year, the Fund’s operating expenses remain the same based
upon the expenses as shown in the fee table, and all dividends and distributions are reinvested. Entry fees are reﬂected
in both scenarios and redemption (exit) fees are reﬂected in the rows labeled “With redemption at end of period.”  Actual
costs may be higher or lower.

Money Manager Agreement
 
This agreement (the
"Agreement") is between TIFF Investment Program, Inc. ("TIP"), a Maryland corporation, for its
TIFF Multi-Asset Fund and such other of its Funds as TIP and the Manager (as defined below) may agree upon from time to
time (the "Fund") and Smith Breeden Associates, Inc. (the "Manager"), a registered investment adviser under
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the "Advisers Act"), and is effective as of July 1, 2012 (the

Recitals
 
TIP is an open-end
management investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"); and
 
TIP wishes to retain
the Manager to render advisory services to the Fund and the Manager is willing to render those services.
 
The parties therefore agree as follows:

The Manager will provide
investment management services with respect to assets placed with the Manager on behalf of the Fund from time to time. Such assets
may be placed in one or more separately managed accounts (each, a “Managed Account”), and each Managed Account may
be changed by investment, reinvestment, additions, disbursements of expenses, and withdrawals. All assets placed in such Managed
Accounts are referred to in this Agreement collectively as the "Managed Assets." The Fund may make additions to or withdraw
all or any portion of the Managed Assets from this management arrangement at any time.

Registration Statement under the 1940 Act and the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, on Form N-lA as filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission relating to the Fund and the shares of common stock in the Fund, as such Registration Statement may be
amended from time to time (the "Registration Statement");
 
(iii)	the
Manager's Investment Guidelines for each Managed Account, which may be amended from time to time through mutual agreement by TAS
and the Manager;
 
(iv)	written
instructions and directions of the board of directors of TIP; and
 
(v)	written
instructions and directions of TAS.
 
(b)	Responsibility
with Respect to Actions of Others. TIP may place the investment portfolio of each of its funds, including the Fund,
with one or more investment managers. To the extent the applicability of, or conformity with, the Requirements depends upon investments
made by, or activity of, the managers other than the Manager, the Manager agrees to comply with such Requirements: (i) to the extent
that such compliance is within the Manager's Investment Guidelines; and (ii) to the extent that the Manager is provided with information
sufficient to ascertain the applicability of such Requirements. If it appears to the Fund at any time that the Fund may not be
in compliance with any Requirement and the Fund or TAS so notifies the Manager, the Manager shall promptly take such actions not
inconsistent with applicable law as the Fund or TAS may reasonably specify to effect compliance.
 
(c)	Responsibility
with Respect to Performance of Duties. In performing its duties under this Agreement, the Manager will act solely in the interests
of the Fund and shall use reasonable care and its best judgment in matters relating to the Fund. The Manager will not deal with
the Managed Assets in its own interest or for its own account.
  
 

4.Recordkeeping and Reporting

 
(a)	Records.
The Manager shall maintain proper and complete records relating to the furnishing of investment management services under this
Agreement, including records with respect to the securities transactions for the Managed Assets required by Rule 31a-1 under the
1940 Act. All records maintained pursuant to this Agreement shall be subject to examination by the Fund and by persons authorized
by it during reasonable business hours upon reasonable notice. Records required by Rule 31a-1 maintained as specified above shall
be the property of the Fund; the Manager will preserve such records for the periods prescribed by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act
and shall surrender such records promptly at the Fund's request. Upon termination of this Agreement, the Manager shall promptly
return records that are the Fund's property and, upon demand, shall make and deliver to the Fund true and complete and legible
copies of such other records maintained as required by this Section 4(a) as the Fund may request. The Manager may retain copies
of records furnished to the Fund.
 
(b)	Reports to
Custodian. The Manager shall provide to the Fund's custodian and to the Fund, on each business day, information relating to
all transactions concerning the Managed Assets.
 
(c)	Other Reports.
The Manager shall render to the board of directors of TIP and to TAS such periodic and special reports as the board or TAS
may reasonably request.
 

A-2
 

	 Appendix A
 
 

5.Purchase and Sale of Securities

 
(a)	Selection
of Brokers. The Manager shall place all orders for the purchase and sale of securities on behalf of the Fund with brokers or
dealers selected by the Manager in conformity with the policy respecting brokerage set forth in the Registration Statement. Neither
the Manager nor any of its officers, employees, or any of its "affiliated persons,” as defined in the 1940 Act, will
act as principal or receive any compensation in connection with the purchase or sale of investments by the Fund other than the
management fees provided for in Section 6 hereof.
 
In placing such orders, the Manager will
give primary consideration to obtaining the most favorable price and efficient execution reasonably available under the circumstances
and in accordance with applicable law. In evaluating the terms available for executing particular transactions for the Fund and
in selecting broker-dealers to execute such transactions, the Manager may consider, in addition to commission cost and execution
capabilities, those factors that it deems relevant, such as the financial stability and reputation of broker-dealers and the brokerage
and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) provided
by such broker-dealers. The Manager is authorized to pay a broker-dealer who provides such brokerage and research services a commission
for executing a transaction which is in excess of the amount of commission another broker-dealer would have charged for effecting
that transaction if the Manager determines in good faith that such commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage
and research services provided by such broker-dealer in discharging responsibilities with respect to the Fund or to other client
accounts as to which it exercises investment discretion.
 
(b)	Aggregating
Orders. On occasions when the Manager deems the purchase or sale of a security to be in the best interest of the Fund as well
as other advisory clients of the Manager, the Manager, to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations, may, but shall
be under no obligation to, aggregate the securities to be so sold or purchased in order to obtain the most favorable price or lower
brokerage commissions and efficient execution. In such event, allocation of securities so purchased or sold, as well as the expense
incurred in the transaction, will be made by the Manager in the manner it considers to be most equitable and consistent with its
fiduciary obligations to the Fund and its other clients.
  
 

6.Management Fees; Expenses

 
(a)	 Management
Fees. Schedule I-A, I-B, and I-C attached hereto set out the fees to be paid by the Fund to the Manager for the respective
Managed Accounts. In the case of the Managed Account that falls under Schedule I-A, fees will be paid by the Fund to the Manager
each month, on or before the last business day of the month that follows the end of the month
to which the fee relates and the applicable fee rate will be applied to the average daily net asset value of the Managed Assets
of the relevant Managed Account for the applicable month, computed as described in the Fund's Registration Statement. In the case
of the Managed Account that falls under Schedule I-B, fees will be paid by the Fund to the Manager
each month on or before the last business day of the month that follows the end of each rolling 12-month measurement period, as
applicable, and the applicable fee rate will be applied to the average daily net asset value of the Managed Assets of the
relevant Managed Account for the rolling 12-month measurement period, computed as described in the Fund's Registration Statement
and in Schedule I-B, and the result divided by 12 to determine the fee payable for each month. In the case of Managed Accounts
that fall under Schedule I-C, fees will be paid by the Fund to the Manager each month on or before the last business day of the
month that follows the end of the period to which the fee relates as set out in Schedule 1-C.
 
(b) Expenses. The
Manager shall furnish at its own expense all of its own office facilities, equipment and supplies, and shall perform at its own
expense all routine and recurring functions necessary to render the services required under this Agreement including administrative,
bookkeeping and accounting, clerical, statistical, and correspondence functions. The Manager shall not have responsibility for
calculating the Net Asset Value of the Fund's portfolio, but must daily review the pricing of the Managed Assets. The Fund shall
be responsible for its own fees and expenses; provided, however, that expenses set forth in the following sentence shall be paid
out of the Managed Assets. The Fund shall pay directly, or, if the Manager makes payment, reimburse the Manager for, (1) custodial
transaction fees for the Managed Assets, (ii) brokerage commissions, issue and transfer taxes and other costs of securities transactions
to which the Fund is a party, including any portion of such commissions attributable to research and brokerage services; and (iii)
taxes, if any, payable by the Fund. In addition, the Fund shall pay directly, or, if the Manager makes payment, reimburse the Manager
for, such non-recurring special out-of-pocket costs and expenses as may be authorized in advance by the Fund.
  

A-3
 

	 Appendix A
 

 

7.Non-Exclusivity of Services

 
The Manager is free
to act for its own account and to provide investment management services to others. The Fund acknowledges that the Manager and
its officers and employees, and the Manager's other clients, may at any time have, acquire, increase, decrease or dispose of positions
in the same investments which are at the same time being held, acquired or disposed of under this Agreement for the Fund. Neither
the Manager nor any of its officers or employees shall have any obligation to effect a transaction under this Agreement simply
because such a transaction is effected for his or its own account or for the account of another client. The Fund agrees that the
Manager may refrain from providing any advice or services concerning securities of companies for which any officers, directors,
partners or employees of the Manager or any of the Manager's affiliates act as financial adviser, investment manager or in any
capacity that the Manager deems confidential, unless the Manager determines in its sole discretion that it may appropriately do
so. The Fund appreciates that, for good commercial and legal reasons, material nonpublic information which becomes available to
affiliates of the Manager through these relationships cannot be passed on to the Fund.
  
 

8.Liability

 
The Manager shall not
be liable to the Fund, TIP, or TAS for any error of judgment, but the Manager shall be liable to the Fund for any loss resulting
from willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence by the Manager in providing services under this Agreement or from reckless
disregard by the Manager of its obligations and duties under this Agreement.
 
TIP understands that
certain provisions of this Agreement including, without limitation, this section of this Agreement, may serve to limit the potential
liability of the Manager. TIP has had the opportunity to consult with Manager as well as, if desired, its professional advisors
and legal counsel as to the effect of these provisions. TIP further understands that certain federal and state securities laws
including, but not limited to, the Advisers Act, may impose liability or allow for legal remedies even where the Manager has acted
in good faith and that the rights under those laws may be non-waivable. Nothing in this Agreement shall, in any way, constitute
a waiver or limitation by TIP of any rights which may not be so limited or waived in accordance with applicable law.
  
 

9.Representations

 
(a)	The Manager
hereby represents to the Fund that the Manager is registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act, that it has full
power and authority to enter into and perform fully the terms of this Agreement and that the execution of this Agreement on behalf
of the Manager has been duly authorized and, upon execution and delivery, this Agreement will be binding upon the Manager in accordance

(b)	The Manager
represents that it complies in all material respects with all applicable laws, both federal and state.

10.Term

 
This Agreement shall
continue in effect for a period of one (1) year from the date hereof and shall thereafter be automatically renewed for successive
periods of one (1) year each, provided such renewals are specifically approved at least annually in conformity with the requirements
of the 1940 Act; provided, however, that this Agreement may be terminated without the payment of any penalty, by (a) the Fund,
if a decision to terminate is made by the board of directors of TIP or by a vote of a majority of the Fund's outstanding voting
securities (as defined in the 1940 Act), or (b) the Manager, in each case with at least 30 days' written notice from the terminating
party and on the date specified in the notice of termination.
 

A-4
 

	 Appendix A
 
 
This Agreement shall terminate automatically
in the event of its assignment (as defined in the 1940 Act).
  
 

11.Amendment

 
Except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, this Agreement may be amended by mutual consent, but the consent of the Fund must be approved in conformity
with the requirements of the 1940 Act and any order of the Securities and Exchange Commission that may address the applicability
of such requirements in the case of the Fund.

Schedule I-A 
Dated as of July 1, 2012
 
to the
Money Manager Agreement (the “Agreement”)
Dated as of July 1, 2012
 
between 
Smith Breeden Associates Inc. (the “Manager”)
and 
TIFF Investment Program, Inc. for its
TIFF Multi-Asset Fund (the “Fund”)
 
 
This fee schedule shall
apply to the Managed Account generally referred to by the parties as the “beta account” with a mandate focused on US
Treasury obligations.
 
As compensation for
the services performed and the facilities and personnel provided by the Manager pursuant to this Agreement, the Fund will pay to
the Manager a fee according to the following formula:
 


First $500 million of assets*: 
0.03% per annum

Assets* over $500 million:
0.02% per annum

 
* Average daily net assets of the Managed
Account for which compensation is calculated under this Schedule I-A.
 
	The fee shall be prorated for any period
that is less than a full calendar month.	
 
All capitalized terms
used but not defined in this Schedule I-A shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Agreement.
 

A-7
 

	 Appendix A
 

 
Schedule I-B
Dated as of July 1, 2012
 
to the
Money Manager Agreement (the “Agreement”)
Dated as of July 1, 2012
 
between 
Smith Breeden Associates Inc. (the “Manager”)
and 
TIFF Investment Program, Inc. for its
TIFF Multi-Asset Fund (the “Fund”)
 
 
This fee schedule shall
apply to the Managed Account generally referred to by the parties as the “low alpha account.” The Managed Account to
which this fee schedule shall apply has a mandate focused on US Treasury Inflation Protected Securities supplemented by an overlay
portfolio of high quality credits designed to produce modest excess returns.
 
As compensation for
the services performed and the facilities and personnel provided by the Manager pursuant to this Agreement, the Fund will pay to
the Manager a fee according to the following formula:
 


First $200 million of assets*:
10 + [.200 x (Excess Return - 15 basis points)]

Assets* over $200 million:
5 + [.200 x (Excess Return - 15 basis points)]

 


Floor:
10 basis points (5 basis points on assets* over $200 million)

Cap:
85 basis points

Fulcrum:
48 basis points at 205 basis points Excess Return (assets* less than $200 million)

 
* Average daily net assets of the Managed
Account for which compensation is calculated under this Schedule I-B (“Schedule I-B Assets”) for each month over rolling
12-month month periods. For purposes of this fee calculation, the assets managed pursuant to a Money Manager Agreement between
the Manager and the Fund dated July 1, 2009 shall be considered Schedule I-B Assets, as the compensation and fee schedule that
were in effect under the previous agreement and the compensation and fee schedule in this Schedule I-B are identical. These historical
Schedule I-B Assets shall be adjusted to reflect the withdrawal of Schedule I-B Assets occurring in connection with the Effective
Date of this Agreement. For example, if $150 million of Schedule I-B Assets is withdrawn on or about the Effective Date, assets
for each month prior to such withdrawal shall be reduced by $150 million when calculating the rolling 12-month average daily net
assets.
 
For purposes of this
fee calculation, Excess Return is the amount by which the actual gross total return of the Schedule I-B Assets exceeds the Benchmark
total return, measured over rolling 12-month periods. The Benchmark shall be the Barclays US Government Inflation-Linked Bonds
Index Total Return (the “TIPS Benchmark”), or its successors.
 
If the Manager ceases
to render services hereunder at any time during, and before the last day of, any calendar month, the Manager shall be entitled
to a fee for services rendered hereunder during such month equal to 150% of the Floor (prorated based on the number of days during
such calendar month that the Manager provided services hereunder) payable by the Fund on or before the last day of the month following
the month in which the Manager ceased to render services hereunder.
 
All capitalized terms used but not defined
in this Schedule I-B shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Agreement.
 

A-8
 

	 Appendix A
 
 
Schedule I-C 
Dated as of July 1, 2012
 
to the
Money Manager Agreement (the “Agreement”)
Dated as of July 1, 2012
 
 
between 
Smith Breeden Associates Inc. (the “Manager”)
and 
TIFF Investment Program, Inc. for its
TIFF Multi-Asset Fund (the “Fund”)
 
This fee schedule shall
apply to Managed Accounts designated from time to time, and generally referred to, by the parties as “high alpha accounts.”
The initial Managed Account to which this fee schedule shall apply has a mandate focused on securitized credit opportunities, with
primary emphasis in agency and non-agency securitized credit instruments backed by residential and commercial mortgages. Other
mandates might focus on securitized credits, corporate credits, US government and agency obligations or other sectors within the
fixed income market.
 
As compensation for
the services performed and the facilities and personnel provided by the Manager pursuant to this Agreement, the Fund will pay to
the Manager a fee as set forth below.
 
The Fund will pay the Manager (i) an asset
based fee (the “Investment Management Fee") plus (ii) a performance based fee (the "Performance Based Fee"),
each as described below.
 
Capitalized terms used throughout this
schedule shall have the meanings given to them in the Agreement unless otherwise defined herein.
 
 
Investment Management Fee:
The Fund will pay the Manager an asset based fee of 30 basis points (0.30%) per annum on the first $200 million of Managed Account
assets and 25 basis points (0.25%) per annum on Managed Account assets in excess of $200 million, calculated monthly and based
the aggregate average daily net assets of the Managed Accounts for which compensation is calculated under this Schedule I-C for
the month to which the fee relates. The Investment Management Fee with respect to any Managed Account will be prorated for any
period that is less than a full calendar month.
 
Calculation and Payment of Performance
Based Fee: For each Calculation Period, the Performance Based Fee will be equal to 10 percent of the Performance Fee Accrual
Account at the end of the Calculation Period if the Performance Fee Accrual Account is equal to or greater than 4.8 percent of
the aggregate Managed Account assets for which compensation is calculated under this Schedule I-C as of the end of the Calculation
Period. If the Performance Fee Accrual Account is less than 4.8 percent of such aggregate Managed Account assets but greater than
zero as of the end of the Calculation Period, the Performance Based Fee will be equal to 2.5 percent of the Performance Fee Accrual
Account. If the Performance Fee Accrual Account is a negative dollar amount as of the end of the Calculation Period, the Performance
Based Fee will be zero. The Performance Based Fee shall be payable monthly, in arrears, in the month that follows the Calculation
Period or, in the event of a complete withdrawal of Managed Account assets, in the month that follows such withdrawal. In the event
of a complete withdrawal of Managed Account assets, the final Performance Based Fee will be equal to the entire Performance Fee
Accrual Account, if such Account contains a positive balance. In the event of a complete withdrawal of Managed Account assets at
a time when the Performance Fee Accrual Account contains a negative balance, the final Performance Based Fee will be zero.
 
Definitions Related to the Calculation and Payment of
the Performance Based Fee: 
 
Calculation Period: Calculation
Period means each calendar month. In the event of a complete withdrawal, the final Calculation Period shall be the period that
commences on first day of the month of withdrawal and ends on the date of complete withdrawal, even though less than a full month.
 
Effective Date: The Effective Date
is the date on which the Fund has first placed assets with the Manager.
 

A-9
 


	 Appendix A
 
 
Hurdle: The Hurdle is defined as
total return of 1 month LIBOR for the Calculation Period + (235 basis points/12)* starting net asset value of the Managed Account
assets as of the first day of the Calculation Period. The Hurdle is a USD amount and shall be calculated separately for each Managed
Account that falls under this Schedule I-C. In the event of contributions to or withdrawals from the Managed Account assets, the
Hurdle shall be pro-rated with respect to the Managed Account assets held for less than a full calendar month. Note: The total
return of 1 month LIBOR can be obtained using the Bloomberg Ticker LUS1.
 
Net Appreciation: Net Appreciation
means the excess, if any, of the ending net asset value of the Managed Account assets as of the last day of the applicable Calculation
Period over the beginning net asset value of the Managed Account assets as of the first day of the applicable Calculation Period.
The beginning net asset value will be increased to reflect any additional assets placed with the Manager during the applicable
Calculation Period or reduced to reflect any assets withdrawn from the Manager during the applicable Calculation Period. Net Appreciation
is a USD amount. Net Appreciation shall be calculated separately for each Managed Account that falls under this Schedule I-C.
 
Net Depreciation: Net Depreciation
means the excess, if any, of the beginning net asset value of the Managed Account assets as of the first day of the applicable
Calculation Period over the ending net asset value of the Managed Account assets as of the last day of the applicable Calculation
Period. The beginning net asset value will be increased to reflect any additional assets placed with the Manager during the applicable
Calculation Period or reduced to reflect any assets withdrawn from the Manager during the applicable Calculation Period. Net Depreciation
is a USD amount. Net Depreciation shall be calculated separately for each Managed Account that falls under this Schedule I-C.
 
Incentive: For each Calculation
Period, the Incentive is equal to 20% * (Net Appreciation or Net Depreciation – Investment Management Fee – Hurdle).
Incentive is a USD amount and may result in a positive or negative product. The Incentive shall be calculated separately for each
Managed Account that falls under this Schedule I-C.
 
Performance Fee Accrual Account:
This account is a single, cumulative memo account into which (i) the Incentive of each Managed Account that falls under Schedule
I-C is credited, if positive, or debited, if negative, for each Calculation Period and (ii) the Performance Based Fee, if any,
is withdrawn each Calculation Period.
 
All capitalized terms used but not defined
in this Schedule I-C shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Agreement.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Barron’s 2017 Best Online Broker Ranking
Fidelity takes the top spot, with Interactive Brokers and TD Ameritrade right on its heels


 







By

Theresa W. Carey

 Biography




 




March 18, 2017


The bull market is on sale for online brokerage customers. In the run-up to our 22nd annual ranking of Barron’s Best Online Brokers, two developments topped all others: The three major indexes—the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the Standard & Poor’s 500, and the Nasdaq Composite—all set record highs, and six brokers slashed commissions and other fees. At the 16 brokers we reviewed this year, the average monthly cost of trading for an occasional investor had fallen 25% since early 2016, to $47.51 from $63.45. That means...
