owing by the Trust to the extent not paid from amounts on deposit
in the Remarketing Fee Account;


     (o) if
applicable, sequentially, first to the Remarketing Agents for
certain expenses incurred in connection with the remarketing of the
Reset Rate Notes on such Distribution Date, and second to the
Administrator for advances made on behalf of the Trust for the
payment of remarketing expenses on that or prior Distribution
Dates; and


     (p) to the
Excess Distribution Certificateholder, any remaining amounts after
application of the preceding clauses.


     Amounts that would
be paid to each Swap Counterparty pursuant to clauses (d)(2),
(d)(3), (f) or (m) above, (1) with respect to payments of
interest on the Reset Rate Notes if the Reset Rate Notes bear a
fixed rate of interest or with respect to payments of principal on
the Reset Rate Notes then in Foreign Exchange Mode, will be
determined on or before the fourth Business Day preceding each
Distribution Date and will be paid by the Trust as set forth in the
applicable Swap Agreement (or, with respect to a Distribution Date
that coincides with a Reset Date resulting in a successful
remarketing of the Reset Rate Notes if the Reset Rate Notes are
then in Foreign Exchange Mode, payments under the related Swap
Agreement will be made one Business Day prior to such Distribution
Date); and (2) with respect to payments of interest on the
Reset Rate Notes if the Reset Rate Notes are then bearing a
floating rate of interest, will be paid by the Trust to the related
Swap Counterparty by 1:00 p.m. (New York time) on the Business Day
immediately preceding each Distribution Date.


Notwithstanding
the foregoing:


     (x) If
(i) on any Distribution Date following distributions under
clauses 2.8(a) through (f) above to be made on such Distribution
Date, the Outstanding Amount of the Class A Notes would be in
excess of (A) the sum of (1) the outstanding principal
balance of the Trust Student Loans, (2) any accrued but unpaid
interest on the Trust Student Loans as of the last day of the
related Collection Period, (3) the balance of the Capitalized
Interest Account on the Distribution Date following those
distributions required to be made under clauses 2.8(d) and
(e) above, (4) the balance of the Add-On Consolidation
Loan Account on such Distribution Date, and (5) the balance of
the Reserve Account on such Distribution Date following
those

17




 


distributions
required to be made under clauses 2.8(a) through (f) above,
minus (B) the Specified Reserve Account Balance for that
Distribution Date, or (ii) an Event of Default affecting the
Class A Notes has occurred and is continuing, then, until the
conditions described in (i) or (ii) no longer exist,
amounts on deposit in the Collection Account and the Reserve
Account shall be applied on such Distribution Date to the payment
of the Class A Noteholders’ Distribution Amount before
any amounts are applied to the payment of the Class B
Noteholders’ Distribution Amount; and


     (y) In the
event that a Swap Termination Payment is owed by the Trust to any
Swap Counterparty and a Replacement Transaction (as defined in the
related Swap Agreement) is procured by the Trust under which the
replacement Swap Counterparty makes a payment to the Trust, the
Trust will pay that amount directly to the original Swap
Counterparty to the extent that a Swap Termination Payment is owed
by the Trust to that Swap Counterparty. If after making that
payment, the original Swap Counterparty is still owed a payment,
then the remaining amount will be paid as set forth in clause
(m) above.


     If a Currency Swap
Agreement terminates, amounts that would have otherwise been paid
to the related Swap Counterparty under the related Currency Swap
Agreement will be used to make payments to the Reset Rate
Noteholders in an amount in Euros, Pounds Sterling or any other
applicable non-U.S. Dollar currency equal to the payment that would
have been made by the related Swap Counterparty to the Trust. If
this occurs, the Administrator, on behalf of the Trust, will
exchange, or will instruct the Indenture Trustee to exchange, U.S.
Dollars for Euros, Pounds Sterling or any other applicable non-U.S.
Dollar currency in order to make distributions to the Reset Rate
Noteholders.


     Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event the Trust Student Loans are not sold
pursuant to Section 6.1(A) or Section 4.4 of the
Indenture, the amount that would otherwise be paid to the Excess
Distribution Certificateholder shall be applied on such
Distribution Date to pay as an accelerated payment of principal on
the Notes, first to the Class A Noteholders in the same order
and priority as is set forth in clause 2.8(f) above until the
Outstanding Amount of the Class A Notes is paid in full and
reduced to zero, and then to the Class B Noteholders as set
forth in clause 2.8(i) above; provided that the amount of
such distribution shall not exceed the Outstanding Amount of the
Class A Notes or the Class B Notes, as applicable, after
giving effect to all other payments in respect of principal of
Class A Notes and Class B Notes to be made on such
Distribution Date.


     Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if:


     (i) on any
Distribution Date following distributions or allocations under
clauses 2.8(a) through (f) above to be made on that
Distribution Date, without giving effect to any payments from the
Capitalized Interest Account to the Class B Noteholders, the
Outstanding Amount of the Class A Notes (or if the Reset Rate
Notes are then in Foreign Exchange Mode, then the U.S. Dollar
Equivalent Principal Amount), less amounts (other than Investment
Earnings) on deposit in any Accumulation Account, would be in
excess of:


     (1) the
outstanding principal balance of the Trust Student Loans,
plus

18




 


     (2) any accrued
but unpaid interest on the Trust Student Loans as of the last day
of the related Collection Period, plus


     (3) the balance of
Reserve Account Balance on such Distribution Date following those
distributions required to be made under clauses 2.8
(a) through (f) above, minus


     (4) the Specified
Reserve Account Balance and any Supplemental Interest Account
Deposit Amount(s) for that Distribution Date, or


     (ii) an Event of
Default affecting the Class A Notes has occurred and is
continuing,


then, until the
conditions described in clauses (i) and (ii) above no
longer exist, the amounts on deposit in the Collection Account and
the Reserve Account will be applied on that Distribution Date to
the payment of the Class A Noteholders’ Distribution
Amount and the Supplemental Interest Account Deposit Amount(s)
before any amounts are applied to the payment of the Class B
Noteholders’ Distribution Amount.


     Section 2.9
Reserve Account . On the Closing Date, the Issuer shall
deposit the Reserve Account Initial Deposit into the Reserve
Account.


     (a) In the
event that the Primary Servicing Fee for any Monthly Servicing
Payment Date or Distribution Date exceeds the amount distributed to
the Servicer pursuant to Section 2.7(b) above and
Section 2.8(a) above on such Monthly Servicing Payment Date or
Distribution Date, the Administrator shall instruct the Indenture
Trustee in writing to withdraw from the Reserve Account on such
Monthly Servicing Payment Date or Distribution Date an amount equal
to such excess, to the extent of funds available therein, and to
distribute such amount to the Servicer; provided ,
however , that except as provided in Section 2.9(f)
below, amounts on deposit in the Reserve Account will not be
available to cover any unpaid Carryover Servicing Fees to the
Servicer.


     (b) In the
event that the Available Funds are insufficient to make the
payments described under Sections 2.8(a) through 2.8(c),
2.8(d)(1), 2.8(d)(2) and 2.8(e) above on any Distribution Date
(after giving effect to required distributions and/or allocations
from the Capitalized Interest Account), the Administrator shall
instruct the Indenture Trustee in writing to withdraw from the
Reserve Account on each Distribution Date an amount equal to such
deficiency, to the extent of funds available therein after giving
effect to clause (a) above, and to distribute and/or allocate
such amounts in the same order and priority as is set forth in
Sections 2.8(c), 2.8(d)(1), 2.8(d)(2) and 2.8(e)
above.


     (c) In the
event that the Class A Noteholders’ Principal
Distribution Amount on the Note Final Maturity Date with respect to
any Class of Class A Notes exceeds the amount distributed to
such Class A Noteholders pursuant to Section 2.8(f) above
on such date, the Administrator shall instruct the Indenture
Trustee in writing to withdraw from the Reserve Account on such
Note Final Maturity Date an amount equal to such excess, to the
extent of funds available therein after giving effect to clauses
(a) and (b) above, and to distribute such amount
to

19




 


the
Class A Noteholders entitled thereto, in the same order and
priority as is set forth in Section 2.8(f) above.


     (d) In the
event that the Class B Noteholders’ Principal
Distribution Amount on the Class B Maturity Date exceeds the
amount distributed to the Class B Noteholders pursuant to
Section 2.8(i) on such date, the Administrator shall instruct
the Indenture Trustee in writing to withdraw from the Reserve
Account on the Class B Maturity Date an amount equal to such
excess, to the extent of funds available therein after giving
effect to clauses (a) through (c) above, and to
distribute such amount to the Class B Noteholders entitled
thereto.


     (e) After
giving effect to clauses (a) through (d) above, if the
amount on deposit in the Reserve Account on any Distribution Date
(after giving effect to all deposits or withdrawals therefrom on
such Distribution Date other than pursuant to this clause (e)) is
greater than the Specified Reserve Account Balance for such
Distribution Date, the Administrator shall instruct the Indenture
Trustee in writing to withdraw the amount on deposit in excess of
the Specified Reserve Account Balance and deposit such amount into
the Collection Account.


     (f) On the
final Distribution Date upon termination of the Trust and following
the payment in full of the Outstanding Amount of the Notes and of
all other amounts (other than Carryover Servicing Fees, Swap
Termination Payments, if applicable, and Remarketing Fees and
expenses) owing or to be distributed hereunder or under the
Indenture to Noteholders, the Servicer, any Swap Counterparty, the
Remarketing Agents or the Administrator, as applicable, to the
extent that Available Funds on such date are insufficient to make
the following payments, amounts remaining in the Reserve Account
shall be used first to pay any Carryover Servicing Fees, second to
pay any Swap Termination Payments not previously paid to the
applicable Swap Counterparty, if any, third to pay any Remarketing
Fees not previously paid from the Remarketing Fee Account and
fourth to pay any Remarketing Fees and expenses due to the
Remarketing Agents or the Administrator. Any amount remaining on
deposit in the Reserve Account after such payments have been made
shall be distributed to the Excess Distribution Certificateholder.
The Excess Distribution Certificateholder shall in no event be
required to refund any amounts properly distributed pursuant to
this Section 2.9(f).


     (g) Anything
in this Section 2.9 to the contrary notwithstanding, if the
market value of securities and cash in the Reserve Account is on
any Distribution Date sufficient to pay the remaining principal
amount of and interest accrued on the Notes, and to pay any unpaid
Carryover Servicing Fee, Swap Termination Payments and Remarketing
Fees and expenses, such amount will be so applied on such
Distribution Date and the Administrator shall instruct the Eligible
Lender Trustee and the Indenture Trustee to make such
payments.


     Section 2.10

Sections 2.8(d)(1), 2.8(d)(2) and 2.8(e) on a Distribution
Date (prior to any distributions and/or allocations from amounts on
deposit in the Reserve Account), the Administrator shall instruct
the Indenture Trustee in writing to withdraw from the Capitalized
Interest Account an amount equal to such deficiencies, to the
extent of funds available therein, and to distribute and/or
allocate such amount first, pro rata based on the amounts of such
shortfalls, to the Class A Noteholders until they have
received the Class A Noteholders’ Interest Distribution
Amount for that Distribution Date and the related Swap Counterparty
until it has received the Swap Interest Payments required to be

Quarterly Funding Amount for that Distribution Date.


     (ii) If amounts
remaining on deposit in the Remarketing Fee Account on any
Distribution Date, after giving effect to all distributions
required to be made on that Distribution Date, exceeds the sum of
the Reset Period Target Amount for the Reset Rate Notes, the
Administrator shall instruct the Indenture Trustee in writing to
withdraw such excess amount from the Remarketing Fee Account,

For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Fitch Affirms Three SLM 2005 Trusts | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms Three SLM 2005 Trusts
    





October 03, 2016 11:13 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed the following ratings:
    

      SLM Student Loan Trust 2005-6(SLM 2005-6):
    

      --Class A-5A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-5B at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-6 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-7 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class B at 'Asf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      SLM Student Loan Trust 2005-7(SLM 2005-7):
    

      --Class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-5 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class B at 'Asf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      SLM Student Loan Trust 2005-8(SLM 2005-8):
    

      --Class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-5 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class B at 'Asf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      The affirmations above are due to the notes passing both Fitch's credit 
      and maturity stresses at the commensurate rating level.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      U.S. Sovereign Risk: The trust collateral comprises 100% Federal Family 
      Education Loan Program (FFELP) loans, with guaranties provided by 
      eligible guarantors and reinsurance provided by the U.S. Department of 
      Education (ED) for at least 97% of principal and accrued interest. The 
      U.S. sovereign rating is currently 'AAA'/Outlook Stable.
    

      Collateral Performance for SLM 2005-6: Fitch assumes a base case default 
      rate of 16.25% and a 49% default rate under the 'AAA' credit stress 
      scenario. The claim reject rate is assumed to be 0.50% in the base case 
      and 3% in the 'AAA' case. Fitch applies the standard default timing 
      curve in its credit stress cash flow analysis. The trailing 12-month 
      (TTM) average constant default rate, utilized in the maturity stresses, 
      is 2.1%. TTM levels of deferment, forbearance, income-based repayment 
      (prior to adjustment) and constant prepayment rate (voluntary and 
      involuntary) are 5.7%, 8.4%, 7.1% and 7.3%, respectively, and are used 
      as the starting point in cash flow models. Subsequent declines or 
      increases are modeled as per criteria. The borrower benefit is assumed 
      to be approximately 0.26%, based on information provided by the sponsor.
    

      Collateral Performance for SLM 2005-7: Fitch assumes a base case default 
      rate of 16.75% and a 50.25% default rate under the 'AAA' credit stress 
      scenario. The claim reject rate is assumed to be 0.50% in the base case 
      and 3% in the 'AAA' case. Fitch applies the standard default timing 
      curve in its credit stress cash flow analysis. The TTM average constant 
      default rate, utilized in the maturity stresses, is 1.7%. TTM levels of 
      deferment, forbearance, income-based repayment (prior to adjustment) and 
      constant prepayment rate (voluntary and involuntary) are 5.5%, 7.6%, 
      6.7% and 7.3%, respectively, and are used as the starting point in cash 
      flow models. Subsequent declines or increases are modelled as per 
      criteria. The borrower benefit is assumed to be approximately 0.24%, 
      based on information provided by the sponsor.
    

      Collateral Performance for SLM 2005-8: Fitch assumes a base case default 
      rate of 16% and a 48% default rate under the 'AAA' credit stress 
      scenario. The claim reject rate is assumed to be 0.50% in the base case 
      and 3% in the 'AAA' case. Fitch applies the standard default timing 
      curve in its credit stress cash flow analysis. The TTM average constant 
      default rate, utilized in the maturity stresses, is 2.3%. TTM levels of 
      deferment, forbearance, Income-based repayment (prior to adjustment) and 
      constant prepayment rate (voluntary and involuntary) are 5.9%, 9.1%, 
      7.2% and 7.7%, respectively, and are used as the starting point in cash 
      flow models. Subsequent declines or increases are modelled as per 
      criteria. The borrower benefit is assumed to be approximately 0.24%, 
      based on information provided by the sponsor.
    

      Basis and Interest Rate Risk: Fitch applies its standard basis and 
      interest rate stresses to this transaction as per criteria.
    

      Payment Structure: Credit enhancement (CE) is provided by 
      overcollateralization (OC), excess spread and, for the class A notes, 
      subordination. As of June 2016, respective total and senior effective 
      parity ratios (including the reserve) are 100.13% (0.13% CE) and 105.16% 
      (4.91% CE) for SLM 2005-6; 100.41% (0.41% CE) and 106.16% (5.80% CE) for 
      SLM 2005-7; 100.39% (0.39% CE) and 105.93% (5.60% CE) for SLM 2005-8. 
      Liquidity support is provided by reserve accounts sized at $4,950,100 
      from SLM 2005-6; $2,280,587 for SLM 2005-7; and $3,780,805 for SLM 
      2005-8. Cash will continue to be released as long as the target OC 
      amounts of $1.7 million for SLM 2005-6 and target parity of 100% 
      (excluding the reserve, as parity is below 40%) for SLM 2005-7 and SLM 
      2005-8 are maintained.
    

      Maturity Risk: Fitch's SLABS cash flow model indicates that the notes 
      are paid in full on or prior to the legal final maturity dates under the 
      commensurate rating scenario.
    

      Operational Capabilities: Day-to-day servicing is provided by Navient 
      Solutions, Inc. (formerly known as Sallie Mae, Inc.). Fitch believes 
      Navient to be an acceptable servicer of FFELP student loans.
    

      CRITERIA VARIATIONS
    

      For transactions in surveillance, Fitch will treat certain assets such 
      as claims filed as short-term assets in its cash flow analysis. Given 
      that Fitch's current criteria is silent on the treatment of such assets, 
      this treatment is considered a criteria variation.
    

      Under the 'Counterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered 
      Bonds', dated July 18, 2016, Fitch looks to its own ratings in analyzing 
      counterparty risk and assessing a counterparty's creditworthiness. The 
      definition of permitted investments for this deal allows for the 
      possibility of using investments not rated by Fitch, which represents a 
      criteria variation. Since the only available funds to invest in are 
      those held in the Collection Account, and the funds can only be invested 
      for a short duration of three months given the payment frequency of the 
      notes, Fitch does not believe such variation has a measurable impact 
      upon the ratings assigned.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Since the FFELP student loan ABS relies on the U.S. government to 
      reimburse defaults, 'AAAsf' FFELP ABS ratings will likely move in tandem 
      with the 'AAA' U.S. sovereign rating. Aside from the U.S. sovereign 
      rating, defaults, basis risk, and loan extension risk account for the 
      majority of the risk embedded in FFELP student loan transactions. 
      Additional defaults, basis shock beyond Fitch's published stresses, 
      lower than expected payment speed, and other factors could result in 
      future downgrades. Likewise, a buildup of CE driven by positive excess 
      spread given favorable basis factor conditions could lead to future 
      upgrades.

      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may

Fitch Affirms SLM Student Loan Trust 2005-8 Senior Notes | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms SLM Student Loan Trust 2005-8 Senior Notes
    





April 15, 2010 03:26 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings affirms the long-term ratings on the senior notes of the 
      SLM Student Loan Trust 2005-8, and maintains the Stable Rating Outlook. 
      See the complete list of rating actions at the end of this press 
      release. The trust has sufficient credit enhancement for the senior 
      notes with the Fitch calculated senior parity at 104.84% as of December 
      2009 and increasing.
    

      Fitch's Global Structured Finance Rating Criteria were used to review 
      the ratings and the affirmation is based on the performance of the trust 
      in-line with the expectations outlined therein. The Stable Outlook has 
      been maintained because, with the significant buildup of parity for the 
      senior notes, the ratings are expected to remain stable for the next two 
      years. The subordinate student loan notes will be reviewed separately 
      upon the completion of the updated basis risk analysis.
    

      The collateral supporting SLM Student Loan Trust 2005-8notes consists 
      entirely of federally guaranteed student loans originated under the 
      Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP). FFELP loans are 
      guaranteed at least 97% of principal and accrued interest, depending on 
      the loan origination date. As of December 2009, the loans are serviced 
      by Sallie Mae.
    

      Fitch affirms the ratings and maintains the Stable Outlook on the 
      following classes:
    

      --Class A-2 notes at 'AAA/LS1';
    

      --Class A-3 notes at 'AAA/LS1';
    

      --Class A-4 notes at 'AAA/LS1';
    

      --Class A-5 notes at 'AAA/LS1'.
    

      The following applicable criteria report is available on Fitch's web 
      site at 'www.fitchratings.com':
    

      --'Global Structured Finance Rating Criteria' (Sept. 30, 2009).
