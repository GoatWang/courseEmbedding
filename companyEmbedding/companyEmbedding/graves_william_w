I wish I knew for sure that this is the Bill Graves I knew.  We lost contact after he moved from San Diego except for a call.  He told me that he was sick but I had no idea how sick he actually was.  May the Creator smle upon your soul as he forgives your indescressions...

Item Description: ReInk Books, 2017. Softcover. Book Condition: NEW. Reprinted from 1910 edition. Language: eng. NO changes have been made to the original text. This is NOT a retyped or an ocr'd reprint. Illustrations, Index, if any, are included in black and white. Each page is checked manually before printing. As this reprint is from very old book, there could be some missing or flawed pages, but we always try to make the book as complete as possible. Fold-outs, if any, are not part of the book. If the original book was published in multiple volumes then this reprint is of only one volume, not the whole set. This paperback book is SEWN, where the book block is actually sewn (smythe sewn/section sewn) with thread before binding which results in a more durable type of paperback binding. It can also be open wide. The pages will not fall out and will be around for a lot longer than normal paperbacks. This print on demand book is printed on high quality acid-free paper. Original Publisher: St. Louis, Mo., [Stewart Scott Co. Press] 110 pages.  Bookseller Inventory # 452198609

Item Description: ReInk Books, 2017. Hardcover. Book Condition: NEW. Reprinted from 1910 edition. Language: eng. NO changes have been made to the original text. This is NOT a retyped or an ocr'd reprint. Illustrations, Index, if any, are included in black and white. Each page is checked manually before printing. As this reprint is from very old book, there could be some missing or flawed pages, but we always try to make the book as complete as possible. Fold-outs, if any, are not part of the book. If the original book was published in multiple volumes then this reprint is of only one volume, not the whole set. This hardcover book is SEWN, where the book block is actually sewn (smythe sewn/section sewn) with thread before binding which results in a more durable type of hardcover binding. It can also be open wide. The pages will not fall out and will be around for a lot longer than normal hardcovers. This book is printed on demand on acid-free paper. Original Publisher: St. Louis, Mo., [Stewart Scott Co. Press] 110 pages.  Bookseller Inventory # HB452198609
