Born to Dare Manifesto - Tudor Watches

“We’re devoted to the classic. But reject the status quo.”Born from the will to go beyond the standards, Tudor’s watchmaking philosophy draws its inspiration from its heritage, while incorporating state-of-the-art technology, exclusive innovations and pioneering creativity.Created by the founder of Rolex, Hans Wilsdorf, the Tudor Watch Company was born with a mission to explore new territories, offering “a watch that (his) agents could sell at a more modest price than (his) Rolex watches, and yet could attain (its) standards of dependability”.The Tudor of today has not drifted away from the original vision. While strictly adhering to the fundamentals of excellence, the design of a Tudor watch reinterprets a rich history to create something truly unique – a bold fusion of the original and the contemporary in an unrivalled proposition.A Tudor watch is born to dare.“We keep the best of the past. The best watchmaking practices, the best designs.”“And push the boundaries of what’s new.”Tudor’s reinvention of the classics has kept their watches distinctive for more than half a century. Never afraid to redefine the rules, Tudor’s new watches are strongly connected to the past while incorporating 21st-century technology. They also never shy away from pushing the boundaries of what’s new, experimenting with unusual materials, combinations and inspirations.Consider when Tudor decided to revisit their diver’s watch history. They drew inspiration from the past while embracing modernity. The Tudor Black Bay has direct antecedents in some of the most iconic Tudor watches. The 1958 Oyster Prince Submariner reference 7924 contributed its oversized crown and general lines while the ‘Snowflake’ Tudor Submariner, worn by the French Navy in the 1970s, offered up its unique angular hands. Classic designs, contemporised for a new century.The Black Bay Bronze incorporates a golden-toned marine-grade aluminium bronze case specifically chosen for its proven durability in marine environments. That this alloy develops a unique patina overtime while paying tribute to Tudor’s long-standing relationship with the French Navy is a bonus.But design is nothing without performance. Indeed, the Black Bay incorporates a supremely robust Manufacture calibre that took the Tudor R&D team 5 years to develop. Boasting a generous 70-hour power reserve, exceptional ergonomics and independently-certified precision, it sets higher standards. Tudor standards.A Tudor watch is born to raise standards.“Born for a purpose. Field-tested to the extreme.”A Tudor watch is built for those who dare to step out of their comfort zone. It is designed to perform in all and every condition. From a refined evening out to the most extreme environments imaginable.Over the years, Tudor watches have been put at test on a daily basis strapped on the wrist of the most daring individuals, on land racing through rough Alpine roads, on ice accompanying the British North Greeland Expedition, in the air issued to the para rescue teams of the US Air Force and underwater with the frogmen of the French Navy. They never deceived them, constantly delivering robust and reliable time-keeping.Today, from pure purpose-built tool watches to timeless elegant dress watches, the Tudor collection perpetuates that spirit of supreme dependability, having every single watch undergo a strict and demanding testing protocol guaranteeing precision, waterproofness and robustness, beyond industry standards.A Tudor watch is born to go above and beyond.“For those who are up for anything. Those who face their fears. Those who re-inventthemselves every day.”The wearers of a Tudor today are not so very different to those of the past. They are people with unconventional attitudes. People with ambition. People who are willing to pursue their passions – no matter where they take them. Like Tudor, they believe in learning from and building on past experiences to inform how they think and behave today.Tudor wearers seek to find experiences that expand their world view. They appreciate exceptional craftsmanship and sense. They are as interested in how something is made as they are in what it is intended to do. They insist on owning the best tools for the job and pride themselves on being in the know.Those who wear a Tudor share a thirst for discovery. A spirit of adventure. And the will to go further. They are curious. They are fearless.They are born to dare.A TUDOR is#BornToDare.

 Home Bar Products
One of the best ways to treat yourself is to add a home bar stocked with your favorite drinks. To get the good times rolling, accompany those libations with a group of good friends and the proper accessories. Depending on your drink (or drinks) of choice, the proper wine and beer related products are necessary to keep the liquids flowing; this includes barware, bar tools and of course a place to both store and sit-and-sip on your beverages.

A wine rack or cabinet will keep delicate wine glasses, shot glasses and beer glasses tidy and easy to reach when it’s time to fill up. Don’t overlook the small yet essential accessories, either, like a jigger, corkscrew or bottle opener, whiskey stones and a wine aerator. Once you’ve gathered your bar equipment, learn some recipes and proper techniques, then try your hand at playing bartender with some friends. Wiping down the bar and asking about everyone’s troubles isn’t necessary, we promise. Whatever you require, we’ve got a great collection of  bar accessories here on Houzz to add some life to your party.

Sell on Houzz - Learn MoreHow do I choose the right height for my     bar stools?The last thing you want is a stool that has you cramming your legs under the counter, so pay close attention to the height of various bar chairs for sale — they may not all provide enough legroom for you to sit comfortably beneath your bar. The most common     bar stool sizes available are table height, counter height, bar height and extra tall. You’ll want to aim for about 9 to 13 inches between the top of the stool seat and the bottom of your countertop, but to make things even easier, we’ve put together a handy guide that matches up standard counter heights with  bar stool heights: Table Height: These range in height from 18 to 23 inches and can accommodate a surface height of 28 to 30 inches. They’re a great alternative to your more traditional dining table chairs.Counter Height: These vary in height from 24 to 26 inches and will fit a surface height of 36 to 39 inches. They’re smaller than a typical bar or restaurant stool.Bar Height: These go from 28 to 30 inches in height and are perfect for a bar with a surface height of 40 to 42 inches. You can find stools in this height at many restaurants.Extra Tall: Get a spectator’s view with a height of 33 to 36 inches. You’ll want to pair these with a counter that has a surface height of 44 to 47 inches.You should also keep in mind the horizontal space around your     bar stool. Six inches between each stool is optimal for socializing and eating, but if your dream bar or kitchen has swivel  bar stools or counter stools with arms, you’ll want to add just a bit more space. What style of     bar stool is best for my counter or bar?Have a look around your kitchen or bar and decide if you want your new stools to stand out or blend in with the color, style or materials already present. For placement in a narrow hallway or next to a kitchen island, backless      bar stools are a great choice, because they can be tucked out of the way under the counter overhang. If your stools are the pièce de résistance to your kitchen or eating space, look for easy to clean surfaces like leather, wood, metal or even microfiber. Don’t be afraid to mix and match, either. Metal  bar stools can add contrast to a kitchen or bar that is predominantly wood, and wooden bar stools can bring a bit of nature inside a modern, high gloss kitchen. Here on Houzz you can find a wide variety of     counter stools as well as     bar stools on sale.

					Jonathan Charles Fine Furniture is the vision of Jonathan Sowter, an English furniture designer who excels at the art of fine antique reproduction. Jonathan Charles designs and manufactures the highest-quality European antique replicas as well as their own unique transitional designs.What makes them different is their meticulous attention-to-detail and pursuit of high-quality construction. Their passion for detail is also reflected in their in-house brass foundry, in which they manufacture their own hardware so that when they design a new piece of furniture they can also design one-of-a-kind pulls, hinges, locks and even keys for that piece.Jonathan Charles works with artisans who display a large range of skills. They take pride in their work, which is evident in their beautifully-crafted antique replicas. They go far beyond just creating furniture that resembles English classics. They employ age-old techniques, which breathe soul and lasting-quality into their products.Many of their inspirations come from original antiques that Jonathan discovers in his travels. Sometimes, they will reproduce them as accurately as possible, while at other times they will take a detail that they like and design a completely new piece of furniture around that feature.Oftentimes, they will start the design process from scratch. They gather inspiration from a variety of sources - be it a classic wallpaper design, nature, classic antiques, a rare object, or jewelry.They never design to the limitations of their factory, and have actually expanded their factory as they have developed new skills in advanced marquetry, bronze casting, hand carving and much more.They never compromise on design and would be foolish to compromise on quality. Only the finest materials are used in their furniture. They also employ inspectors that ensure technically-sound components and design throughout the process. These experts oversee production, checking in at key transaction points so that nothing is overlooked. Before an item is packaged, it is reviewed with a keen eye and must pass a comprehensive checklist by their quality control inspector.

Kitchen & Dining Furniture

 82,246 Kitchen and Dining Furniture
Kitchen and dining spaces center around food, and where there’s food, there’s people. Between hosting dinner parties and scarfing down breakfast at your counter, your kitchen and dining room furniture sees its fair share of use. Because of this, it’s essential that you invest in durable dining sets and kitchen furniture, including bar stools, pantry cabinets, kitchen islands, sideboards and bar carts that will hold up to the chaos.

Sell on Houzz - Learn MoreThe purpose of such furniture is geared more toward function than decor, but that doesn’t mean you can’t have both. Find pieces that fit the style of your space, but also offer versatility for all situations. For example, if you are short on space, look for a dining table with an insert so you can keep it small but expand it when you have more guests. Simple dining chairs can easily be dressed up with chair cushions or covers, so something less trendy and more classic will last you for years. Small bistro tables and bar tables are great for casual meals, as well as doing homework or small crafts. Take your time while shopping for furniture for your kitchen or dining room, as these big ticket items are easy to style but more difficult to change and replace.Browse our  kitchen and dining furniture section to find the products you love.

Because the dining room is the hub of home entertaining, finding the right dining table to accommodate family and friends is a worthy investment. A good table can last decades — it can even be passed down from generation to generation. Besides being above all practical, a dining table also sets the overall  mood of the space: a lightly stained wooden set for four exudes an informal, casual feel, while a formal table for 10 evokes sophistication and formality. As you get ready to purchase a new one, consider what works for you and your family. More

Sell on Houzz - Learn MoreHow big should my dining room table be?As you decide what set to purchase, think about how often you entertain and how many people usually attend. If all your family lives nearby, a larger dining table would be a worthy investment. On the other hand, if family doesn't visit that often, an oversized table might not get much use.  If you prefer to have options, purchase one with a table leaf so you can accommodate guests but still have a smaller option for more intimate gatherings. Whatever the size, be sure it fits the space. Measure the table and think about chair movement to ensure that everyone can get in and out without much effort.What shape should I choose?Both round and square dinner tables promote conversation and socialization, while large, rectangular dining tables are perfect for larger parties. For a look that mixes the traditional with the contemporary, consider outfitting a large room with an oblong or octagon one.What table material should I get?The material is mostly dictated by the overall style of the space; after all, your furniture should reflect your  taste. Darker woods, such as cherry and mahogany, are often seen as elegantly traditional, while dark metals, concrete, and wood/metal mixtures are mostly contemporary. Colorful plastics are modern and playful, while glass can be modern or traditional, depending on the base material used.

Born to Dare Manifesto - Tudor Watches

“We’re devoted to the classic. But reject the status quo.”Born from the will to go beyond the standards, Tudor’s watchmaking philosophy draws its inspiration from its heritage, while incorporating state-of-the-art technology, exclusive innovations and pioneering creativity.Created by the founder of Rolex, Hans Wilsdorf, the Tudor Watch Company was born with a mission to explore new territories, offering “a watch that (his) agents could sell at a more modest price than (his) Rolex watches, and yet could attain (its) standards of dependability”.The Tudor of today has not drifted away from the original vision. While strictly adhering to the fundamentals of excellence, the design of a Tudor watch reinterprets a rich history to create something truly unique – a bold fusion of the original and the contemporary in an unrivalled proposition.A Tudor watch is born to dare.“We keep the best of the past. The best watchmaking practices, the best designs.”“And push the boundaries of what’s new.”Tudor’s reinvention of the classics has kept their watches distinctive for more than half a century. Never afraid to redefine the rules, Tudor’s new watches are strongly connected to the past while incorporating 21st-century technology. They also never shy away from pushing the boundaries of what’s new, experimenting with unusual materials, combinations and inspirations.Consider when Tudor decided to revisit their diver’s watch history. They drew inspiration from the past while embracing modernity. The Tudor Black Bay has direct antecedents in some of the most iconic Tudor watches. The 1958 Oyster Prince Submariner reference 7924 contributed its oversized crown and general lines while the ‘Snowflake’ Tudor Submariner, worn by the French Navy in the 1970s, offered up its unique angular hands. Classic designs, contemporised for a new century.The Black Bay Bronze incorporates a golden-toned marine-grade aluminium bronze case specifically chosen for its proven durability in marine environments. That this alloy develops a unique patina overtime while paying tribute to Tudor’s long-standing relationship with the French Navy is a bonus.But design is nothing without performance. Indeed, the Black Bay incorporates a supremely robust Manufacture calibre that took the Tudor R&D team 5 years to develop. Boasting a generous 70-hour power reserve, exceptional ergonomics and independently-certified precision, it sets higher standards. Tudor standards.A Tudor watch is born to raise standards.“Born for a purpose. Field-tested to the extreme.”A Tudor watch is built for those who dare to step out of their comfort zone. It is designed to perform in all and every condition. From a refined evening out to the most extreme environments imaginable.Over the years, Tudor watches have been put at test on a daily basis strapped on the wrist of the most daring individuals, on land racing through rough Alpine roads, on ice accompanying the British North Greeland Expedition, in the air issued to the para rescue teams of the US Air Force and underwater with the frogmen of the French Navy. They never deceived them, constantly delivering robust and reliable time-keeping.Today, from pure purpose-built tool watches to timeless elegant dress watches, the Tudor collection perpetuates that spirit of supreme dependability, having every single watch undergo a strict and demanding testing protocol guaranteeing precision, waterproofness and robustness, beyond industry standards.A Tudor watch is born to go above and beyond.“For those who are up for anything. Those who face their fears. Those who re-inventthemselves every day.”The wearers of a Tudor today are not so very different to those of the past. They are people with unconventional attitudes. People with ambition. People who are willing to pursue their passions – no matter where they take them. Like Tudor, they believe in learning from and building on past experiences to inform how they think and behave today.Tudor wearers seek to find experiences that expand their world view. They appreciate exceptional craftsmanship and sense. They are as interested in how something is made as they are in what it is intended to do. They insist on owning the best tools for the job and pride themselves on being in the know.Those who wear a Tudor share a thirst for discovery. A spirit of adventure. And the will to go further. They are curious. They are fearless.They are born to dare.A TUDOR is#BornToDare.

It is suitable for use as a finish on new wood or stripped furniture, a reconditioner for old or damaged finishes, a furniture wax for fine furniture and antiques or an antiquing agent where the desire is to "age" a newly painted carving or project.

Incredible Product
I used this product upon the recommendation of a master builder who specializes in restoration.  My 20 year old late 18th early 19th century reproduction cabinets desperately needed rejuvenating.  I initially borrowed a can. It's so awesome I'm getting my very own. This color matched whatever the original woodworker used to finish/glaze and distress the cabinets so filled in all the dings and grooves my active family has made over the years, plus removed any tacky spots near the knobs. It also left a beautiful hard finish, and application was a no brainer. The cabinets look like "new" again. Love it!
