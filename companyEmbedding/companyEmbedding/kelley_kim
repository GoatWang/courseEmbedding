Hampton Products International Introduces the Array, an Innovative, Simple-to-Use Cloud- and App-Enabled Digital Deadbolt
Jan 19 16
At the International Builders Show, Hampton Products International is introducing the patent-pending Brink’s Home Security Array digital deadbolt, a technologically advanced, cloud- and app-enabled digital door lock that can be installed without adding separate hubs or accessories, making it one of the most consumer-friendly Smart Home lock products available. By including a highly efficient, proprietary power system, Array allows consumers to use their existing Wi-Fi routers to connect the deadbolt to the cloud, providing a “security simplified” solution for homeowners looking to upgrade from traditional deadbolts. Brink’s Home Security Array delivers a number of best-in-category features, designed with both the novice Smart Home user and the highly connected homeowner in mind: Array uses proven Wi-Fi wireless technology to enable turn-key operation right out of the box. Homeowners can install Array using a single screwdriver, and easily connect to their home router; To power the deadbolt’s Wi-Fi connection, Array uses an innovative power management system that combines a proprietary battery PLUS an onboard photovoltaic panel that captures light energy from a variety of indoor and outdoor sources – even in dim light – to sustain the lock’s functions; Array’s unique, advanced power management circuitry regulates the battery’s intake and output to provide a multi-year, useful battery life; Array users can open their doors three ways: via smartphone, touch pad, or traditional metal key; The Array smartphone app for iOS and Android devices enables multiple usage and tracking functions; Data encryption, two-step authentication, and a highly secure cloud architecture provides enterprise-class security; The photovoltaic panel built into the elegantly designed deadbolt doubles as a cover to the discretely hidden metal touchpad; and, in addition to working as a stand-alone connected deadbolt, Array will also work with popular Smart Home systems. The Array smartphone app will allow the user to operate the deadbolt with both iOS and Android devices. Using cloud connectivity and point-to-point connections between the cloud, mobile app, and deadbolt, consumers can open their doors with a smartphone instead of using keys; provide access remotely to guests using E-Keys and E-Codes; check to confirm whether the door is closed and locked; and use the app to view door lock usage, and schedule or manage user access. Array digital deadbolts will employ a highly secure cloud architecture and two-factor authentication to ensure users maintain full control over access to their home. All data transmitted between the deadbolt, app, and cloud will be protected by encryption protocols. Array digital deadbolts will also be compatible with Apple HomeKit, Works with Nest products, and various Smart Home platforms. Array digital deadbolts feature durable construction, meet or exceed American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Grade 2 standards – the high performance rating for residential door hardware – and are pick-resistant, bump-resistant, and drill-resistant. Easy to install, Array deadbolts will be available in several finishes to match almost any décor, including satin nickel, Tuscan Bronze®, and polished brass.

Walmart's 'Made In USA' Push Has Become Incredibly Complicated

(Reuters) - When Walmart
  pledged last year to buy an extra $250 billion in U.S.-made goods
  over the next decade, it appeared to be just what was needed to
  help move America's putative manufacturing renaissance from
  rhetoric to reality.

  But suppliers trying to reshore production as part of the
  initiative by the world's largest retailer are running into
  practical problems as they try to restart long-idled corners of
  U.S. manufacturing.

  Companies that make the leap have to grapple with a host of
  challenges, including a shallow pool of component suppliers, an
  inexperienced workforce, and other shortcomings that developed
  during the country's long industrial decline.

  "A lot of the tribal knowledge and skill sets are gone because
  the humans who used to do that work have either retired or died,"
  says H. Kim Kelley, the CEO of Hampton Products International, a
  privately held maker of locks, lighting and other household
  hardware. The Foothill Ranch, California-based company began
  selling products made in Asia to Walmart in the 1990s and is now
  supplying it with some U.S.-made products.

  Trying to rebuild that manufacturing capability, while making
  products that meet Walmart's standards, can require companies to
  “start from scratch,” Kelley says.





  Cindi Marsiglio, the Walmart vice president overseeing the U.S.
  sourcing push, says the retailer and its existing suppliers have
  150 active reshoring projects in various stages of development.
  For all too many, she says, finding U.S.-made component parts has
  emerged as a vexing problem.

  Hampton, which also makes tow straps, tie-downs and bungee cords
  for the automotive market, had a hard time locating a U.S. maker
  of lightweight but strong polyester yarn. Marsiglio says other
  suppliers complain of difficulty finding small motors, as well as
  plastic injection molding equipment and computerized cut-and-sew
  tools.

  The issue is so widespread that Walmart is making it the focus of
  a two-day summit it is hosting in August in Denver. At a similar
  summit held in Orlando last year, Walmart focused on connecting
  suppliers with economic development officers from states hoping
  to lure the new factories.

  The retailer says it is especially interested in having factory
  owners with excess capacity attend the August event - even those
  that aren't interested in supplying Walmart directly. The hope is
  that they can become contract manufacturers to Walmart suppliers
  looking to produce in the United States.

  On July 8, it is also inviting hundreds of potential vendors to
  an "open call" to pitch U.S.-made products to the retailer in
  Bentonville, Arkansas, where it is based.

SHUT PLANTS

  Walmart's critics say the company bears some responsibility for
  the diminished capability of U.S. manufacturers. For years, its
  relentless insistence that suppliers cut costs prompted companies
  to shut domestic plants and shift production to low-wage
  countries.

  Now, the retailer is asking companies to come back home - though
  they need little prompting. The forces pulling production back to
  the United States are powerful and real and include lower
  domestic energy prices, increasingly competitive wage rates, the
  benefits of greater automation, and a renewed appreciation for
  the value of being able to respond quickly to shifting U.S.
  customer demands.

  Still, starting up a manufacturing operation is a complex
  undertaking, especially for vendors like Hampton and Redman &
  Associates, an Arkansas-based toymaker.

  Last year, Redman sold 1.1 million battery-powered ride-on toys,
  such as large toy cars, in the United States - every one of them
  made in Chinese contract plants. By 2016, the privately held
  company plans to be producing about 600,000 of those toys each
  year out of a brand-new company-owned and run plant in the U.S.

  Mel Redman, the company's CEO and chairman, says the transition
  has required the company to reverse engineer everything its
  Chinese contractors were doing - an exercise that wasn't easy
  given his executive team's background in retail.

  “We didn’t know much about manufacturing – we didn’t know
  anything about it really,” he says.

SHIPPING COSTS

  Walmart declines to say how many products it has introduced as a
  result of the 18-month-old Made in USA initiative. But the
  company says consumers can now buy everything from U.S.-made
  flat-screen TVs, light bulbs and towels and curtains in its
  stores and on its website.

  The flat-screen TVs, made in Winnsboro, South Carolina by Element
  Electronics, may be the campaign’s biggest surprise to date.

  Founded in 2007, Element had until this year made all its TVs in
  Asia - but it was unable to get them on Walmart's shelves because
  there was nothing that differentiated them from rivals' products,
  says CEO Mike O'Shaughnessy.

  “So we began to think about what we could do differently. Well,
  one of the things we could do differently is to make our TVs at
  home,” he says.

  Element built a small test plant in Michigan that began producing
  flat-screen TVs shortly before Walmart announced the Made in USA
  push in January 2013. The announcement prompted the company to
  fast-track its expansion. Today, Element’s 315,000-square-foot
  plant in South Carolina has six assembly lines making 32- and
  40-inch TVs that are now available in all of Walmart's more than
  4,000 U.S. stores.

  The switch has led to significant savings in ocean freight
  charges and customs duties on finished goods - though like so
  many companies involved in the initiative Element has had
  difficulty finding domestic suppliers. "We import the vast
  majority of our parts," says O'Shaughnessy. "Longer term, the
  more success we have procuring our parts domestically, the better
  off we expect to be." 

  Although Walmart has given itself 10 years to meet its $250
  billion goal, Marsiglio says the retailer hopes to meet the
  target ahead of schedule. She says the point of the "open call"
  next month is to simplify a product pitching process that can
  challenge even long-time suppliers.

  But while the door is open, the bar is high and Walmart will
  require any applicants to open their financial books as part of
  the screening process.

  Given Walmart’s reputation as a tough negotiator with suppliers,
  the disclosure of sensitive financial information to the retailer
  requires a leap of faith. But Element's O'Shaughnessy said his
  company had no misgivings about opening its books. Walmart needs
  to know it can rely on its vendors, he said.

  “What does it cost to produce product? What does it cost to move
  product? Every one of the variables that make up the cost of the
  product we (shared) with Walmart,” he says.
