Company Summary


We're a company that has partnered with some of the world's leading researchers into the rapidly growing field of mindfulness. Mindfulness is a practice that has received increasing scientific attention as a way to combat stress and chronic disease states that result from stress, and maladaptive coping behaviors such as smoking, overeating, and misusing alcohol and drugs.

From this state-of-the-art research, we've created sustainable behavioral change programs that tackle the root causes of chronic disease, rising health care costs, and health-related productivity losses. We're the only company delivering live, interactive, mind-body wellness curriculums online, offering them to employers, insurers, and TPAs.

Our programs are taught by licensed health professionals, including physicians and psychotherapists, and are designed to help people prevent, mitigate, and slow the progression of diseases associated with family, work, and lifestyle risk factors.

We've partnered with Duke University Health System, Duke Integrative Medicine, UC San Diego Medical Center, The University of Pennsylvania Medical Center, and Aetna, among others.

eMindful 










Help employees achieve more mindfulness in their everyday lives 


eMindful is an educational program focused on enhancing health and wellness. Employees and associates can take these live, webinar-style classes at their computers and mobile devices, or in a group setting.
The end goal of each eMindfulness course is to help employees improve their mental resilience, manage stress, and make positive changes to their behaviors and habits.










Key features 



Mindfulness practice is effective in reducing stress and moderating stress-related behaviors such as smoking, overeating, and self-medicating, which can lead to costly health problems.
Our research* shows that mindfulness practices can improve productivity and reduce stress:

Less stress: 28.6% improvement on Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score
Better sleep quality: 20.3% improvement on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index
Higher productivity: 47 minutes more productive time per week, based on the Work Limitations Questionnaire













Additional features 


Four classes are available:









Stress Reduction and Resilience: Stress Less, Live More™


Employees can learn to manage work-related stressors and raise awareness of behavioral patterns that undermine success. This class focuses on bringing more of what’s good into life.





Tobacco Cessation: QuitSmart® Mindfully™


This course combines the effectiveness of the QuitSmart program with innovative mindfulness techniques, helping employees use the mind and learn self-hypnosis techniques to help them ease off nicotine and kick tobacco.




Weight Management: Weight Balance for Life™


This weight-loss program takes a whole-person approach to the many challenges of diet, nutrition and exercise. It combines conventional information about nutrition and fitness with practices for reconnecting the mind and body to determine hunger and fullness.




Diabetes Management: Living Fully with Diabetes™


This program addresses educational, nutritional, behavioral, and mind-body awareness to help provide sustainable methods for  the management of diabetes. Participants in this program can learn how to: feel more confident living with diabetes, reduce stressors that negatively impact diabetes management, and improve their overall health and well-being.






* Findings based on the Program Results Analysis from eMindful’s Resiliency and Stress Management Programs (performed June 3, 2015).

How does mindfulness work?








What is mindfulness?


How will I benefit?


How do I practice?











Mindfulness is the ability to intentionally focus your attention in the present moment, with curiosity and interest.
When you do this, you can become more aware of your thoughts, emotions and physical sensations as they are happening, without being swept away by them.
Mindfulness training is brain training. By practicing, you begin to notice when your mind has wandered, you can let go of distractions more easily, and you can refocus on what is important in the moment. In short, you become more mentally and emotionally fit.
Some people describe mindfulness as truly living life instead of operating on autopilot, worrying about the future, or reliving the past. When we are mindful, we are aware and clear about what is happening now. We can make better choices today, which increases the likelihood of a happier tomorrow. 










Most of us experience some level of stress, usually in the form of the most common negative emotions like frustration, worry or anger.
Mindfulness doesn’t change what happens to us; it changes the way we choose to react to it.
 Practicing Mindfulness reduces stress, anxiety and negative reactivity. It increases cognitive control, positive mood, health, creativity and productivity.
Neuroscience shows regular mindfulness practice can increase the size of brain areas associated with learning and memory and shrink those linked to stress and anxiety.










Practicing Mindfulness is like practicing a musical instrument or any other skill — the more you practice, the better you get.
You practice to develop your attention, concentration and ability to be present without being judgmental. You turn your attention to your body, thoughts and emotions, welcoming whatever you find. It’s like discovering what’s already here.
The purpose of practicing mindfulness isn’t to perfect it. The purpose is to be more present to what’s happening here and now... less lost in thought, unfocused and distracted.
It takes some guidance to learn how to do this... live classes, where you can participate in a community with experienced teachers and ask questions, is the most effective way to practice.
With practice you improve. And it gets easier. The more proficient you are, the more present you are and the more you see situations clearly and control you have over your reactions.

The Masters Series










Stress Reduction
Stress negatively impacts health and makes us less resilient. Mindfulness has been shown to have a positive impact on a range of physiological processes, including lowering blood pressure, reversing metabolic syndrome and reducing unintended emotional, reactionary responses.


Mindful Eating
Conventional approaches to weight loss include exercise and diet management, yet research consistently shows people who are capable of losing weight don't keep it off. This is partly because eating has become a way of habitually coping with stress, difficult emotions and boredom. Bringing mindfulness to eating will help you enjoy food in ways you may have never experienced before, and help improve your weight balance.


Mindful Daily
Live sessions every day of the week, multiple times per day always with a new topic of how to apply mindfulness skills into your daily life.


The Masters Series
Practice with some of the luminaries and notable names in mindfulness in intimate sessions with a limited number of live participants.

OPC - Frequently Asked Questions



How do I earn Minutes of Mindfulness for my charity?
Every minute you spend in a live Mindful Daily course will increase our donation to your charity. The more Mindful Dailies you attend, the more you earn!
Can I change my choice of Charity in the middle of the challenge?
No. After you complete registration for the 1% Challenge your chosen charity team cannot be changed.
Who makes the donation?
eMindful will make the donation based on how much you participate.
How do you track Minutes of Mindfulness?
We track Minutes of Mindfulness by the amount of time you spend practicing in live Mindful Daily sessions — it does not count by just registering for a class, watching recorded content or using Chime Time or other features. You can join any number of live Mindful Daily sessions during the day, every day of the week and accrue additional minutes. To schedule and attend a Mindful Daily session, navigate to “Live Classes” and register for one or more of the Mindful Daily sessions on that page. Then, attend the session as shown in the “My Schedule” page.
Do my Minutes of Mindfulness count toward the personal rewards too?
Sort of, but no. Your personal rewards are earned by how many days you participate in the Challenge. The number of minutes you practice per day does not change the number of days you practice.
I’m going to do all 30 days! but... just in case... how do I see which days I have missed?
Hover or tap on the 1% Challenge progress bar (on the Dashboard, My Schedule, Live Classes, and On Demand pages) to see a list of dates attended, missed, and remaining in the Challenge.
I’m traveling and am in a different time zone now — when does the “day” begin and end?
Days are counted starting at 12:00AM Eastern Time (midnight) at the beginning of a Mindful Daily. Any Mindful Daily attended that starts before midnight is counted towards the previous day. Please remember that the time that is shown is based on what time zone you set in the Account Info of your profile.
Does a “Full Course” count towards my total?
Only Mindful Daily courses count toward your 1% Challenge goals. Full Courses do not contribute to the 1% Challenge.
I don’t think I’ve missed a day, but the progress bar shows I missed one — why?
Please make sure that the Mindful Daily classes you attend fall inside the 24-hour range of the time zone you provided. If you believe that there is an error, please contact support@emindful.com
How do I claim my rewards?
After the Challenge has officially ended, we will send out a notification to your registered email address on how to claim your rewards. Please make sure you have not opted-out of receiving emails or you will likely not receive instructions on how to claim your rewards. Additional details about the rewards are contained in the Terms and Conditions of the 1% Challenge.
Can I earn all the Rewards if I participate all 30 days?
No. The Rewards are not cumulative, once you earn a new Reward package level it will replace the package level before it.
Don’t see an answer to your question?
If you have another question, please contact support@emindful.com

This is Vanessa. This is Vanessa being happy and productive at her job. But a few weeks ago, this was Vanessa: tired, struggling and stressed about family and financial issues.
 This is Vanessa’s boss Frank. Frank saw Vanessa was having a hard time, and wondered, “What can I do to help when I see my employees struggling?”
 That’s when Frank discovered Humana Wellness. As an employer, when you choose to work with Humana, there is a wide range of wellness programs and services available to address many of your employees’ needs. Well-being isn’t just physical. It’s mental, emotional, financial and social too.
 When your employees are overwhelmed by work, finances and everyday responsibilities, it can cause them to not only be unhappy and unhealthy, but less productive as well. 
Creating a culture of well-being is one of the best ways to make wellness programming successful. At Humana, that’s far more than just a catchphrase. It’s about fostering a culture in which employees can participate in well-being in a tangible way—providing programs for stress relief, financial advice, and work-life services that keep your employees engaged and productive at work. And we’ll be with you every step of the way, helping you create the culture that works best for your business.
 We know that no two companies are alike, and there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Employers need a partner in well-being, not a transaction-based corporate contract. Our vision, resources and ability to collaborate result in a custom strategy that’s a unique fit for your organization. Humana has the tools and know-how to make your wellness strategy a success, and that success can be measured in both reduced employee absences and lower healthcare costs. 
Frank used Humana Wellness programs to offer extra support and resources to Vanessa. Now she’s the happy, healthy and productive person you see today. That’s good for Vanessa. And it’s great for business, too.
To learn more about how Humana can help, talk to a Humana sales representative today.

OPC - Frequently Asked Questions



How do I earn Minutes of Mindfulness for my charity?
Every minute you spend in a live Mindful Daily course will increase our donation to your charity. The more Mindful Dailies you attend, the more you earn!
Can I change my choice of Charity in the middle of the challenge?
No. After you complete registration for the 1% Challenge your chosen charity team cannot be changed.
Who makes the donation?
eMindful will make the donation based on how much you participate.
How do you track Minutes of Mindfulness?
We track Minutes of Mindfulness by the amount of time you spend practicing in live Mindful Daily sessions — it does not count by just registering for a class, watching recorded content or using Chime Time or other features. You can join any number of live Mindful Daily sessions during the day, every day of the week and accrue additional minutes. To schedule and attend a Mindful Daily session, navigate to “Live Classes” and register for one or more of the Mindful Daily sessions on that page. Then, attend the session as shown in the “My Schedule” page.
Do my Minutes of Mindfulness count toward the personal rewards too?
Sort of, but no. Your personal rewards are earned by how many days you participate in the Challenge. The number of minutes you practice per day does not change the number of days you practice.
I’m going to do all 30 days! but... just in case... how do I see which days I have missed?
Hover or tap on the 1% Challenge progress bar (on the Dashboard, My Schedule, Live Classes, and On Demand pages) to see a list of dates attended, missed, and remaining in the Challenge.
I’m traveling and am in a different time zone now — when does the “day” begin and end?
Days are counted starting at 12:00AM Eastern Time (midnight) at the beginning of a Mindful Daily. Any Mindful Daily attended that starts before midnight is counted towards the previous day. Please remember that the time that is shown is based on what time zone you set in the Account Info of your profile.
Does a “Full Course” count towards my total?
Only Mindful Daily courses count toward your 1% Challenge goals. Full Courses do not contribute to the 1% Challenge.
I don’t think I’ve missed a day, but the progress bar shows I missed one — why?
Please make sure that the Mindful Daily classes you attend fall inside the 24-hour range of the time zone you provided. If you believe that there is an error, please contact support@emindful.com
How do I claim my rewards?
After the Challenge has officially ended, we will send out a notification to your registered email address on how to claim your rewards. Please make sure you have not opted-out of receiving emails or you will likely not receive instructions on how to claim your rewards. Additional details about the rewards are contained in the Terms and Conditions of the 1% Challenge.
Can I earn all the Rewards if I participate all 30 days?
No. The Rewards are not cumulative, once you earn a new Reward package level it will replace the package level before it.
