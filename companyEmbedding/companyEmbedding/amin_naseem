About Bellerophon
Bellerophon Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biotherapeutics company focused on developing innovative therapies at the intersection of drugs and devices that address significant unmet medical needs in the treatment of cardiopulmonary and cardiac diseases. The Company has two programs in advanced clinical development. The first program, INOpulse®, is based on the Company’s proprietary pulsatile nitric oxide delivery device. The Company is currently developing two product candidates under its INOpulse program: one for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), for which the Company intends to commence Phase 3 clinical trials in the second half of 2015, and the other for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (PH-COPD), which is in Phase 2 development. The Company’s second program is bioabsorbable cardiac matrix (BCM), an injectable device for the prevention of cardiac remodeling and subsequent congestive heart failure following acute myocardial infarction (AMI), commonly known as a heart attack. BCM is currently in a placebo-controlled clinical trial, expected to report top-line results in mid-2015, designed to support CE mark registration in the European Union and, assuming positive results, to provide the basis for an additional registration trial in the United States. Bellerophon has an exclusive worldwide license to BCM from BioLineRx Ltd.

                                Report abuseTranscript of Soccer photo credit Nasa / Goddard Space Flight Center / Reto StöckliThe Best Sport In The WorldFootball (Soccer)What is Soccer?Association football, usually known as football or soccer, is a sport played between two teams of eleven players with an around ball. Soccer is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries, making soccer the world's most popular sport. The game is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end of the field. The point of the game is to score by kicking the ball into the opposing goal.What does a soccer field look like and made out of?A soccer field is the playing surface for the game of Football (soccer) and it's made out of turf.What are the soccer rules?Soccer is one of the simplest sports in the world. This may be the reason why it's the most popular sport in the world. You will find the basic soccer rules to play the game easy to understand. The rules become more complicated and technical with the level of play. But even at the professional level they are quite simple. FIFA, International Federation of Football, holds the official rules to the game. According to them, the official rules may be modified in their application for players of under 16 years of age, female soccer players, veteran players (over 35 years of age), and for players with disabilities.Why did I choose this topic?What is FIFA?How Soccer positions look like and names.All the positions that are played in a soccer game.I chose this topic because I wanted to learn more about, soccer is one of my favourite sports and I enjoy playing soccer.I have friends that play soccer and I find soccer interesting I really wanted to find a lot of information it or ask my friends for more information about soccer.Soccer FieldTurf grassSoccer RuleStarting the GameThe game is started at the centre of the field. The team who kicks off passes the ball forward to a teammate at the referees signal. The opposing team is not allowed to enter the centre circle until the team kicks off.Out of BoundsIf the ball crosses the side line it is a throw in. The team who did not touch the ball last before the ball crossed the line gets the throw in.Corner kickIf the team that is defending that goal line touches it out it is a corner kick. If the team attacking that goal kicks it out it is a goal kick.How long is a game?For basic soccer rules a game is no more than 90 minutes long. Two halves of 45 minutes and 15 minutes half time break.NO HANDS!Alright, I know you probably knew this but here it is anyway. Only the goalie can use their hands touch the ball.Do I play soccer?No I don't play, I play rugby. I just play soccer with my friends at school or at parks out of school. If I was able to play at school I would be a goal keeper.The Federation Internationale Football Association is the international controlling body of association football, futsal and beach soccer. FIFA supports 209 nationals. The house of FIFA is in Switzerland, and the president of FIFA is Sepp Blatter. FIFA is responsible for the organization of football's major international tournaments, especially the World Cup.Bibliographyhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_footballhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFAhttp://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/melbourne-storm-fullback-billy-slater-playing-with-severe-tendonitis-in-his-foot/story-e6frexnr-1226317060067http://www.foxsports.com.au/league/nrl-premiership/melbourne-storm-duo-billy-slater-and-cooper-cronk-100-per-cent-fit-to-take-on-south-sydney/story-fn2mcuj6-1226619222002#.UamhekDI2N0http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football_pitchhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Football_pitch_metric_and_imperial.svghttp://www.tulsaturf.com/http://clca.clc-church.com/soccer/http://www.everyjoe.com/2007/11/29/sports/kaka-planning-evangelical-career-post-soccer/https://www.facebook.com/castrolfootballhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2012/nov/22/nextgen-football-elite-youth-europehttp://www.ronaldo7.net/news/archive/290-levante-1-0-real-madrid-half-ronaldo-was-not-enough-to-avoid-the-loss.htmlhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2012/jun/09/euro-2012-cristiano-ronaldo-portugal-germanyhttp://www.soccerbible.com/news/general/archive/2009/05/28/lionel-messi-watch-28-05-09.aspxhttp://www.student.nvcc.edu/home/udpyakurel/Untitled-1.htmlhttp://www.pophistorydig.com/?tag=zidane-biographyhttp://www.football-tricks.com/zidane.htmlAndre MachochiThanks for Listening to my PreziNaseem AminNaseem AminBilly SlaterJohnathan ThurstonFull transcriptPopular presentationsSee more popular or the latest prezisPreziProductGalleryThe ScienceConversational PresentingFor BusinessTestimonialsCompanyAboutTeamCareersOur ValuesPressOur CustomersContact UsLanguages
