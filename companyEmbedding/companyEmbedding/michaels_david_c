Doubt is Their Product: How Industry's Assault on Science Threatens Your Health




Author
David Michaels


Publisher
Oxford University Press



Publication date

2008


ISBN
0199719764


Doubt is Their Product: How Industry's Assault on Science Threatens Your Health is a 2008 book by David Michaels, Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health under U.S. President Obama.
"Doubt is our product," a cigarette executive once observed, "since it is the best means of competing with the 'body of fact' that exists in the minds of the general public. It is also the means of establishing a controversy." Michaels argues that for decades cigarette manufacturers knew that their product was hazardous to people's health, but hired mercenary scientists who "manufactured uncertainty by questioning every study, dissecting every method, and disputing every conclusion". In doing so the tobacco industry waged a campaign that "successfully delayed regulation and victim compensation for decades"
Doubt is Their Product documents how the tobacco industry's tactics spawned a multimillion dollar industry that is dismantling public health safeguards in areas far from tobacco. Product defense consultants, he argues, have increasingly skewed the scientific literature, manufactured and magnified scientific uncertainty, and influenced policy decisions to the advantage of polluters and the manufacturers of dangerous products. To keep the public confused about the hazards posed by global warming, second-hand smoke, asbestos, lead, plastics, and many other toxic materials, industry executives have hired unscrupulous scientists and lobbyists to dispute scientific evidence about health risks. In doing so, they have not only delayed action on specific hazards, but they have constructed barriers to make it harder for lawmakers, government agencies, and courts to respond to future threats.[1]
Doubt is Their Product has been reviewed in Science,[2] New Scientist,[3] and Chemical and Engineering News.[4]

Known for taking the road less traveled, Michael David Winery has always stood apart from the crowd. Whether it be their outlandish brands and packaging or their quirky personalities, Michael and David are definitely on a stage of their own and this wine showcases just that. The fruit for this brute of a Cab comes from the original “super freak,” Michael Phillips’ vineyard located only a medicine balls toss away from the winery.

Wine Profile

Tasting Notes
Bing cherry, toasted French vanilla bean and a hint of juniper berry on the nose. In the palate oak and fruit flavors are complemented with refined tannins and flavors of dark ripe plums, mission figs and toasted legumes.


Food Pairing Notes
Winemaker Jeff Farthing's favorite pairing for Freakshow Cab and filet mignon with bearnaise sauce and grilled asparagus.

The wine...excellent.  The label...AMAZING!  How can I learn the story of the label? 







David Kris







(Oct 22, 2016 at 5:39 PM)
2013 Cabernet Sauvignon, WOW we tasted it at Trader Joe's. we thought it was a good wine. We brought a bottle home and let it breath a bit. What an excellent wine. Now we want more! Congrats  Michael  and David this really was nice. 







Ken







(Oct 30, 2016 at 4:35 PM)
Excellent wine for the price. A jubilee of fruit on the front with subtle tannin on the back. I've paired with steak & roast--you won't be disappointed buy at least two 







Kevin







(Dec 16, 2016 at 1:54 PM)
This is pretty much all I drink these days. Gives me that nice face buzz and has excellent full-body taste. 







Keith







(Jan 28, 2017 at 5:33 PM)
Bought two bottles for the label. Drank it. Bought a case for the  He taste. 







Tina







(Feb 14, 2017 at 5:55 PM)
OH MY! I can't sing the praises of Freakshow, there's so many. I love this wine! I don't even like red wine, but I definitely tell EVERYONE (literally) about Freakshow. 







Kevin B







(Mar 27, 2017 at 5:20 PM)
Once it opens up it has a great aroma and better a rich full cab semi-dry flavor.  I enjoyed it with a great filet mignon but others enjoyed it with a chicken dish and even a blackened mahi dish.  Fantastic wine!!! 







Chelsie







(Jun 9, 2017 at 7:32 AM)
I passed the wine isle at a local store and the bottle caught my eye, loving red wine I bought it of course, and after I let it vent for a while, I absolutely LOVED IT!!!! Went back to the store and bought 2 more bottles. Thinking about getting a full case in the future. It's delicious! 







Garrett







(Jun 30, 2017 at 4:20 PM)
It's nice and smooth for a wine in the $20 price range and doesn't taste sharp but it's also a bit thin for a cab. Kinda reminds me of a Pinot Nior merlot blend with a little more oak. Medium to light body here. Still worth the 20 bucks I paid for it
