And the extras put on the very top of the latter push this ladder over the topVerified purchase:  Yes | Condition: Newby 407bobbFeb 17, 2016Great priceThe UPS driver wondered why I bought this on line because I could have gone to Home Depot.  No, a 7' ladder is not available in any hardware store.  It was the the best price any where.  I work on portable buildings and do electrical and acoustical ceilings.  The 6' ladder is just a tad short when reaching up to set anchors in the trusses and an 8' is too tall to move around a 95" ceiling height, so I wondered if there was a 7' ladder out there.    I will be getting a 5' ladder next.Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: Newby honestseller48Oct 29, 2015Not too big, Not too small, Just RightI have six foot and an eight foot commercial aluminum ladder.  But at times neither is just right for the job.  I can climb higher on a six foot ladder and risk falling or the eight foot doesn't fit inside a home well or easy to carry as it's taller and heavier.  This ladder works well in the basement or inside a home and is a sturdy ladder.Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: Newby arlenerotterFeb 16, 2016Awesome ladder!This is the most secure I have ever felt on a ladder. It is exceptionally sturdy and well worth the value.Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: Newby caribbeandreame...Nov 08, 2015Great Ladder,Does all that I expect it to do,replaced a 20 year old Fiberglass ladder that only had a 225 lb ratingVerified purchase:  Yes | Condition: NewThis item doesn't belong on this page.CancelThanks, we'll look into this.

              Is this ladder made in the US?           Asked by: Anonymous             The 6200 Series of ladders are manufactured in Mexico. In recent years Werner Co. has expanded globally to become the world leader in the manufacturing and distribution of ladders, climbing equipment and ladder accessories. Werner is now available in new markets and product categories and has added manufacturing and distribution facilities in the U.S. and around the world to satisfy global demand.            Answered by: Werner Customer Care Date published: 2014-10-24                I would like to buy your 6207ladder at your LA distribution center, to save on shipping. I am having trouble navigating back to the correct web page.           Asked by: Anonymous             Werner Co. does not sell directly. Please visit our website at www.wernerladder.com and utilize our distributor locator to identify the nearest distributors in your area.            Answered by: Werner Customer Care Date published: 2015-11-30                What is the weight of this ladder?           Asked by: Anonymous             The 6207 weighs 26 pounds.            Answered by: Werner Customer Care Date published: 2014-02-05                can I buy a replacement top piece for a 6208 ladder           Asked by: Anonymous             Yes the top of the 6208 ladder is replaceable. In order to determine which top will fit your model of ladder, we would also need the mark number (MK) on the ladder. This number can be found on the duty rating on the side rail of the ladder. If your MK is 12,13,14,15,16, or 17, you would need to order the 38-31. If your MK is 18 you would nee 38-32. If the MK on your ladder is not one of the MK's I have listed above, then we do not have a top for your model of ladder.            Answered by: Werner Customer Care Date published: 2015-07-17                Replacement Labels                     Hi,

I work in an educational environment and have a ladder like the one shown. I noticed the labels are worn off on my ladder. I like my department (IT Dept.) compliant with OSHA. Does Werner distribute replacement labels? If so, how would I obtain these? Thank you for any help you can give. 

Sincerely, 
Philip Long 
IT Director         Asked by: Anonymous             Werner Co. does offer replacement safety label kits, and duty rating label kits. These kits may be special ordered through your local distributors. Please provide the distributor with your model number and they can special order the correct kits for your unit.            Answered by: Werner Customer Care Date published: 2016-10-05                What is the warrantee on this ladder?                     What is the time and coverage if it has a warrantee at all , as I can find no reference to one anywhere?         Asked by: Anonymous             Werner Co. does not offer a written or implied warranty on its products. We do stand behind the quality and workmanship of our models. Issues of this nature would usually become evident within the first 6 to 12 months of ownership.

©  Werner Co. All Rights Reserved.












    
Different types of ladders are designed to keep you safe and productive when 
climbing or standing. Using the wrong style of ladder or simply ignoring the 
limitations of climbing equipment can result in a fall or serious injury.
                








                Height is referring to the actual ladder height. Extension ladders should be 7 to 10 feet longer than the highest support or contact point, which may be the wall or roof line. The highest standing level is four rungs down from the top. The highest permitted standing level on a stepladder is two steps down from the top.
                
Reach height is the maximum reach assuming a 5’6” person with a vertical 12” reach.
            




    
    Ladders are designed to safely hold up to a specific amount of weight. The Werner Performance System defines five different capacities using a color and star rating system. 
	The Duty Rating is defined as the maximum safe load capacity of the ladder. A person’s fully clothed weight plus the weight of any tools and 
	materials that are carried onto the ladder must be less than the load capacity. 
	



    
Werner offers ladder made from fiberglass and aluminum. Each material has characteristics which 
make it best for certain applications, or one material may simply fit the personal preferences 
of the user. For example, if working around electricity users should select fiberglass products 
due to their non-conductive side rails.

Thank you for your feedback.
If you need help or have a question for Customer Service, please visit the Help Section.Building SuppliesWhen building, no matter how small or supersized the structure, if the supplies and tools used in the construction aren't right the building isn't going to turn out to be the monument expected. Instead, it'll only display a shoddiness that might just be unsafe. Because of this, don't cut corners during the planning process. Have the right items, from flooring materials to attic vents, and build better.

Amazon.com's Building Supplies Store has those products every contractor and builder needs, starting with the essential building materials for a variety of spaces: ceiling medallions, ceramic tiles, glass tiles and stone tiles, corbels, flooring materials, moldings and trims, exterior doors, fence post caps, gutter parts and accessories, wood flooring, and attic vents. Moving from materials to constructing, don't forget the necessary rough plumbing items like food disposers, water heaters, water pumps, and toilet parts, electrical essentials and tools like dimmers, door chimes and bells, extension cords, tools and testers, power strips, recessed lighting, switches and outlets, and wall plates, and weather vanes.

There's no need when thinking about moving materials to stress about the bodily wear and tear, however, because we offer handling products, too, such as dollies, drywall lifts, forklifts, hand trucks, lifting straps, lift tables, pallet trucks, pallets, platform trucks, roller stands, service carts, tie-downs, and winches, hoists, and pulleys. And for reaching those second floor and elevated building situations, don't show up without a reliable stepladder, extension ladder, emergency ladder, telescoping ladder, or multiple ladders, and for longer term jobs, some sturdy scaffolding.

In the same way that using weak materials or unhelpful tools is a sure step towards disaster, using a less-than-dependable brand is a bad idea. Shop top brands like 2x4basics, 3M, Cramer, Filtrete, Honeywell, JET, Kidde, Louisville Ladder, Lux, Magna Cart, and Werner and start building with a leg already up. You'll also find a wide range of deals and special offers on building materials and supplies in the Value Center. There won't be a building job in the world you'll back down from finishing.

Product Details

				Offering a full set of rear horizontals and heavy-duty internal spreaders, this stepladder is ideal for the homeowner or the professional. It has a lock-in system to secure tools from falling while keeping them right at hand. The bracing system helps protect the rails from damage. Each knee-braced step is slip resistant and double riveted. The fiberglass rails are nonconductive for working near electricity. Back-up plates reinforce all top connectors.
