    Construction Loans  

When it comes to construction financing, a quick closing can mean the difference between a profitable project built on time and under budget or another lost opportunity. Given the risk that comes with rapidly changing market conditions, Seattle Funding Group’s deal certainty can be a game changer for the experienced builder. While banks are still in loan committee, SFG’s construction borrowers are out of the ground and on their first or second draw. SFG’s construction loan program is the fastest, simplest financing of its kind in the market today.
SFG’s Construction Department is managed by Jim McBride, a construction professional who has been with SFG since 2001. Prior to the close of a construction loan, Jim works closely with the applicant/owner/builder to analyze the essential elements of the project, including the budget, plans, specs, permit status, site conditions, GC and the construction team. After close, Jim continues to work closely with the builder throughout the construction process, up to the point of completion. Jim’s experience, dedication and focus are a tremendous value add for SFG and builders alike. Our many long-term construction relationships and repeat opportunities stem from Jim’s commitment to a quality experience and result for all involved.

“Best service and speed of funding we've had in a long time. Thanks and we hope to have another transaction for you soon.”Jeff MeierhoferThe Madison Group“My experience as a commercial real estate broker has demonstrated that finding a willing buyer and seller is only half the challenge, obtaining the financing that glues the deal together is the other half. Seattle Funding Group provided the service and flexibility that kept all the parties at the table.”Dan StutzCB Richard Ellis“As a broker, I called Seattle Funding Group first because I heard they are the quickest lender around that can get almost anything done fast, and they definitely did that for us. The same day I called, they came out to my client's properties and approved them both the same day. None of the other lenders came close in respect to time or customer service as SFG.”Jared EkdahlGuaranty Mortgage“When our clients need results, the team at Seattle Funding Group is simply the best in the business, bar none.”Peter NisbetMarcus & Millichap“I have referred many customers to Seattle Funding Group over the last 10 years. I know them to be consistent, reliable and customer oriented.”Morris GrobermanSenior Vice President, Colliers International“These guys are good...Very good!”Steve HansenPresident/Founder, JSH Properties“I am so impressed with Seattle Funding Group and the level of performance and service delivered by SFG. Your make sense underwriting truly saved my clients. Furthermore, you actually do what you say you'll do. We closed quickly and easily. My clients are happy, I'm happy. Thank you very much.”Jeff DadeResponse Mortgage Services“After four weeks of hell with a jumbo lender, Seattle Funding Group stepped in, and in 48 hours saved my deal.”Steve TytlerBest Mortgage Services“When it comes to fast closings, Seattle Funding Group is the only equity lender we know that can take a deal down inside of a week.”Keith DaveyEquity Link Financial Services, Inc. Portland, Oregon“Seattle Funding Group says they're fast, I say 'no way', they're the fastest. They recently drafted loan documents within 24 hours of my submission. And because they have no prepay penalty, I don't have to hide from my borrowers when they ask me for a refinance.”Anthony R. OwensPortia Financial Services“Not surprisingly, my customer wanted no prepayment penalty on his $450,000 equity loan. After another broker had worked on it for two months with no success, we took it to Seattle Funding Group. They closed the deal, with no prepayment penalty, inside of a week.”Michael HoveyMortgage Master“The underwriters at Seattle Funding Group are real deal makers. They delivered exactly as promised, on time, and without hassles. I'd use them again and again and again.”Mike ReedWashington Home Mortgage“It is always great doing business with someone that is available as Seattle Funding Group Vice President Kent Rowe has been. Let's continue to develop a SFG, Las Vegas connection!”Bill MagersPrime Cap Financial“I'd like to thank you and your whole group for working as hard as you did to get these loans turned around so quickly. When I decided to pull these from my previous lender, I was a little skeptical on the turn around time you quoted. You and your group came through for us, much appreciated.”Dan BartoliBorrower“I enjoy working with Seattle Funding Group's experienced construction loan manager. On several occasions he has given me ideas and feedback that have avoided unanticipated complications or delays.”Thach NguyenFounder and President Thach Real Estate Group“Finest private money I ever worked with.

Congratulations on a job well done!”Mickey HedgesColdwell Banker Previews International“One week ago we were in the 'talking stage' and here it is a week later 'all done.' From start to finish your team was professional and efficient. Even though we only had a week to close you did not create a sense of panic. We appreciate all you did and look forward to working together in the future.”Philip JemmettJemm Investments, LLC“Because of you... 6 JayMarc employees have stopped collecting unemployment. 14 families will move into a new home this year. 26 contractors and vendors are growing their businesses. 100+ tradesmen are now diligently building JayMarc houses instead of home waiting by the phone. 1 idea, with your support, is changing lives. Thank you for financing JayMarc Homes, you are making a difference.”The JayMarc FamilyJayMarc Homes“I would like to thank you and your team for the professionalism shown when working with our client and the expediency at which your firm approved and closed the loan. It is always a pleasure to know that there are still great people and companies out there still doing 'make sense business' loans. Until the next deal...”Donald D. Green IIIBerkshire Capital“I was very impressed with the turn time and professionalism of the staff at Seattle Funding Group.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner
                        









Advertise Honestly









            Adhere to established standards of advertising and selling.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Make known all material facts in both written and verbal representations, remembering that misrepresentation may result not only from direct statements but by omitting or obscuring relevant facts.
                

                    2. Ensure that any written materials are readily available, clear, accurate and complete.
                







Be Transparent









            Openly identify the nature, location, and ownership of the business, and clearly disclose all policies, guarantees and procedures that bear on a customer's decision to buy.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Upon request, provide BBB with all information required to evaluate compliance with BBB standards. This may include, but is not limited to business name, address and contact information; names and background of principles; business and banking references; licensing and/or professional accreditation; and a complete description of the nature of the business.
                

                    2. Clearly disclose to customers:

                    
1. direct and effective means to contact the business
2. terms of any written contract
3. any guarantees or warranties accompanying a product

                            4. any restrictions or limitations imposed (e.g. limited supply,maximum number available per customer)
                        
5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur
                        
7. total cost of the transaction, including tax, shipping and handling, and other related charges



                    3. If selling products or providing services on Web sites or via other electronic means:

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

 IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT: To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means for you: When you open an account, the lender will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow the lender to identify you. The lender may also ask to see your driver's license and other identifying documents.
*Disclaimer:24/7 Lending Group is not a lender and does not represent lenders as a loan broker or in any other capacity other than as a loan matching referral service, offering free rate quotes with no impact to your credit. 24/7 Lending Group does not run your credit and is not acting as a credit services agent for you. Lenders may perform a soft pull of your credit during the free rate quote process. Soft credit pulls have no impact to your credit scores or rating. You must select a rate quote and then finalize your loan directly with the lender with which you have selected. Any credit product for which you apply is solely the product of the lender. Most lenders will perform a hard credit check under the Fair Credit Reporting Act in order to evaluate your request promptly and adequately. Your permission will be asked for prior to any hard credit inquiry being performed. Final rates, terms and fees will be based on your individual credit history and underwritten by the lender NOT 24/7 Lending Group. 24/7 Lending Group cannot guarantee final terms, rates or repayments as they vary by lender. Providing your information on this Website does not guarantee approval for a product offering.  There is no charge to use 24/7 Lending Group service. 24/7 Lending Group may receive compensation from a lender in certain circumstances.
  Rate quotes provided to customers will be no greater than 35.99% APR (APRs include 0-5% origination fees), with terms from 12 to 72 months and available borrowing amounts of $1,000 to $35,000. Representative Personal Loan Example: For a $5,000 36-month loan at an interest rate of 6.03% with a 1.11% origination fee of $55.50, you will receive a loan amount of $4,944.50 and will make 36 monthly payments of about $152.18 at a 6.78% APR. Total loan cost would be $5,478.48.

 IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT: To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means for you: When you open an account, the lender will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow the lender to identify you. The lender may also ask to see your driver's license and other identifying documents.
*Disclaimer:24/7 Lending Group is not a lender and does not represent lenders as a loan broker or in any other capacity other than as a loan matching referral service, offering free rate quotes with no impact to your credit. 24/7 Lending Group does not run your credit and is not acting as a credit services agent for you.

There is no charge to use 24/7 Lending Group service. 24/7 Lending Group may receive compensation from a lender in certain circumstances.
  Rate quotes provided to customers will be no greater than 35.99% APR (APRs include 0-5% origination fees), with terms from 12 to 72 months and available borrowing amounts of $1,000 to $35,000.
