BAYNON
INTERNATIONAL CORP. 

NOTES TO
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 MARCH 31, 2010 AND 2009
(UNAUDITED)

1. THE
COMPANY

Baynon
International Corp. formerly known as Technology Associates
Corporation (the "Company"), was originally incorporated on
February 29, 1968 under the laws of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking. On
December 28, 1989, the Company reincorporated under the laws of the
State of Nevada. The Company was formerly engaged in the technology
marketing business and its securities traded on the National
Association of Securities Dealers OTC Bulletin Board. The Company
has not engaged in any business operations for at least the last
eight fiscal years and has no operations to date.

The
Company will attempt to identify and negotiate with a business
target for the merger of that entity with and into the Company. In
certain instances, a target company may wish to become a subsidiary
of the company or wish to contribute assets to the Company rather
than merge.

No
assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in
identifying or negotiating with any target company. The Company
provides a means for a foreign or domestic private company to
become a reporting (public) company whose securities would be
qualified for trading in the United States secondary
market.

2. SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Interim
Presentation
The December 31, 2009 balance sheet data was derived from audited
financial statements but does not include all disclosures required
by generally accepted accounting principles. In the opinion of
management, the accompanying unaudited financial statements contain
all normal and recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly
the financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2010, its
results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and
2009 and its cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2010
and 2009.

The
statements of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2010
and 2009 are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full
year.

While the
Company believes that the disclosures presented are adequate to
make the information not misleading, these financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and
accompanying notes included in the Company's annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009.

Earnings
(Loss) Per Share
The Company computes earnings or loss per share in accordance with
Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards
Codification ("ASC") 260, "Earnings Per Share". Basic earnings per
share is computed by dividing income available to common
stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential
dilution that could occur if securities or other agreements to
issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock.
Diluted earnings per share is computed based upon the
weighted

(UNAUDITED)

average
number of common shares and dilutive common equivalent shares
outstanding, which includes convertible debentures, stock options
and warrants. The following securities have been excluded from the
calculation of loss per share for the three months ended March 31,
2010 and 2009 as their effect would be anti-dilutive:

Going
Concern
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming
that the Company will continue as a going concern. As shown in the
accompanying financial statements, the Company has incurred
continuing operating losses and has an accumulated deficit of
$237,715 at March 31, 2010. The Company has no revenue generating
operations and has limited cash resources. These factors raise
substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a
going concern.

Management
believes that it will be able to achieve a satisfactory level of
liquidity to meet the Company's obligations through December 31,
2010 by obtaining additional financing from key officers, directors
and certain investors. However, there can be no assurance that the
Company will be able to generate sufficient liquidity to maintain
its operations. The financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might result from the outcome of these
uncertainties.

3.
CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE - STOCKHOLDER

On
December 13, 2008, the Company issued an unsecured note payable to
a stockholder in exchange for $5,000 in cash, in order for the
Company to pay current invoices. The note bore interest at 6% per
annum and matured on December 13, 2009. The stockholder had the
option to convert the note and accrued interest into the Company's
common stock at $.01 per share. The option was exercised on June
15, 2009 and 517,500 shares of common stock were issued in
satisfaction of the note and accrued interest.

On
December 26, 2008, the Company issued an unsecured note payable to
a stockholder in exchange for $20,000 in cash, in order for the
Company to pay current invoices. The note bore interest at 6% per
annum, and matured on December 26, 2009. The stockholder had the
option to convert the note and accrued interest into the Company's
common stock at $.01 per share. The option was exercised on June
15, 2009 and 2,070,000 shares of common stock were issued in
satisfaction of the note and accrued interest.

On
September 1, 2009, the Company issued an unsecured note payable to
a stockholder in exchange for $20,000 in cash, for the Company's
working capital needs. The note bears interest at 6% per annum, and
matures on September 1, 2010. The stockholder has the option to
convert the note and accrued interest into the Company's common
stock at $.01 per share. The option expires on September 1,
2010.

  

BAYNON
INTERNATIONAL CORP.

 MARCH 31, 2010 AND 2009
(UNAUDITED)

At March
31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, accrued interest on the notes was
$693 and $398, respectively. Interest expense amounted to $296 and
$369 for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009,
respectively.

BAYNON
INTERNATIONAL CORP. 

NOTES TO
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 JUNE 30, 2011 AND 2010
(UNAUDITED)

1. THE
COMPANY

Baynon
International Corp., formerly known as Technology Associates
Corporation (the "Company"), was originally incorporated on
February 29, 1968 under the laws of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking. On
December 28, 1989, the Company reincorporated under the laws of the
State of Nevada. The Company was formerly engaged in the technology
marketing business and its securities traded on the National
Association of Securities Dealers OTC Bulletin Board. The Company
has not engaged in any business operations for at least the last
eight fiscal years and has no operations to date.

The
Company will attempt to identify and negotiate with a business
target for the merger of that entity with and into the Company. In
certain instances, a target company may wish to become a subsidiary
of the company or wish to contribute assets to the Company rather
than merge.

No
assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in
identifying or negotiating with any target company. The Company
provides a means for a foreign or domestic private company to
become a reporting (public) company whose securities would be
qualified for trading in the United States secondary
market.

2. SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Interim
Presentation

The
December 31, 2010 balance sheet data was derived from audited
financial statements but does not include all disclosures required
by generally accepted accounting principles. In the opinion of
management, the accompanying unaudited financial statements contain
all normal and recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly
the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2011, its
results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2011 and
2010 and its cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2011 and
2010.

The
statements of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2011 and
2010 are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full
year.

While the
Company believes that the disclosures presented are adequate to
make the information not misleading, these financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and
accompanying notes included in the Company's annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010.

  

Loss Per
Share

The
Company computes loss per share in accordance with Financial
Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards
Codification ("ASC") 260, "Earnings Per Share". Basic earnings per
share is computed by dividing income available to common
stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding, Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential
dilution that could occur if securities or other agreements to
issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock.
Diluted earnings per share is computed based upon the weighted
average number of common shares and dilutive common equivalent
shares outstanding, which includes convertible debentures, stock
options and warrants. The following securities have been excluded
from the calculation of loss per share for the six months ended
June 30, 2011 and 2010 as their effect would be
anti-dilutive: 

 




                                                
2011        2010
                                             
---------   ---------
Convertible note payable and accrued
  interest -
stockholder                     
3,877,677   2,099,288




 

Going
Concern

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that
the Company will continue as a going concern. As shown in the
accompanying financial statements, the Company has incurred
continuing operating losses and has an accumulated deficit of
$267,232 at June 30, 2011. The Company has no revenue generating
operations and has limited cash resources. These factors raise
substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a
going concern.

Management
believes that it will be able to achieve a satisfactory level of
liquidity to meet the Company's obligations through June 30, 2012
by obtaining additional financing from key officers, directors and
certain investors. However, there can be no assurance that the
Company will be able to generate sufficient liquidity to maintain
its operations. The financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might result from the outcome of these
uncertainties.

Fair Value
of Financial Instruments

The
carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash and cash
equivalents, accounts payable, notes payable, and accrued expenses
approximate fair value based on the short-term maturity of those
instruments.

Recently
Issued Accounting Standards

Management
does not believe that any recently issued but not yet effective
accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material
effect on the accompanying financial statements.

  

3.
CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE - STOCKHOLDERS

On
September 1, 2009, the Company issued an unsecured note payable to
a stockholder in exchange for $20,000 in cash, for the Company's
working capital needs. The note bored interest at 6% per annum and
matured on September 1, 2010. The stockholder had the option to
convert the note and accrued interest into the Company's common
stock at $.01 per share. On September 1, 2010, the note was
extended (renewed) to September 1, 2011, with the same terms as the
original note with the exception of the option to convert changed
to $.0125 per share. The option expires on September 1,
2011.

On August
23, 2010, the Company issued an unsecured note payable to the same
stockholder in exchange for $25,000 in cash, for the Company's
working capital needs. The note bears interest at 6% per annum, and
matured on August 23, 2011. The stockholder has the option to
convert the note and accrued interest into the Company's common
stock at $.0125 per share. The option expires on August 23,
2011.

At June
30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, accrued interest on the notes was
#3,471 and $2,132 respectively. Interest expense amounted to $1,339
and $595 for the six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010,
respectively.

Company has evaluated subsequent events through the date that the
