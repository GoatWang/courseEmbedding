Jeffrey F. O’Donnell, Sr. Rejoins BioSig Technologies’ Board of Directors

2 years ago

Appointed as Chairman of the Compensation Committee

BioSig Technologies (OTCQB: BSGM), a medical device company that is developing its proprietary PURE EP™ technology platform designed to improve the clinical outcomes of electrophysiology (EP) procedures, today announced Jeffrey F. O’Donnell, Sr. has rejoined BioSig’s Board of Directors and will serve as Chairman of the Compensation Committee. Mr. O’Donnell sat on BioSig’s Board of Directors from October 2011 through February 2014.
 
Mr. O’Donnell has extensive experience in the healthcare industry, combining a traditional corporate background with serial entrepreneurship. Over his career he has raised in excess of $300 million in equity and debt capital in both public and private markets.
Currently, Mr. O’Donnell serves as CEO and Chairman of the Board of privately-held Trice Medical™, which develops optical guided needles for the detection of soft tissue damage in human joints. He joined Trice Medical in March 2011. Prior to joining Trice Medical, Mr. O’Donnell founded Embrella Cardiovascular, which developed a product to protect heart patients from blood clots. In three years, he raised $9 million in private offerings, and in 2011 the company was purchased by Edwards Lifesciences for $43 million.
Mr. O’Donnell also founded PhotoMedex, a publicly traded medical device company in December 1999 and served as CEO and Director until 2009. In 2009, Mr. O’Donnell also served as Managing Director of BioStar Ventures, a venture capital firm founded by physicians and medical business leaders to invest in early stage medical devices.
Prior to the founding of PhotoMedex, Mr. O’Donnell served as President, COO and was promoted to CEO of Radiance Medical (formerly Cardiovascular Dynamics, Inc). Raising over $50 million through an initial public offering, the company maintained strategic alliances with Medtronic and Guidant Corporation. Mr. O’Donnell served as CEO and Chairman until the company was purchased by Endologix in 2000. During his career Mr. O’Donnell also held senior sales positions at Guidant Corporation, Boston Scientific Corporation and the Orthopedic Division of Johnson & Johnson.
Mr. O’Donnell also serves as Chairman of the Board of MELA Sciences and as a Board Member of CD Diagnostics. He holds a BS in Business Administration from LaSalle University, Philadelphia, PA. In 2011, he was named the Greater Philadelphia Emerging Entrepreneur by Ernst & Young and in 2005 he was named Price Waterhouse Coopers Life Sciences CEO of the Year.

Greg Cash, BioSig CEO, said, “We are pleased that Jeffrey O’Donnell will rejoin our Board of Directors and Chair the Compensation Committee. Jeffrey brings years of experience in the cardiovascular space and he is the perfect executive to guide and advise the Management of BioSig throughout our overall expansion.”
Jeffrey F. O’Donnell, stated, “BioSig Technologies has outstanding technology that may vastly improve diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in the cardiac electrophysiology laboratory as well as overall patient outcomes. I look forward to working with my fellow Board members and the Management team at BioSig, to bring the company to new levels of excellence.”
About BioSig Technologies
BioSig is a medical device company that has developed a proprietary technology platform designed to greatly improve the $3 billion electrophysiology (EP) marketplace(1), (www.biosigtech.com). Led by a proven management team and a veteran, independent Board of Directors, Los Angeles-based BioSig is preparing to commercialize its PURE EP System.
PURE EP is a next-generation surface electrocardiogram and intracardiac multichannel recording and analysis system designed to assist electrophysiologists in making clinical decisions in real-time by acquiring and displaying high-fidelity cardiac signal recordings and providing guidance in identifying ablation targets — areas of tissue to destroy that otherwise create a heart rhythm disturbance (arrhythmia).
Analysts forecast the global market for EP devices will grow at a 12.1 percent compound annual growth rate, from $2.5 billion in 2012 to $5.5 billion by 2019(1) — making it one of the fastest growing medical device segments. Just in the US, the number of Atrial Fibrillation (AF) and Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) arrhythmia ablations is forecast to grow at 10.5 percent from 2012 to 2017(2).
BioSig intends to seek FDA 510(k) approval for the PURE EP System. The Company has already achieved proof of concept validation through UCLA EP & Animal Labs, and is collaborating with several of the nation’s most prestigious cardiac arrhythmia centers including Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute, UCLA Cardiac Arrhythmia Center, and Mayo Clinic.

Trice Medical Raises $11.6 Million; Appoints Jeffrey O’Donnell Sr. to Chairman and CEO | Trice Medical









































































Trice Medical Raises  $11.6 Million; Appoints Jeffrey O’Donnell Sr. to Chairman and CEO        





WAYNE AND KING OF PRUSSIA, Pa., Jul 17, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX)
Company is pioneering needle-based diagnostic and therapeutic technologies for orthopedics
via PRWEB – Trice Medical™, a private diagnostics company focused on micro invasive technologies, today announced that it closed the first tranche of an $11.6 million Series B financing, which was led by Safeguard Scientifics SFE -0.10%  with participation from BioStar Ventures and other existing investors. Proceeds from the funding will support Trice’s efforts to commercialize and market its initial diagnostic arthroscopy product, mi-eye™, into the physician’s office.
In addition, Jeffrey F. O’Donnell Sr. will transition to the role of Chairman and CEO after serving as Executive Chairman since Trice’s founding in 2011.
As part of this first tranche of financing, Safeguard deployed $1.25 million in Trice and has a 9.6% primary ownership position. The second tranche of financing will close pending 510(k) clearance from the FDA for mi-eye™. With this regulatory milestone, Safeguard expects to deploy an additional $3.75 million in Trice, which will increase Safeguard’s primary ownership to approximately 26%.
“We believe that Trice has the potential to significantly disrupt the current orthopedic diagnostics paradigm,” said Gary J. Kurtzman, M.D. , Managing Director, Healthcare at Safeguard who will join Trice Medical’s board of directors. “Trice is addressing all three major constituents within healthcare–physicians, payers and patients. They already have reimbursement codes for physicians in place; they clearly deliver cost savings for insurers; and they provide a better experience for patients. In addition, we’re thrilled to be working with Jeff O’Donnell again, who previously served as a member of Safeguard’s Life Sciences Advisory Board. His extensive experience in devices and diagnostics, along with Richard H. Washburn–Trice’s President and COO who has 20 years of experience in new product development and medical device commercialization–will prove invaluable for the company as it prepares to commercialize mi-eye™.”
Mr. O’Donnell stated, “mi-eye™ provides the injured patient with an answer to their injury during their first visit to the orthopedic surgeons office. It will shrink the time from injury to recovery and reduce cost to the healthcare system. This financing will allow Trice to begin marketing mi-eye™, pending U.S. FDA Clearance. This is a tremendous opportunity to lead Trice’s team, expand the company’s value proposition, and partner once again with Safeguard Scientifics. The technology and the current market create the perfect environment for the launch of this product.”
Mr. O’Donnell is a serial entrepreneur with more than 30 years of experience leading medical device companies. In 2008, Mr. O’Donnell started Embrella Cardiovascular, a medical device startup company, which was sold in 2011 to Edwards Lifesciences (EW). Prior to Embrella Cardiovascular, Mr. O’Donnell served as President and CEO of PhotoMedex (PHMD) from 1999 to 2009. He was the President and CEO of Radiance Medical Systems (originally Cardiovascular Dynamics) from 1997 to 1999 after serving as its Vice President of Sales and Marketing from 1995 to 1997. From 1994 to 1995 Mr. O’Donnell held the position of President and CEO of Kensey Nash Corporation (KNSY). Additionally, he has held several senior sales and marketing management positions at Boston Scientific Corporation, Guidant Corporation and Johnson & Johnson’s Orthopedic Division.
About mi-eye™
Trice Medical’s mi-eye™ device is designed to provide a more immediate, definitive and less expensive diagnosis, eliminating the false reads of indirect modalities, such as MRIs. Mi-eye™ is a fully disposable, single-use, streamlined visualization device that uses a standard 14-gauge needle with an integrated camera and light source to perform a diagnostic arthroscopy–all while in the physician’s office during the initial consultation. A separate LCD tablet, running on Android OS, is attached via a data cable from the mi-eye™ needle. Mi-eye™ is delivered to customers in sterile packaging and ready for immediate use.
