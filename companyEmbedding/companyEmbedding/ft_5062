Inoculation of bats with European Geomyces destructans supports the novel pathogen hypothesis for the origin of white-nose syndromeProduct Type: Journal ArticleYear: 2012Author(s): Warnecke, L., J. M. Turner, T.K. Bollinger, J.M. Lorch, V. Misra, P.M. Cryan, G. Wibbelt, D.S. Blehert, and C.K.R. WillisSuggested Citation: Warnecke, L., J. M. Turner, T.K. Bollinger, J.M. Lorch, V. Misra, P.M. Cryan, G. Wibbelt, D.S. Blehert, and C.K.R. Willis. 2012. Inoculation of bats with European Geomyces destructans supports the novel pathogen hypothesis for the origin of white-nose syndrome. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. 5. White-nose syndrome (WNS) is an emerging disease of hibernating bats associated with cutaneous infection by the fungus Geomyces destructans (Gd), and responsible for devastating declines of bat populations in eastern North America. Affected bats appear emaciated and one hypothesis is that they spend too much time out of torpor during hibernation, depleting vital fat reserves required to survive the winter. The fungus has also been found at low levels on bats throughout Europe but without mass mortality. This finding suggests that Gd is either native to both continents but has been rendered more pathogenic in North America by mutation or environmental change, or that it recently arrived in North America as an invader from Europe. Thus, a causal link between Gd and mortality has not been established and the reason for its high pathogenicity in North America is unknown...

Dont miss this one! Extraordinary and pristine 2/2-3/2 heated pool home with private back yard & outdoor kitchen in a gated community. The original owner changed the builder's original 3rd bedroom to a family room which can easily be another bedroom with the addition of a closet or free-standing closet. This light & bright open floor plan with volume ceilings and plantation shutters will delight you! The expansive floor plan has plenty of windows to enjoy looking at the pool and peaceful back yard, a granite kitchen, separate over-sized laundry room, and an oversized 28 ft. garage with plenty of storage. The private guest wing has the 2nd large bedroom, bath, and the extra large family room with access to pool area can be closed off for privacy and is perfect for a parent. The master suite has a sitting area and executive bath with dual sinks, a walk-in shower and garden tub. Other highlights are central vacuum system, intercom system, accordion style hurricane shutters, and beautiful curb appeal with landscape lighting. Ground maintenance and recreation center are included. Pool was resurfaced in 2015, pool heater replaced in 2016, A/C unit replaced in 2015, exterior paint 12/16. This beautiful home is A MUST SEE AND WON'T LAST LONG!

The business-to-business marketplace on Amazon.com expands its
      customer base across healthcare, education, government and commercial
      organizations


Amazon Business now offers business-only pricing on millions of
      products and access to more than 85,000 business sellers


SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jul. 25, 2017--
      (NASDAQ: AMZN) –Amazon Business today announced that it now has
      more than one million business customers since launching in April of
      2015, offering business-only pricing on millions of products and access
      to more than 85,000 business sellers. Amazon Business serves businesses
      of all sizes and across industries, including hospitals, educational
      institutions, labs, daycares, government agencies, restaurants, Fortune
      50 companies and sole proprietors. Amazon Business customers include Con
      Edison of NY, Gwinnett County Public Schools, Intermountain Healthcare,
      Johns Hopkins University, King County, Mayo Clinic, Siemens in the USA,
      and Stanford University, among others.
    

      “We are grateful to our customers for helping us reach this significant
      milestone,” said Prentis Wilson, Vice President of Amazon Business.
      “Their feedback has been invaluable in helping us better serve
      businesses and organizations of various sizes – from local government
      agencies to global enterprises, we are constantly looking for ways to
      innovate on behalf of customers, and will continue to build out features
      that delight them. We are striving to set a new standard for B2B
      e-commerce with Amazon Business, and it’s still day one for us.”
    

      “The transition to Amazon Business was a breeze,” said Danielle Hinz,
      Chief Procurement Officer, King County. “Setting up our users was simple
      and didn’t require any staff training. In addition, Amazon Business has
      helped us realize county-wide cost savings, such as providing access to
      business-only pricing with Quantity Discounts. We are also able to track
      purchases easily by department and user – we appreciate and value that
      transparency in our organization.”
    

      “Amazon Business is taking a lot of weight off of our shoulders,” said
      Drake Paben, Director of IT Procurement, Siemens Corporation (U.S.).
      “Depending on the type of business, our teams may need tools delivered
      in a matter of hours, large amounts of office supplies, or big pieces of
      machinery for our factories. With Amazon Business, we’re able to
      automate a lot of orders and give our employees, divisions and factories
      the products they need to complete their jobs in a timely manner. They
      can find products easily on Amazon Business, and get them delivered in a
      very short amount of time. We are looking forward to expanding our
      procurement capabilities with Amazon Business.”
    

      Stanford’s Chief Procurement Officer, Ben Moreno, has been leading a
      transformative initiative to reduce the University’s administrative
      burden while updating the procurement experience to consumer-like
      expectations. A decentralized structure, and the vast number of
      commodities purchased within a University environment, makes traditional
      procurement difficult to manage and lends itself to the more
      consumer-oriented buying experience of an open marketplace. To provide
      its campus consumers an open marketplace with increased visibility and
      seamless purchasing, Stanford University’s Procurement department
      selected Amazon Business.
