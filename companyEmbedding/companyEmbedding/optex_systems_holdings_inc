                                                                                                                                                                                 Optex Systems Holdings Inc.   Company website: www.optexsys.com   Optex Systems Holdings, Inc., (OTCQB:OPXS) through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Optex Systems, Inc is a well positioned defense company with an established history in the industry, a strong customer base and a backlog of contracts moving forward.  Optex Systems, Inc. was founded in 1987 as an ISO 9001:2000.  In February 2009, the Optex ISO status changed to 9001:2008 certified concern, which manufactures optical sighting systems and assemblies primarily for Department of Defense (DOD) applications.    December 16, 2013, Optex issued the first Patent covering its Digital Day and Night Elbow Technology - See DDAN Datasheet 	       Market Opportunity - U.S. Military Optex products are currently marketed in the military and related government markets. Since 1998, American military spending has increased over 225% on an annual basis to over $600 billion per year. As the American presence overseas continues, this level of spending should continue to exist. Also, the market for replacement parts for existing military equipment is significant. Optex meets the U.S. military requirements with its product line:  Reliabilty - failure can cost lives 	Cost effectiveness 	Ability to deliver on schedule 	Armed forces need to see to perform 	Mission critical products 	      Market Opportunity - Commercial/Retail Optex products are currently sold exclusively to military and related government markets. We believe we have significant potential retail opportunities to commercialize various products we presently manufacture. Our initial focus will be directed in three product areas.  Big Eye Binoculars - While the military application we produce is based on mature military designs, Optex owns all castings, tooling and glass technology. These large fixed mount binoculars could be sold to Cruise Ships, Personal Yachts and Cities/Municipalities. Night Vision Goggles - Optex presently manufactures the Optical System for the NL-61 Night Vision Goggles for the Ministry of Defense of Israel. This technology is based on the IR Squared design and could be implemented for retail commercial applications. Infrared Imaging Equipment - Optex manufactures and assembles Infrared Imaging Equipment for Textron and components for Raytheon's Thermal Imaging M36 Mount product. This equipment and technology has potential to be assembled for border patrol, police and security agencies.    Products Optex products are installed on a majority of types of U.S. military land vehicles, such as the Abrams and Bradley fighting vehicles, Light Armored and Advanced Security Vehicles and have been selected for installation on the Stryker family of 10 vehicles. Optex also manufactures and delivers numerous periscope configurations, rifle and surveillance sights and night vision optical assemblies. Optex delivers its products both directly to the military services and to prime contractors.   Specific product line includes:  Electronic sighting systems Mechanical sighting systems Laser protected glass periscopes Laser protected plastic periscopes Non-laser protected plastic periscopes Howitzer sighting systems Ship binoculars Replacement optics (e.g. filters, mirrors)   Customer Base Optex serves customers in three primary categories:  1.  Prime contractor for TACOM, U.S. Army, Navy and the Marine Corps. 2.  Subcontractor for BAE (LSE: BA.L), General Dynamics (NYSE: GD), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) and Raytheon Company (NYSE: RTN). 3.  Supplier to foreign governments that include Israel, Australia, NAMSA and South America. As of September 2013, we derived approximately 89% of our gross business revenue from three customers: 47% from General Dynamics Land Systems Divisions, 30% from The U.S. Government (primarily DLA), and 12% from BAE Systems (with which we have approximately 75 discrete contracts for items that are utilized in vehicles, product lines and spare parts.)     • December 9, 2013 - Optex Systems, Inc.

Announces Second Quarter 2017 Financial HighlightsMarketwiredMay 17, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareRICHARDSON, TX--(Marketwired - May 17, 2017) -  Optex Systems Holdings, Inc. (OPXS), a leading manufacturer of precision optical sighting systems for domestic and worldwide military and commercial applications, announced financial highlights from its 2017 second quarter financial results.Backlog as of April 2, 2017, was $16.9 million as compared to a backlog of $12.0 million as of October 2, 2016, representing an increase of $4.9 million or 40.8%. During the six months ending April 2, 2017, Optex Systems booked $12.4 million in new orders, representing a 25.3% increase over the booked orders of $9.9 million in the prior year period ending March 27, 2016. Optex Systems, Inc. has experienced an increase in US government demand for laser protected periscopes in support of ongoing maintenance of US combat vehicles in addition to increased orders for foreign markets. Our total periscope contract awards for the six months ending April 2, 2017 totaled $6.1 million, a 41.9 % increase compared to the prior year period ending March 27, 2016. The Applied Optics Center booked new orders for the six month period of $5.3 million, an increase of 47.2% over the prior year first half orders with significant new commercial orders booked against a multi-year strategic supplier agreement for optical assemblies.Our consolidated revenue increased by $1.1 million or 17.5% during the six months ending April 2, 2017, as compared to the six months ending March 27, 2016. Increased revenue was realized across each of the operating segments with growth in both military and commercial customers' demands.The gross margin increased by $0.6 million, and 5.1% points to 20.4% from 15.3% during the six months ending April 2, 2017 as compared to the six months ending March 27, 2016. We experienced gross margin improvements across both operating segments during the current year and attribute the gross margin growth to higher revenue combined with cost efficiency improvements and changes in product mix between the respective periods. We expect the gross margin for both segments to continue to improve through the second half of the fiscal year on higher revenue.Danny Schoening, CEO of the Optex Systems Holdings, Inc. commented, "We are cautiously optimistic that recent proposed boosts in military spending by the government administration will have a favorable impact in the direction of funding and additional product needs for the U.S. military. We continue to pursue new military and commercial opportunities both domestically and abroad for each of our operating segments while maintaining our current footprint with U.S. military vehicle manufactures. Optex remains focused on providing high quality optical products and pursuing cost efficiency improvements to remain competitively priced, provide savings to our customers and increase our bottom line profitably."Highlights of the unaudited Consolidated and Segment Results of Operations have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These financial highlights are excerpts which do not include all information and disclosures set forth in the consolidated financial statements and footnotes and do not present a balanced or complete picture of the Company's financial status, and should be read in conjunction with the Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended April 2, 2017 filed with the SEC on May 17, 2017.ABOUT OPTEX SYSTEMSOptex, which was founded in 1987, is a Richardson, Texas based ISO 9001:2008 certified concern, which manufactures optical sighting systems and assemblies, primarily for Department of Defense (DOD) applications.

During the six months ending April 2, 2017, Optex Systems booked $12.4 million in new orders, representing a 25.3% increase over the booked orders of $9.9 million in the prior year period ending March 27, 2016. Optex Systems, Inc. has experienced an increase in US government demand for laser protected periscopes in support of ongoing maintenance of US combat vehicles in addition to increased orders for foreign markets. Our total periscope contract awards for the six months ending April 2, 2017 totaled $6.1 million, a 41.9 % increase compared to the prior year period ending March 27, 2016. The Applied Optics Center booked new orders for the six month period of $5.3 million, an increase of 47.2% over the prior year first half orders with significant new commercial orders booked against a multi-year strategic supplier agreement for optical assemblies. 
Our consolidated revenue increased by $1.1 million or 17.5% during the six months ending April 2, 2017, as compared to the six months ending March 27, 2016. Increased revenue was realized across each of the operating segments with growth in both military and commercial customers' demands. 
The gross margin increased by $0.6 million, and 5.1% points to 20.4% from 15.3% during the six months ending April 2, 2017 as compared to the six months ending March 27, 2016. We experienced gross margin improvements across both operating segments during the current year and attribute the gross margin growth to higher revenue combined with cost efficiency improvements and changes in product mix between the respective periods. We expect the gross margin for both segments to continue to improve through the second half of the fiscal year on higher revenue.
Danny Schoening, CEO of the Optex Systems Holdings, Inc. commented, "We are cautiously optimistic that recent proposed boosts in military spending by the government administration will have a favorable impact in the direction of funding and additional product needs for the U.S. military. We continue to pursue new military and commercial opportunities both domestically and abroad for each of our operating segments while maintaining our current footprint with U.S. military vehicle manufactures. Optex remains focused on providing high quality optical products and pursuing cost efficiency improvements to remain competitively priced, provide savings to our customers and increase our bottom line profitably." 
Highlights of the unaudited Consolidated and Segment Results of Operations have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These financial highlights are excerpts which do not include all information and disclosures set forth in the consolidated financial statements and footnotes and do not present a balanced or complete picture of the Company's financial status, and should be read in conjunction with the Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended April 2, 2017 filed with the SEC on May 17, 2017.
