(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources  The Partnership does not engage in sales of goods or services. Its assets are  The Partnership's capital consists of the capital contributions of the partners as increased or decreased by net realized and/or unrealized gains or losses on trading and by expenses, interest income and redemptions of Units.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Partnership capital decreased 20.7% from $21,675,111 to $17,191,608. This decrease was attributable to redemptions of 236,896.223 limited partners Units totaling $2,734,471 and redemptions of 3,035.559 General Partner Units totaling $35,183, coupled with a net loss of $1,713,849. Future redemptions can impact the amount of funds available for investments in subsequent periods.  Critical Accounting Policies  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the General Partner to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting period. The General Partner believes that the estimates utilized in preparing the financial statements are reasonable. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Partnership's significant accounting policies are described in detail in Note 2, "Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," of the Financial Statements.  The Partnership records all investments at fair value in their financial statements, with changes in fair value reported as a component of net realized gains (losses) and net change in unrealized gains (losses) in the Statements of Income and Expenses. The General Partner estimates that, at any given time, approximately 20.7% to 43.2% of the Partnership's contracts are traded over-the-counter.  - 19 -  Table of Contents  Results of Operations  General: The Partnership's results depend on the Trading Advisor and the ability of the Trading Advisor's trading program to take advantage of price movements in the futures, forward and options markets.  The Trading Advisor trades the Partnership's assets in accordance with its Financial, Metal & Energy Large Portfolio, a proprietary, systematic trading program. The trading models utilized in the Trading Advisor's trading program are designed to detect and exploit medium-term to long-term price changes, while also applying risk management and portfolio management principles.  The Trading Advisor believes that utilizing multiple trading models provides an important level of diversification, and is most beneficial when multiple contracts of each market are traded. Every trading model may not trade every market. It is possible that one trading model may signal a long position while another trading model signals a short position in the same market. It is the Trading Advisor's intention to offset those signals to reduce unnecessary trading, but if the signals are not simultaneous, both trades will be taken and since it is unlikely that both positions would prove profitable, in retrospect, one or both trades will appear to have been unnecessary. It is the Trading Advisor's policy to follow trades signaled by each trading model independently of the other models.  The following presents a summary of the Partnership's operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and a general discussion of its trading activities during each period. It is important to note, however, that the Trading Advisor trades in various markets at different times and that prior activity in a particular market does not mean that such market will be actively traded by the Trading Advisor or will be profitable in the future. Consequently, the results of operations of the Partnership are difficult to discuss other than in the context of the Trading Advisor's trading activities on behalf of the Partnership during the period in question. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.  The Partnership's results of operations set forth in the financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require the use of certain accounting policies that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements, including the following: the contracts the Partnership trades are accounted for on a trade-date basis and marked to market on a daily basis. The difference between their original contract value and market value is recorded in the Statements of Income and Expenses as "Net change in unrealized gains (losses) on open contracts" and recorded as "Net realized gains (losses) on closed contracts" when open positions are closed out. The sum of these amounts constitutes the Partnership's trading results. The market value of a futures contract is the settlement price on the exchange on which that futures contract is traded on a particular day. The value of a foreign currency forward contract is based on the spot rate as of approximately 3:00 P.M. (E.T.), the close of the business day. Interest income, as well as management fees, incentive fees, General Partner fees and ongoing placement agent fees of the Partnership are recorded on an accrual basis.  The General Partner believes that, based on the nature of the operations of the Partnership, no assumptions relating to the application of critical accounting policies other than those presently used could reasonably affect reported amounts.  - 20 -  Table of Contents  During the Partnership's third quarter of 2016, the net asset value per Unit decreased 4.6% from $11.59 to $11.06 as compared to an increase of 3.1% during the third quarter of 2015. The Partnership experienced a net trading loss before fees and expenses in the third quarter of 2016 of $582,123. Losses were primarily attributable to the Partnership's trading in commodity, currencies and interest rates sectors, and were partially offset by gains in the equity sector. The Partnership experienced a net trading gain before fees and expenses in the third quarter of 2015 of $1,026,391. Gains were primarily attributable to the Partnership's trading in commodity and currencies sectors and were partially offset by losses in the equity and interest rates sectors.  The most significant losses were incurred within the global interest rate sector during August from long positions in U.S. fixed income futures as prices declined as U.S. Federal Reserve ("Fed") Chair Janet Yellen's hawkish comments on U.S. monetary policy bolstered speculation that the central bank could raise interest rates in the coming months. Additional losses in this sector were recorded from long global fixed income futures positions as uncertainty and nervousness over central bank interest rate decisions drove prices lower during the first half of September. In the currency sector, losses were recorded during the third quarter from short positions in the euro versus the U.S. dollar as the relative value of the euro rebounded after concern regarding the U.K. referendum vote to leave the E.U. subsided and the relative value of the dollar decreased during late September following the Fed meeting decision not to tighten monetary policy. Within the energy complex, losses were incurred during August and September from short positions in crude oil and its related products as prices increased after reports surfaced and were confirmed that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ("OPEC") would curtail oil production. Losses within the metals complex were experienced primarily during August from long positions in precious metals futures as prices moved lower due to weakening investor demand. The Partnership's losses for the quarter were partially offset by gains achieved within the global stock index sector during July as prices rose after investors looked past geopolitical concerns and focused on better-than-expected economic fundamental data. Within the agricultural markets, gains were experienced during August from short positions in wheat and corn futures as prices moved lower as positive weather conditions in the world's grain growing regions added to a global supply glut. Additional gains were achieved in the agriculturals during September from long positions in sugar futures as prices moved higher due to unfavorable growing conditions threatening crop yields in Brazil and India, the world's largest sugar cane growers.  - 21 -  Table of Contents  During the Partnership's nine months ended September 30, 2016, the net asset value per Unit decreased 8.4% from $12.08 to $11.06 as compared to a decrease of 4.4% during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The Partnership experienced a net trading loss before fees and expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $910,835. Losses were primarily attributable to the Partnership's trading in commodity, equity and currencies sectors, and were partially offset by gains in the interest rates sector. The Partnership experienced a net trading gain before fees and expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 of $1,077. Gains were primarily attributable to the Partnership's trading in equity and currencies sectors and were partially offset by losses in the commodity and interest rates sectors.  The most significant losses were incurred within the energy complex during March and May from short positions in crude oil and its related products as prices rallied as U.S. crude production continued to decline. Additional losses in this complex were experienced during April and June from short positions in natural gas futures as prices increased after warmer-than-expected weather in the U.S. spurred speculation of a tightening market. Further losses in the energies were incurred during August and September from short positions crude oil and its related products. In the currency sector, losses were recorded during February from short positions in the Canadian dollar, New Zealand dollar, and Japanese yen as the relative value of the U.S. dollar weakened amid concern of growing vulnerability of the U.S. economy. During April, losses in currencies were recorded from short positions in the British pound versus the U.S. dollar after the pound strengthened as fears the United Kingdom might vote to exit the E.U. began to prematurely subside. During May, losses were incurred from short U.S. dollar positions against a variety of currencies after the dollar steadily strengthened. During June, losses were recorded in the currency markets from positioning in the euro due to choppy price action leading up to and after the decision of the U.K. to leave the E.U. During August losses in this sector were experienced from short positions in the euro versus the U.S. dollar. Within the metals complex, losses were incurred during January and February from short precious metals positions as prices increased as uncertainty in Chinese financial markets, plunging oil prices, and signs of softening U.S. economic growth all bolstered the safe haven appeal of the metals. Additional losses in this sector were recorded during February and March from short base metals futures positions as prices rose due to a decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar and optimism that demand would improve after the Chinese government signaled increased support for economic stimulus. Further losses within the metals were incurred during May and August from long positions in precious metals futures positions as prices declined. Within the global stock indices, losses were experienced during January from long positions amid a steep sell-off in equities as global growth concerns persisted to start the New Year. During April, further losses were incurred from short global equity index futures positions as prices moved higher as commodity prices bounced and global central banks continued to provide an accommodative backdrop for stocks. Additional losses in this sector were recorded during June from global equity index futures positions as priced moved lower and September as prices fluctuated amid speculation surrounding global central bank activity and its consequential effects on the marketplace. In the agricultural markets, losses were recorded during January from short corn futures positions as prices rose after a strong U.S. export sales report and adverse weather conditions in Brazil. Additional losses in this sector were incurred during March from short wheat and soybean futures positions. Further losses in these markets were incurred during the first half of the April from long sugar futures positions, and during May from long futures positions in cocoa. The Partnership's losses for the first nine months of the year were partially offset by gains achieved within the global interest rates sector during January and February primarily from long European bond futures positions as prices increased following dovish comments released by the European Central Bank and a flight-to-quality due to global growth concerns. Further gains from long European bond futures positions were recorded during May. In June, additional gains were achieved within this sector from long positions in European and U.S. fixed income futures as prices advanced as uncertainty surrounding the economic and political fallout following the U.K.'s vote to leave the E.U. increased demand for the relative "safety" of government debt.  - 22 -  Table of Contents  Nov 10, 2016  (c) 1995-2016 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  As of June 30, 2015, the percentage of assets allocated to each market sector was approximately as follows: Interest Rate 7.10%; Currency 45.29%; Equity 14.87%; and Commodity 32.74%.  Liquidity. The Partnership deposits its assets with MS&Co. as its clearing commodity broker in separate futures, forward and options trading accounts established for the Trading Advisor. Such assets are used as margin to engage in trading and may be used as margin solely for the Partnership's trading. The assets are held either in non-interest bearing bank accounts or in securities and instruments permitted by the CFTC for investment of customer segregated or secured funds. Since the Partnership's sole purpose is to trade in futures, forwards, options and U.S. Treasury bills, it is expected that the Partnership will continue to own such liquid assets for margin purposes.  The Partnership's investment in futures, forwards, options and U.S. Treasury bills may, from time to time, be illiquid. Most U.S. futures exchanges limit fluctuations in prices during a single day by regulations referred to as "daily price fluctuation limits" or "daily limits." Trades may not be executed at prices beyond the daily limit. If the price for a particular futures or options contract has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit, positions in that futures or options contract can neither be taken nor liquidated unless traders are willing to effect trades at or within the limit. Futures prices have occasionally moved the daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no trading. These market conditions could prevent the Partnership from promptly liquidating its futures or options contracts and result in restrictions on redemptions.  There is no limitation on daily price movements in trading forward contracts on foreign currencies. The markets for some world currencies have low trading volume and are illiquid, which may prevent the Partnership from trading in potentially profitable markets or prevent the Partnership from promptly liquidating unfavorable positions in such markets, subjecting it to substantial losses. Either of these market conditions could result in restrictions on redemptions. For the periods covered by this report, illiquidity has not materially affected the Partnership's assets.  There are no known material trends, demands, commitments, events, or uncertainties at the present time that are reasonably likely to result in the Partnership's liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way.  As of June 30, 2015, approximately 54.71% of the Partnership's total investment exposure is futures contracts which are exchange-traded while approximately 45.29% is forward contracts which are off-exchange traded.  Capital Resources. The Partnership does not have, nor does it expect to have, any capital assets. The Partnership's only assets are its equity in trading accounts, consisting of restricted and unrestricted cash, net unrealized income on open contracts and investment in U.S. Treasury bills, if applicable. Redemptions of Units in the future will affect the amount of funds available for investments in futures, forwards, options and U.S. Treasury bills in subsequent periods. It is not possible to estimate the amount, and therefore the impact, of future outflows of Units.  - 19 -  Table of Contents  There are no known material trends, favorable or unfavorable, that would affect, nor any expected material changes to, the Partnership's capital resource arrangements at the present time.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations. The Partnership does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, nor does it have contractual obligations or commercial commitments to make future payments, that would affect its liquidity or capital resources.  Results of Operations  General. The Partnership's results depend on the Trading Advisor and the ability of the Trading Advisor's trading program to take advantage of price movements in the futures, forward and options markets.  The Trading Advisor trades the Partnership's assets in accordance with its Financial, Metal & Energy Large Portfolio, a proprietary, systematic trading program. The trading models utilized in the Trading Advisor's trading program are designed to detect and exploit medium-term to long-term price changes, while also applying risk management and portfolio management principles.  The Trading Advisor believes that utilizing multiple trading models provides an important level of diversification, and is most beneficial when multiple contracts of each market are traded. Every trading model may not trade every market. It is possible that one trading model may signal a long position while another trading model signals a short position in the same market. It is the Trading Advisor's intention to offset those signals to reduce unnecessary trading, but if the signals are not simultaneous, both trades will be taken and since it is unlikely that both positions would prove profitable, in retrospect, one or both trades will appear to have been unnecessary. It is the Trading Advisor's policy to follow trades signaled by each trading model independently of the other models.  The following presents a summary of the Partnership's operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, and a general discussion of its trading activities during each period. It is important to note, however, that the Trading Advisor trades in various markets at different times and that prior activity in a particular market does not mean that such market will be actively traded by the Trading Advisor or will be profitable in the future. Consequently, the results of operations of the Partnership are difficult to discuss other than in the context of the Trading Advisor's trading activities on behalf of the Partnership during the period in question. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.  The Partnership's results of operations set forth in the financial statements on pages 2 through 18 of this report are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require the use of certain accounting policies that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements, including the following: the contracts the Partnership trades are accounted for on a trade-date basis and marked to market on a daily basis. The difference between their original contract value and market value is recorded on the Statements of Income and Expenses as "Net change in unrealized trading profit (loss)" on open contracts, and recorded as "Net realized trading profit (loss)" when open positions are closed out. The sum of these amounts constitutes the Partnership's trading results. The market value of a futures contract is the settlement price on the exchange on which that futures contract is traded on a particular day. The value of a foreign currency forward contract is based on the spot rate as of approximately 3:00 P.M. (E.T.), the close of the business day. Interest income, as well as management fees, incentive fees, brokerage fees, administrative fees and ongoing placement agent fees of the Partnership are recorded on an accrual basis.  - 20 -  Table of Contents  The General Partner believes that, based on the nature of the operations of the Partnership, no assumptions relating to the application of critical accounting policies other than those presently used could reasonably affect reported amounts.  For the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2015  The Partnership recorded total trading results including interest income totaling $(3,650,891) and expenses totaling $362,834, resulting in a net loss of $(4,013,725) for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The Partnership's net asset value per Unit decreased from $13.84 at March 31, 2015 to $11.80 at June 30, 2015.  During the second quarter, the Partnership posted a loss in net asset value per Unit from trading losses in global interest rates, energies, agriculturals, global stock indices, currencies, and metals. The most significant losses were achieved within global interest rate sector during April and May from long Australian government bond futures positions as prices decreased after the Reserve Bank of Australia released hawkish comments and better-than-expected economic data. Additional losses were experienced in this sector from long positions in U.S. and European fixed income futures as prices whipsawed amid uncertainty surrounding U.S. monetary policy and the Greek financial crisis. Within the energy complex, losses were recorded throughout the second quarter from long and short crude oil positions as prices fluctuated as the market assessed global demand and the value of the U.S. dollar. In the agricultural sector, losses were incurred during the second half of June from short corn and wheat futures positions as prices spiked due to crop concerns following heavy rainfall in the U.S. Midwest region. Within the global stock index sector, losses were recorded during June from long positions in U.S., European, and Asian index futures as prices decreased amid investor anxiety over Greece's debt obligations and China's slowing economy. Losses within the currency sector were experienced during April from short euro positions versus the U.S. dollar as the dollar moved lower after weaker U.S. economic data suggested that the U.S. Federal Reserve will hold off on an interest rate hike longer-than-expected. Additional losses were recorded in this sector during June from short positions in the euro and Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar as the value of the U.S. dollar weakened as the U.S. Federal Reserve continued to provide little insight on when or how quickly it plans to raise interest rates. Within the metals sector, losses were recorded primarily during May from long futures positions in zinc and copper as prices fell due to a strengthening U.S. dollar and additional signs of an economic slowdown in China.  The Partnership recorded total trading results including interest income totaling $(1,024,454) and expenses totaling $729,616, resulting in a net loss of $(1,754,070) for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The Partnership's net asset value per Unit decreased from $12.72 at December 31, 2014, to $11.80 at June 30, 2015.  During the first six months of the year, the Partnership posted a loss in net asset value per Unit as trading losses in energy, agriculturals, metals, and global interest rates more than offset trading gains in currencies and global stock indices. The most significant losses were recorded within the energy complex primarily during February, April, and June as oil prices fluctuated without consistent direction as the market assessed global demand and the value of the U.S. dollar. In the agricultural sector, losses were incurred during the second half of June from short com and wheat futures positions as prices spiked due to crop concerns following heavy rainfall in the U.S. Midwest region. Within the metals sector, losses were recorded as prices whipsawed from February through June as investors attempted to gauge global demand and the timing of an U.S. central bank interest rate hike. Within the global interest rate markets, losses were incurred primarily during February, April, May, and June from long positions in European and U.S. fixed income futures as prices declined as the probability the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates increased. A portion of the Partnership's losses during the first six months of the year was offset by gains experienced within the currency sector during January from short Canadian dollar and euro positions versus the U.S. dollar as the values of these two currencies decreased against the U.S. dollar after the Bank of Canada unexpectedly cut interest rates and the European Central Bank announced a larger-than-expected bond buying program. Additional gains were achieved from short euro positions versus the U.S. dollar during March and May. Within the global stock index sector, gains were recorded primarily during February from long positions in U.S., Japanese, Australian, European, and Canadian index futures as a bounce in oil prices alleviated some fears around a global growth slowdown. Additional gains were achieved in this sector during April from long positions in Asian equity index futures as prices rallied after Chinese regulators relaxed rules regarding mainland citizens investing in the Hong Kong stock market and continued loose monetary policies.  For the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2014  The Partnership recorded total trading results including interest income totaling $1,490,970 and expenses totaling $384,706, resulting in net income of $1,106,264 for the three months ended June 30, 2014. The Partnership's net asset value per Unit increased from $9.33 at March 31, 2014, to $9.73 at June 30, 2014.  During the second quarter, the Partnership posted a gain in net asset value per Unit from as trading profits in global interest rates, stock indices, and metals offset trading losses in currencies, energies and agriculturals. The most significant gains were experienced within the interest rate sector throughout the majority of the second quarter from long positions in European fixed income futures as prices advanced as German unemployment unexpectedly increased and euro-area lending contracted, boosting demand for the relative "safety" of government debt. Additional gains were recorded during May from long positions in U.S. Treasury futures as prices increased amid easing of investor concern that the U.S. Federal Reserve would raise borrowing costs. Within the global stock index sector, gains were achieved primarily during May and June from long European, Asian, and U.S. equity index futures positions as prices increased as global economic data met expectations, geopolitical risks eased, and investors speculated that central banks' monetary policies would remain accommodative in the near future. Within the metals markets, gains were recorded during April from long positions in nickel futures as prices moved higher due to Indonesia's ongoing export ban and concern geopolitical fallout in Ukraine would limit supplies from Russia. A portion of the Partnership's gains for the quarter was offset by losses recorded within the currencies sector, primarily during May and June, from both long and short euro positions versus the U.S. dollar as the value of the euro whipsawed after manufacturing and business confidence signaled uneven economic growth and amid speculation on further European Central Bank stimulus. Additional losses in this sector were recorded throughout the majority of the second quarter from short Japanese yen positions as the yen increased in value after investors sought the "safe-haven" currency following geopolitical unrest abroad. Within the energy complex, losses were recorded from futures positions in gasoil and oil refined products as prices whipsawed throughout the second quarter amid unexpected shifts in inventories and geopolitical concerns which changed supply and demand estimates. Within the agricultural markets, losses were recorded during May and June from long positions in the soybean complex as prices declined after favorable weather throughout much of the U.S. Midwest boosted soybean plantings to near record levels.  - 21 -  Table of Contents  The Partnership recorded total trading results including interest income totaling $(1,792,268) and expenses totaling $1,048,138, resulting in a net loss of $2,840,406 for the six months ended June 30, 2014. The Partnership's net asset value per Unit decreased from $10.54 at December 31, 2013, to $9.73 at June 30, 2014.  During the first six months of the year, the Partnership posted a loss in net asset value per Unit as trading losses in energies, currencies, global stock indices, metals, and agriculturals offset trading gains in the global interest rate sector. The most significant losses were recorded within the energy complex during January from short futures positions in crude oil and petroleum distillates as prices advanced following cold weather in the U.S., which boosted demand for heating fuel. Additional losses in this sector were recorded during March from long natural gas and heating oil futures positions as prices declined after mild weather in the U.S. led to a decrease in demand. In the second quarter, losses were recorded from long futures positions in gasoil and oil refined products as prices whipsawed amid unexpected shifts in inventories and geopolitical concern, which changed supply and demand estimates. Within the currency sector, losses were recorded throughout the majority of the first two quarters from short Japanese yen positions as the yen intermittently increased in value after investor sought the "safe-haven" currency following geopolitical unrest abroad. Additional losses in this sector were incurred throughout the first half of the year from positions in the euro and Swiss franc against the U.S. dollar amid speculation of changes in government central bank monetary policy. Within the global stock index markets, losses were recorded during January from long positions in U.S., European, and Asian equity index futures as prices declined following softer-than-expected economic data in the U.S. and China, along with political and economic headwinds facing emerging markets. Additional losses in this sector were incurred during March from long equity index futures positions as prices declined in the first half of the month amid unrest in Russian-Ukrainian relations and weak Chinese economic data. In the metals sector, losses were recorded during January through May from both long and short positions in copper futures as prices fluctuated on varying economic news from China, the world's largest user of the metal. Additional losses in the first half of the year were incurred from short precious metal futures positions as prices whipsawed following geopolitical concerns in Ukraine and the Middle East, which caused investor anxiety and sporadic demand for "safe-haven" assets. Within the agricultural sector, losses were experienced during May and June from long futures positions in the soybean complex as prices declined after favorable weather throughout much of the U.S. Midwest boosted soybean plantings to near record levels. Additional losses were incurred during February from short positions in sugar futures as prices advanced as adverse weather in Brazil negatively affected crops. The Partnership's losses during the first six months of the year were partially offset by gains experienced within the interest rate sector throughout the majority of the second quarter from long positions in European fixed income futures as prices advanced as German unemployment unexpectedly increased and euro-area lending contracted, boosting demand for the relative "safety" of government debt. Additional gains were recorded during May from long positions in U.S. Treasury futures as prices increased amid easing of investor concern that the U.S. Federal Reserve would raise borrowing costs. Further gains were experienced during January from long positions in European fixed income futures as prices increased as investors sought the relative "safety" of interest rate instruments amid growing uncertainties in emerging markets  - 22 -  Table of Contents  Aug 12, 2015  (c) 1995-2015 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.

MORGAN STANLEY SMITH BARNEY CHARTER CAMPBELL LP - 10-Q - 20060810 - NOTES_TO_FINANCIAL_STATEMENT





NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


June 30, 2006

(Unaudited)

The unaudited financial statements contained herein include, in
the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair
presentation of the results of operations and financial condition
of Morgan Stanley Charter Campbell L.P. (the ?Partnership?).  The
financial statements and condensed notes herein should be read in
conjunction with the Partnership?s December 31, 2005 Annual Report
on Form 10-K.  Certain prior year amounts relating to cash
balances were reclassified on the Statements of Financial
Condition and the related Statements of Cash Flows to conform to
2006 presentation.  Such reclassifications have no impact on the
Partnership?s reported net income (loss).


1.  Organization
Morgan Stanley Charter Campbell L.P. is a Delaware limited
partnership organized in 2002 to engage primarily in the
speculative trading of futures contracts, options on futures and
forward contracts, and forward contracts on physical commodities
and other commodity interests, including, but not limited to,
foreign currencies, financial instruments, metals, energy, and
agricultural products. The Partnership is one of the Morgan
Stanley Charter Series of funds, comprised of the Partnership,





MORGAN STANLEY CHARTER CAMPBELL L.P.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)



which effective as of May 1, 2006 is a closed-end limited
partnership, and three continuously-offered limited partnerships:

Morgan Stanley Charter Graham L.P., Morgan Stanley Charter
Millburn L.P., and Morgan Stanley Charter MSFCM L.P.


The Partnership?s general partner is Demeter Management
Corporation (?Demeter?).  The non-clearing commodity broker is
Morgan Stanley DW Inc. (?Morgan Stanley DW?).  The clearing
commodity brokers are Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated (?MS &
Co.?) and Morgan Stanley & Co. International Limited (?MSIL?).
Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. (?MSCG?) acts as the
counterparty on all options on foreign currency forward contracts
for the Partnership. Demeter, Morgan Stanley DW, MS & Co., MSIL,
and MSCG are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Morgan Stanley. Campbell
& Company, Inc. (?Campbell? or the ?Trading Advisor?) is the
trading advisor to the Partnership.


Effective May 1, 2006, Campbell is no longer accepting any
additional funds for management from the Partnership.  As a
result, effective May 1, 2006, Demeter no longer accepts any
subscriptions for units of limited partnership interest
(?Unit(s)?) in the Partnership or any exchanges from other Morgan
Stanley Charter Series of funds for Units of the Partnership.





MORGAN STANLEY CHARTER CAMPBELL L.P.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)



While no subscriptions or exchanges for Units of the Partnership
were accepted after the April 30th month-end closing, Demeter will
continue to operate the Partnership and Campbell will
continue to trade the Partnership?s assets in accordance with the
terms of the Management Agreement by and among the Partnership,
Demeter, and Campbell.  Limited partners of the Partnership
will continue to be able to redeem their Units of the Partnership
and exchange their Units of the Partnership for Units in other
Morgan Stanley Charter Series of funds at any month-end closing.


2.  Related Party Transactions
The Partnership?s cash is on deposit with Morgan Stanley DW, MS &
Co., and MSIL in futures, forwards, and options trading accounts
to meet margin requirements as needed.  Monthly, Morgan Stanley DW
pays the Partnership interest income equal to 100% of its average
daily funds held at Morgan Stanley DW at a rate equal to that
earned by Morgan Stanley DW on its U.S. Treasury bill investments.
In addition, Morgan Stanley DW pays the Partnership interest
received from MS & Co. and MSIL with respect to such Partnership?s
assets deposited as margin.  The Partnership pays brokerage fees
to Morgan Stanley DW.





MORGAN STANLEY CHARTER CAMPBELL L.P.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)



3.  Financial Instruments
The Partnership trades futures contracts, options on futures and
forward contracts, and forward contracts on physical commodities
and other commodity interests, including, but not limited to,
foreign currencies, financial instruments, metals, energy, and
agricultural products.  Futures and forwards represent contracts
for delayed delivery of an instrument at a specified date and
price.  Risk arises from changes in the value of these contracts
and the potential inability of counterparties to perform under the
terms of the contracts.  There are numerous factors which may
significantly influence the market value of these contracts,
including interest rate volatility.


The market value of exchange-traded contracts is based on the
settlement price quoted by the exchange on the day with respect
to which market value is being determined.  If an exchange-traded
contract could not have been liquidated on such day due to the
operation of daily limits or other rules of the exchange, the
settlement price shall be the settlement price on the first
subsequent day on which the contract could be liquidated.  The
market value of off-exchange-traded contracts is based on the
fair market value quoted by the counterparty.





MORGAN STANLEY CHARTER CAMPBELL L.P.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)



The Partnership?s contracts are accounted for on a trade-date
basis and marked to market on a daily basis.  The Partnership
accounts for its derivative investments in accordance with the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,
?Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities?
(?SFAS No. 133?).  SFAS No. 133 defines a derivative as a
financial instrument or other contract that has all three of the
following characteristics:


1)      One or more underlying notional amounts or payment
provisions;

2)      Requires no initial net investment or a smaller initial net
investment than would be required relative to changes in
market factors;

3)      Terms require or permit net settlement.


Generally, derivatives include futures, forward, swaps or options
contracts, and other financial instruments with similar
characteristics such as caps, floors, and collars.


The net unrealized gains (losses) on open contracts, reported as a
component of ?Equity in futures interests trading accounts? on the
Statements of Financial Condition, and their longest contract
maturities were as follows:

The Partnership has credit risk associated with counterparty non-
performance.  As of the date of the financial statements, the
credit risk associated with the instruments in which the
Partnership trades is limited to the amounts reflected in the
Partnership?s Statements of Financial Condition.


The Partnership also has credit risk because Morgan Stanley DW, MS
& Co., MSIL, and/or MSCG act as the futures commission merchants
or the counterparties, with respect to most of the Partnership?s
assets. Exchange-traded futures, forward, and futures-styled
options contracts are marked to market on a daily basis, with
variations in value settled on a daily basis.  Morgan Stanley DW,
MS & Co., and MSIL, each as a futures commission merchant for the
Partnership?s exchange-traded futures, forward, and futures-styled
options contracts, are required, pursuant to regulations of the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (?CFTC?), to segregate from
their own assets, and for the sole benefit of their commodity
customers, all funds held by them with respect to





MORGAN STANLEY CHARTER CAMPBELL L.P.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONCLUDED)



exchange-traded futures, forward, and futures-styled options
contracts, including an amount equal to the net unrealized gains
(losses) on all open futures, forward, and futures-styled options
contracts, which funds, in the aggregate, totaled $436,258,470 and
$396,667,080 at June 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively.
With respect to the Partnership?s off-exchange-traded forward
currency contracts, there are no daily exchange-required
settlements of variation in value, nor is there any requirement
that an amount equal to the net unrealized gains (losses) on open
forward contracts be segregated.  However, the Partnership is
required to meet margin requirements equal to the net unrealized
loss on open contracts in the Partnership accounts with the
counterparty, which is accomplished by daily maintenance of the
cash balance in a custody account held at Morgan Stanley DW for
the benefit of MS & Co.  With respect to those off-exchange-traded
forward currency contracts, the Partnership is at risk to the
ability of MS & Co., the sole counterparty on all such contracts,
to perform.  The Partnership has a netting agreement with MS & Co.
This agreement, which seeks to reduce both the Partnership?s and
MS & Co.?s exposure on off-exchange-traded forward currency
contracts, should materially decrease the Partnership?s credit
risk in the event of MS & Co.?s bankruptcy or insolvency.
