Rethinking the MBA
Business Education at a Crossroads
For decades, MBA graduates from top-tier schools set the standard for cutting-edge business knowledge and skills. Now the business world has changed, say the authors of Rethinking the MBA -- Srikant M. Data, David A. Garvin, and Patrick G. Cullen -- and MBA programs must change with it. Increasingly, managers and recruiters are questioning conventional business education.

Rethinking the MBA: Business Education at a Crossroads
Srikant M. Datar, David A. Garvin and Patrick Cullen
"Business Schools Face Test of Faith." "Is It Time to Retrain B-Schools?" As these headlines make clear, business education is at a major crossroads. For decades, MBA graduates from top-tier schools set the standard for cutting-edge business knowledge and skills. Now the business world has changed, say the authors of Rethinking the MBA. and MBA programs must change with it. Increasingly, managers and recruiters are questioning conventional business education. Their concerns? Among other things, MBA programs aren't giving students the heightened cultural awareness and global perspectives they need. Newly minted MBAs lack essential leadership skills. Creative and critical thinking demand far more attention. In this compelling and authoritative new book, the authors document a rising chorus of concerns about business schools gleaned from extensive interviews with deans and executives as well as from a detailed analysis of current curricula and emerging trends in graduate business education; provide case studies showing how leading MBA programs have begun reinventing themselves for the better; and offer concrete ideas for how business schools can surmount the challenges that come with reinvention, including securing faculty with new skills and experimenting with new pedagogies. Rich with examples and thoroughly researched, Rethinking the MBA reveals why and how business schools must define a better pathway for the future.

Testing Strategy with Multiple Performance Measures: Evidence from a Balanced Scorecard at Store24
Dennis Campbell, Srikant M. Datar, Susan L. Kulp and V.G. Narayanan
We analyze balanced scorecard data from a convenience store chain, Store24, during the implementation of an innovative, but ultimately unsuccessful, strategy. Quarterly strategic reviews, based in part on the firm's balanced scorecard, led executives at Store24 to identify problems with, and eventually abandon, this strategy over a two-year period. We find that formal statistical tests of the hypotheses underlying the firm's balanced scorecard and strategy map reveal problems with the strategy on a timelier basis. We also test alternative hypotheses to those underlying the firm's formal strategy map and scorecard that are consistent with concerns expressed by some of Store24's top executives during the initial stages of implementing the new strategy. Our analysis demonstrates that this firm's balanced scorecard contained useful and timely information for distinguishing between these alternatives. These results provide some of the first field-based evidence on the potential for a firm's balanced scorecard to provide useful information for detecting problems in its strategy.

Leadership Effort in Professional Radiology Associations
Srikant M. Datar, John Tan and Sanjay Saini
Professional associations advocate for their members' interests; provide forums for education, training, and certification; and support domain-specific research and development efforts. The purpose of this study was to determine the amount of resources devoted to the leadership committees of professional radiology associations in the United States. Internet research was conducted to identify general, subspecialty, and special interest radiology associations, followed by a survey that focused on the number of committees and the average number of members per committee for each association. Established or published benchmarks were used to calculate committee-related annual expenditures from the survey data. Two hundred forty full-time equivalents, or nearly $100 million, are devoted to leadership activities within radiology associations each year. This is equivalent to approximately 1% of the professional income in radiology. These resources have enabled individual radiologists and societies to cooperate on important initiatives. More research should be conducted on other specialties or industries to provide comparable data on the optimal investment in the leadership effort.

Organizational Design and Control across Multiple Markets: The Case of Franchising in the Convenience Store Industry
Dennis Campbell, Srikant M. Datar and Tatiana Sandino
Many companies operate units that are dispersed across different types of markets, and thus serve significantly diverging customer bases. Such market-type dispersion is likely to compromise the headquarter's ability to control its local managers' behavior and satisfy the divergent needs of different types of customers. In this paper we find evidence that market-type dispersion is an important determinant of delegation and the provision of incentives. Using a sample of convenience store chains, we show that market-type dispersion is related to the degree of franchising at the chain level as well as the probability of franchising a given store within a chain. Our results are robust to alternative definitions of market-type dispersion and to other determinants of franchising such as the stores' geographic distance from headquarters and geographic dispersion. Additional analyses also suggest that chains that do not franchise at all may cope with market-type dispersion by decentralizing operations from headquarters to their stores, and, to a weaker extent, by providing higher variable pay to their store managers.

In Microfinance, Clients Must Come First
Srikant M. Datar, Marc J. Epstein and Kristi Yuthas
In the debate over whether microfinance works, few microfinance institutions articulate what, exactly, their ultimate goals are and how, exactly, they will achieve them. The authors cut through the confusion by mapping a clear theory of change for microfinance. If the goal of microfinance is to alleviate poverty, they say, then MFIs should focus on helping their clients build successful enterprises, rather than on making more and bigger loans.

Design Thinking and Innovative Problem Solving
Srikant M. Datar and Caitlin N. Bowler
In 2012 we set out to answer two key questions. Can anyone, including MBAs and executives with superb analytical skills, learn to think more innovatively? If so, how might we go about developing these skills? Through close collaboration with individuals from major design thinking practices and innovation firms (e.g. IDEO, frog design, LUMA Institute), we have developed a semester long, cross-disciplinary, “doing” course that presents students with a conceptual framework for a human-centered innovation process and provides them tools for engaging in that process, as well as many opportunities to practice. After several years our conclusion is that these skills can be developed by anyone open and willing to practice and develop these critical skills. This chapter gives an overview of the course curriculum, complete with the conceptual framework, underlying principles, range of tools and examples of how these tools can be applied.

Revitalizing State Bank of India
Srikant M. Datar, N. M. Bhatta, Rishikesha T. Krishnan and Rachna Tahilyani
State Bank of India is India’s oldest and largest bank with the government of India as its majority shareholder. Arundhati Bhattacharya, a 35-year veteran of the bank, is appointed as its chairman in October 2013. Her appointment coincides with Moody’s downgrading the bank’s debt due to rising nonperforming assets. She embarks on a mission to improve the bank’s risk taking and management abilities, ensure uniform customer experience, and encourage greater collaboration among various verticals. Her efforts help the bank reduce its nonperforming assets and improve its profitability. However, Bhattacharya knows that these gains will be fleeting without the development of a trained workforce who can address 21st century industry problems with speed and creativity. This requires transforming SBI into a performance-oriented bank supported by a new career development and remuneration system. Bhattacharya wonders if attempting to change the culture of a 206-year-old mammoth organization is feasible or a mere pipe dream.

BMVSS: Changing Lives through Innovation One Jaipur Limb at a Time (Abridged)
Srikant Datar, Saloni Chaturvedi and Caitlin Bowler
Bhagwan Mahaveer Viklang Sahayata Samiti (BMVSS) is an Indian not-for-profit organization engaged in assisting differently-abled persons by providing them with the legendary low-cost prosthesis, the Jaipur Foot, and other mobility-assisting devices, free of cost. Known for its patient-centric culture, its focus on innovation, and for developing the $20 Stanford-Jaipur knee, BMVSS has assisted over a million people in its lifetime of 44 years. As the founder, Mr. D.R. Mehta, thinks about the financial sustainability of BMVSS, he must devise a strategy that will sustain its human impact well into the future.

Tech Mahindra and the Acquisition of Satyam Computers (A)
Srikant M. Datar, Anjali Raina and Namrata Arora
Set in 2008, the case details Tech Mahindra, an information technology (IT) company within the Mahindra Group, an Indian multi-industry company with a diverse stable of businesses including automotives, farm equipment, and financial services, and its decision to acquire controlling stake in Satyam Computer Services Ltd. (Satyam), a troubled Indian IT company managed since January 2009 by a six-member government-appointed caretaker board. Anand Mahindra, Chairman and Managing Director of the Mahindra Group, saw the acquisition of Satyam as a strategic opportunity to move to the next level of growth. The acquisition would allow the Group to diversify across verticals, customers, and geographies, market a wide range of services to Satyam's strong customer base, and capitalize on common support systems in order to reduce operating costs and secure operational synergies. His brief to Vineet Nayyar—the vice chairman and managing director of Tech Mahindra and the vice chairman of Satyam—and C.P Gurnani—the CEO of Mahindra Satyam—was based on a set of clear principles: rectify the issues related to corporate governance; ensure an environment of trust where ethical conduct was valued; manage reputation risks by meeting customers and demonstrating the Mahindra Group's commitment; and restore faith within customers through newfound business models of delivery and engagements. As Nayyar reflected on Anand Mahindra's words, he wondered what series of business decisions he would have to make in order to retain the good elements, throw out the bad pieces, regain trust, and trigger change within the newly anointed Mahindra Satyam.

Srikant M. Datar, David A. Garvin and James Weber
In the fall of 2006, the Yale School of Management launched a new core curriculum in its MBA program.

In the three years since it was founded, the Boston-based Internet strategy consulting firm, Extraprise, has changed its strategy three times. Jennifer Gabler, the CFO, considers what kinds of control systems she can put in place to ensure the company can continue to achieve operational excellence.

Novartis (A):  Being a Global Leader
Srikant M. Datar and Carin-Isabel Knoop
For the Novartis leaders, the decision to "use stretch budgets again next year" highlights the tension between candor and empowerment and command-and-control, between the new and the old, between high performance and business as usual, between Ciba and Sandoz. Management must decide what kind of company and culture they want to build.

Co-operative Bank, The
Robert S. Kaplan and Srikant M. Datar
A British bank with strong roots in the cooperative movement encounters declining profitability in an increasingly competitive and deregulated financial services industry. It attempts to grow by broadening its customer base and increasing the range of products and services offered. It turns to activity-based costing as part of its reengineering effort to learn more about the process and product costs and customer profitability, and contemplates what actions to take based on this new information.

This latest edition of Cost Accounting incorporates the latest research and most up-to-date thinking into all relevant chapters and 80% more MyAccountingLab coverage!

 Offer a solid presentation of the fundamentals: Hallmark Features.  
 Exceptionally strong emphasis on managerial uses of cost information. Clarity and understandability of the text. Excellent balance in integrating modern topics with traditional coverage. Emphasis on human behavior aspects. Extensive use of real-world examples. Ability to teach chapters in different sequences. Excellent quantity, quality, and range of assignment material.
Tailor the material to suit your course needs: Flexibility of Use. This text’s modular, flexible organization can be used to suit a number of different approaches to teaching and learning. 
 
NEW! Provide a greater emphasis on strategy. This edition deepens the text’s emphasis on strategy development and execution. Several chapters build on the strategy theme introduced in Chapter 1: 
 Chapter 13 has a greater discussion of strategy maps as a useful tool to implement the balanced scorecard and a simplified presentation of how income statements of companies can be analyzed from the strategic perspective of product differentiation or cost leadership. Strategy considerations in the design of activity-based costing systems are covered in Chapter 5.  The strategy of preparation of budgets is included in Chapter 6. The strategy involved in decision-making is covered in Chapters 11 and 12.
NEW! Take the concepts abroad: Increased Emphasis on Global Issues. This edition contains an increased emphasis on global issues in order to reflect today’s increasingly global business environment. For example: 
 Chapter 11 discusses the benefits and challenges that arise when outsourcing products/services outside the United States. Chapter 22 examines the importance of transfer pricing in minimizing the tax burden faced by multinational companies. Several new examples of management accounting applications in companies are drawn from international settings.
NEW! Present an increased focus on the service sector. In keeping with the shifts in the U.S. and world economy, this edition makes greater use of service sector examples:
 Chapter 2 discusses the concepts around the measurement of costs in a software development—rather than a manufacturing setting. Chapter 6 provides several examples of the use of budgets and targets in service companies. Several concepts in action boxes focus on the service sector such as activity-based costing at Charles Schwab (Chapter 5) and managing wireless data bottlenecks (Chapter 19).
NEW! Address the latest issues: New Cutting-Edge Topics. The rapid pace of change in today’s organizations is reflected throughout this edition. Examples of new topics include: 
 An introduction to foreign currency and forward contract issues in the context of outsourcing decisions. Added ideas based on Six Sigma to the discussion of quality. Rewritten chapters on strategy and the balanced scorecard, and simplified presentation connecting strategy development, strategy maps, balanced scorecard, and analysis of operating income. Discussion of current trends towards Beyond Budgeting and the use of rolling forecasts. A discussion on the link between traditional forms of cost allocation and the nascent movement in Europe towards Resource Consumption Accounting. A sharper focus on how companies are simplifying their costing systems with the presentation of value streams and lean accounting.
OTHER POINTS OF DISTINCTION
 
NEW! Introduce students to the material: Opening Vignettes. Each chapter opens with a vignette on a real company situation. The vignettes get students engaged in a business situation, or dilemma, illustrating why and how the concepts in the chapter are relevant in business. Examples include:
 Chapter 1 describes how Apple uses cost accounting information to make decisions relating to how they price the most popular songs on iTunes. Chapter 3 explains how the band U2 paid for their extensive new stage by lowering ticket prices. Chapter 7 describes how even the NBA was forced to cut costs after over half of the league’s franchises declared losses. Chapter 11 shows how JetBlue uses Twitter and email to help their customers make better pricing decisions. Chapter 12 discusses how Tata Motors designed a car for the Indian masses, priced at only $2,500. Chapter 14 shows how Best Buy boosts profits by analyzing its customers and their buying habits. Chapter 18 describes how Boeing incurred great losses as it reworked its much anticipated Dreamliner airplane.
 
Updated! See the real-world applications: Concepts in Action Boxes. Found in every chapter, these boxes cover real-world cost accounting issues across a variety of industries including automobile racing, defense contracting, entertainment, manufacturing, and retailing. New examples include:
 How Zipcar helps reduce business transportation costs Job costing at Cowboys Stadium The “Death Spiral” and the end of landline telephone service Transfer pricing dispute temporarily stops the flow of Fiji Water 
 NEW! Provide the information that matters: Streamlined Presentation. The authors continue to simplify and streamline the presentation of various topics in order to make it as easy as possible for a student to learn the concepts, tools, and frameworks introduced in different chapters. The following has been streamlined in this edition:
 Chapter 3—the discussion of target net income Chapter 5—the core issues in activity-based costing (ABC) Chapter 8, which now uses a single comprehensive example to illustrate the use of variance analysis in ABC systems Chapter 13, which now contains a much simpler presentation of the strategic analysis of operating income Chapter 15, which now uses a simpler, unified framework to discuss various cost-allocation methods Chapters 17 and 18—the material on standard costing has been moved to the appendix, allowing for smoother transitions through the sections in the body of the chapter

NEW! Address the latest issues: New Cutting-Edge Topics. The rapid pace of change in today’s organizations is reflected throughout this edition. Examples of new topics include: 
An introduction to foreign currency and forward contract issues in the context of outsourcing decisions.Added ideas based on Six Sigma to the discussion of quality.Rewritten chapters on strategy and the balanced scorecard, and simplified presentation connecting strategy development, strategy maps, balanced scorecard, and analysis of operating income.Discussion of current trends towards Beyond Budgeting and the use of rolling forecasts.A discussion on the link between traditional forms of cost allocation and the nascent movement in Europe towards Resource Consumption Accounting.A sharper focus on how companies are simplifying their costing systems with the presentation of value streams and lean accounting.
OTHER POINTS OF DISTINCTION
 
NEW! Introduce students to the material: Opening Vignettes. Each chapter opens with a vignette on a real company situation. The vignettes get students engaged in a business situation, or dilemma, illustrating why and how the concepts in the chapter are relevant in business. Examples include:
Chapter 1 describes how Apple uses cost accounting information to make decisions relating to how they price the most popular songs on iTunes. Chapter 3 explains how the band U2 paid for their extensive new stage by lowering ticket prices. Chapter 7 describes how even the NBA was forced to cut costs after over half of the league’s franchises declared losses. Chapter 11 shows how JetBlue uses Twitter and email to help their customers make better pricing decisions. Chapter 12 discusses how Tata Motors designed a car for the Indian masses, priced at only $2,500. Chapter 14 shows how Best Buy boosts profits by analyzing its customers and their buying habits. Chapter 18 describes how Boeing incurred great losses as it reworked its much anticipated Dreamliner airplane.
 
Updated! See the real-world applications: Concepts in Action Boxes. Found in every chapter, these boxes cover real-world cost accounting issues across a variety of industries including automobile racing, defense contracting, entertainment, manufacturing, and retailing. New examples include:
How Zipcar helps reduce business transportation costs Job costing at Cowboys Stadium The “Death Spiral” and the end of landline telephone service Transfer pricing dispute temporarily stops the flow of Fiji Water 
 NEW! Provide the information that matters: Streamlined Presentation. The authors continue to simplify and streamline the presentation of various topics in order to make it as easy as possible for a student to learn the concepts, tools, and frameworks introduced in different chapters. The following has been streamlined in this edition:
Chapter 3–the discussion of target net income Chapter 5–the core issues in activity-based costing (ABC) Chapter 8, which now uses a single comprehensive example to illustrate the use of variance analysis in ABC systems Chapter 13, which now contains a much simpler presentation of the strategic analysis of operating income Chapter 15, which now uses a simpler, unified framework to discuss various cost-allocation methods Chapters 17 and 18–the material on standard costing has been moved to the appendix, allowing for smoother transitions through the sections in the body of the chapter

New to This Edition
Use the most current information to prepare students for their field.

NEW cutting-edge topics that reflect changes occurring in the role of cost accounting in organizations are examined:Sustainability strategies and the methods companies use to implement sustainability with business goals are introduced and discussed.Ideas based on academic research have been added regarding the weights to be placed on performance measures in a balanced scorecard.Details have been added on the transfer pricing strategies used by multinational technology firms such as Apple and Google to minimize income taxes.Current trends in the regulation of executive compensation are discussed.The evolution of enterprise resource planning systems and newer simplified costing systems that practice lean accounting is described.The role of accounting concepts and systems in fostering and supporting innovation and entrepreneurial activities in firms is discussed.
Greater emphasis on sustainability as a critical managerial challenge of the coming decade:The authors highlight this concept in Chapter 1 and return to the theme in several subsequent chapters. Chapter 12 discusses the benefits to companies from measuring social and environmental performance and how such measures can be incorporated in a balanced scorecard.Chapter 23 provides several examples of companies that mandate disclosures and evaluate managers on environmental and social metrics. A variety of chapters, including Chapters 4, 10, and 15, contain vignettes that stress themes of energy independence, using cost analysis to reduce environmental footprints, and constructing “green” homes in a cost-effective manner.
Deeper consideration of global issues in many chapters:The special challenges of budgeting in multinational companies (Chapter 6)The challenges of evaluating the performance of divisions located in different countries (Chapter 23)The differences in the way process flows are accounted for under U.S. and international accounting rules, and the impact of these differences on companies’ margins and after-tax income (Chapter 17 opener)The importance of transfer pricing in minimizing the tax burden faced by multinational companies (Chapter 22)Additionally, several new examples of management accounting applications in companies are drawn from international settings.

Provide a solid presentation of accounting hallmarks with a great emphasis on strategy
.
Increased focus on merchandising and service sectors, with corresponding de-emphasis of traditional manufacturing settings:Chapter 10 illustrates linear cost functions in the context of payments for cloud computing services.Chapter 20 highlights inventory management in retail organizations and has a revised example based on a seller of sunglasses.Chapter 21 now incorporates a new running example that looks at capital budgeting in the context of a transportation company. Several Concepts in Action boxes focus on the merchandising and service sectors, including the use of activity-based costing to reduce the costs of health care delivery (Chapter 5), the structure of SGA costs at Nordstrom (Chapter 2), and an analysis of the operating income performance of Best Buy (Chapter 12).
NEW and revised opening vignettes in each chapter to illustrate the relevance of chapter concepts in real business situations:
Chapter 2 describes how Hostess Brands, the maker of Twinkies, was driven into liquidation by the relatively high proportion of fixed costs in its operations. Chapter 4 explains the importance of job costing for “green” homebuilders such as KB Home. Chapter 8 examines Tesla Motors’ understanding of fixed and variable overhead costs for planning and control purposes. Chapter 12 shows how Volkswagen’s Brazilian subsidiary used the balanced scorecard to guide its journey out of the global financial crisis.Chapter 15 shows the impact of two alternative methods of cost allocation considered by theU.S. government for charging customers for the costs of developing “Smart Grids” for power.Chapter 23 describes the historical misalignment between performance measurement and pay at AIG and the recent changes to the compensation plans for its executives.  
NEW and revised Concepts in Action Boxes in each chapter that cover real-world cost accounting issues across a variety of industries, including automobile racing, defense contracting, entertainment, manufacturing, and retailing. New examples include:Cost—Volume—Profit Analysis Makes Megabus a Mega-Success (Chapter 3)Flexible Budgets at Corning (Chapter 7)What Does It Cost AT&T to Send a Text Message (Chapter 10)Are Charitable Organizations Allocating Joint Costs in a Misleading Way? (Chapter 16)Avoiding Performance-Measurement Silos at Staples (Chapter 23)

Tailor the material to suit your needs.

A streamlined presentation designed to simplify and streamline the presentation of various topics, making it as easy as possible for students to learn concepts, tools, and frameworks:A major change in this edition is the reorganization of Chapters 12 and 13. Chapter 13 in the fourteenth edition, “Strategy, Balanced Scorecard, and Strategic Profitability Analysis,” has been moved to Chapter 12, and Chapter 12 in the fourteenth edition, “Pricing Decisions and Cost Management,” has been moved to Chapter 13. As a result of the switch, Chapter 13 is the first of four chapters on cost allocation. The purposes of allocation are introduced  in Chapter 13 and cost allocation for long-run product costing and pricing is discussed. Continuing the same example, Chapter 14 discusses cost allocation for customer costing. Chapter 15 builds on the Chapter 4 example to discuss cost-allocation for support departments. Chapter 16 discusses joint cost allocation.  As a result of the reorganization, we have also made major revisions in the structure and writing of each of these chapters as we discuss in detail in the next section.Other examples of more streamlined presentations can be found in:Chapter 2 on the discussion of fundamental cost concepts and the managerial framework for decision making.Chapter 6, which has a revised appendix that ties together the chapter example and the cash budget.Chapter 8, which has a comprehensive chart that lays out all of the variances described in Chapters 7 and 8.Chapter 9, which uses a single two-period example to illustrate the impact of various inventory costing methods and denominator level choices.
