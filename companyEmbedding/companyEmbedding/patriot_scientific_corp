Q: What is the role of Phoenix Digital Solutions?
A: Phoenix Digital Solutions, or PDS, is a joint venture that aggregates the ownership interests in the Moore Microprocessor PatentTM (MMP) Portfolio, facilitating the unified marketing and licensing of the patents. We are a 50% owner in PDS.
Q: Has the MMP Portfolio been tested through challenges at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office?
A: Yes, the MMP Portfolio has survived 17 re-examination challenges. No further challenges are pending at this time.
Q: Has the MMP Portfolio been successfully tested in litigation?
A: Yes. In litigation before the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, HTC was found to infringe multiple claims within our 5,809,336 patent. The ‘336 patent is one of several patents contained within the MMP Portfolio. Presently we have actions pending in the Northern District against multiple defendants alleging infringement of the ‘749, ‘890, and ‘336 patents. 
Q: What other operating activities is Patriot involved in?
A: At present our focus is the licensing of the MMP Portfolio. Our previous experience in developing intellectual property (IP) in the course of designing our own chips has been leveraged into the licensing program of today.

Patriot Scientific Corporation refers to itself an "Intellectual Property (IP) licensing company." Founded in 1992, it is a Delaware corporation based in Carlsbad, California and is one of the publicly traded companies started by inventor Elwood "Woody" Norris. Its stock currently trades over-the-counter under the ticker symbol "PTSC."
Patriot was never successful in selling any of the technology or products it developed itself, but realized in 2004 that the acquisition of Nanotronics Corporation from Helmut Falk (Sr.) made years earlier may have given it patent rights to fundamental microprocessor technology. Its income in the last few years has come from licensing fees and settlements of patent infringement claims. It became notable in the world of penny stocks by issuing two shareholder dividends to distribute licensing/settlement income.

History[edit]
Patriot Scientific Corporation was founded in 1992 by Woody Norris as the successor to Patriot Financial Corporation, a Colorado corporation, incorporated on June 10, 1987. In 1994, Patriot purchased the assets of nanoTronics, which included the basic architecture of Patriot's microprocessors as well as the patents that are today known as the MMP portfolio. The company further strengthened its intellectual property assets by acquiring networking and communication device manufacturer Metacomp, Inc. in 1997. Patriot entered into a joint venture agreement with Technology Properties Limited, Inc. (“TPL”) in 2005 to focus on monetizing the assets in the MMP portfolio. Around the same time, the company ceased its own research and development operations. The company moved its headquarters from San Diego, CA to Carlsbad, CA in 2006.
Microprocessor Products[edit]




IGNITE Ia and IIf microprocessors from the early 2000s


The IGNITE was Patriot's attempt to bring its own microprocessor design to market. Initially marketed as ShBoom Box and later as PSC 1000, the processor was finally renamed IGNITE in the early 2000s. Notably, the IGNITE architecture was not a register machine, but used a stack computation model, which is the foundation of programming languages like Java and Forth. Originally it was designed as a fast execution platform for Forth, but with the advent of Java in the mid-1990s Patriot shifted its focus to efficiently running Java bytecode.
MMP licensees[edit]
Patriot's licensing success is a result of a joint-venture formed in June, 2005, with the TPL Group. Alliacense, a TPL entity, manages the commercialization of this jointly owned "Moore Microprocessor patent portfolio (MMP)."

Its stock currently trades over-the-counter under the ticker symbol "PTSC."
Patriot was never successful in selling any of the technology or products it developed itself, but realized in 2004 that the acquisition of Nanotronics Corporation from Helmut Falk (Sr.) made years earlier may have given it patent rights to fundamental microprocessor technology. Its income in the last few years has come from licensing fees and settlements of patent infringement claims. It became notable in the world of penny stocks by issuing two shareholder dividends to distribute licensing/settlement income.

History[edit]
Patriot Scientific Corporation was founded in 1992 by Woody Norris as the successor to Patriot Financial Corporation, a Colorado corporation, incorporated on June 10, 1987. In 1994, Patriot purchased the assets of nanoTronics, which included the basic architecture of Patriot's microprocessors as well as the patents that are today known as the MMP portfolio. The company further strengthened its intellectual property assets by acquiring networking and communication device manufacturer Metacomp, Inc. in 1997. Patriot entered into a joint venture agreement with Technology Properties Limited, Inc. (“TPL”) in 2005 to focus on monetizing the assets in the MMP portfolio. Around the same time, the company ceased its own research and development operations. The company moved its headquarters from San Diego, CA to Carlsbad, CA in 2006.
Microprocessor Products[edit]




IGNITE Ia and IIf microprocessors from the early 2000s


The IGNITE was Patriot's attempt to bring its own microprocessor design to market. Initially marketed as ShBoom Box and later as PSC 1000, the processor was finally renamed IGNITE in the early 2000s. Notably, the IGNITE architecture was not a register machine, but used a stack computation model, which is the foundation of programming languages like Java and Forth. Originally it was designed as a fast execution platform for Forth, but with the advent of Java in the mid-1990s Patriot shifted its focus to efficiently running Java bytecode.
MMP licensees[edit]
Patriot's licensing success is a result of a joint-venture formed in June, 2005, with the TPL Group. Alliacense, a TPL entity, manages the commercialization of this jointly owned "Moore Microprocessor patent portfolio (MMP)."

PTSC,  Patriot Scientific Corp.,  Receives LOI for Smart Card Products from a Major Chinese Manufacturer


 SAN DIEGO--September 26, 2002--PTSC (Patriot Scientific Corp.) (OTCBB:PTSC) announced today it has entered into a letter of intent with a major Chinese manufacturer to integrate its IGNITE™ embedded microprocessor technology into a silicon solution for a smart card product. China's smart card industries have formed an "industrial chain" to accelerate the development and modernization of finance, telecom, transportation and other industries as reported by Card Forum International.  "The IGNITE processor has been evaluated as having an architecture with superior performance to address multiple market segment requirements imposed by the customer" stated Dr. Patrick Nunally, the PTSC Chief Technical Officer. He continued by stating, "IGNITE will address the current market needs as well as anticipated requirements associated with advanced cryptographic devices in future products."   In 2001, China issued a total of 320.2 million smart cards, among those were 253.3 million memory IC cards and 66.9 million CPU based cards with annual growth rate of 15-25% for the next five years as stated by Card Forum International. "Although the price competition will be intense, the demonstrable technical merits and performance advantages of the IGNITE technology will enable the application of the processor by embedded developers as well as the provision of a solution utilizing a complete SoC (System on Chip) design from PTSC" said Joey Maitra, the company's Vice President of Engineering and Programs. "Additionally, IGNITE has advantages over the competition in both the contact and contactless smart card market," continued Maitra.   "PTSC has differentiated its technology from the competitors and is fully prepared to address one of the most rapidly expanding markets within the semiconductor market," said Jeff Wallin, the company's CEO.   PTSC's IGNITE™ family of microprocessors enables manufacturers to differentiate their products, replace less efficient processing devices, add functionality and reduce cost. The IGNITE's unique dual stack architecture coupled with the lowest gate count and memory footprint in the industry, enables IGNITE to be the industry's price/performance leader. PTSC has successfully integrated the industry's smallest and most powerful RISC 32-bit microprocessor. It also has a full Java application environment. The speed, flexibility, efficiency and low cost of this technology package is what makes it the most attractive advanced microprocessor in the market.    About PTSC: Founded in 1987, PTSC is an Intellectual Property (IP); Integrated Circuit (IC) and systems level embedded engineering company. The Company sells the IGNITE™ processor in silicon both in the United States and abroad. Customers also come to PTSC for product integration and development using the IGNITE technology. For further information on PTSC, visit http://www.ptsc.com.    Safe Harbor statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: Statements in this news release looking forward in time involve risks and uncertainties, including the risks associated with the effect of changing economic conditions, trends in the products markets, variations in the company's cash flow, market acceptance risks, technical development risks, seasonality and other risk factors detailed in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings.
