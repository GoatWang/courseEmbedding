 ROBERT G. HARPER (Age 98)  Peacefully on Tuesday, January 6, 2015 of Chevy Chase, MD with his wife at his bedside. He was a member of the First Presbyterian Church of Winchester and then National Presbyterian Church. A retired attorney and U.S. Foreign Service Officer, Mr. Harper, the son of the late Rev. and Mrs. Lewis Feuilleteau Harper, Sr., was born in Herndon, Virginia; and later grew up in Berryville and Winchester. He was a graduate of Hampden Sydney College, University of Virginia School of Law and Harvard Business School's Advanced Management Program. First moving to Washington as a law clerk to the chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals, Mr. Harper joined the United States Naval Reserve as an officer following the outbreak of World War II. After the war, he served at U.S. embassies in Peru and Bolivia, among other Foreign Service assignments in Europe, Asia and Latin America. He eventually returned to Washington to work for the General Counsel of the Central Intelligence Agency and as a private lawyer. As a legal adviser on behalf of the White House, he traveled to Vietnam during the war to assist local officials with rule of law and governance matters in South Vietnam. He was preceded in death by his brothers Lewis Feuilleteau Harper, Jr. and Charles Edwin Harper, and is survived by his loving wife Jeannette, sons Robert G. Harper, IV (Kristen) and Charles E. Harper, and grandson Robert G. Harper, V. He was a member of National Presbyterian Church. Family will receive friends at PUMPHREY'S BETHESDA-CHEVY CHASE FUNERAL HOME, 7557 Wisconsin Ave, Bethesda, MD on Friday, January 9 from 3 to 5 p.m. Burial service will be held at Mount Hebron Cemetery, 305 East Boscawen Street, Winchester, VA on Saturday, January 10 at 12 noon.
