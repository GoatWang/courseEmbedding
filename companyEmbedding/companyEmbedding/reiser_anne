Hurricane Irene and associated floods of August 27-30, 2011, in New Jersey
Intense rainfall from Hurricane Irene during August 27–30, 2011, inundated streams throughout New Jersey resulting in peak streamflows exceeding the 100-year recurrence interval at many streamgages and causing heavy property and road damage. The rain event affected the entire State. Some notably affected areas were the Passaic and Hackensack...

Monitoring storm tide and flooding from Hurricane Sandy along the Atlantic coast of the United States, October 2012
The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) deployed a temporary monitoring network of water-level and barometric pressure sensors at 224 locations along the Atlantic coast from Virginia to Maine to continuously record the timing, areal extent, and magnitude of hurricane storm tide and coastal flooding generated by Hurricane Sandy. These records were...

Streamflow characteristics and trends in New Jersey, water years 1897-2003
Streamflow statistics were computed for 111 continuous-record streamflow-gaging stations with 20 or more years of continuous record and for 500 low-flow partial-record stations, including 66 gaging stations with less than 20 years of continuous record. Daily mean streamflow data from water year 1897 through water year 2001 were used for the...

Evaluation of Streamflow, Water Quality, and Permitted and Nonpermitted Loads and Yields in the Raritan River Basin, New Jersey, Water Years 1991-98
Seventeen water-quality constituents were analyzed in samples collected from 21 surface-water sampling sites in the Raritan River Basin during water years 1991-97. Loads were computed for seven constituents. Thirteen constituents have associated instream water-quality standards that are used as reference levels when evaluating the data. Nine of...

The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in cooperation with other Federal, State, and local agencies, operates and maintains a variety of surface-water data-collection networks throughout the State of New Jersey. The networks include streamflow-gaging stations, low-flow sites, crest-stage gages, tide gages, tidal creststage gages, and water-quality...

Use of Low-Flow Trend and Transfer-Function Models to Determine Relation of Low Flows to Regional Urbanization and Precipitation, Rahway River Basin, New Jersey, 1940-91
The Rahway River Basin in northern New Jersey has become heavily urbanized. The importance of the Rahway River as a water-supply source for the region led to an investigation of trends in the river's low-flow characteristics over time and their relation to regional urbanization and precipitation. Since 1950, low flows at a stream-gaging station...

Relation of pesticide concentrations to season, streamflow, and land use in seven New Jersey streams
The presence and variability of pesticides in seven New Jersey streams was documented by analyzing 146 samples collected from the streams from April 1996 through June 1998. The samples were analyzed for 85 pesticides, including 50 herbicides, 28 insecticides, and 7 degradation products, at method detection limits that ranged from 0.001 to 0.018...
