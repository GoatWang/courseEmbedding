Definitions:
The Price/Earnings Ratio is a stock’s current price divided by the company’s trailing 12-month earnings per share. The Price/Book Ratio is used to compare a stock's market value to its book value. It is calculated by dividing the current closing price of the stock by the latest quarter's book value per share. The P/E and P/B ratio of a fund is the weighted average of the price/earnings and price/book ratios of the underlying stocks in a fund’s portfolio. 
R-squared measures how a fund’s performance correlates with a benchmark index’s performance and shows what portion of it can be explained by the performance of the overall market/index. R-squared ranges from  0, meaning no correlation, to 1, meaning perfect correlation.
Beta is a measure of the volatility of a fund relative to its benchmark index. A beta greater (less) than 1 is more (less) volatile than the index.

Market Overview

U.S. equities continued to rally for the seventh straight quarter, with the S&P 500 returning 3.09%. Plunging oil prices and a more muddied political and economic outlook were not enough to derail market momentum, as the S&P hit a series of new record highs. In a well-telegraphed move, the Federal Reserve Bank hiked rates by another 25 basis points and laid out a plan for balance sheet normalization later this year, provided the economy improves as expected. The economic picture this quarter, though, was somewhat more mixed. The final estimate for first-quarter GDP growth was revised higher, driven by increased spending on health care, financial services and insurance, while the manufacturing index ticked up on new orders, and consumer confidence rose above expectations due to the solid job market and rising stock and home prices. Payroll and housing data reports, however, disappointed, and a tick-down in the unemployment rate was mostly due to a drop in the size of the labor force.
On the political front, controversy surrounding the White House and the ongoing Russia investigation continued to escalate, while Senate Republicans again delayed a vote on their controversial health care reform bill after failing to garner significant support. By the end of the quarter, volatility picked up in the U.S. equity market, as investors rotated out of growth and momentum stocks and back into cyclical and value plays.
 

Fund Performance
The Fund’s Investor shares returned 0.27% for the quarter, underperforming the S&P 500 Index return of 3.09%. Security selection was the largest driver of underperformance, particularly within the consumer discretionary and information technology sectors, as well as industrials and financials. This was slightly offset by a benefit from being underweight to energy, which was one of the worst performing sectors this quarter.

For both the Fund and the Index, Health Care was the best performing sector this quarter, lifted by positive trial data and increased merger and acquisition rumors, as well as speculation that an upcoming executive order on drug pricing could benefit pharmaceutical companies. The largest positive contributor to the Fund’s relative performance was diagnostic information services company Quest Diagnostics, which returned almost 14% for the quarter. Quest reported better-than-expected earnings for the twelfth straight quarter, with solid organic volume growth led by recovery in healthcare utilization. Quest's partnerships with hospitals are showing traction, boosting volumes to the highest level in two years. The company is well positioned to gain share from hospital-based labs in the long-term as it continues to sign new partnerships. Meanwhile, its retail business is also ramping up, with the company set to add more than a hundred new Safeway stores, which will eventually replace Quest’s existing patient service centers and should provide numerous cost-reduction opportunities. Medical equipment company Edwards Lifesciences was another top contributor from the Health Care sector, returning almost 26% for the quarter. Edwards rose to six-month highs after reporting better-than-expected results for the first quarter, driven by strong U.S. sales of transcatheter aortic heart valves, and lifting annual sales guidance.
Another top contributor to relative performance was truck engine manufacturer Cummins, which returned more than 8% for the quarter after reporting first-quarter earnings 26% higher than the first quarter last year, far surpassing expectations. Stronger industrial demand from construction and mining is offsetting weaker demand from truck production in North America, while international sales benefitted from growth in China and Europe. Cummins highlighted an initiative for automated transmissions that will be fully integrated into its engine production and is expected to deliver up to a 7% improvement in fuel economy.
Relative performance was also helped by the Fund not holding General Electric, which is not approved for investment by the Domini Funds due to its involvement with the weapons industry and nuclear power plants, and by having an underweight position in AT&T. Both companies declined more than 8% for the quarter. AT&T reported lower-than-expected first quarter results, driven by weaker consumer net additions for wireless services, but partially offset by stronger broadband results. The stock fell on news of AT&T’s planned acquisition with Time Warner, which would be its second large acquisition in three years. The acquisition would further increase net debt and weaken its credit metrics.
These positive contributions to the Fund’s relative performance were more than offset by a number of significant detractors. The two largest individual detractors this quarter were retailers Foot Locker and Ross Stores, which declined more than 33% and 12%, respectively. Shoe and apparel retailer Foot Locker, after having already lowered its previously issued guidance, reported first-quarter results that came in below diminished expectations. Despite the company’s long history of tight inventory control and spending discipline, it is facing a significant structural challenge due to having a large number of brick-and-mortar stores in a declining mall environment. Discount home and apparel retailer Ross Stores declined along with other retailers this quarter, despite bucking the retail trend by reporting stronger-than-expected results for the first quarter, driven by strong store traffic and average basket size.
The next largest detractors were in the Information Technology sector. Application services software company F5 Networks declined almost 11% for the quarter after reporting quarterly results that missed consensus estimates, driven by weakness in European sales and flat growth in services. F5 is facing short-term headwinds from delayed purchase decisions attributed to a transition from physical to virtual application-delivery controllers, customer hesitance in moving to the cloud, and political uncertainty in Europe. IBM also declined almost 11% after quarterly sales fell short of estimates. This marked its 20th consecutive quarter of revenue declines. IBM is similarly experiencing delays in service contracts and weakness in European markets, while its investments in high-growth areas have yet to generate sufficient sales to offset declines in legacy businesses.
Walgreens Boots Alliance, the holding company for Walgreens pharmacy, was another significant detractor, declining more than 5% for the quarter. Pharmacy stocks fell following a report that Amazon is considering entering the business of selling prescription drugs.

Making a Difference



Domini engages in direct dialogue with corporations in our portfolios and files shareholder proposals on a broad range of social, environmental, and corporate governance issues. Shareholder activism — the practice of active ownership — lies at the heart of what we believe responsible investing is all about. Here are a few ways your investment in the Domini Funds has made a difference. For more stories, click here.
 


A Season of Accountability
If you sit on the board of a publicly traded company, there is only one time of year when you must face your shareholders. For most companies, that time is at the spring annual meeting. Since the 1960’s, shareholders have raised key issues of concern at these meetings, from napalm production to racial discrimination to climate change. On behalf of our fund shareholders, we have submitted more than 250 shareholder proposals over the past 22 years, ensuring that your voice is heard.

Protecting Freedom of Expression and Privacy on the Internet
Internet and telecommunications companies receive thousands of requests per year from governments around the world to censor content or divulge information about their users. Many of these requests violate international human rights principles. For the past ten years, Domini has helped to build the Global Network Initiative (GNI), an organization focused on protecting freedom of expression and privacy from improper government intrusion.

Mandatory Sustainability Reporting
In April, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a historic Concept Release, seeking comments on a wide range of rules that require publicly traded companies to disclose information to their investors. We were very pleased to see the inclusion of a series of questions about sustainability information among the Release’s more than 300 pages.

Positive Change at Four Companies
In addition to using social, environmental and governance standards to select our investments, each year the Domini Social Equity Fund submits shareholder proposals to corporations in its portfolio, addressing a broad range of social and environmental issues.  They send a strong message to corporate management, and can often encourage the company to speak to us about reaching an agreement.

Our Position on Fossil Fuel Owners and Producers
For many years, Domini has incorporated concerns about the environmental risks of companies owning and producing fossil fuels into our investment standards. Over time, we have gradually eliminated an increasing number of these firms from our holdings as our concerns about a variety of environmental and safety issues, including climate change, have increased.

The Domini Funds are not insured and are subject to market risks, such as sector concentration and style risk. Investing internationally involves special risks, such as currency fluctuations, social and economic instability, differing securities regulations and accounting standards, limited public information, possible changes in taxation, and periods of illiquidity. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. You may lose money.
The Domini Impact Bond Fund is not insured and is subject to market risks, including interest rate and credit risks. During periods of rising interest rates, bond funds can lose value. The Domini Impact Bond Fund currently holds a large percentage of its portfolio in mortgage-backed securities. During periods of falling interest rates, mortgage-backed securities may prepay the principal due, which may lower the Fund’s return by causing it to reinvest at lower interest rates. Some of the Domini Impact Bond Fund's community development investments may be unrated and carry greater credit risks than its other investments.

Applicants' Representations
1. The Trust, a Massachusetts business trust, is registered under the Act as an open-end management investment company and currently offers three series of shares (each a “Series”), each with its own distinct investment objectives, policies and restrictions.[1] 
           The Adviser is, and any future Adviser will be, registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”). The Adviser serves as the investment adviser to each Series pursuant to an investment advisory agreement with the Trust (each an “Investment Advisory Agreement” and collectively, the “Investment Advisory Agreements”).[2] 
           Each Investment Advisory Agreement was approved or will be approved by the board of trustees of the Trust (the “Board”), including a majority of the trustees who are not “interested persons,” as defined in section 2(a)(19) of the Act, of the Trust, the Subadvised Fund, or the Adviser (“Independent Trustees”) and by the shareholders of the relevant Subadvised Fund in the manner required by sections 15(a) and 15(c) of the Act and rule 18f-2 under the Act.[3] 

2. Under the terms of each Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser, subject to the oversight of the Board, furnishes a continuous investment program for each Subadvised Fund. The Adviser periodically reviews investment policies and strategies of each Subadvised Fund and based on the need of a particular Subadvised Fund may recommend changes to the investment policies and strategies of the Subadvised Fund for consideration by its Board. For its services to each Subadvised Fund, the Adviser receives an investment advisory fee from that Subadvised Fund as specified in the applicable Investment Advisory Agreement based on that Subadvised Fund's average daily net assets. The terms of the Investment Advisory Agreements also permit the Adviser, subject to the approval of the relevant Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, and the shareholders of the applicable Subadvised Funds (if required by applicable law), to delegate portfolio management responsibilities of all or a portion of the assets of the Subadvised Fund to one or more subadvisers (“Subadvisers”). The Adviser has entered into subadvisory agreements (“Subadvisory Agreements”) with two Subadvisers to serve as Subadvisers to the Series.[4] 
           Each Subadviser is, and any future Subadviser will be, an investment adviser as defined in section 2(a)(20) of the Act as well as registered with the Commission as an “investment adviser” under the Advisers Act. The Adviser evaluates, allocates assets to and oversees the Subadvisers, and makes recommendations about their hiring, termination and replacement to the Board, at all times subject to the authority of the Board. The Adviser currently compensates each Subadviser out of the advisory fees paid to the Adviser under the relevant Investment Advisory Agreement; in the future, Subadvised Funds may directly pay advisory fees to the Subadvisers.
3. Applicants request an order to permit the Adviser, subject to Board approval, to select certain Subadvisers to manage all or a portion of the assets of a Subadvised Fund pursuant to a Sub-Advisory Agreement and materially amend Sub-Advisory Agreements without obtaining shareholder approval. The requested relief will not extend to any Subadviser that is an affiliated person, as defined in section 2(a)(3) of the Act, of the Trust or a Subadvised Fund or the Adviser, other than by reason of serving as a Subadviser to Subadvised Funds (“Affiliated Subadviser”).
4. Applicants also request an order exempting the Subadvised Funds from certain disclosure provisions described below that may require the Applicants to disclose fees paid to each Subadviser by the Adviser or a Subadvised Fund. Applicants seek an order to permit each Subadvised Fund to disclose (as a dollar amount and a percentage of each Subadvised Fund's net assets) only: (a) the aggregate fees paid to the Adviser and any Affiliated Subadvisers; and (b) the aggregate fees paid to Subadvisers other than Affiliated Subadvisers (collectively, the “Aggregate Fee Disclosure”). A Subadvised Fund that employs an Affiliated Subadviser will provide separate disclosure of any fees paid to the Affiliated Subadviser.
Applicants' Legal Analysis
1. Section 15(a) of the Act provides, in relevant part, that it is unlawful for any person to act as an investment adviser to a registered investment company except pursuant to a written contract that has been approved by the vote of a majority of the company's outstanding voting securities. Rule 18f-2 under the Act provides that each series or class of stock in a series  investment company affected by a matter must approve that matter if the Act requires shareholder approval.
2. Form N-1A is the registration statement used by open-end investment companies. Item 19(a)(3) of Form N-1A requires disclosure of the method and amount of the investment adviser's compensation.
3. Rule 20a-1 under the Act requires proxies solicited with respect to an investment company to comply with Schedule 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”). Items 22(c)(1)(ii), 22(c)(1)(iii), 22(c)(8) and 22(c)(9) of Schedule 14A, taken together, require a proxy statement for a shareholder meeting at which the advisory contract will be voted upon to include the “rate of compensation of the investment adviser,” the “aggregate amount of the investment adviser's fees,” a description of the “terms of the contract to be acted upon,” and, if a change in the advisory fee is proposed, the existing and proposed fees and the difference between the two fees.
4. Regulation S-X sets forth the requirements for financial statements required to be included as part of a registered investment company's registration statement and shareholder reports filed with the Commission. Sections 6-07(2)(a), (b) and (c) of Regulation S-X require a registered investment company to include in its financial statement information about the investment advisory fees.
5. Section 6(c) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt any person, security, or transaction or any class or classes of persons, securities, or transactions from any provisions of the Act, or from any rule thereunder, if such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Applicants state that the requested relief meets this standard for the reasons discussed below.
6. Applicants assert that the shareholders expect the Adviser, subject to the review and approval of the Board, to select the Subadvisers who are best suited to achieve the Subadvised Fund's investment objective. Applicants assert that, from the perspective of the shareholder, the role of the Subadviser is substantially equivalent to the role of the individual portfolio managers employed by an investment adviser to a traditional investment company. Applicants state that requiring shareholder approval of each Subadvisory Agreement would impose unnecessary delays and expenses on the Subadvised Funds and may preclude the Subadvised Funds from acting promptly when the Adviser and Board consider it appropriate to hire Subadvisers or amend Subadvisory Agreements. Applicants note that the Investment Advisory Agreements and any Subadvisory Agreement with an Affiliated Subadviser (if any) will continue to be subject to the shareholder approval requirements of section 15(a) of the Act and rule 18f-2 under the Act.
7. If new Subadvisers are hired, the Subadvised Funds will inform shareholders of the hiring of a new Subadviser pursuant to the following procedures (“Modified Notice and Access Procedures”): (a) Within 90 days after a new Subadviser is hired for any Subadvised Fund, that Subadvised Fund will send its shareholders either a Multi-manager Notice or a Multi-manager Notice and Multi-manager Information Statement; [5] 
           and (b) the Subadvised Fund will make the Multi-manager Information Statement available on the Web site identified in the Multi-manager Notice no later than when the Multi-manager Notice (or Multi-manager Notice and Multi-manager Information Statement) is first sent to shareholders, and will maintain it on that Web site for at least 90 days. In the circumstances described in this Application, a proxy solicitation to approve the appointment of new Subadvisers provides no more meaningful information to shareholders than the proposed Multi-manager Information Statement. Moreover, as indicated above, the applicable Board would comply with the requirements of Sections 15(a) and 15(c) of the 1940 Act before entering into or amending Sub-Advisory Agreements.
8. Applicants assert that the requested disclosure relief would benefit shareholders of the Subadvised Funds because it would improve the Adviser's ability to negotiate the fees paid to Subadvisers. Applicants state that the Adviser may be able to negotiate rates that are below a Subadviser's “posted” amounts if the Adviser is not required to disclose the Subadvisers' fees to the public. Applicants submit that the requested relief will also encourage Subadvisers to negotiate lower subadvisory fees with the Adviser if the lower fees are not required to be made public.
Applicants' Conditions
Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions:
1. Before a Subadvised Fund may rely on the order requested herein, the operation of the Subadvised Fund in the manner described in the Application will be approved by a majority of the Subadvised Fund's outstanding voting securities as defined in the Act or, in the case of a Subadvised Fund whose public shareholders purchase shares on the basis of a prospectus containing the disclosure contemplated by condition 2 below, by the initial shareholder before such Subadvised Fund's shares are offered to the public.
2. The prospectus for each Subadvised Fund will disclose the existence, substance, and effect of any order granted pursuant to the Application. In addition, each Subadvised Fund will hold itself out to the public as employing the Manager of Managers Structure. The prospectus will prominently disclose that the Adviser has the ultimate responsibility, subject to oversight by the Board, to oversee the Subadvisers and recommend their hiring, termination, and replacement.
3. Subadvised Funds will inform shareholders of the hiring of a new Subadviser within 90 days after the hiring of the new Subadviser pursuant to the Modified Notice and Access Procedures.
4. The Adviser will not enter into a Subadvisory Agreement with any Affiliated Subadviser without that agreement, including the compensation to be paid thereunder, being approved by the shareholders of the applicable Subadvised Fund.
5. At all times, at least a majority of the Board will be Independent Trustees, and the nomination of new or additional Independent Trustees will be placed within the discretion of the then-existing Independent Trustees.
6. Independent legal counsel, as defined in rule 0-1(a)(6) under the Act, will be engaged to represent the Independent Trustees. The selection of such counsel will be within the  discretion of the then-existing Independent Trustees.
7. Whenever a Subadviser change is proposed for a Subadvised Fund with an Affiliated Subadviser, the Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, will make a separate finding, reflected in the Board minutes, that the change is in the best interests of the Subadvised Fund and its shareholders, and does not involve a conflict of interest from which the Adviser or the Affiliated Subadviser derives an inappropriate advantage.
8. Whenever a Subadviser is hired or terminated, the Adviser will provide the Board with information showing the expected impact on the profitability of the Adviser.
9. Each Adviser will provide the Board, no less frequently than quarterly, with information about the profitability of the Adviser on a per Subadvised Fund basis. The information will reflect the impact on profitability of the hiring or termination of any Subadviser during the applicable quarter.
10. The Adviser will provide general management services to each Subadvised Fund, including overall supervisory responsibility for the general management and investment of the Subadvised Fund's assets and, subject to review and approval of the Board, will: (i) Set the Subadvised Fund's overall investment strategies; (ii) evaluate, select, and recommend Subadvisers to manage all or a portion of the Subadvised Fund's assets; (iii) allocate and, when appropriate, reallocate the Subadvised Fund's assets among Subadvisers; (iv) monitor and evaluate the Subadvisers' performance; and (v) implement procedures reasonably designed to ensure that Subadvisers comply with the Subadvised Fund's investment objective, policies and restrictions.
11. No Trustee or officer of the Trust or of a Subadvised Fund or director or officer of the Adviser, will own directly or indirectly (other than through a pooled investment vehicle that is not controlled by such person) any interest in a Subadviser except for (i) ownership of interests in the Adviser or any entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the Adviser; or (ii) ownership of less than 1% of the outstanding securities of any class of equity or debt of any publicly traded company that is either a Subadviser or an entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with a Subadviser.
12. Each Subadvised Fund will disclose in its registration statement the Aggregate Fee Disclosure.
13. In the event the Commission adopts a rule under the Act providing substantially similar relief to that in the order requested in the Application, the requested order will expire on the effective date of that rule.
14. For Subadvised Funds that pay fees to a Subadviser directly from fund assets, any changes to a Subadvisory Agreement that would result in an increase in the total management and advisory fees payable by a Subadvised Fund will be required to be approved by the shareholders of the Subadvised Fund.

 
For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority.
Kevin M. O'Neill,
Deputy Secretary.

1.
     Applicants also request relief with respect to any future series of the Trust and to any other existing or future registered open-end management investment company or series thereof that: (a) Is advised by the Adviser or any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Adviser or its successors (included in the term “Adviser”); (b) uses the manager of managers structure described in the application (“Manager of Managers Structure”); and (c) complies with the terms and conditions of this application (together with the current Series, each a “Subadvised Fund” and collectively, the “Subadvised Funds”). The only existing registered open-end management investment company that currently intends to rely on the requested order is named as an Applicant. Each Series that is or currently intends to be a Subadvised Fund, and each Subadviser (as defined below) that currently intends to rely on the requested order, is identified in this application. For purposes of the requested order, “successor” is limited to an entity that results from a reorganization into another jurisdiction or a change in the type of business organization. If the name of any Subadvised Fund contains the name of a Subadviser, the name of the Adviser that serves as the primary adviser to the Subadvised Fund will precede the name of the Subadviser.

     The Adviser has entered into Subadvisory Agreements with (i) Wellington Management Company LLP as a subadviser to manage the Domini Social Equity Fund and Domini International Social Equity Fund; and (ii) Seix Investment Advisors LLC as a subadviser to manage the Domini Social Bond Fund. Neither of the existing subadvisers is affiliated with the Adviser.

5.
     A “Multi-manager Notice” will be modeled on a Notice of Internet Availability as defined in rule 14a-16 under the Exchange Act, and specifically will, among other things: (a) Summarize the relevant information regarding the new Subadviser; (b) inform shareholders that the Multi-manager Information Statement is available on a Web site; (c) provide the Web site address; (d) state the time period during which the Multi-manager Information Statement will remain available on that Web site; (e) provide instructions for accessing and printing the Multi-manager Information Statement; and (f) instruct the shareholder that a paper or email copy of the Multi-manager Information Statement may be obtained, without charge, by contacting the Subadvised Funds. 
A “Multi-manager Information Statement” will meet the requirements of Regulation 14C, Schedule 14C and Item 22 of Schedule 14A under the Exchange Act for an information statement, except as modified by the requested order to permit Aggregate Fee Disclosure. Multi-manager Information Statements will be filed electronically with the Commission via the EDGAR system.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
