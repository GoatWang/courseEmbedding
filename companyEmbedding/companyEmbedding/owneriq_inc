What is Second-Party Data?



			Second-party data is about complete data transparency. You choose your data sets and know exactly the audience you’re reaching.
			

Second-party data is built specifically for sharing (i.e. combining) the first-party data of one partner with the first-party data of another relevant partner, achieving complete transparency on desktop and mobile. This data source has already gone mainstream within relationships between two entities with a symbiotic relationship, such as retailers and brands.
Beyond these instances, the adoption of the concept will depend on the particulars of the association between the parties at hand. Organizations with an adjacent relationship, organizations that share an agency, and organizations that share a platform are all common examples of other second-party data use cases.

Making Headlines















































































































 At BPN, our top objective is to provide our clients with strategic thinking and data-driven results to deliver effective integrated marketing campaigns. We believe in using the right partner to deliver the core consumer audience to achieve the brand's goals. ownerIQ’s second-party data platform had just what we were looking for when we sought out specialized audience data sets. For one client, ownerIQ’s premium auto data delivered an exceptionally impressive 85.69% video completion rate.
Alison Raynak
Media Planner, Borders Perrin Norrander






 Working with ownerIQ allows Cabela's to enable brands to reach shoppers with relevant, unobtrusive messaging. This helps us create the best possible experience for our shoppers by reaching them with products and services relevant to their interests.
Klint Andreas
Director of E-commerce Merchandising, Cabela's






 At Universal McCann, we’re result-driven at the core. We love that ownerIQ operates the same way. Our partnership allows us to seamlessly do what we do best: perform and drive meaningful results for our clients by using second-party data. An example of this is a top shipping and mailing services client recognized us a top performer for ROAS (return on ad spend) on the campaign, showing ownerIQ's ability to perform when it matters. I would recommend ownerIQ for other brand teams across the agency.
Lisa Cao
Manager, Integrated Investment






 In an industry where the phrase “data is king” is thrown around by everyone from thought leaders to entry level marketers, it does seem a bit ironic that the bulk of available targeting data is largely an unknown in composition and quality. At this moment in advertising, the quality of non-proprietary data is, simply put, bad and ineffective. In this sense, ownerIQ is a diamond in the rough. No matter what the client’s goal is, I know that the quality of their data will be a cornerstone of our strategy and a major contributor to providing results.
Sherveen Shingu
Senior Manager, Display Strategy, Point It






 Two non-competitive travel advertisers came to Xaxis looking to establish a controlled data sharing partnership. We quickly realized that there is a missing link needed to set up this type of a relationship. That link is a second-party data platform which gives advertisers an easy way to control and negotiate the terms of their arrangement.
JR Crosby
Director, Strategy & Investment, Xaxis






 First-party data is easy. You follow that guy from the website. But second-party is that extra spoke in the wheel. It opens up a lot more opportunity. It's a good awareness driver. It's just as relevant [if not more] as first- and third-party data. They complement each other very well.
Tim Trus
Director of Search & Media, Rosetta






 The ability to target the Toys “R” Us audience of parents was exactly what my brand needed to succeed in this campaign. We saw tremendous results after exposure, exceeding our ROI goal by more than 5x.
Tena Crock
VP of EComm & Digital Marketing at Step2






 We were looking for somebody to bring something different to the table in terms of the set of data that would add to what we were doing. That’s where ownerIQ came in, where they said, "We have these partnerships with retailers, and brands. We can get you on a new set of data that no one else really had." Overall, ownerIQ for at least a few clients has been one of our best performing partners.
Sean Corcoran
SVP, Director of Digital Media & Social Influence at Mullen






 Vendor Targeted Marketing from ownerIQ is something you can’t do with any SEO or Google adwords campaign, Yelp reviews, website takeover campaigns, website banner ads or the innumerable online campaigns touted by every radio, TV, newspaper and online media company in existence.
Richard Yagjian
 Executive Vice-President, WB Hunt Company, Inc. (Hunt's Photo & Video)





 ownerIQ not only has massive amounts of exclusive second party shopper data, they also have extensive capabilities to measure online to offline sales.  Their team was very consultative in helping us choose the right measurement partners and had a lot of expertise in how to set the campaign up for success.  We look forward to working with them on multiple campaigns in the future.

                            Traci Rosen
AMD, Horizon Media





 A successful shopper marketing campaign drives results and combines online, in-store and offline marketing, this is exactly what ownerIQ helped us do for a well known Cottage Cheese brand. ownerIQ’s always-on campaign delivered strong sales outcomes for multiple retailers and CPG brand.

                            Greg Smith
Director of Shopper Marketing, Partners + Napier

 About the Q
ownerIQ is the first and only transparent data marketplace focused on creating successful partnerships for retailers, brands and marketers alike. ownerIQ is driven by the idea that all brands and retailers find value in having the ability to transparently share their audience data with their marketing partners. ownerIQ’s brand and retail partners are at the forefront of this digital disruption and understand their audience data is a valuable marketing asset. By fostering transparent data economies between retailers, OEMs, co-op partners and product brands, ownerIQ enables brands of all types to support their digital marketing agendas and drive sales. 
					

                	ownerIQ's second-party data marketplace supports digital media’s largest and most transparent shared data economy where these partnerships and transactions are fostered through a cloud-based custom built Data Management Platform. Today, ownerIQ provides Retailers and Product Brand marketers with a platform to maximize the value of their data and access 200+ million consumers and 2.8 billion shopping interactions monthly. ownerIQ partners leverage their audiences to generate marketing budget and ad support, open up ad revenue channels, and generate new customer insights. As a result, making it possible for any programmatic advertiser to power media activations (online advertising campaigns) that are more transparent, more relevant, and more insightful than any 3rd party data execution.  
					


 The Q Story
Having successfully built and sold their first company, Bitpipe,   co-founders Jay Habegger and Eric Mabley put together the founding team of ownerIQ (Jay Habegger, Doug Shattuck, Eric Mabley, Chris Back and Connie Johnson) in 2007. This time the goal was to change advertising for retailers and brands with the idea of ownership targeting  through the power of  second-party data.
Even back then, we knew the best predictor of buying behavior is shopping behavior. Early on we partnered with retailers and brands launching our flagship product,  ManualsOnline.  Since our inception we have grown to be the leading programmatic solution for retailers and brands and the first of its kind transparent second-party data sharing marketplace offering a full product suite to  retailers and   brands to experience next level digital advertising through transparency, relevancy and scalability.
					
ownerIQ "the Q" was recently named in the 2015 Ad Age BtoB Best Awards, Digiday Signal Award, Boston Business Journal's Hottest Tech Companies to Watch, and Editor's Choice Award from Shopper Marketing Magazine.

 This is where we started carefully building models to combine the highly predictive data we were bringing to market, including consumer behavior at retail, with meticulous evaluation of each placement opportunity.


Jay Habegger
CEO








Second-Party Data & Decisioning
We merged mar tech and ad tech to go under one roof, and it’s a performance game changer.









Second-Party Audience Cloud



It all starts with ownerIQ’s massive, TRANSPARENT, second-party data cloud. With over 600 audience partners, an unparalleled amount of shopping and purchasing data (at the product and brand level) is directly ported into our audience platform.








CoEx Audience Platform



From these partners, CoEx, our audience platform, directly ingests over 3 billion shopping behaviors and over 20 million monthly transactions for a total cost at retail over $2.5 billion. This deluge data is organized into our taxonomy of nearly 20,000 product and brands categories and directly fed it into our decisioning engine.








Real-Time Decisioning Engine



This level of access to product / brand level shopping / purchasing information is not possible via 3rd party data segments, and it enables ownerIQ’s decisioning engine to apply an “expected performance score” (EP score) to every opportunity we see. An EP score is the probability that a user will take a desired action based on the similarities of their shopping and purchase behavior to those that bought, or converted. Our decisioning engine by numbers:

1.3 Trillion impressions processed monthly
Over 500 billion opportunities seen across mobile devices
Over 600,000 data points are calculated on every opportunity

What is Second-Party Data?



			Second-party data is about complete data transparency. You choose your data sets and know exactly the audience you’re reaching.
			

Second-party data is built specifically for sharing (i.e. combining) the first-party data of one partner with the first-party data of another relevant partner, achieving complete transparency on desktop and mobile. This data source has already gone mainstream within relationships between two entities with a symbiotic relationship, such as retailers and brands.
Beyond these instances, the adoption of the concept will depend on the particulars of the association between the parties at hand. Organizations with an adjacent relationship, organizations that share an agency, and organizations that share a platform are all common examples of other second-party data use cases.

Making Headlines















































































































 At BPN, our top objective is to provide our clients with strategic thinking and data-driven results to deliver effective integrated marketing campaigns. We believe in using the right partner to deliver the core consumer audience to achieve the brand's goals. ownerIQ’s second-party data platform had just what we were looking for when we sought out specialized audience data sets. For one client, ownerIQ’s premium auto data delivered an exceptionally impressive 85.69% video completion rate.
Alison Raynak
Media Planner, Borders Perrin Norrander






 Working with ownerIQ allows Cabela's to enable brands to reach shoppers with relevant, unobtrusive messaging. This helps us create the best possible experience for our shoppers by reaching them with products and services relevant to their interests.
Klint Andreas
Director of E-commerce Merchandising, Cabela's






 At Universal McCann, we’re result-driven at the core. We love that ownerIQ operates the same way. Our partnership allows us to seamlessly do what we do best: perform and drive meaningful results for our clients by using second-party data. An example of this is a top shipping and mailing services client recognized us a top performer for ROAS (return on ad spend) on the campaign, showing ownerIQ's ability to perform when it matters. I would recommend ownerIQ for other brand teams across the agency.
Lisa Cao
Manager, Integrated Investment






 In an industry where the phrase “data is king” is thrown around by everyone from thought leaders to entry level marketers, it does seem a bit ironic that the bulk of available targeting data is largely an unknown in composition and quality. At this moment in advertising, the quality of non-proprietary data is, simply put, bad and ineffective. In this sense, ownerIQ is a diamond in the rough. No matter what the client’s goal is, I know that the quality of their data will be a cornerstone of our strategy and a major contributor to providing results.
Sherveen Shingu
Senior Manager, Display Strategy, Point It






 Two non-competitive travel advertisers came to Xaxis looking to establish a controlled data sharing partnership. We quickly realized that there is a missing link needed to set up this type of a relationship. That link is a second-party data platform which gives advertisers an easy way to control and negotiate the terms of their arrangement.
JR Crosby
Director, Strategy & Investment, Xaxis






 First-party data is easy. You follow that guy from the website. But second-party is that extra spoke in the wheel. It opens up a lot more opportunity. It's a good awareness driver. It's just as relevant [if not more] as first- and third-party data. They complement each other very well.
Tim Trus
Director of Search & Media, Rosetta






 The ability to target the Toys “R” Us audience of parents was exactly what my brand needed to succeed in this campaign. We saw tremendous results after exposure, exceeding our ROI goal by more than 5x.
Tena Crock
VP of EComm & Digital Marketing at Step2






 We were looking for somebody to bring something different to the table in terms of the set of data that would add to what we were doing. That’s where ownerIQ came in, where they said, "We have these partnerships with retailers, and brands. We can get you on a new set of data that no one else really had." Overall, ownerIQ for at least a few clients has been one of our best performing partners.
Sean Corcoran
SVP, Director of Digital Media & Social Influence at Mullen






 Vendor Targeted Marketing from ownerIQ is something you can’t do with any SEO or Google adwords campaign, Yelp reviews, website takeover campaigns, website banner ads or the innumerable online campaigns touted by every radio, TV, newspaper and online media company in existence.
Richard Yagjian
 Executive Vice-President, WB Hunt Company, Inc. (Hunt's Photo & Video)





 ownerIQ not only has massive amounts of exclusive second party shopper data, they also have extensive capabilities to measure online to offline sales.  Their team was very consultative in helping us choose the right measurement partners and had a lot of expertise in how to set the campaign up for success.  We look forward to working with them on multiple campaigns in the future.

                            Traci Rosen
AMD, Horizon Media





 A successful shopper marketing campaign drives results and combines online, in-store and offline marketing, this is exactly what ownerIQ helped us do for a well known Cottage Cheese brand. ownerIQ’s always-on campaign delivered strong sales outcomes for multiple retailers and CPG brand.

                            Greg Smith
Director of Shopper Marketing, Partners + Napier

What is Second-Party Data?



			Second-party data is about complete data transparency. You choose your data sets and know exactly the audience you’re reaching.
			

Second-party data is built specifically for sharing (i.e. combining) the first-party data of one partner with the first-party data of another relevant partner, achieving complete transparency on desktop and mobile. This data source has already gone mainstream within relationships between two entities with a symbiotic relationship, such as retailers and brands.
Beyond these instances, the adoption of the concept will depend on the particulars of the association between the parties at hand. Organizations with an adjacent relationship, organizations that share an agency, and organizations that share a platform are all common examples of other second-party data use cases.

Making Headlines















































































































 At BPN, our top objective is to provide our clients with strategic thinking and data-driven results to deliver effective integrated marketing campaigns. We believe in using the right partner to deliver the core consumer audience to achieve the brand's goals. ownerIQ’s second-party data platform had just what we were looking for when we sought out specialized audience data sets. For one client, ownerIQ’s premium auto data delivered an exceptionally impressive 85.69% video completion rate.
Alison Raynak
Media Planner, Borders Perrin Norrander






 Working with ownerIQ allows Cabela's to enable brands to reach shoppers with relevant, unobtrusive messaging. This helps us create the best possible experience for our shoppers by reaching them with products and services relevant to their interests.
Klint Andreas
Director of E-commerce Merchandising, Cabela's






 At Universal McCann, we’re result-driven at the core. We love that ownerIQ operates the same way. Our partnership allows us to seamlessly do what we do best: perform and drive meaningful results for our clients by using second-party data. An example of this is a top shipping and mailing services client recognized us a top performer for ROAS (return on ad spend) on the campaign, showing ownerIQ's ability to perform when it matters. I would recommend ownerIQ for other brand teams across the agency.
Lisa Cao
Manager, Integrated Investment






 In an industry where the phrase “data is king” is thrown around by everyone from thought leaders to entry level marketers, it does seem a bit ironic that the bulk of available targeting data is largely an unknown in composition and quality. At this moment in advertising, the quality of non-proprietary data is, simply put, bad and ineffective. In this sense, ownerIQ is a diamond in the rough. No matter what the client’s goal is, I know that the quality of their data will be a cornerstone of our strategy and a major contributor to providing results.
Sherveen Shingu
Senior Manager, Display Strategy, Point It






 Two non-competitive travel advertisers came to Xaxis looking to establish a controlled data sharing partnership. We quickly realized that there is a missing link needed to set up this type of a relationship. That link is a second-party data platform which gives advertisers an easy way to control and negotiate the terms of their arrangement.
JR Crosby
Director, Strategy & Investment, Xaxis






 First-party data is easy. You follow that guy from the website. But second-party is that extra spoke in the wheel. It opens up a lot more opportunity. It's a good awareness driver. It's just as relevant [if not more] as first- and third-party data. They complement each other very well.
Tim Trus
Director of Search & Media, Rosetta






 The ability to target the Toys “R” Us audience of parents was exactly what my brand needed to succeed in this campaign. We saw tremendous results after exposure, exceeding our ROI goal by more than 5x.
Tena Crock
VP of EComm & Digital Marketing at Step2






 We were looking for somebody to bring something different to the table in terms of the set of data that would add to what we were doing. That’s where ownerIQ came in, where they said, "We have these partnerships with retailers, and brands. We can get you on a new set of data that no one else really had." Overall, ownerIQ for at least a few clients has been one of our best performing partners.
Sean Corcoran
SVP, Director of Digital Media & Social Influence at Mullen






 Vendor Targeted Marketing from ownerIQ is something you can’t do with any SEO or Google adwords campaign, Yelp reviews, website takeover campaigns, website banner ads or the innumerable online campaigns touted by every radio, TV, newspaper and online media company in existence.
Richard Yagjian
 Executive Vice-President, WB Hunt Company, Inc. (Hunt's Photo & Video)





 ownerIQ not only has massive amounts of exclusive second party shopper data, they also have extensive capabilities to measure online to offline sales.  Their team was very consultative in helping us choose the right measurement partners and had a lot of expertise in how to set the campaign up for success.  We look forward to working with them on multiple campaigns in the future.

                            Traci Rosen
AMD, Horizon Media





 A successful shopper marketing campaign drives results and combines online, in-store and offline marketing, this is exactly what ownerIQ helped us do for a well known Cottage Cheese brand. ownerIQ’s always-on campaign delivered strong sales outcomes for multiple retailers and CPG brand.

                            Greg Smith
Director of Shopper Marketing, Partners + Napier

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
