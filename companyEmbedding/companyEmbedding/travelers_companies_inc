Travelers Inc.: Keep An Eye On The Valuation - The Travelers Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TRV) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Travelers Inc.: Keep An Eye On The ValuationJun.15.17 | About: The Travelers (TRV) The CrickAnt Long only, value, insurance, mid-capSummaryTravelers Inc. is one of the largest P&C insurers in the U.S.As some others insurers (e.g. Aflac, Cincinnati Financial), Travelers Inc. rewards very well its shareholders by increasing every year its dividend and by repurchasing its shares.However, the underwriting performance is declining over the years. The Q1 2017 results proved again that the operating performance continues deteriorating.The company remains a good choice for a dividend seeker, even if the insurer is currently slightly overvalued.Notes for the readers Most of the figures are based on the financial reports of Travelers Inc. (NYSE:TRV) and of its main competitors. Executive Summary Travelers Inc. is a US-based property and casualty insurance company which is one of the largest insurers in the country. The share price has reached a new 52-week high and should continue climbing while Q1 2017 results were not excellent, showing the downward trend of the underwriting performance of the company's portfolio. Even if the insurer has outperformed its peers in the past, the question of the undervaluation should be raised. To answer the question that every investor asks him/herself - should I invest in this stock regarding my investor profile? - we need to analyze the historical results of the company, look on its underwriting track record, its capital redistribution, its commercial performance to determine if it is worth to invest in it. History of the group The origins of Travelers go back to the 19th century. The Travelers Companies is created by the merger of two companies, Saint Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Co and Travelers. Saint Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Co. was founded March 5, 1853, in St. Paul, Minnesota, by Alexander Wilkin, secretary of the Minnesota Territory, and 16 other businesspeople. In 1864, J.G. Batterson and nine other entrepreneurs found The Travelers Insurance Company. After one century of expansion, Saint Paul Fire and, Marine Insurance Co formed in 1968 The St. Paul Companies Inc. and acquired in 1988 St. Katerine Insurance Company, a London-based insurer. In 1996, The Travelers Indemnity Company and the Aetna Casualty and Surety Company merged to form the U.S. fourth largest P&C insurer. Two years later, The St. Paul acquired United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company, a Baltimore-based insurer and became the eighth largest P&C insurer in the United States. The same year, the Travelers Group merged with Citicorp to form Citigroup (NYSE:C). In 2002, Citigroup's management, considering the synergies between the bank and insurance activities were not sufficient enough, decided to spin-off Travelers Property and Casualty into a subsidiary company. Citigroup ended Travelers' business adventure by selling the Travelers Life & Annuity to MetLife (NYSE:MET). In 2004, The St. Paul and Travelers merged to form the St. Paul Travelers Companies. Three years later, the company changed its name to The Travelers Companies, Inc. and repurchased the rights to the famous red umbrella logo from Citigroup. In 2013, Travelers acquired through its Canadian subsidiary The Dominion of Canada General Insurance Company. In 2015, Travelers acquired the majority interest in the business of its J. Malucelli joint venture in Brazil.
 The Travelers in 2016 With 2016 net written premiums of $25.0 billion, Travelers Inc. is a general business holding company which operates mainly in the United States (93.8% of the 2016 revenues) and Canada (4.3% of the 2016 revenues). The company provides a broad range of commercial and personal P&C insurance products and services to businesses, government units, associations, and individuals. Travelers Inc. groups its operations into three business segments: 

 Source: Travelers' Financial Document  Business & International Insurance which posted $14.7 billion in revenues last year. Through its segment, Travelers Inc. offers a broad array of P&C products to its clients. Its main lines of business are workers' compensation, commercial automobile, commercial property, general liability, commercial multi-peril and international. The products under "Business & International Insurance" segments are distributed through approximately 11,000 independent agencies and brokers. The client target is the mid-sized businesses as they represented 44% of the total revenues of this segment. Bond & Specialty Insurance which generated $2.1 billion in revenues in 2015. Travelers Inc. writes mainly Fidelity & Surety policies and General Liability insurance coverage. Personal Insurance with $8.2 billion in revenues in 2016. Personal Insurance products are marketed and distributed through 10,900 independent agencies. The two product lines sold through this segment are automobile insurance products and homeowners insurance products.  Competitive Position: A Leading Player In The U.S. P&C Insurance Market The Travelers Companies, Inc. is a leading provider of property casualty insurance for auto, home, and business. Hence it has a leading position in both commercial and personal insurance lines of business. In commercial insurance, it holds the No. 2 position. In personal insurance segment, the insurer is the third-largest insurance company in the U.S. With a 3.1% annualized growth rate from 2013, Travelers Inc. is not a fast growing company but is neither a declining one.
 

 Source: Travelers' Financial Document The growth in the turnover is mainly driven by the Business and Internal insurance segment which is the largest business segments of the company. From 2013 to 2016, the net written premiums grew by 8.6% to $14.7 billion. 

 Source: Travelers' Financial Document Mainly present in the U.S. (the international segment representing only 12% of the total new written business), the commercial insurance portfolio of the U.S-based insurer is well-diversified regarding the types of products. 

 Source: Travelers' Financial Document However, its leading position does not prevent Travelers against price competitions, the increase in the catastrophe losses and the deterioration of its operating profitability. 

 Source: Travelers' Financial Document Even if the net written premiums grew over the years, the deterioration of the combined ratio eroded the commercial development efforts done during the last four years.
 The degradation of the operating performance in the commercial business could also be observed in the personal insurance business. With $8.2 billion of revenues in 2016, this segment has followed the same upward trend regarding commercial development. The net premiums increased by 13.3% from 2013 to 2016 but the income was more erratic than the revenue growth, mainly due to higher volatility regarding claims development. 

 Source: Travelers' Financial Document The erratic movement of the portfolio profitability could be partially explained by the structure of it. With automobile and homeowner insurance products in its personal portfolio, Travelers should face to an intense competition with the other insurers, which are sometimes only present in some states in the U.S. and then have higher competitive advantages than Travelers in spite of its leading position regarding its premium volume. 

 Source: Travelers' Financial Document Last but not least, the surety portfolio is tiny compared to the two others: only $2 billion of revenues in 2016. 

 Source: Travelers' Financial Document The portfolio is split into two lines of business: the Surety insurance portfolio, which represented, in 2016, 36% of the net premiums written for this segment and the management liability insurance portfolio, which is mainly focused on the small and the middle markets.
 

 Source: Travelers' Financial Document As surety and management insurance businesses are niche markets, it is harder for Travelers to have the same commercial development than for its traditional markets. However, there is low pressure on the prices, and it is easier (with a strong underwriting process) to deliver a higher profitability than in the motor insurance, which is a less tailored-insurance market than the surety business. Hence the income level in this segment is more stable and less volatile, with a lower combined ratio, often positively impacted by favorable claims development for the prior years. 

 Source: Travelers' Financial Document Travelers Inc. remains a mature insurer in the U.S. with a substantial market position in both commercial and personal segments. Even if the growth in the revenues was higher in Q1 2017 than the one observed during the last year, the investors could not expect the P&C company to increase its operating revenues by 5 or 10% per year. Furthermore, the investors should not be dazzled by the positive commercial development observed during the first quarter of 2017. An insurer does not make money by writing more premiums. An insurance company makes money by only two means: it invests very efficiently the premiums paid by its policyholders or its writes more premiums than it pays claims. In Travelers' case, investment income declined modestly in Q1 2017, following the downward spiral of the fixed-income portfolio and the combined ratio deteriorated. Hence, the investors should not be too optimistic regarding the revenue increase or should rather concentrate on the evolution of the portfolio (both commercial portfolio and investment portfolio) profitability.
 Operating Performance: A Strong But Declining Performance The main obvious metric for a P&C insurer is the combined ratio. It could be difficult to compare two different P&C insurers if the market is completely different, but it is the simplest and the most straightforward metric to say at least if a P&C insurer is profitable or not. In Travelers' case, the answer is simple: the company is profitable in all segments for many years. It is mainly due to a strong underwriting discipline coupled with a leading position in its markets. 

 Source: Travelers' Financial Document With an average combined ratio of around 90%, any insurance professional could say that Travelers Inc.'s underwriting performance is very high. Generally speaking, the long-term combined ratio target is rather around 95%. Nordic European insurers (e.g. Gjensidige (OTC:GJNSF) (OTCPK:GJNSY), Topdanmark (OTCPK:TPDKY), Sampo (OTCPK:SAXPY) (OTCPK:SAXPF)) and niche insurers (credit insurers, some reinsurers, other insurers as Aflac (NYSE:AFL), Atlas (NASDAQ:AFH), and Kingstone Companies (NASDAQ:KINS)) are able to reach this target on a long-term horizon. For the majority of the insurance company, 98% combined ratio is the holy grail of the underwriting performance. However, the profitability of the insurance portfolio of Travelers Inc. is slightly declining over the years. The worst deterioration of the profitability is related to the personal insurance portfolio. From 2013 to 2016, the combined ratio rose by 4.8 percentage points to 95.1%. 2016 was also worrisome because the reserve development of the prior years was unfavorable. In a traditional insurance company, the process is the following: actuaries calculate an ultimate claim amount per attachment year, based on the claims triangles (paid or incurred). In most of the cases, the actuaries slightly over-reserve to be more conservative. That's why every year, the company could release a reserve amount related to prior years. The reserving process depends primarily on the management's strategy (some insurers could be more aggressive than others regarding their reserving process). Going back to Travelers, the insurer has proven in the past that it was prudent regarding the claims and reserve assessment. A negative run-off should mean that the situation deteriorated more than expected. And we could also see that in Q1 2017: the impact of the catastrophe events increased (an additional 1.4 percentage point impact on the combined ratio than in Q1 2016) and there was no reserve release related to the prior years.
 

 Source: Travelers' Financial Document Yet all is not doom and gloom. Even if the commercial insurance portfolio profitability declined as well from 2013, the situation in 2016 was more than good. However, the situation deteriorated slightly in Q1 2017 with a combined ratio of 96.3%. 

 Source: Travelers' Financial Document Furthermore, the bond & specialty portfolio remains very profitable with an average combined ratio lower than 70%. As for the rest of the portfolio, 2017 did not start well, the portfolio delivering less run-off than last year (mainly due to the AOI experience as mentioned during the Q1 2017 conference call). 

 Source: Travelers' Financial Document As for the operating performance, the investment performance is slightly declining, but the reason is completely explainable. With 92% of bond and short-term securities and AA average credit rating, it is tough for an insurer to deliver an excellent performance in a low-interest rate environment. 


 Source: Travelers' Financial Document That's why the contribution of the financial income in the RoE dropped over the years, except in Q1 2017, mainly driven by higher private equity returns. As the largest part of the portfolio is invested in fixed-income instruments, a gradual increase in the interest rates would improve the profitability of the investment portfolio. 

 Source: Travelers' Financial Document Going back to the RoE question, even if it has decreased over the years, mainly impacted by the operating performance deterioration and low-interest rate environment, the level of the RoE is higher than of its peers. 

 Source: Travelers' Financial Document In other words, Travelers Inc. remains more profitable than its competitors (on an average basis) because of a solid operating performance and a smaller impact of the low-interest rate environment (unlike the life insurers). Regarding the track record of Travelers Inc., we could expect the company to continue delivering strong underwriting results. 2017 could be more challenging than the previous years. However, if the company succeeds to reprice its policies and reduces the impact of the catastrophe events, investors could have a good surprise. Nevertheless, they should remain prudent, look at the trend and do not mistake their dreams for reality. Stock Repurchase Program and Dividend: Nothing To Say, It Is Terrific We could say that Travelers Inc. is not a growing company. We could add that the profitability of the firm is lower than in the past and quite disappointing, if not worrisome. But no one could have the nerve to say that Travelers Inc. is a non-rewarding listed insurer. Every long-term shareholder has been rewarded for its patience, its investment and its trust in the company's strategy.
 With a 9.8% annualized growth of the paid dividend from 2006, we could say that Travelers Inc. rewarded the efforts of its shareholders. 

 Source: Travelers' Financial Document Hence the dividend (paid on a quarterly basis) per share increased by $1.52 to reach $2.62 per share, in 2016. In other words, it has more than doubled in 11 years. Not so bad. Furthermore, the company also repurchased its shares year after year, increasing mechanically the dividend received by the shareholders. By paying cash dividends without interruption for 146 years, Travelers Inc. could consider as a good choice for a dividend seeker. With a low payout ratio (around 25%), investors could continue being confident in the gradual increase in the cash dividend. Stock Valuation: A Valuable Slightly Overvalued Company Sometimes, we should talk about money. Any investors, even the dividend seekers, should know if the intrinsic value is lower or higher than the current market price. So let's discuss valuation! To assess the intrinsic value of Travelers Inc., we used an approach based on the following valuation methods:  Historical Ratios: P/E, Price/Sales, and Price/Book Valuation Multiple: P/E, and Price/Book. As a peer review, we have chosen the following companies: Progressive (NYSE:PGR), Allstate (NYSE:ALL), Arch Capital (NASDAQ:ARCC), Old Republic International Corporation (NYSE:ORI), Hartford Financial Services (NYSE:HIG), Chubb (NYSE:CB) and Cincinnati Financial Corporation (NASDAQ:CINF). DCF Valuation: We decided to model six scenarios with a discount rate of 12%. From an external point view, this level of the discount rate could be seen as assessed arbitrary. It has been done (at least partially) and could be criticized. 
 1) Based on EPS: three scenarios (Best, Base and Worst): - Best: 7% annual growth for the next fifteen years. The terminal growth rate is 2%. In this scenario, we consider that Travelers Inc. would continue to repurchase its own shares actively and improve its operating profitability. - Base: A 4% annual growth for the next fifteen years. The terminal growth rate is 1%. In this scenario, we consider that Travelers Inc. would continue to repurchase its own shares actively and maintain its operating profitability. - Worst: A 3% annual growth for the next fifteen years. The terminal growth rate is 1%. In this scenario, we consider that operating profitability would deteriorate and would be only offset by an active stock repurchase program. 2) Based on DPS: three scenarios (Best, Base and Worst): - Best: a 9.8% annual growth based on 11-year average increase - Base: a 7% annual growth based on the 3-year average increase. - Worst: a 4% annual growth 

 The company seems to be slightly overvalued at the current price. However, we would like to mention something. With the DDM, the output is very sensitive to the inputs. Hence changing the annual growth of the dividend and above all the discount rate could modify the results completely. However, we prefer keeping our assumptions and giving a valuation range rather than an absolute amount. Therefore, the intrinsic value per share is between $115 and $120. In our view, the company remains overvalued. Conclusion Slightly overvalued at the moment, Travelers Inc. remains a very profitable insurance company, which is facing to difficulties to maintain its historical level of profitability. However, it is a well-diversified company which both increases its dividend and repurchases its shares year after year. A lazy dividend seeker, who is not interested in any valuation consideration, should have this stock in his/her portfolio. An investor, more focused on some risk/reward metrics could have a look at other insurance companies, more undervalued than the New-York-headquartered P&C company.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

The Travelers Companies, Inc. announced a new online system that enables UK brokers to receive Management Liability quotes and bind coverage for their clients in a matter of minutes. Accessed through the My Travelers e-trade platform, the Management Liability Package from Travelers uses four steps to streamline the quoting process and help brokers bind Directors and Officers Liability, Employment Practices Liability, Pension Trustees Liability and Commercial Crime coverage. The system also gives brokers built-in support through a live chat function that connects directly to the underwriters, step-by-step video demos, answers to common questions and tips that make the transaction easy and efficient. The four-step quoting process includes an initial search that will preload a large amount of customer information for the broker, who is then required to confirm information, coverage selection and start dates. A final step binds the coverage. Additional features of the Management Liability Package enable brokers to: Generate multiple quotes in a few clicks. Save as they go and amend information at any time. Choose from multiple limit options. Copy and paste quotes from the online tool into other documents. Create multiple quote options and bind only the parts the client needs.

History[edit]




Top: The familiar umbrella logo of the Travelers, used until its spinoff from Citigroup. Bottom: The logo that The St. Paul used prior to the merger with Travelers.


The main predecessor companies of The Travelers Companies, Inc. are The St. Paul Companies, Inc. and Travelers Property Casualty Corporation.
Saint Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Co. was founded March 5, 1853, in St. Paul, Minnesota, serving local customers who were having a difficult time getting claim payments in a timely manner from insurance companies on the east coast of the United States. It barely survived the Panic of 1857 by dramatically paring down its operations and later reorganizing itself into a stock company (as opposed to a mutual company). It soon spread its operations across the country. In 1998 it acquired USF&G, known formerly as United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company, an insurance company based in Baltimore, Maryland, for $3.9 billion in stock and assumed debt.[4][5] By buying USF&G, they went from the 13th to the eighth largest property and casualty insurance company in the United States. Through economies of scale between the two companies, and a difficult business environment, they downsized the company substantially over the coming years by selling certain business units to focus on more profitable business units.[6][7]
Travelers was founded in 1864 in Hartford. It was founded to provide travel insurance to railroad travelers at a time when travel was far more risky and dangerous than today, hence the name. Along the way it had many industry firsts, including the first automobile policy, the first commercial airline policy, and the first policy for space travel.[8] By the early 1990s, Travelers was predominantly a general property and casualty insurer that also happened to do some travel insurance on the side, and it quietly exited its original business in 1994. What was left of Travelers' travel insurance business was acquired by three former employees and is now known as Travel Insured International.




The Travelers logo, ca. 1993


In the 1990s, it went through a series of mergers and acquisitions. It was bought by Primerica in 1993,[9] but the resulting company retained the Travelers name. In 1995 it became The Travelers Group.[8] It bought Aetna's property and casualty business in 1996.[10]
In 1998, the Travelers Group merged with Citicorp to form Citigroup.[9] However, the synergies between the banking and insurance arms of the company did not work as well as planned, so Citigroup spun off Travelers Property and Casualty into a subsidiary company in 2002,[11] although it kept the red umbrella logo. Three years later, Citigroup sold Travelers Life & Annuity to MetLife.[12] In 2003, Travelers bought renewal rights for Royal & SunAlliance Personal Insurance and Commercial businesses.[13][14]
In 2004, the St. Paul and Travelers Companies merged and renamed itself St. Paul Travelers, with the headquarters set in St. Paul, Minnesota.[15] In August of that year, it was charged of misleading statements associated with the merger.[16][17] Despite many assurances from CEO Jay Fishman that the newly formed company would retain the St. Paul name, the corporate name only lasted until 2007, when the company repurchased the rights to the famous red umbrella logo from Citigroup and readopted it as its main corporate symbol, while also changing the corporate name to The Travelers Companies.[18][19][20][21]
Many of Travelers' ancestor companies, such as St. Paul and USF&G, are technically still around today, and still write policies and accept claims in their own names (under the overarching Travelers brand name). As is typical of most insurers in the United States, Travelers never dissolved the various companies it acquired, but simply made them wholly owned subsidiaries and trained its employees to act on behalf of those subsidiaries. This is a common risk management strategy used by U.S. insurance groups. If any one company in the group gets hit with too many claims, the situation can be easily contained to that one company (which is placed in runoff and allowed to run its policies to completion), while the remainder of the group continues to operate normally.
In November 2010, Travelers entered into a joint venture agreement under which the company would invest in J. Malucelli Participações em Seguros e Resseguros S.A., the market leader in the surety insurance business in Brazil. The transaction closed in June 2011 with Travelers acquiring a 43.4 percent interest. Travelers' investment in newly issued shares significantly increased J. Malucelli's capital level, positioning it for substantial growth in Brazil. At the time, Travelers had the option to increase its investment to retain a 49.5 percent interest, which the company later did in 2012.[22]
In June 2013, Travelers announced the acquisition of Dominion of Canada General Insurance Company from E-L Financial Corporation Limited (TSX: ELF).[23] The transaction later closed in November 2013. The combined organization, referred to as Travelers Canada, remains headquartered in Toronto.[24]
The company’s joint venture with J. Malucelli in Brazil completed the acquisition of a majority interest in Cardinal Compañía de Seguros, a Colombian start-up surety provider in September 2015. The business, which is based in Bogotá, operates under the co-branded name J. Malucelli Travelers.[25]
In October 2015, Travelers acquired a majority interest in the property casualty business of its J. Malucelli joint venture in Brazil. J. Malucelli commenced writing property casualty business in 2012.[26] The property casualty business operates under the Travelers brand and focuses on property, general liability, construction and financial insurance products. The business is based in São Paulo.
As a result of the transaction, Travelers now owns 95 percent of the property casualty business with Paraná Banco, the parent company of J. Malucelli, retaining a five percent interest. Travelers’ interest in the surety business of the J. Malucelli joint venture remains at 49.5 percent.[27]
In March 2017, Travelers agreed to acquire UK-based Simply Business from Aquiline Capital Partners for approximately $490 million. Simply Business is a leading U.K. distributor of small business insurance policies, offering products online on behalf of a broad panel of carriers. It has more than 425,000 microbusiness customers covering more than 1,000 classes of business, and was named “Best Company to Work For” by The Sunday Times in 2015 and 2016. The transaction adds to Travelers' digital capabilities.[28][29][30]
Travelers is currently 116 on the Fortune 500[31] list of largest U.S. companies. On June 8, 2009, Travelers replaced its former parent Citigroup on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
On August 4, 2015 the company announced that Alan Schnitzer would succeed Jay Fishman as Chief Executive Officer effective December 1, 2015.[32]
Alleged anticompetitive practices[edit]
In January 2007, Travelers agreed to pay US$77 million to six states to settle a class action suit and end investigations into its insurance practices.[33][34] The charges involved paying the insurance broker Marsh & McLennan Companies contingent commissions to win business without the knowledge of clients, thus creating a conflict of interest.[35] Additionally, the investigation examined whether Travelers had created the illusion of competition by submitting fake bids,[36] thus misleading clients into believing they were receiving competitive commercial premiums.[37]
National Football League lawsuit[edit]
In August 2012, Travelers sued the National Football League for forcing the company and its subsidiaries to pay to defend the league for failing to protect players from brain injury, in a case filed in the New York State Supreme Court called Discover Property & Casualty Co. et al. vs. National Football League et al., New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 652933/2012. The league had sued over three dozen insurance companies the week before in an attempt to cover the claims that players made against the league.[38][39][40]
Advertising[edit]




St. Paul Travelers logo used until February 2007


The original logo of the red umbrella started in 1870 when it appeared in a newspaper ad for the young insurance company. It was revived in the early 1960s, when it was given its signature red color by Harry W. Knettell, then the account executive for The Travelers and Vice President at the Charles Brunelle advertising agency. During the late 1960s Charles Brunelle was the largest advertising agency in Hartford, a city known as "the insurance capital of the world" due to the many insurance companies in that town. The Travelers was one of their many insurance company clients.[41][better source needed]
In 2006, a Travelers commercial titled Snowball was nominated for an Emmy. Snowball featured a man, walking down a steep San Francisco sidewalk, who trips and knocks over a table of items at a garage sale. The man and the items roll down the street, forming a ball which gathers garbage cans, pedestrians, construction materials, motorcycles, light poles, and other items, in a manner very reminiscent of the familiar cartoon "snowball" effect or the cult video game Katamari Damacy.[42] The creators of the ad say it is simply based on the snowball effect, they have never heard of the game, and that the resulting similarity was a surprise to them.[43]
In 2007, the company secured naming rights for an annual event to be called the Travelers Championship golf tournament, formerly the Greater Hartford Open, on the PGA Tour.
In April 2008, The Travelers purchased back the rights to the famous red umbrella, which is featured in several commercials starring Paul Freeman as well as other advertisements. In July 2008, the spot "Delivery," also starring Freeman, was nominated for an Emmy.

It is the second largest writer of U.S. commercial property casualty insurance and the third largest writer of U.S. personal insurance through independent agents. Travelers is incorporated in Minnesota, with headquarters in New York City and its largest office in Hartford, Connecticut. Travelers also maintains a large office in St. Paul, Minnesota.[1] It has been a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average since June 8, 2009.[3]

History[edit]




Top: The familiar umbrella logo of the Travelers, used until its spinoff from Citigroup. Bottom: The logo that The St. Paul used prior to the merger with Travelers.


The main predecessor companies of The Travelers Companies, Inc. are The St. Paul Companies, Inc. and Travelers Property Casualty Corporation.
Saint Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Co. was founded March 5, 1853, in St. Paul, Minnesota, serving local customers who were having a difficult time getting claim payments in a timely manner from insurance companies on the east coast of the United States. It barely survived the Panic of 1857 by dramatically paring down its operations and later reorganizing itself into a stock company (as opposed to a mutual company). It soon spread its operations across the country. In 1998 it acquired USF&G, known formerly as United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company, an insurance company based in Baltimore, Maryland, for $3.9 billion in stock and assumed debt.[4][5] By buying USF&G, they went from the 13th to the eighth largest property and casualty insurance company in the United States. Through economies of scale between the two companies, and a difficult business environment, they downsized the company substantially over the coming years by selling certain business units to focus on more profitable business units.[6][7]
Travelers was founded in 1864 in Hartford. It was founded to provide travel insurance to railroad travelers at a time when travel was far more risky and dangerous than today, hence the name. Along the way it had many industry firsts, including the first automobile policy, the first commercial airline policy, and the first policy for space travel.[8] By the early 1990s, Travelers was predominantly a general property and casualty insurer that also happened to do some travel insurance on the side, and it quietly exited its original business in 1994. What was left of Travelers' travel insurance business was acquired by three former employees and is now known as Travel Insured International.




The Travelers logo, ca. 1993


In the 1990s, it went through a series of mergers and acquisitions. It was bought by Primerica in 1993,[9] but the resulting company retained the Travelers name. In 1995 it became The Travelers Group.[8] It bought Aetna's property and casualty business in 1996.[10]
In 1998, the Travelers Group merged with Citicorp to form Citigroup.[9] However, the synergies between the banking and insurance arms of the company did not work as well as planned, so Citigroup spun off Travelers Property and Casualty into a subsidiary company in 2002,[11] although it kept the red umbrella logo. Three years later, Citigroup sold Travelers Life & Annuity to MetLife.[12] In 2003, Travelers bought renewal rights for Royal & SunAlliance Personal Insurance and Commercial businesses.[13][14]
In 2004, the St. Paul and Travelers Companies merged and renamed itself St. Paul Travelers, with the headquarters set in St. Paul, Minnesota.[15] In August of that year, it was charged of misleading statements associated with the merger.[16][17] Despite many assurances from CEO Jay Fishman that the newly formed company would retain the St. Paul name, the corporate name only lasted until 2007, when the company repurchased the rights to the famous red umbrella logo from Citigroup and readopted it as its main corporate symbol, while also changing the corporate name to The Travelers Companies.[18][19][20][21]
Many of Travelers' ancestor companies, such as St. Paul and USF&G, are technically still around today, and still write policies and accept claims in their own names (under the overarching Travelers brand name). As is typical of most insurers in the United States, Travelers never dissolved the various companies it acquired, but simply made them wholly owned subsidiaries and trained its employees to act on behalf of those subsidiaries. This is a common risk management strategy used by U.S. insurance groups. If any one company in the group gets hit with too many claims, the situation can be easily contained to that one company (which is placed in runoff and allowed to run its policies to completion), while the remainder of the group continues to operate normally.
In November 2010, Travelers entered into a joint venture agreement under which the company would invest in J. Malucelli Participações em Seguros e Resseguros S.A., the market leader in the surety insurance business in Brazil. The transaction closed in June 2011 with Travelers acquiring a 43.4 percent interest. Travelers' investment in newly issued shares significantly increased J. Malucelli's capital level, positioning it for substantial growth in Brazil. At the time, Travelers had the option to increase its investment to retain a 49.5 percent interest, which the company later did in 2012.[22]
In June 2013, Travelers announced the acquisition of Dominion of Canada General Insurance Company from E-L Financial Corporation Limited (TSX: ELF).[23] The transaction later closed in November 2013. The combined organization, referred to as Travelers Canada, remains headquartered in Toronto.[24]
The company’s joint venture with J. Malucelli in Brazil completed the acquisition of a majority interest in Cardinal Compañía de Seguros, a Colombian start-up surety provider in September 2015. The business, which is based in Bogotá, operates under the co-branded name J. Malucelli Travelers.[25]
In October 2015, Travelers acquired a majority interest in the property casualty business of its J. Malucelli joint venture in Brazil. J. Malucelli commenced writing property casualty business in 2012.[26] The property casualty business operates under the Travelers brand and focuses on property, general liability, construction and financial insurance products. The business is based in São Paulo.
As a result of the transaction, Travelers now owns 95 percent of the property casualty business with Paraná Banco, the parent company of J. Malucelli, retaining a five percent interest. Travelers’ interest in the surety business of the J. Malucelli joint venture remains at 49.5 percent.[27]
In March 2017, Travelers agreed to acquire UK-based Simply Business from Aquiline Capital Partners for approximately $490 million. Simply Business is a leading U.K. distributor of small business insurance policies, offering products online on behalf of a broad panel of carriers. It has more than 425,000 microbusiness customers covering more than 1,000 classes of business, and was named “Best Company to Work For” by The Sunday Times in 2015 and 2016. The transaction adds to Travelers' digital capabilities.[28][29][30]
Travelers is currently 116 on the Fortune 500[31] list of largest U.S. companies. On June 8, 2009, Travelers replaced its former parent Citigroup on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
On August 4, 2015 the company announced that Alan Schnitzer would succeed Jay Fishman as Chief Executive Officer effective December 1, 2015.[32]
Alleged anticompetitive practices[edit]
In January 2007, Travelers agreed to pay US$77 million to six states to settle a class action suit and end investigations into its insurance practices.[33][34] The charges involved paying the insurance broker Marsh & McLennan Companies contingent commissions to win business without the knowledge of clients, thus creating a conflict of interest.[35] Additionally, the investigation examined whether Travelers had created the illusion of competition by submitting fake bids,[36] thus misleading clients into believing they were receiving competitive commercial premiums.[37]
National Football League lawsuit[edit]
In August 2012, Travelers sued the National Football League for forcing the company and its subsidiaries to pay to defend the league for failing to protect players from brain injury, in a case filed in the New York State Supreme Court called Discover Property & Casualty Co. et al. vs. National Football League et al., New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 652933/2012. The league had sued over three dozen insurance companies the week before in an attempt to cover the claims that players made against the league.[38][39][40]
Advertising[edit]




St. Paul Travelers logo used until February 2007


The original logo of the red umbrella started in 1870 when it appeared in a newspaper ad for the young insurance company. It was revived in the early 1960s, when it was given its signature red color by Harry W. Knettell, then the account executive for The Travelers and Vice President at the Charles Brunelle advertising agency. During the late 1960s Charles Brunelle was the largest advertising agency in Hartford, a city known as "the insurance capital of the world" due to the many insurance companies in that town. The Travelers was one of their many insurance company clients.[41][better source needed]
In 2006, a Travelers commercial titled Snowball was nominated for an Emmy. Snowball featured a man, walking down a steep San Francisco sidewalk, who trips and knocks over a table of items at a garage sale. The man and the items roll down the street, forming a ball which gathers garbage cans, pedestrians, construction materials, motorcycles, light poles, and other items, in a manner very reminiscent of the familiar cartoon "snowball" effect or the cult video game Katamari Damacy.[42] The creators of the ad say it is simply based on the snowball effect, they have never heard of the game, and that the resulting similarity was a surprise to them.[43]
In 2007, the company secured naming rights for an annual event to be called the Travelers Championship golf tournament, formerly the Greater Hartford Open, on the PGA Tour.
In April 2008, The Travelers purchased back the rights to the famous red umbrella, which is featured in several commercials starring Paul Freeman as well as other advertisements. In July 2008, the spot "Delivery," also starring Freeman, was nominated for an Emmy.

The Travelers Companies, Inc. is an American insurance company. It is the second largest writer of U.S. commercial property casualty insurance and the third largest writer of U.S. personal insurance through independent agents. Travelers is incorporated in Minnesota, with headquarters in New York City and its largest office in Hartford, Connecticut. Travelers also maintains a large office in St. Paul, Minnesota.[1] It has been a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average since June 8, 2009.[3]
The company has field offices in every U.S. state, plus operations in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Singapore, China, Canada, and Brazil. In 2014, the company reported revenues of US $27 billion and total assets of US $103 billion.
Travelers, through its subsidiaries and approximately 14,000 independent agents and brokers, provides commercial and personal property and casualty insurance products and services to businesses, government units, associations, and individuals. The company offers insurance through three segments:

Personal Insurance, which includes home, auto and other insurance products for individuals
Business Insurance, which includes a broad array of property and casualty insurance and insurance-related services in the United States
Bond and Specialty Insurance, which includes surety, crime, and financial liability businesses which primarily use credit-based underwriting processes, as well as property and casualty products that are predominantly marketed on an international basis.

History[edit]




Top: The familiar umbrella logo of the Travelers, used until its spinoff from Citigroup. Bottom: The logo that The St. Paul used prior to the merger with Travelers.


The main predecessor companies of The Travelers Companies, Inc. are The St. Paul Companies, Inc. and Travelers Property Casualty Corporation.
Saint Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Co. was founded March 5, 1853, in St. Paul, Minnesota, serving local customers who were having a difficult time getting claim payments in a timely manner from insurance companies on the east coast of the United States. It barely survived the Panic of 1857 by dramatically paring down its operations and later reorganizing itself into a stock company (as opposed to a mutual company). It soon spread its operations across the country. In 1998 it acquired USF&G, known formerly as United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company, an insurance company based in Baltimore, Maryland, for $3.9 billion in stock and assumed debt.[4][5] By buying USF&G, they went from the 13th to the eighth largest property and casualty insurance company in the United States. Through economies of scale between the two companies, and a difficult business environment, they downsized the company substantially over the coming years by selling certain business units to focus on more profitable business units.[6][7]
Travelers was founded in 1864 in Hartford. It was founded to provide travel insurance to railroad travelers at a time when travel was far more risky and dangerous than today, hence the name. Along the way it had many industry firsts, including the first automobile policy, the first commercial airline policy, and the first policy for space travel.[8] By the early 1990s, Travelers was predominantly a general property and casualty insurer that also happened to do some travel insurance on the side, and it quietly exited its original business in 1994. What was left of Travelers' travel insurance business was acquired by three former employees and is now known as Travel Insured International.




The Travelers logo, ca. 1993


In the 1990s, it went through a series of mergers and acquisitions. It was bought by Primerica in 1993,[9] but the resulting company retained the Travelers name. In 1995 it became The Travelers Group.[8] It bought Aetna's property and casualty business in 1996.[10]
In 1998, the Travelers Group merged with Citicorp to form Citigroup.[9] However, the synergies between the banking and insurance arms of the company did not work as well as planned, so Citigroup spun off Travelers Property and Casualty into a subsidiary company in 2002,[11] although it kept the red umbrella logo. Three years later, Citigroup sold Travelers Life & Annuity to MetLife.[12] In 2003, Travelers bought renewal rights for Royal & SunAlliance Personal Insurance and Commercial businesses.[13][14]
In 2004, the St. Paul and Travelers Companies merged and renamed itself St. Paul Travelers, with the headquarters set in St. Paul, Minnesota.[15] In August of that year, it was charged of misleading statements associated with the merger.[16][17] Despite many assurances from CEO Jay Fishman that the newly formed company would retain the St. Paul name, the corporate name only lasted until 2007, when the company repurchased the rights to the famous red umbrella logo from Citigroup and readopted it as its main corporate symbol, while also changing the corporate name to The Travelers Companies.[18][19][20][21]
Many of Travelers' ancestor companies, such as St. Paul and USF&G, are technically still around today, and still write policies and accept claims in their own names (under the overarching Travelers brand name). As is typical of most insurers in the United States, Travelers never dissolved the various companies it acquired, but simply made them wholly owned subsidiaries and trained its employees to act on behalf of those subsidiaries. This is a common risk management strategy used by U.S. insurance groups. If any one company in the group gets hit with too many claims, the situation can be easily contained to that one company (which is placed in runoff and allowed to run its policies to completion), while the remainder of the group continues to operate normally.
In November 2010, Travelers entered into a joint venture agreement under which the company would invest in J. Malucelli Participações em Seguros e Resseguros S.A., the market leader in the surety insurance business in Brazil. The transaction closed in June 2011 with Travelers acquiring a 43.4 percent interest. Travelers' investment in newly issued shares significantly increased J. Malucelli's capital level, positioning it for substantial growth in Brazil. At the time, Travelers had the option to increase its investment to retain a 49.5 percent interest, which the company later did in 2012.[22]
In June 2013, Travelers announced the acquisition of Dominion of Canada General Insurance Company from E-L Financial Corporation Limited (TSX: ELF).[23] The transaction later closed in November 2013. The combined organization, referred to as Travelers Canada, remains headquartered in Toronto.[24]
The company’s joint venture with J. Malucelli in Brazil completed the acquisition of a majority interest in Cardinal Compañía de Seguros, a Colombian start-up surety provider in September 2015. The business, which is based in Bogotá, operates under the co-branded name J. Malucelli Travelers.[25]
In October 2015, Travelers acquired a majority interest in the property casualty business of its J. Malucelli joint venture in Brazil. J. Malucelli commenced writing property casualty business in 2012.[26] The property casualty business operates under the Travelers brand and focuses on property, general liability, construction and financial insurance products. The business is based in São Paulo.
As a result of the transaction, Travelers now owns 95 percent of the property casualty business with Paraná Banco, the parent company of J. Malucelli, retaining a five percent interest. Travelers’ interest in the surety business of the J. Malucelli joint venture remains at 49.5 percent.[27]
In March 2017, Travelers agreed to acquire UK-based Simply Business from Aquiline Capital Partners for approximately $490 million. Simply Business is a leading U.K. distributor of small business insurance policies, offering products online on behalf of a broad panel of carriers. It has more than 425,000 microbusiness customers covering more than 1,000 classes of business, and was named “Best Company to Work For” by The Sunday Times in 2015 and 2016. The transaction adds to Travelers' digital capabilities.[28][29][30]
Travelers is currently 116 on the Fortune 500[31] list of largest U.S. companies. On June 8, 2009, Travelers replaced its former parent Citigroup on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
On August 4, 2015 the company announced that Alan Schnitzer would succeed Jay Fishman as Chief Executive Officer effective December 1, 2015.[32]
Alleged anticompetitive practices[edit]
In January 2007, Travelers agreed to pay US$77 million to six states to settle a class action suit and end investigations into its insurance practices.[33][34] The charges involved paying the insurance broker Marsh & McLennan Companies contingent commissions to win business without the knowledge of clients, thus creating a conflict of interest.[35] Additionally, the investigation examined whether Travelers had created the illusion of competition by submitting fake bids,[36] thus misleading clients into believing they were receiving competitive commercial premiums.[37]
National Football League lawsuit[edit]
In August 2012, Travelers sued the National Football League for forcing the company and its subsidiaries to pay to defend the league for failing to protect players from brain injury, in a case filed in the New York State Supreme Court called Discover Property & Casualty Co. et al. vs. National Football League et al., New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 652933/2012. The league had sued over three dozen insurance companies the week before in an attempt to cover the claims that players made against the league.[38][39][40]
Advertising[edit]




St. Paul Travelers logo used until February 2007


The original logo of the red umbrella started in 1870 when it appeared in a newspaper ad for the young insurance company. It was revived in the early 1960s, when it was given its signature red color by Harry W. Knettell, then the account executive for The Travelers and Vice President at the Charles Brunelle advertising agency. During the late 1960s Charles Brunelle was the largest advertising agency in Hartford, a city known as "the insurance capital of the world" due to the many insurance companies in that town. The Travelers was one of their many insurance company clients.[41][better source needed]
In 2006, a Travelers commercial titled Snowball was nominated for an Emmy. Snowball featured a man, walking down a steep San Francisco sidewalk, who trips and knocks over a table of items at a garage sale. The man and the items roll down the street, forming a ball which gathers garbage cans, pedestrians, construction materials, motorcycles, light poles, and other items, in a manner very reminiscent of the familiar cartoon "snowball" effect or the cult video game Katamari Damacy.[42] The creators of the ad say it is simply based on the snowball effect, they have never heard of the game, and that the resulting similarity was a surprise to them.[43]
In 2007, the company secured naming rights for an annual event to be called the Travelers Championship golf tournament, formerly the Greater Hartford Open, on the PGA Tour.
In April 2008, The Travelers purchased back the rights to the famous red umbrella, which is featured in several commercials starring Paul Freeman as well as other advertisements. In July 2008, the spot "Delivery," also starring Freeman, was nominated for an Emmy.

	AmTrav | Corporate Business Travel Management









How We're Different
AmTrav was built entirely from the ground up 
				 unlike anyone else



















Different is Good
Most business travel agencies are the same and that's a problem for the companies and organizations that hire them.
The issue is that most agencies license the components that make up their service. For example, their online booking tool, agent interfaces and reporting tools are built and maintained by other companies. Some if not all customer support is outsourced too. This lack of control is a problem for customers who require a responsive agency partner.
At AmTrav, we've been building all of our technology in-house for over 20 years. This control enables us to respond quickly to our customers. We can and have been building our service directly for their needs. Not being beholden to third party companies enables us to respond quickly to the needs of our customers. It also gives us the flexibility to hire highly experienced AmTrav agents available 24/7 by phone (with no hold times), email and live chat.
Above is a diagram to help visualize the difference between AmTrav (an agency that develops all of its products and services in-house) and the other guys.


The Results
Owning and maintaining all of our own technology enables us to better manage our customers' travel.





Customizable Tools
Need a tweak to the booking tool or travel policy logic? It's easy because we control the software.







Better Uptime
We never have to wait on a third party vendor to fix a problem. We can do it ourselves.







Human Support
Not paying licensing fees to third parties frees us up to offer top tier real human support.







Responsive
Your feedback combined with our flexibility allows for continuous product improvement.








Let us take away the stress of managing your travel
You’ll have peace of mind knowing we built everything for you

2013 and Earlier:
IT Priorities
• The company has recently signed a $200 million development agreement for a data center build in Springfield, Nebraska. The comapny will also spend $760,000 on infrastructure for 190,000 square-foot site. 
• The company has recently begun a multi-year business intelligence and analytics initiative which will include the development of an analytics and reporting strategy for operations, infrastructure, and architecture systems. 
•  The company is looking into BYOD programs to be deployed within the next year. 
• The company will increase spending on desktop productivity within the next year.  

IT Structure

Though the company's IT staff is distributed across several locations, Travelers Companies' IT department is led from the company's offices in Hartford, CT, where the bulk of the IT staff is also located, as opposed to the corporate headquarters in New York.

IT Intelligence Snippets

2013:
• 1-10 tb data volume company-wide across 2 to 5 data centers, and expects an annual data growth of 6-10%. 
• 75-90% of its servers are to be virtualized by the end of 2013. 
• Corporate IT manages 120 mobile devices. 
• Corporate IT manages 5000 desktops.
• Standardized on 1-2 product vendors with a limited set of hardware. 
• Long term plan for running new applications is to add servers and virtualize, but no new facilities are scheduled.
• Less than 30% of IT staff is dedicated to the sustenance of its ERP platform, and less than 30% of ERP support is outsourced to a third party.
• Its organization-wide data volume is approximately >5 pb and is growing at an annual rate of 20-50%. 
• Its data environment consists of somewhat integrated data (25-50% of data on a single database architecture) that is primarily deployed on-premises in a “roll-your-own” appliance. 
•The company uses Hadoop-based store (e.g. HBase) to store data primarily sourced from enterprise applications, public internet data, and human-generated data/text (such as social media).
   
2011:

• In 2011, engineering staff within the department migrated the core SAS application from an IBM environment to a Red Hat Enterprise Linux platform hosted on HP Proliant servers.
   

The IT budget is typically finalized in Q4.
