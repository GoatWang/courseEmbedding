NEW YORK and GURGAON, India, July 13, 2016 /PRNewswire/ --








Yatra Online, Inc. ("Yatra"), a rapidly growing India-based online travel agent, and Terrapin 3 Acquisition Corporation (NASDAQ:    TRTL; "TRTL"), announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement to combine in a transaction that values Yatra at an enterprise value of $218 million. Yatra is one of the fastest growing consumer travel platforms and online travel agents in India with more than 4 million customers.  TRTL is a special purpose acquisition company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, acquisition, or similar business combination.  Yatra will be the surviving company in the transaction and intends to be listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbol "YTRA" following completion of the transaction. The combined company will continue to be led by Yatra's experienced management team under the leadership of chief executive and co-founder Dhruv Shringi. 
Launched in August 2006, Yatra, through its yatra.com website, is a one-stop online shop for all travel-related services aimed at both leisure and business travelers in India.  A leading consolidator of travel products, Yatra provides reservation connectivity for more than 60,000 hotels in India, a larger network than any other Indian online travel agent. Positioned as a brand that believes in "creating happy travelers," yatra.com provides information, pricing, and booking capability for domestic Indian and international air travel, hotel bookings, holiday packages, and bus and railway reservations, all designed to make business and leisure travel easier and more affordable.  Customers can access yatra.com from their desktop or mobile browsers, via Yatra's mobile applications, a 24x7 multi-language call center, and a countrywide network of Holiday Lounges and Yatra Travel Express store locations. 
Yatra customers booked more than 2.8 million air travel reservations and hotel stays with total transaction value worth more than $900 million (at current exchange rates) during their fiscal year ended March 2016, an increase of 25% from the prior year (at constant currency rates) with 74% of transactions coming from repeat clients who return to book more travel. 
"We are excited to partner with TRTL in a transaction that we believe will enable Yatra to continue its growth as a new public company," said Mr. Shringi. "This transaction gives us substantial additional resources to support our growth and the continued improvement of our integrated online and mobile platforms. We look forward to expanding our already extensive network of domestic and international partnerships with hotels, airlines, car services, and tour package promoters, as well as further strengthening our brand presence and technology platform."
Nathan Leight, Chairman of the board of TRTL, said, "We created TRTL with the express purpose of partnering with a company that would benefit from a public listing, could utilize our cash resources for growth and generate long-term returns for our shareholders.  Yatra has the broadest brand recognition of any online travel agent in India.  The infrastructure required to compete in India as an online travel agent represents a significant barrier to market entry.  With its high level of brand recognition, large hotel network, significant investment in technology, and deep management experience in this sector, we believe Yatra has created tremendous competitive advantages.  Not only is India one of the fastest growing economies in the world, business and leisure travel are among the fastest growing parts of its economy.  Adding to that India's tremendous socio-economic trends toward urbanization and the rapid adoption of e-commerce and smartphone use by a population with increasing amounts of disposable income, we are excited about Yatra's prospects.  We believe our combination will provide substantial new resources to position the company for accelerated future growth."
Yatra's current key investors include leading U.S. and Indian venture capital firms and Indian strategic investors. This group will continue to own approximately a third or more of Yatra upon the consummation of the business combination.
Promod Haque, Senior Managing Partner at Norwest Venture Partners, said, "We are delighted to have TRTL on board in combination with Yatra. This transaction will provide Yatra with significant resources to further strengthen its presence as one of the leading players in the fast growing Indian online travel market. We believe that the online travel market in India has a long runway of future growth with the key drivers of increasing prosperity, smartphone penetration and internet access across broad sections of the population. With its strong brand awareness and robust technology platform, Yatra is perfectly positioned to leverage the additional resources from this transaction to grow the business at an even faster pace going forward."    
Summary of Transaction
TRTL raised $212.75 million in its IPO which is now held in a trust account.  MIHI LLC, an affiliate of Macquarie Capital ("MIHI") has committed to purchase an additional $20 million of TRTL equity as part of the transaction.  Under the terms of the proposed transaction, it is estimated that the current shareholders of Yatra will continue to own at least 35% of the issued and outstanding shares in the combined company.  The first $100 million of cash (including MIHI's $20 million forward purchase) will be allocated entirely to the combined company's balance sheet and to pay transaction expenses.  Any amount greater than $100 million available from TRTL will then be allocated 80% to current Yatra shareholders and 20% as cash to the combined company's balance sheet.  Cash payments to current Yatra shareholders will be capped at $80 million.  
In addition, existing shareholders of Yatra may receive additional consideration of up to $35 million upon the achievement of certain financial objectives during the 18 months after closing.
In order to facilitate the transaction, TRTL's sponsors have agreed to reduce by half the number of founder shares that they would have otherwise had at closing and MIHI has agreed commensurately to reduce the amount of its forward purchase of TRTL shares, made at the time of TRTL's initial public offering, from $40 million to $20 million.
The boards of directors of both TRTL and Yatra have approved the proposed transaction. Completion of the transaction, which is expected in October 2016, is subject to approval by TRTL stockholders and other customary closing conditions.
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. is acting as TRTL's capital markets advisor.  Greenberg Traurig, LLP and Ellenoff Grossman & Schole LLP are representing TRTL. Goodwin Procter LLP is representing Yatra.
The description of the business combination contained herein is only a summary and is qualified in its entirety by the reference to the definitive agreements relating to the transaction, copies of which will be filed by TRTL with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as exhibits to a Current Report on Form 8-K.

Yatra is one of the fastest growing online travel agents serving India, one of the world's fastest growing economies The transaction will provide capital and financial flexibility intended to further accelerate Yatra's growth Investor conference call scheduled for Thursday, July 14, at 10:00 a.m. EDT NEW YORK and GURGAON, India, July 13 and July 14, 2016 -- Yatra Online, Inc. ("Yatra"), a rapidly growing India-based online travel agent, and Terrapin 3 Acquisition Corporation (NASDAQ: TRTL; "TRTL"), announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement to combine in a transaction that values Yatra at an enterprise value of $218 million. Yatra is one of the fastest growing consumer travel platforms and online travel agents in India with more than 4 million customers. TRTL is a special purpose acquisition company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, acquisition, or similar business combination. Yatra will be the surviving company in the transaction and intends to be listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbol "YTRA" following completion of the transaction. The combined company will continue to be led by Yatra's experienced management team under the leadership of chief executive and co-founder Dhruv Shringi. Launched in August 2006, Yatra, through its yatra.com website, is a one-stop online shop for all travel-related services aimed at both leisure and business travelers in India. A leading consolidator of travel products, Yatra provides reservation connectivity for more than 60,000 hotels in India, a larger network than any other Indian online travel agent. Positioned as a brand that believes in "creating happy travelers," yatra.com provides information, pricing, and booking capability for domestic Indian and international air travel, hotel bookings, holiday packages, and bus and railway reservations, all designed to make business and leisure travel easier and more affordable. Customers can access yatra.com from their desktop or mobile browsers, via Yatra's mobile applications, a 24x7 multi-language call center, and a countrywide network of Holiday Lounges and Yatra Travel Express store locations. Yatra customers booked more than 2.8 million air travel reservations and hotel stays with total transaction value worth more than $900 million (at current exchange rates) during their fiscal year ended March 2016, an increase of 25% from the prior year (at constant currency rates) with 74% of transactions coming from repeat clients who return to book more travel. "We are excited to partner with TRTL in a transaction that we believe will enable Yatra to continue its growth as a new public company," said Mr. Shringi. "This transaction gives us substantial additional resources to support our growth and the continued improvement of our integrated online and mobile platforms. We look forward to expanding our already extensive network of domestic and international partnerships with hotels, airlines, car services, and tour package promoters, as well as further strengthening our brand presence and technology platform." Nathan Leight, Chairman of the board of TRTL, said, "We created TRTL with the express purpose of partnering with a company that would benefit from a public listing, could utilize our cash resources for growth and generate long-term returns for our shareholders. Yatra has the broadest brand recognition of any online travel agent in India. The infrastructure required to compete in India as an online travel agent represents a significant barrier to market entry. With its high level of brand recognition, large hotel network, significant investment in technology, and deep management experience in this sector, we believe Yatra has created tremendous competitive advantages. Not only is India one of the fastest growing economies in the world, business and leisure travel are among the fastest growing parts of its economy. Adding to that India's tremendous socio-economic trends toward urbanization and the rapid adoption of e-commerce and smartphone use by a population with increasing amounts of disposable income, we are excited about Yatra's prospects. We believe our combination will provide substantial new resources to position the company for accelerated future growth." Yatra's current key investors include leading U.S. and Indian venture capital firms and Indian strategic investors. This group will continue to own approximately a third or more of Yatra upon the consummation of the business combination. Promod Haque, Senior Managing Partner at Norwest Venture Partners, said, "We are delighted to have TRTL on board in combination with Yatra. This transaction will provide Yatra with significant resources to further strengthen its presence as one of the leading players in the fast growing Indian online travel market. We believe that the online travel market in India has a long runway of future growth with the key drivers of increasing prosperity, smartphone penetration and internet access across broad sections of the population. With its strong brand awareness and robust technology platform, Yatra is perfectly positioned to leverage the additional resources from this transaction to grow the business at an even faster pace going forward." Summary of TransactionTRTL raised $212.75 million in its IPO which is now held in a trust account. MIHI LLC, an affiliate of Macquarie Capital ("MIHI") has committed to purchase an additional $20 million of TRTL equity as part of the transaction. Under the terms of the proposed transaction, it is estimated that the current shareholders of Yatra will continue to own at least 35% of the issued and outstanding shares in the combined company. The first $100 million of cash (including MIHI's $20 million forward purchase) will be allocated entirely to the combined company's balance sheet and to pay transaction expenses. Any amount greater than $100 million available from TRTL will then be allocated 80% to current Yatra shareholders and 20% as cash to the combined company's balance sheet. Cash payments to current Yatra shareholders will be capped at $80 million. In addition, existing shareholders of Yatra may receive additional consideration of up to $35 million upon the achievement of certain financial objectives during the 18 months after closing. In order to facilitate the transaction, TRTL's sponsors have agreed to reduce by half the number of founder shares that they would have otherwise had at closing and MIHI has agreed commensurately to reduce the amount of its forward purchase of TRTL shares, made at the time of TRTL's initial public offering, from $40 million to $20 million. The boards of directors of both TRTL and Yatra have approved the proposed transaction. Completion of the transaction, which is expected in October 2016, is subject to approval by TRTL stockholders and other customary closing conditions.

Terrapin 3 Acquisition Corporation Announces Business Combination with Yatra Online, Inc.

Yatra is one of the fastest growing online travel agents serving India, one of the world's fastest growing economies
The transaction will provide capital and financial flexibility intended to further accelerate Yatra's growth
Investor conference call scheduled for Thursday, July 14, at 10:00 a.m. EDT




Jul 13, 2016, 8:45pm EDT














NEW YORK and GURGAON, India, July 13, 2016 /PRNewswire/ --
Yatra Online, Inc. ("Yatra"), a rapidly growing India-based online travel agent, and Terrapin 3 Acquisition Corporation (NASDAQ: TRTL; "TRTL"), announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement to combine in a transaction that values Yatra at an enterprise value of $218 million. Yatra is one of the fastest growing consumer travel platforms and online travel agents in India with more than 4 million customers.  TRTL is a special purpose acquisition company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, acquisition, or similar business combination.  Yatra will be the surviving company in the transaction and intends to be listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbol "YTRA" following completion of the transaction. The combined company will continue to be led by Yatra's experienced management team under the leadership of chief executive and co-founder Dhruv Shringi. 
Launched in August 2006, Yatra, through its yatra.com website, is a one-stop online shop for all travel-related services aimed at both leisure and business travelers in India.  A leading consolidator of travel products, Yatra provides reservation connectivity for more than 60,000 hotels in India, a larger network than any other Indian online travel agent. Positioned as a brand that believes in "creating happy travelers," yatra.com provides information, pricing, and booking capability for domestic Indian and international air travel, hotel bookings, holiday packages, and bus and railway reservations, all designed to make business and leisure travel easier and more affordable.  Customers can access yatra.com from their desktop or mobile browsers, via Yatra's mobile applications, a 24x7 multi-language call center, and a countrywide network of Holiday Lounges and Yatra Travel Express store locations. 
Yatra customers booked more than 2.8 million air travel reservations and hotel stays with total transaction value worth more than $900 million (at current exchange rates) during their fiscal year ended March 2016, an increase of 25% from the prior year (at constant currency rates) with 74% of transactions coming from repeat clients who return to book more travel. 
"We are excited to partner with TRTL in a transaction that we believe will enable Yatra to continue its growth as a new public company," said Mr. Shringi. "This transaction gives us substantial additional resources to support our growth and the continued improvement of our integrated online and mobile platforms. We look forward to expanding our already extensive network of domestic and international partnerships with hotels, airlines, car services, and tour package promoters, as well as further strengthening our brand presence and technology platform."
Nathan Leight, Chairman of the board of TRTL, said, "We created TRTL with the express purpose of partnering with a company that would benefit from a public listing, could utilize our cash resources for growth and generate long-term returns for our shareholders.  Yatra has the broadest brand recognition of any online travel agent in India.  The infrastructure required to compete in India as an online travel agent represents a significant barrier to market entry.  With its high level of brand recognition, large hotel network, significant investment in technology, and deep management experience in this sector, we believe Yatra has created tremendous competitive advantages.  Not only is India one of the fastest growing economies in the world, business and leisure travel are among the fastest growing parts of its economy.  Adding to that India's tremendous socio-economic trends toward urbanization and the rapid adoption of e-commerce and smartphone use by a population with increasing amounts of disposable income, we are excited about Yatra's prospects.  We believe our combination will provide substantial new resources to position the company for accelerated future growth."
Yatra's current key investors include leading U.S. and Indian venture capital firms and Indian strategic investors. This group will continue to own approximately a third or more of Yatra upon the consummation of the business combination.
Promod Haque, Senior Managing Partner at Norwest Venture Partners, said, "We are delighted to have TRTL on board in combination with Yatra. This transaction will provide Yatra with significant resources to further strengthen its presence as one of the leading players in the fast growing Indian online travel market. We believe that the online travel market in India has a long runway of future growth with the key drivers of increasing prosperity, smartphone penetration and internet access across broad sections of the population. With its strong brand awareness and robust technology platform, Yatra is perfectly positioned to leverage the additional resources from this transaction to grow the business at an even faster pace going forward."    
Summary of Transaction
TRTL raised $212.75 million in its IPO which is now held in a trust account.  MIHI LLC, an affiliate of Macquarie Capital ("MIHI") has committed to purchase an additional $20 million of TRTL equity as part of the transaction.  Under the terms of the proposed transaction, it is estimated that the current shareholders of Yatra will continue to own at least 35% of the issued and outstanding shares in the combined company.  The first $100 million of cash (including MIHI's $20 million forward purchase) will be allocated entirely to the combined company's balance sheet and to pay transaction expenses.  Any amount greater than $100 million available from TRTL will then be allocated 80% to current Yatra shareholders and 20% as cash to the combined company's balance sheet.  Cash payments to current Yatra shareholders will be capped at $80 million.  
In addition, existing shareholders of Yatra may receive additional consideration of up to $35 million upon the achievement of certain financial objectives during the 18 months after closing.
In order to facilitate the transaction, TRTL's sponsors have agreed to reduce by half the number of founder shares that they would have otherwise had at closing and MIHI has agreed commensurately to reduce the amount of its forward purchase of TRTL shares, made at the time of TRTL's initial public offering, from $40 million to $20 million.
The boards of directors of both TRTL and Yatra have approved the proposed transaction. Completion of the transaction, which is expected in October 2016, is subject to approval by TRTL stockholders and other customary closing conditions.

NEW YORK and GURGAON, India, Dec. 16, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Terrapin 3 Acquisition Corporation (NASDAQ:   TRTL, TRTLU, TRTLW, "TRTL") today announced that it completed its business combination with Yatra Online, Inc. ("Yatra"), a rapidly growing, India-based online travel agent.  The transaction was unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies and was approved by a vote of TRTL's shareholders on December 12, 2016.  With the closing of the transaction, TRTL has become a partially owned subsidiary of Yatra and all shares of TRTL Class A Common Stock will be automatically exchanged for Yatra's ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis and all warrants to purchase shares of TRTL Class A Common Stock will automatically become warrants to purchase Yatra's ordinary shares on the same terms.

Dhruv Shringi, Yatra's co-founder and chief executive officer, said, "It's a matter of great pride for us to be one of the few Indian companies to be listed on NASDAQ. Over the course of the past decade, Yatra has established itself as one of the leading brands and companies in the Indian Internet and e-commerce space. We are thankful to our shareholders, customers and patrons for supporting us and helping us achieve this milestone. The additional capital raised through this transaction will be used by us to further accelerate our growth, invest in mobile technology, and expand our multi-channel distribution network. With a well-established brand, a large and loyal customer base, and a strong balance sheet, we are a strong force to be reckoned with in the Indian travel market." 
Nathan Leight, chairman of Terrapin 3 Acquisition Corporation, said, "We are truly delighted to align our shareholders' interests with Yatra's accomplished team of management and distinguished venture and strategic investors.  Dhruv Shringi and his team founded and created a company that millions of customers trust and return to for a wide range of travel services and experiences.  We believe Yatra is uniquely positioned to benefit from the continued vibrant expansion of India, the world's fastest growing major economy, and the rapid adoption of e-commerce and mobile technology by India's flourishing consumer class."
Yatra received approximately $93 million in cash in connection with the business combination and related transactions.

Transaction Criteria

Unique solutions for companies and investors…
What is in it for a Business?
Terrapin 3 is more than just a purchaser of good businesses for cash. We offer great flexibility in what we acquire and how we structure the transaction. We can either buy the business with cash or issue stock. The seller can divest completely or partially and may retain control in the newly public company. This flexibility provides sellers the opportunity to go public without the pitfalls of the IPO process, such as market timing risk or the need to be in “fashionable” sectors. Most importantly, by merging with a SPAC like Terrapin 3, a seller knows up-front what “price” they will receive — as opposed to being subjected to the uncertainties of the IPO market and underwriter decisions at the time of the offering.

Terrapin 3 is a solution that can create liquidity and infuse capital
Terrain 3 has $213 million in trust in addition to $40 million committed from our Macquarie co-sponsor.  Therefore, there is up to $253 million available for a transaction (though we may also raise additional capital from our existing or new investors)  – and there is up to $122 million of additional capital available if and when investors exercise warrants to purchase TRTL shares at $11.50 per share.
Terrapin 3 capital may be used to:

Access liquidity and growth capital, reduce debt
Monetize current owners’ stake
Bridge valuation gaps from short-term events
Enable merger of two companies while going public
Sell a non-traditional story to public market investors
Certainty of minimum funding to close transaction from Macquarie component
Retain and provide future incentive to management
Create equity “currency” for future acquisitions


Broad range of potential targets
Terrapin 3 can provide solutions for a range of businesses and shareholders.
Enterprise value:  $200 million to $1.25 billion or greater
Location:  US or international
Current equity ownership type: Private company or public company in need of restructuring
Corporate status:  Standalone company or division of larger entity
Acquisition currency: Cash, public stock, preferred shares, debt
Post-transaction ownership by existing shareholders: Preferably 20% or more (including retaining control)
Sector / company:  Any, subject to certain priorities:

Solid management team in place
Long-term growth story, organic or acquisition
Some or complete public reporting infrastructure
Limited fundamental regulatory risk (e.g. not subject to FDA approval)
Not based on fad or transient trend
