CombiMatrix Corp. (NASDAQ: CBMX)[2] CombiMatrix is a clinical diagnostic laboratory specializing in pre-implantation genetic screening, miscarriage analysis, prenatal and pediatric diagnostics, offering DNA-based testing for the detection of genetic abnormalities beyond what can be identified through traditional methodologies. As a full-scale cytogenetic and cytogenomic laboratory, CombiMatrix performs genetic testing utilizing a variety of advanced cytogenomic techniques, including chromosomal microarray analysis, standardized and customized fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and high-resolution karyotyping.[3] CombiMatrix is dedicated to providing high-level clinical support for healthcare professionals in order to help them incorporate the results of complex genetic testing into patient-centered medical decision making.
In 2012 CombiMatrix shifted its focus from providing oncology genetic testing to developmental testing. Their focus is cytogenomic miscarriage analysis, prenatal analysis and postnatal/pediatric analysis.[4][5]

CombiSNP Array[edit]
CombiMatrix uses the CombiSNP Array as their technology platform. SNP stands for Single nucleotide polymorphism probes. These probes allow for increased precision and greater diagnostic yield. This array contains more than 845,000 SNP markers covering both coding and non-coding human genome sequences. The median spatial resolution between probes is 1 Kb within gene rich regions and 5 Kb outside of gene-rich regions.[6]

CombiMatrix Corp. (NASDAQ: CBMX)[2] CombiMatrix is a clinical diagnostic laboratory specializing in pre-implantation genetic screening, miscarriage analysis, prenatal and pediatric diagnostics, offering DNA-based testing for the detection of genetic abnormalities beyond what can be identified through traditional methodologies. As a full-scale cytogenetic and cytogenomic laboratory, CombiMatrix performs genetic testing utilizing a variety of advanced cytogenomic techniques, including chromosomal microarray analysis, standardized and customized fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and high-resolution karyotyping.[3] CombiMatrix is dedicated to providing high-level clinical support for healthcare professionals in order to help them incorporate the results of complex genetic testing into patient-centered medical decision making.
In 2012 CombiMatrix shifted its focus from providing oncology genetic testing to developmental testing. Their focus is cytogenomic miscarriage analysis, prenatal analysis and postnatal/pediatric analysis.[4][5]

CombiSNP Array[edit]
CombiMatrix uses the CombiSNP Array as their technology platform. SNP stands for Single nucleotide polymorphism probes. These probes allow for increased precision and greater diagnostic yield. This array contains more than 845,000 SNP markers covering both coding and non-coding human genome sequences. The median spatial resolution between probes is 1 Kb within gene rich regions and 5 Kb outside of gene-rich regions.[6]

Looks like they'll do $4.0M in 2017 - that's a 30% increase which is what they have been doing for a while.But gross profit was 54% last year.  They are running closer to 60% this year.  That will make a big difference.They lost $1.24M last year.  Running the figures for 2017, I see where they will lose $350K this year or roughly 12 cents/share.Anyone else got figures?MoreReplyReplies (2)01BBrianBlowout!!! Beat by .07 and beat on revenues! This is finally going to return to above $10 where I will at least break even! Then I'll hold for profits. Very glad us long suffering longs are about to see vindication!

Albeit, CBMX has had about 3 Reverse Splits, so not a lot of confidence there... Is this the turning point with a loss under $500K vs. over $1.5 million last year... Cash Flow positive goal in Q4 2017???????? Only 2.9 million shares outstanding... Roll the dice here????????????????????ReplyReplies (4)14LListener2307Earning release May 4.I'm looking for $3.85M in revenue; $4.1 in total expenses for a loss of 250K.  With 2.5M shares outstanding, that would be a loss of 10 cents per share.I would sure love to see more revenue, though, which of course would mean more of everything else but loss.ReplyReplies (2)11SSamWhat would y'all say to someone who currently holds CBMX currently. Sell?

So the unit volume growth you're looking at is not apples to apples. Unit growth is actually much higher than they're reporting because prior year includes SQNM business.Also, anyone can do testing. Anyone can do banking. Anyone can do security software. Anyone can do homes. I can name plenty of smaller players in those industries executing extremely well against BAC, TOL, etc.ReplyReplies (2)10ppersistentoneIs any part of the company's microarray technology proprietary?   What prevents any test lab from buying microarray technology and competing directly against CBMX at a lower price?ReplyReplies (10)21ppersistentoneDid anyone else notice page 22 of the 10K, which reports about the Series F warrants?   If I am reading this correctly, the Series F warrants contain provisions that dilute out common shareholders in the event of a buyout.   Common shareholders will in effect only receive 70% of the consideration in the event of a takeover offer.This alone may explain why the stock has been undervalued here.ReplyReplies (3)11GGreatDayIsBack2017Keep kicking the tires here! Hard to get my arms around the upside potential... One negative is the most recent Reverse Split, which spells concern about the management ability to execute... Albeit, small market cap, many here in S. California could right a check for the current market cap... Another negative is NO reputable analyst coverage....ReplyReplies (3)03Show MoreSean Hannity responds to claim he ran up a $42,000 tab at Trump's hotel after flying in a 70-year-old lobster from MaineBusiness InsiderSolar Eclipse 2017: Stay in the Tualatin ValleyThe Tualatin ValleySponsoredTrump’s unwitting legacy could be universal health coverageYahoo FinanceYahoo Small BusinessData DisclaimerHelpSuggestionsPrivacyAbout Our AdsTerms (Updated)
