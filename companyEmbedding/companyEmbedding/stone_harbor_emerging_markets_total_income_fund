Important Disclosure

Unless otherwise stated, portfolio facts and statistics are shown for Class A shares; other classes may have different characteristics.

†NAV: Unless you are eligible for a waiver, the public offering price you pay when you buy Class A shares of the Fund is the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the shares plus an initial sales charge. The initial sales charge varies depending upon the size of your purchase.  No sales charge is imposed where Class A or Class C shares are issued to you pursuant to the automatic investment of income dividends or capital gains distributions. It is the responsibility of the financial intermediary to ensure that the investor obtains the proper “breakpoint” discount. Class C, Class I and Class Y do not have an initial sales charge; however, Class C does charge a contingent deferred redemption charge.  See the 
        
    prospectus and summary prospectus for more information.
1Van Eck Associates Corporation (the “Adviser”) has agreed to waive fees and/or pay Fund expenses to the extent necessary to prevent the operating expenses of the Fund (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, interest expense, trading expenses, dividends and interest payments on securities sold short, taxes and extraordinary expenses) from exceeding 1.60% for Class A, 2.50% for Class C, 1.00% for Class I, and 1.10% for Class Y of the Fund’s average daily net assets per year until May 1, 2018. During such time, the
        expense limitation is expected to continue until the Board of Trustees acts to discontinue all or a portion of such expense limitation.

2The Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) Emerging Markets Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization index that is designed to measure equity market performance of emerging markets. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index consists of the following 23 emerging market country indices: Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Czech Republic, Egypt, Greece, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Qatar, Russia, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey and United Arab Emirates.
        The MSCI Emerging Markets Investment Market Index (MSCI EM IMI) is a free float adjusted market capitalization index that is designed to capture large-, mid- and small-cap representation across 23 emerging markets countries. Emerging Markets countries include: Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Czech Republic, Egypt, Greece, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Russia, Qatar, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey and United Arab Emirates.
The views and opinions expressed are those of VanEck. Fund manager commentaries are general in nature and should not be construed as investment advice. Opinions are subject to change with market conditions. Any discussion of specific securities mentioned in the commentaries is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation to buy these securities. Fund holdings will vary.
You can lose money by investing in the Fund. Any investment in the Fund should be part of an overall investment program, not a complete program. The Fund is subject to the risks associated with its investments in emerging markets securities, which tend to be more volatile and less liquid than securities traded in developed countries. The Fund’s investments in foreign securities involve risks related to adverse political and economic developments unique to a country or a region, currency fluctuations or controls, and the possibility of arbitrary action by foreign governments, including the takeover of property without adequate compensation or imposition of prohibitive taxation. The Fund is subject to risks associated with investments in debt securities, derivatives, commodity-linked instruments, illiquid securities, asset-backed securities, CMOs and small or mid-cap companies. The Fund is also subject to inflation risk, short-sales risk, market risk, non-diversification risk and leverage risk. Please see the 
        
    prospectus and summary prospectus for information on these and other risk considerations.
Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal. An investor should consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the investment company carefully before investing. The prospectus and summary prospectus contain this and other information.  Please read them carefully before investing.

Important Disclosure

Unless otherwise stated, portfolio facts and statistics are shown for Class A shares; other classes may have different characteristics.

†NAV: Unless you are eligible for a waiver, the public offering price you pay when you buy Class A shares of the Fund is the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the shares plus an initial sales charge. The initial sales charge varies depending upon the size of your purchase.  No sales charge is imposed where Class A or Class C shares are issued to you pursuant to the automatic investment of income dividends or capital gains distributions. It is the responsibility of the financial intermediary to ensure that the investor obtains the proper “breakpoint” discount. Class C, Class I and Class Y do not have an initial sales charge; however, Class C does charge a contingent deferred redemption charge.  See the 
        
    prospectus and summary prospectus for more information.
1Van Eck Associates Corporation (the “Adviser”) has agreed to waive fees and/or pay Fund expenses to the extent necessary to prevent the operating expenses of the Fund (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, interest expense, trading expenses, dividends and interest payments on securities sold short, taxes and extraordinary expenses) from exceeding 1.60% for Class A, 2.50% for Class C, 1.00% for Class I, and 1.10% for Class Y of the Fund’s average daily net assets per year until May 1, 2018. During such time, the
        expense limitation is expected to continue until the Board of Trustees acts to discontinue all or a portion of such expense limitation.

You can lose money by investing in the Fund. Any investment in the Fund should be part of an overall investment program, not a complete program. The Fund is subject to the risks associated with its investments in emerging markets securities, which tend to be more volatile and less liquid than securities traded in developed countries. The Fund’s investments in foreign securities involve risks related to adverse political and economic developments unique to a country or a region, currency fluctuations or controls, and the possibility of arbitrary action by foreign governments, including the takeover of property without adequate compensation or imposition of prohibitive taxation. The Fund is subject to risks associated with investments in debt securities, derivatives, commodity-linked instruments, illiquid securities, asset-backed securities, CMOs and small or mid-cap companies. The Fund is also subject to inflation risk, short-sales risk, market risk, non-diversification risk and leverage risk. Please see the 
        
    prospectus and summary prospectus for information on these and other risk considerations.
Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal. An investor should consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the investment company carefully before investing.

Stone Harbor Emerging Markets Income Fund




Notification of Sources of Distribution


Statement Pursuant to Section 19(a) of the Investment Company Act 
      of 1940








July 27, 2017 04:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--On July 27, 2017, the Stone Harbor Emerging Markets Income Fund (NYSE: 
      EDF) (the “Fund”), a closed-end fund, will pay a monthly distribution on 
      its common stock of $0.18 per share to shareholders of record at the 
      close of business on July 17, 2017. The Fund, acting in accordance with 
      an exemptive order received from the Securities and Exchange Commission 
      and with approval of its Board of Trustees, adopted a managed 
      distribution policy under which the Fund may utilize capital gains, 
      where applicable, as part of regular monthly cash distributions to its 
      shareholders. This policy gives the Fund greater flexibility to realize 
      capital gains and to distribute those gains to shareholders.
    

      The following table sets forth the estimated amounts of the current 
      distribution and the cumulative distributions paid this fiscal 
      year-to-date from the sources indicated in the table. In addition, the 
      table shows the percentages of the total distribution amount per share 
      attributable to (i) net investment income, (ii) net realized short-term 
      capital gain, (iii) net realized long-term capital gain and (iv) return 
      of capital or other capital source. These percentages are disclosed for 
      the current distribution as well as the fiscal year-to-date cumulative 
      distribution amount per share for the Fund.

1 The Fund’s fiscal year is December 1 to November 30. 
      Information shown is for the period beginning December 1, 2016.
    

Shareholders should not draw any conclusions about the Fund’s 
      investment performance from the amount of this distribution or from the 
      terms of the Fund’s managed distribution policy.


The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and 
      net realized capital gains, therefore, a portion of your distribution 
      may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for 
      example, when some or all of the money that you invested in the Fund is 
      paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not 
      necessarily reflect the Fund’s investment performance and should not be 
      confused with ‘yield’ or ‘income’.


The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this 19(a) 
      Notice are only estimates, may change over time and are not being 
      provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and 
      sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the 
      Fund’s investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and 
      may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send 
      you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to 
      report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.


      Presented below are return figures, based on the change in the Fund’s 
      Net Asset Value per share (“NAV”), compared to the annualized 
      distribution rate for this current distribution as a percentage of the 
      NAV on the last day of the month prior to distribution declaration date.

      ^ Based on the Fund’s NAV as of June 30, 2017 and the July 27, 2017 
      distribution.
    

      * Based on the Fund’s NAV as of June 30, 2017 and includes distributions 
      through July 27, 2017.
    

      ** Cumulative Total Return is the percentage change in the Fund’s NAV 
      including distributions paid and assuming reinvestment of these 
      distributions for the period December 1, 2016 through June 30, 2017.
    

      *** Average Annual Total Return represents the compound average of the 
      Annual NAV Total Returns of the Fund for the five year period ending 
      June 30, 2017. Annual NAV Total Return is the percentage change in the 
      Fund’s NAV over a year including distributions paid and assuming 
      reinvestment of these distributions.
    

      While the NAV performance may be indicative of the Fund’s investment 
      performance, it does not measure the value of a shareholder’s investment 
      in the Fund. The value of a shareholder’s investment in the Fund is 
      determined by the Fund’s market price, which is based on the supply and 
      demand for the Fund’s shares in the open market.
    

      The Fund’s Board of Trustees reviews the amount of any distributions 
      made pursuant to the Fund’s distribution policy and considers the income 
      earned and capital gain realized by the Fund, as well as the Fund’s 
      available capital. The Board of Trustees will continue to monitor the 
      Fund’s distribution level, taking into consideration, among other 
      things, the Fund’s net asset value and market conditions. The Fund’s 
      distribution policy is subject to modification, suspension or 
      termination by the Board of Trustees at any time, which could have an 
      adverse effect on the market price of the Fund’s shares. The 
      distribution rate should not be considered the dividend yield or total 
      return on an investment in the Fund.

Stone Harbor Emerging Markets Total Income Fund | EDI






EDI's Objective?
The Fund's investment objective is to maximize total return, which consists of income and capital appreciation from investments in emerging markets securities. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. The Fund normally will invest at least 80% of its net assets (plus borrowings for investment purposes) in Emerging Markets Debt. "Emerging Markets Debt" includes fixed income securities and other instruments (including derivatives) that are economically tied to emerging market countries, that are denominated in the predominant currency of the local market of an emerging market country or whose performance is linked or otherwise related to those countries' markets, currencies, economies or ability to repay loans. The Fund normally expects to invest up to 20% of its total assets in Emerging Markets Equity. "Emerging Markets Equity" includes securities issued by either single country or regional exchange-traded funds ("ETFs"), common stocks, preferred stocks, other equity securities and other instruments (including derivatives) that are economically tied to the equity markets of emerging market countries, 
that are denominated in the predominant currency of the local market of an emerging market country or whose performance is linked or otherwise related to those countries' markets, currencies, or economies. The Investment Manager does not have an established performance record investing in equity securities.
Structure

Managed portfolio of emerging markets debt combined with an ability to invest in emerging markets equity, structured to maximize total return

Benefits

Attractive income and total return potential versus traditional single sector emerging markets debt and equity portfolios
Ability to allocate tactically to emerging markets equity to take advantage of opportunities
Potential for low correlation with traditional fixed income portfolios
Potentially competitive risk/return portfolio profile versus many other types of fixed income portfolios

Investing in the Fund involves risks, including the risk that you may receive little or no return on your investment or that you may lose part or even all of your investment.

 Stone Harbor Emerging Markets Income Fund | EDF






EDF's Objective?
The Fund's primary investment objective is to maximize total return, which consists of income on its investments and capital appreciation. The Fund will normally invest at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings made for investment purposes) in Emerging Markets Securities. "Emerging Markets Securities" include fixed income securities and other instruments (including derivatives) that are economically tied to emerging market countries, that are denominated in the predominant currency of the local market of an emerging market country or whose performance is linked to those countries' markets, currencies, economies or ability to repay loans. A security or instrument is economically tied to an emerging market country if it is principally traded on the country's securities markets or if the issuer is organized or principally operates in the country, derives a majority of its income from its operations within the country or has a majority of its assets within the country. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective.
Structure

Managed portfolio of emerging markets fixed income securities
Structured to maximize total return and high current income
Flexible asset allocation

Benefits

Enhanced return potential versus traditional single sector emerging markets debt portfolios
Attractive total return and income potential with the possibility to diversify versus U.S. Dollar denominated assets

Stone Harbor Emerging Markets Total Income Fund






Business Wire




Jun 29, 2017 4:00 PM EDT













 




























































  On June 29, 2017, the Stone Harbor Emerging Markets Total Income Fund (NYSE: EDI) (the "Fund"), a closed-end fund, will pay a monthly distribution on its common stock of $0.1511 per share to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 19, 2017. The Fund, acting in accordance with an exemptive order received from the Securities and Exchange Commission and with approval of its Board of Trustees, adopted a managed distribution policy under which the Fund may utilize capital gains, where applicable, as part of regular monthly cash distributions to its shareholders. This policy gives the Fund greater flexibility to realize capital gains and to distribute those gains to shareholders.  The following table sets forth the estimated amounts of the current distribution and the cumulative distributions paid this fiscal year-to-date from the sources indicated in the table. In addition, the table shows the percentages of the total distribution amount per share attributable to (i) net investment income, (ii) net realized short-term capital gain, (iii) net realized long-term capital gain and (iv) return of capital or other capital source. These percentages are disclosed for the current distribution as well as the fiscal year-to-date cumulative distribution amount per share for the Fund.                             Current Distribution from:                       Per Share ($)     %       Net Investment Income     0.1303     86.23%       Net Realized Short-Term Capital Gains     0.0000     0.00%       Net Realized Long-Term Capital Gains     0.0000     0.00%       Return of Capital or other Capital Source     0.0208     13.77%       Total (per common share)     0.1511     100.00%                       Fiscal Year-to-Date Cumulative                Distributions from  1  :                   Per Share ($)     %       Net Investment Income     0.7413     70.09%       Net Realized Short-Term Capital Gains     0.0000     0.00%       Net Realized Long-Term Capital Gains     0.0000     0.00%       Return of Capital or other Capital Source     0.3164     29.91%       Total (per common share)       1.0577       100.00%        ________________________________________  1 The Fund's fiscal year is December 1 to November 30. Information shown is for the period beginning December 1, 2016.  Shareholders should not draw any conclusions about the Fund's investment performance from the amount of this distribution or from the terms of the Fund's managed distribution policy.  The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains, therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with 'yield' or 'income'.  The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this 19(a) Notice are only estimates, may change over time and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.  Presented below are return figures, based on the change in the Fund's Net Asset Value per share ("NAV"), compared to the annualized distribution rate for this current distribution as a percentage of the NAV on the last day of the month prior to distribution declaration date.

Disclosure
Investing in the Fund involves risks, including the risk that you may receive little or no return on your investment or that you may lose part or even all of your investment. Therefore, before investing you should consider carefully the following risks that you assume when you invest in the Fund's Common Shares. See the section entitled "Principal Risk Factors" for a more complete discussion of the risks of investing in the Fund's Common Shares.
Non-Diversified Status
As a non-diversified investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act") the Fund is not limited in the proportion of its assets that may be invested in securities of a single issuer, and accordingly, the Fund may invest a greater portion of its assets in a more limited number of issuers than a diversified fund. Because the Fund, as a non-diversified investment company, may invest in a smaller number of individual issuers than a diversified investment company, an investment in the Fund may, under certain circumstances, present greater risk to an investor than an investment in a diversified investment company because changes in the financial condition or market assessment of a single issuer may cause greater fluctuations in the Fund's NAV. Notwithstanding its status as a non-diversified investment company, the Fund intends to conduct its operations so as to meet the diversification requirements for qualification as a "regulated investment company," which generally will relieve the Fund of any liability for U.S. federal income tax to the extent its earnings are timely distributed to shareholders. See "U.S. Federal Income Tax Matters." 
No Operating History
The Fund is a newly organized, non-diversified, closed-end investment company with no history of operations and is subject to all of the business risks and uncertainties associated with any new business. An investment in the Fund's Common Shares is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of the entire amount that you invest. See also "-Investment and Market Risk."
Management Risk
The Fund's ability to identify and invest in attractive opportunities is dependent upon the Investment Manager. If one or more key individuals leave the Investment Manager, it may not be able to hire qualified replacements, or may require an extended time to do so, which may adversely affect the Fund's ability to achieve its investment objective. Thomas Brock, the Investment Manager's Chief Executive Officer, will retire on December 31, 2012. Mr. Brock does not serve as a portfolio manager of the Fund. Upon his retirement, his duties with the Investment Manager will be assumed by an executive management committee. Although the Investment Manager is the adviser to several registered open-end funds, the Fund is one of the first closed-end funds to be managed by the Investment Manager. In addition, the Investment Manager does not have an established performance record investing in equity securities. As with any managed fund, the Investment Manager may not be successful in selecting the best-performing securities, leverage strategy or investment techniques, and the Fund's performance may lag behind that of similar funds as a result.
Asset Allocation Risk
The Fund's investment performance depends, in part, upon how its assets are allocated and reallocated by the Investment Manager. The investment performance of the Fund may be adversely affected if the Investment Manager allocates a significant portion of the Fund's assets to a country, industry or sector, asset class or subset of an asset class that performs poorly, including relative to other asset classes or subsets of asset classes. In addition, the Investment Manager's assessment of the relative value of a particular country, industry or sector, asset class or subset of an asset class may prove incorrect, resulting in the Fund's experiencing losses or poor performance.
Investment and Market Risk
An investment in Common Shares is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of the entire principal amount invested. An investment in Common Shares represents an indirect investment in the securities and other financial assets owned by the Fund. Securities held by the Fund are generally traded in over-the-counter markets. The value of these securities and financial assets, like other market investments, may move up or down, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably. The Common Shares at any point in time may be worth less than their original cost, even after taking into account any reinvestment of dividends and distributions. 	Further, the value of securities held by the Fund may decline in value due to factors affecting securities markets generally or particular industries.
Investments in Foreign Securities
Investing in foreign securities or issuers with significant exposure to foreign markets involves certain special considerations that are not typically associated with investments in the securities of U.S. issuers. Foreign issuers are not generally subject to uniform accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards and may have policies that are not comparable to those of domestic issuers. As a result, there may be less information available about foreign issuers than about domestic issuers. Securities of some foreign issuers may be less liquid and more volatile than securities of comparable domestic issuers. There is generally less government supervision and regulation of securities markets, brokers and issuers in non-U.S. countries than in the United States. In addition, with respect to certain foreign countries, there is a possibility of expropriation or confiscatory taxation, political, social and/or financial instability, or adverse diplomatic developments, which could adversely affect the value of investments in those countries. The costs of investing in foreign countries frequently are higher than the costs of investing in the United States. Although the Investment Manager endeavors to achieve the most favorable execution costs in portfolio transactions, trading costs in non-U.S. securities markets are generally higher than trading costs in the United States.
Investments in securities of foreign issuers often will be denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, the value of the Fund's assets, as measured in U.S. dollars, may be affected favorably or unfavorably by changes in currency exchange rates and in exchange control regulations. The Fund may incur costs in connection with conversions between various currencies. See "-Foreign Currency Risk."
Certain foreign governments levy withholding or other taxes on dividend and interest income or on the sale or other disposition of foreign securities. Although in some countries a portion of these taxes are recoverable, the non-recovered portion of foreign withholding taxes will reduce the income received from investments in such countries.
From time to time, the Fund may invest in certain sovereign debt obligations that are issued by, or in certain companies that operate in or have dealings with, countries that thereafter become subject to sanctions or embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and the United Nations and/or that the U.S. government identifies as state sponsors of terrorism. Investments in such countries or companies may be adversely affected because, for example, the credit rating of the sovereign debt security may be lowered due to the country's instability or unreliability or the company may suffer damage to its reputation if it is identified as a company which operates in, or has dealings with, such countries. As an investor in such companies, the Fund will be indirectly subject to those risks and may be required to dispose of such investments at a time when it may not be advantageous to do so.

Investments in Emerging Market Countries
Investing in the securities of issuers located in emerging market countries involves special considerations not typically associated with investing in the securities of other foreign or U.S. issuers, including heightened risks of expropriation and/or nationalization, armed conflict, confiscatory taxation, restrictions on transfers of assets, lack of uniform accounting and auditing standards, less publicly available financial and other information and potential difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations.
The economies of individual emerging market countries may differ favorably or unfavorably from the U.S. economy in such respects as growth of gross domestic product, rate of inflation, currency depreciation, capital reinvestment, resource self-sufficiency and balance of payments position. Governments of many emerging market countries have exercised and continue to exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector. In some cases, the government owns or controls many companies, including some of the largest in the country.
Accordingly, government actions could have a significant effect on economic conditions in an emerging market country and on market conditions, prices and yields of securities in the Fund's portfolio. Moreover, the economies of developing countries generally are heavily dependent upon international trade and, accordingly, have been and may continue to be adversely affected by trade barriers, exchange controls, managed adjustments in relative currency values and other protectionist measures imposed or negotiated by the countries with which they trade. These economies also have been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic conditions in the countries with which they trade. With respect to any emerging market country, there is the possibility of nationalization, expropriation or confiscatory taxation, political changes, government regulation, overburdened and obsolete or unseasoned financial systems, environmental problems, less developed legal systems, economic or social instability or diplomatic developments (including war), which could affect adversely the economies of such countries or the value of the Fund's investments in those countries. It also may be difficult to obtain and to enforce a judgment in a court outside of the United States.
In addition, the interrelatedness of the economies in emerging market countries has deepened over the years, with the effect that economic difficulties in one country may spread throughout a region or even among all or most emerging market countries, an effect that may vitiate any attempt by the Fund to reduce risk through geographic diversification of its portfolio investments.
Investments in emerging market countries may entail purchasing securities issued by or on behalf of entities that are insolvent, bankrupt, in default or otherwise engaged in an attempt to reorganize or reschedule their obligations or in entities that have little or no proven credit rating or credit history. In any such case, the issuer's poor or deteriorating financial condition may increase the likelihood that the Fund will experience losses or diminution in available gains due to bankruptcy, insolvency or fraud.
Foreign Currency Risk
The Fund will invest in Emerging Markets Securities, which may include or be denominated in foreign currencies. The Fund is subject to the risk that those currencies will decline in value relative to the value of the U.S. dollar. The values of the currencies of the emerging market countries in which the Fund may invest may be subject to a high degree of fluctuation due to changes in interest rates, the effects of the monetary policies of the United States, foreign governments, central banks or supranational entities, the imposition of currency controls or other national or global political or economic developments. Therefore, the Fund's exposure to foreign currencies may result in losses to the Fund.
The Fund will compute, and expects to distribute, its income in U.S. dollars, and the computation of income is made on the date that the income is earned by the Fund at the foreign exchange rate in effect on that date. If the value of the foreign currencies in which the Fund receives its income falls relative to the U.S. dollar between the earning of the income and the time at which the Fund converts the foreign currencies to U.S. dollars, the Fund will realize foreign currency losses for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See "U.S. Federal Income Tax Matters." The Fund may be required to liquidate securities in order to make distributions if the Fund has insufficient cash in U.S. dollars to meet distribution requirements. See "Distributions" and "Dividend Reinvestment Plan." The liquidation of investments, if required, may have an adverse effect on the Fund's performance.
Since the Fund may invest in securities denominated in foreign currencies, changes in foreign currency exchange rates will affect the value of securities in the Fund's portfolio and the unrealized appreciation or depreciation of investments. In addition to changes in the value of the Fund's portfolio investments resulting from currency fluctuations, the Fund may incur costs in connection with conversions between various currencies. Foreign exchange dealers realize a profit based on the difference between the prices at which they are buying and selling various currencies. Thus, a dealer normally will offer to sell a foreign currency to the Fund at one rate, while offering a lesser rate of exchange should the Fund desire immediately to resell that currency to the dealer. The Fund will conduct its foreign currency exchange transactions either on a spot (i.e., cash) basis at the spot rate prevailing in the foreign currency exchange market or in the derivatives markets, including through entering into forward, futures or options contracts to purchase or sell foreign currencies.
Currency exchange rates may be negatively affected by rates of inflation, interest rate levels, balance of payments and governmental surpluses or deficits in the countries in which the Fund invests. The currencies of countries may experience significant declines against the U.S. dollar, and devaluation may occur subsequent to investments in these currencies by the Fund. Inflation and rapid fluctuations in inflation rates have had, and may continue to have, negative effects on the economies and securities markets of certain countries. Governments that issue obligations may engage in certain techniques to control the value of their local currencies. Such techniques include central bank intervention, imposition of regulatory controls or the imposition of taxes that may affect the exchange rates of the local currencies in which the debt securities are denominated. Countries may also issue a new currency to replace an existing currency or may devalue their currencies. The liquidity and market values of the Fund's investments may be affected by the actions of the governments of the countries in which the Fund invests. The Fund may be negatively affected by developments associated with the euro. See "-Redenomination Risk" below.
	The Fund may, from time to time, seek to protect the value of some portion or all of its portfolio holdings against currency risks by engaging in currency hedging transactions. Such transactions may include entering into forward currency exchange contracts, currency futures contracts and options on such futures contracts, the use of other derivatives, as well as purchasing put or call options on currencies, in U.S. or foreign markets. Currency hedging involves special risks, including possible default by the other party to the transaction, illiquidity and, to the extent the Investment Manager's view as to certain market movements is incorrect, the risk that the use of hedging could result in losses greater than if they had not been used. In addition, in certain countries in which the Fund may invest, currency hedging opportunities may not be available.
Sovereign Debt Obligations Risk
Investments in countries' government debt obligations involve special risks. Certain countries have historically experienced, and may continue to experience, high rates of inflation, high interest rates, exchange rate fluctuations, large amounts of external debt, balance of payments and trade difficulties and extreme poverty and unemployment. The issuer or governmental authority that controls the repayment of a country's debt may not be able or willing to repay the principal and/or interest when due in accordance with the terms of such debt. A debtor's willingness or ability to repay principal and interest due in a timely manner may be affected by, among other factors, its cash flow situation and, in the case of a government debtor, the extent of its foreign reserves, the availability of sufficient foreign exchange on the date a payment is due, the relative size of the debt service burden to the economy as a whole, the government debtor's policy towards the International Monetary Fund and the political constraints to which a government debtor may be subject. Government debtors may default on their debt and may also be dependent on expected disbursements from foreign governments, multilateral agencies and others abroad to reduce principal and interest arrearages on their debt. The commitment on the part of these governments, agencies and others to make such disbursements may be conditioned on a debtor's implementation of economic reforms and/or economic performance and the timely service of such debtor's obligations. Failure to implement such reforms, achieve such levels of economic performance or repay principal or interest when due may result in the cancellation of such third parties' commitments to lend funds to the government debtor, which may further impair such debtor's ability or willingness to service its debts on a timely basis. Holders of government debt, including the Fund, may be requested to participate in the rescheduling of such debt and to extend further loans to government debtors.
As a result of the foregoing, a government obligor may default on its obligations. If such an event occurs, the Fund may have limited legal recourse against the issuer and/or guarantor. Remedies must, in some cases, be pursued in the courts of the defaulting party itself, and the ability of the holder of foreign government debt securities to obtain recourse may be subject to the political climate in the relevant country. In addition, no assurance can be given that the holders of more senior fixed income securities, such as commercial bank debt, will not contest payments to the holders of other foreign government debt securities in the event of default under their commercial bank loan agreements.
Government obligors in emerging market countries are among the world's largest debtors to commercial banks, other governments, international financial organizations and other financial institutions. The issuers of the government debt securities in which the Fund may invest have in the past experienced substantial difficulties in servicing their external debt obligations, which led to defaults on certain obligations and the restructuring of certain indebtedness. Restructuring arrangements have included, among other things, reducing and rescheduling interest and principal payments by negotiating new or amended credit agreements, and obtaining new credit to finance interest payments. Holders of certain foreign government debt securities may be requested to participate in the restructuring of such obligations and to extend further loans to their issuers. There can be no assurance that the foreign government debt securities in which the Fund may invest will not be subject to similar restructuring arrangements or to requests for new credit, which may adversely affect the Fund's holdings. Furthermore, certain participants in the secondary market for such debt may be directly involved in negotiating the terms of these arrangements and may therefore have access to information not available to other market participants.
Since 2010, the risks of investing in foreign sovereign debt have increased significantly as a result of the ongoing European debt crisis which began in Greece and has begun to spread throughout various other European countries. These debt crises and the ongoing efforts of governments around the world to address these debt crises have also resulted in increased volatility and uncertainty in the United States and the global economy and securities markets, and it is impossible to predict the effects of these or similar events in the future on the United States and the global economy and securities markets or on the Fund's investments. It is possible that these or similar events could have a significant adverse effect on the value and risk profile of the Fund. See "-Redenomination Risk."
Investments in emerging market countries' government debt securities involve currency risk. See "-Foreign Currency Risk."

Corporate Debt Risks.  
Like all debt securities, corporate debt securities generally represent an issuer's obligation to repay to the investor (or lender) the amount borrowed plus interest over a specified time period. A typical corporate bond specifies a fixed date when the amount borrowed (principal) is due in full, known as the maturity date, and specifies dates when periodic interest (coupon) payments will be made over the life of the security.
Corporate debt securities come in many varieties and may differ in the way that interest is calculated, the amount and frequency of payments, the type of collateral, if any, and the presence of special features (e.g., conversion rights). The Fund's investments in corporate debt securities may include, but are not limited to, senior, junior, secured and unsecured bonds, convertible securities, notes and other debt securities, and may be fixed rate, floating rate, zero coupon and inflation linked, among other things.
Prices of corporate debt securities fluctuate and, in particular, are subject to several key risks including, but not limited to, interest rate risk, credit risk, prepayment risk and spread risk. The market value of a corporate bond may be affected by the credit rating of the issuer, the issuer's performance, perceptions of the market place, management performance, financial leverage and reduced demand for the issuer's goods and services. There is a risk that the issuers of the corporate debt securities in which the Fund may invest may not be able to meet their obligations on interest or principal payments at the time called for by such securities.
Interest Rate Risk.  
Interest rate risk is the risk that investments, will decline in value because of changes in market interest rates. When interest rates rise the market value of fixed income securities generally will fall, and when interest rates fall the market value of such securities generally will rise. The Fund's investment in such securities means that the NAV and market price of the Common Shares may decline if market interest rates rise. This risk may be particularly acute because market interest rates are currently at historically low levels. During periods of declining interest rates, an issuer of fixed income securities may exercise its option to redeem or prepay securities prior to maturity, which could result in the Fund's having to reinvest in lower yielding fixed income securities or other types of securities. This is known as call or prepayment risk. During periods of rising interest rates, the average life of certain types of securities may be extended because of slower than expected payments. This may lock in a below market yield, increase the security's duration, and reduce the value of the security. This is known as extension risk. Investments in debt securities with long-term maturities may experience significant price declines if long-term interest rates increase. This is known as maturity risk. The value of the Fund's investments in common shares or other equity securities may also be influenced by changes in interest rates.
Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk that an issuer of, for example, a fixed income security or preferred stock, or the counterparty to a derivatives contract, will be unable to make interest, principal, dividend, or other payments when due. In general, lower rated securities carry a greater degree of credit risk. If rating agencies lower their ratings of securities in the Fund's portfolio, the value of those obligations could decline. In addition, the underlying revenue source for a fixed income security, a preferred stock or a derivatives contract may be insufficient to pay dividends, interest, principal or other required payments in a timely manner. Because a significant primary source of income for the Fund is the dividend, interest, principal and other payments on the fixed income securities, preferred stocks and derivatives in which it invests, any default by an issuer of such an instrument could have a negative effect on the Fund's ability to pay dividends on Common Shares and/or cause a decline in the value of Fund assets. Even if the issuer does not actually default, adverse changes in the issuer's financial condition may negatively affect its credit rating or presumed creditworthiness. These developments would adversely affect the market value of the issuer's obligations or the value of credit derivatives if the Fund has sold credit protection.
Non-Investment Grade Securities Risk
The Fund's investments in fixed income securities and preferred stocks of below investment grade quality (commonly referred to as "high yield" or "junk bonds") are predominantly speculative because of the credit risk of their issuers. While offering a greater potential opportunity for capital appreciation and higher yields, such below investment grade securities entail greater potential price volatility and may be less liquid than higher-rated securities. Issuers of below investment grade quality securities are more likely to default on their payments of interest and principal owed to the Fund, and such defaults will reduce the Fund's NAV and income distributions. The prices of these lower quality securities are more sensitive to negative developments than higher rated securities. Adverse business conditions, such as a decline in the issuer's revenues or an economic downturn, generally lead to a higher non-payment rate. In addition, such a security may lose significant value before a default occurs as the market adjusts to expected higher non-payment rates. The Fund may invest without limit in securities rated below investment grade. See "-Credit Risk."
Equity Securities and Related Market Risk
The market price of common stocks and other equity securities may go up or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. Equity securities may decline in value due to factors affecting equity securities markets generally, particular industries represented in those markets, or the issuer itself. See "-Issuer Risk." The values of equity securities may decline due to general market conditions that are not specifically related to a particular company, such as real or perceived adverse economic conditions, changes in the general outlook for corporate earnings, changes in interest or currency rates or adverse investor sentiment generally. They also may decline due to factors which affect a particular industry or industries, such as labor shortages or increased production costs and competitive conditions within an industry. Equity securities generally have greater price volatility than bonds and other debt securities.

The value of securities may decline for a number of reasons that directly relate to the issuer, such as its financial strength, management performance, financial leverage and reduced demand for the issuer's goods and services, as well as the historical and prospective earnings of the issuer and the value of its assets.
Preferred Securities Risk
Investments in preferred securities are subject to many of the risks associated with both fixed income securities and common shares or other equity securities. Preferred securities may also contain provisions that allow an issuer, under certain conditions, to skip or defer dividend payments. If the Fund owns a preferred security that is deferring its distributions, the Fund may be required to report income for tax purposes while it is not receiving any distributions. Preferred stock in some instances is convertible into common shares or other securities. See "-Convertible Securities Risk."
ETFs and Other Investment Companies Risk
As an investor in an ETF or other investment company, the Fund will be subject to the risks of the underlying securities in which the other investment company invests. In addition, as a shareholder in an ETF or other investment company, the Fund will bear its ratable share of that investment company's expenses, and would remain subject to payment of the Fund's investment management fees with respect to the assets so invested. Common Shareholders would therefore be subject to duplicative expenses to the extent the Fund invests in other investment companies. In addition, these other investment companies may use leverage, in which case an investment would subject the Fund to additional risks associated with leverage. See "-Leverage Risk." The Fund may invest in other investment companies for which the Investment Manager or an affiliate serves as investment manager or with which the Investment Manager is otherwise affiliated. The relationship between the Investment Manager and any such other investment company could create a conflict of interest between the Investment Manager and the Fund.
In addition to the risks related to investing in investment companies generally, investments in ETFs involve the risk that the ETF's performance may not track the performance of the index or markets the ETF is designed to track. In addition, ETFs often use derivatives to track the performance of the relevant index and, therefore, investments in those ETFs are subject to the same derivatives risks discussed above. See "-Derivatives Risk."
Smaller Company Risk
The Fund may invest in small or medium capitalization issuers. The general risks associated with debt instruments or equity securities are particularly pronounced for securities issued by companies with small market capitalizations. Small capitalization companies involve certain special risks. They are more likely than larger companies to have limited product lines, markets or financial resources, or to depend on a small, inexperienced management group. Securities of smaller companies may trade less frequently and in lesser volume than more widely held securities and their values may fluctuate more sharply than other securities. They also may have limited liquidity. Companies with medium-sized market capitalizations may have risks similar to those of smaller companies.
Derivatives Risk
Generally, a derivative is a financial contract the value of which depends upon, or is derived from, the value of an underlying asset, reference rate, or index, and may relate to individual debt or equity instruments, interest rates, currencies or currency exchange rates, commodities, related indexes, and other assets. The Fund may use derivatives to a significant extent for hedging, investment, interest rate or duration management or leverage purposes. Derivative transactions (such as swaps, options and futures contracts and options thereon) may subject the Fund to increased risk of principal loss due to imperfect correlation between the values of the derivatives and the underlying securities or unexpected price or interest rate movements. Some derivatives may be subject to central clearing, while others may not. If a derivative is centrally cleared, a central clearing entity stands between the two parties to the trade as counterparty to each. The Fund will be subject to credit risk with respect to the counterparties to the derivatives contracts (whether a clearing corporation in the case of a cleared derivative instrument or another third party in the case of an uncleared derivative instrument) purchased and sold by the Fund, in addition to the risks associated with direct investments in the underlying reference securities, currencies or other instruments. If a counterparty becomes bankrupt or otherwise fails to perform its obligations under a derivative contract due to financial difficulties, the Fund may experience significant delays in obtaining any recovery under the derivative contract in a dissolution, assignment for the benefit of creditors, liquidation, winding-up, bankruptcy or other analogous reorganization proceeding. In addition, in the event of the insolvency of a counterparty to a derivative transaction, the derivative transaction would typically be terminated at its fair market value. To the extent the Fund's claim is unsecured, the Fund will be treated as a general creditor of such counterparty, and will not have any claim with respect to the underlying security. The Fund may obtain only a limited recovery or may obtain no recovery in such circumstances. See "-Counterparty Risk." The Fund's use of derivatives can affect the amount, timing and character of distributions to shareholders; the extent to which the Fund invests in derivatives may be limited by tax considerations (see discussion in "U.S. Federal Income Tax Matters"). The use of derivatives involves costs which are ultimately borne by the Fund and reduce returns. Derivatives involve exposure that may exceed the original cost, and a small use of derivatives could result in a potentially unlimited loss to the Fund under certain circumstances. 
The use of certain derivatives may expose the Fund to leverage risk. See "-Leverage Risk." It is possible that government regulation of various types of derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps, interest rate options, credit linked notes, foreign currency forward contracts, credit default swaps and total return swaps on individual securities and groups or indices of securities may limit or prevent the Fund from using such instruments as part of its investment strategy, which could negatively affect the Fund's performance. For example, the U.S. Government recently enacted legislation that provides for new regulation of certain portions of the derivatives market, including clearing, margin, reporting, recordkeeping, and registration requirements. Although the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the "CFTC") has released final rules relating to reporting, recordkeeping and registration requirements, many of the provisions contained in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act") are subject to further final rule making and thus its ultimate impact remains unclear. New regulations could, among other things, restrict the Fund's ability to engage in derivatives transactions (for example, by making certain types of derivatives transactions no longer available to the Fund) and/or increase the costs of such derivatives transactions (for example, by increasing margin or capital requirements), and the Fund may be unable to execute its investment strategy as a result. It is unclear how the regulatory changes will affect counterparty risk. 
Leverage Risk
Although the Fund presently intends to utilize leverage, there can be no assurance that the Fund will do so, or that, if utilized, it will be successful during any period in which leverage is employed. The use of leverage by the Fund would result in more risk to the Fund's shareholders than if leverage had not been used and can magnify the effect of any losses. If the income and gains earned on securities to which the Fund has exposure through the use of leverage are greater than the costs of Borrowings, the costs of derivatives transactions used to generate leverage and the dividend payable on any outstanding Preferred Shares, the Fund's returns will be greater than if leverage had not been used. Conversely, if the income and gains from those securities do not cover the payments due in connection with the leverage used, the return will be less than if such leverage had not been used. In addition, if an event of default were to occur with respect to a reference obligation on which the Fund had sold a credit default swap, the value of the reference obligation received by the Fund (if any), coupled with the periodic payments previously received from the counterparty, may be less than the full notional value the Fund pays to the buyer, in which case the investment performance of the Fund's Common Shares will underperform as compared to what the performance would have been had the Fund not written any credit default swaps. See "-Credit Default Swaps Risk" for further information on the risks associated with credit default swaps. The Investment Manager nevertheless may determine to continue to use leverage if it believes that the benefits to the Fund will in the long-term outweigh the potential risk of a reduced return. The expenses associated with Borrowings, sales of credit default swaps, derivatives transactions and issuances of Preferred Shares will be borne by Common Shareholders and, consequently, will result in a reduction of the NAV of the Common Shares. During periods in which the Fund is using leverage in the form of Borrowings or Preferred Shares, the fees paid by the Fund for investment advisory and administrative services will be higher than if the Fund did not use such leverage, as such fees will be calculated on the basis of the Fund's Total Managed Assets, which includes assets attributable to any Borrowings and to any Preferred Shares. In this regard, holders of debt or Preferred Shares do not bear such fees. Rather, Common Shareholders bear the portion of such fees attributable to the assets purchased with the proceeds of such leverage or the investment exposure obtained through such leverage, which means that Common Shareholders effectively bear the entirety of advisory and administrative fees.
back to the top
Short Sales Risk
To the extent the Fund makes use of short sales for investment and/or risk management purposes, the Fund may be subject to certain risks associated with selling short. Short sales are transactions in which the Fund sells securities or other instruments that the Fund does not own. Short sales expose the Fund to the risk that it will be required to cover its short position at a time when the securities have appreciated in value, thus resulting in a loss to the Fund. The Fund may engage in short sales when it does not own or have the right to acquire the security sold short at no additional cost. The Fund's loss on a short sale theoretically could be unlimited in a case in which the Fund is unable, for whatever reason, to close out its short position. In addition, the Fund's short selling strategies may limit its ability to benefit from increases in the markets. If the Fund engages in short sales, it will segregate liquid assets, enter into offsetting transactions or own positions covering its obligations; however, such segregation and cover requirements will not limit or offset losses on related positions. Also, there is the risk that the counterparty to a short sale may fail to honor its contractual terms, causing a loss to the Fund.
Risks of Short Economic Exposure Through Derivatives.
The use by the Fund of derivatives such as options, forwards or futures contracts for investment and/or risk management purposes may subject the Fund to risks associated with short economic exposure. Taking a short economic position through derivatives exposes the Fund to the risk that it will be obligated to make payments to its counterparty if the underlying asset appreciates in value, resulting in a loss to the Fund. The Fund's loss on a short position using derivatives theoretically could be unlimited.
Credit Default Swaps Risk.
Credit default swaps involve greater risks than investing in the reference obligation directly. In addition to general market risks, credit default swaps are subject to liquidity risk, counterparty risk and credit risk. A buyer will lose its investment and recover nothing should no event of default occur. If an event of default were to occur, the value of the reference obligation received by the seller (if any), coupled with the periodic payments previously received, may be less than the full notional value it pays to the buyer, resulting in a loss of value to the seller. When the Fund acts as a seller of a credit default swap, it is exposed to many of the same risks of leverage described herein since if an event of default occurs the seller must pay the buyer the full notional value of the reference obligation.
Although the Fund will seek to realize gains by writing credit default swaps that increase in value, to realize gains on writing credit default swaps, an active secondary market for such instruments must exist or the Fund must otherwise be able to close out these transactions at advantageous times. If no such secondary market exists or the Fund is otherwise unable to close out these transactions at advantageous times, writing credit default swaps may not be profitable for the Fund.
	The market for credit default swaps has become more volatile in recent years as the creditworthiness of certain counterparties has been questioned and/or downgraded. The Fund will be subject to credit risk with respect to the counterparties to the derivative contract (whether a clearing corporation in the case of a cleared credit default swap or another third party in the case of an uncleared credit default swap). If a counterparty's credit becomes significantly impaired, multiple requests for collateral posting in a short period of time could increase the risk that the Fund may not receive adequate collateral. As of the date of this prospectus, credit default swaps are not currently traded on any securities exchange; however, the CFTC has issued a proposed rule which would require certain credit default swaps to be cleared through swaps clearing houses. The Fund may exit its obligations under a credit default swap only by terminating the contract and paying applicable breakage fees, or by entering into an offsetting credit default swap position, which may cause the Fund to incur more losses.
Redenomination Risk
Continuing uncertainty as to the status of the euro and the European Monetary Union (the "EMU") has created significant volatility in currency and financial markets generally. Any partial or complete dissolution of the EMU could have significant adverse effects on currency and financial markets, and on the values of the Fund's portfolio investments, especially any investments denominated in euros. As a result, the value of those investments could decline significantly and unpredictably. In addition, securities or other investments that are redenominated may be subject to foreign currency risk, liquidity risk and valuation risk to a greater extent than similar investments currently denominated in euros. See "-Foreign Currency Risk," "-Liquidity Risk" and "-Valuation Risk." To the extent a currency used for redenomination purposes is not specified in respect of certain euro-related investments, or should the euro cease to be used entirely, the currency in which such investments are denominated may be unclear, making such investments particularly difficult to value or dispose of. The Fund may incur additional expenses to the extent it is required to seek judicial or other clarification of the denomination or value of such securities.
Reinvestment Risk
Income from the Fund's portfolio will decline if and when the Fund invests the proceeds from matured, traded or called debt obligations at market interest rates that are below the portfolio's current earnings rate. For instance, during periods of declining interest rates, an issuer of debt obligations may exercise an option to redeem securities prior to maturity, forcing the Fund to reinvest the proceeds in lower-yielding securities. A decline in income received by the Fund from its investments is likely to have a negative effect on the market price, net asset value and/or overall return of the Common Shares.
Hedging Strategy Risk.
Certain of the investment techniques that the Fund may employ for hedging will expose the Fund to additional or increased risks.
There may be an imperfect correlation between changes in the value of the Fund's portfolio holdings and hedging positions entered into by the Fund, which may prevent the Fund from achieving the intended hedge or expose the Fund to risk of loss. In addition, the Fund's success in using hedge instruments is subject to the Investment Manager's ability to predict correctly changes in the relationships of such hedge instruments to the Fund's portfolio holdings, and there can be no assurance that the Investment Manager's judgment in this respect will be accurate. Consequently, the use of hedging transactions might result in a poorer overall performance for the Fund, whether or not adjusted for risk, than if the Fund had not hedged its portfolio holdings.
The Investment Manager is under no obligation to engage in any hedging strategies, and may, in its discretion, choose not to. Even if the Investment Manager desires to hedge some of the Fund's risks, suitable hedging transactions may not be available or, if available, attractive. A failure to hedge may result in losses to the value of the Fund's investments.
back to the top
Counterparty Risk
The Fund is subject to credit risk with respect to the counterparties to the derivative contracts (whether a clearing corporation in the case of cleared instruments or another third party in the case of uncleared instruments) and other instruments entered into by the Fund or held by special purpose or structured vehicles in which the Fund invests. In the event that the Fund enters into a derivative transaction with a counterparty that subsequently becomes insolvent or becomes the subject of a bankruptcy case, the derivative transaction may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the Fund's ability to realize its rights under the derivative instrument and its ability to distribute the proceeds could be adversely affected. To the extent the Fund's claim is unsecured, the Fund will be treated as a general creditor of such counterparty, and will not have any claim with respect to the underlying security. If a counterparty becomes bankrupt or otherwise fails to perform its obligations under a derivative contract due to financial difficulties, the Fund may experience significant delays in obtaining any recovery under the derivative contract in a dissolution, assignment for the benefit of creditors, liquidation, winding-up, bankruptcy or other analogous reorganization proceeding. The Fund may obtain only a limited recovery or may obtain no recovery in such circumstances.
Net Asset Value Discount Risk
Frequently, shares of closed-end investment companies, such as the Fund, trade at a price below their NAV, commonly referred to as a "discount."
The Fund cannot predict whether, or to what extent, its Common Shares will trade at a discount to their NAV. Immediately following this offering, the NAV of the Fund's Common Shares will be reduced by offering costs paid by the Fund, creating an increased risk that the Common Shares will trade at a discount to their NAV for a period following the offering. Therefore, there is an added risk to investors who may sell their shares shortly after the offering. Before making an investment decision, a prospective investor should consider the suitability of this investment with respect to the investor's investment objectives and personal situation. See "Description of Shares."
Structured Products Risk
Structured Products Risk.  The Fund may invest in structured investments, structured notes and other similar products consistent with the Fund's investment objective and policies. Generally, structured investments are interests in entities organized and operated for the purpose of restructuring the investment characteristics of underlying investment interests or securities. These investment entities may be structured as trusts or other types of pooled investment vehicles. This type of restructuring generally involves the deposit with or purchase by an entity of the underlying investments and the issuance by that entity of one or more classes of securities backed by, or representing interests in, the underlying investments or referencing an indicator related to such investments. The cash flow or rate of return on the underlying investments may be apportioned among the newly issued securities to create different investment characteristics, such as varying maturities, credit quality, payment priorities and interest rate provisions.
Structured notes are derivative securities for which the amount of principal repayment and/or interest payments is based on the movement of one or more "factors." These factors may include, but are not limited to, currency exchange rates, interest rates (such as the prime lending rate or the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR")), referenced bonds and stock indices. Some of these factors may or may not correlate to the total rate of return on one or more underlying instruments referenced in such notes. In some cases, the effect of the movements of these factors may increase or decrease through the use of multipliers or deflators.
The cash flow or rate of return on a structured investment may be determined by applying a multiplier to the rate of total return on the underlying investments or referenced indicator. Application of a multiplier is comparable to the use of financial leverage, a speculative technique. Leverage magnifies the potential for gain and the risk of loss. As a result, a relatively small decline in the value of the underlying investments or referenced indicator could result in a relatively large loss in the value of a structured product. Holders of structured products indirectly bear risks associated with the underlying investments, index or reference obligation, and are subject to counterparty risk. The Fund generally has the right to receive payments to which it is entitled only from the structured product, and generally does not have direct rights against the issuer. While certain structured investment vehicles enable the investor to acquire interests in a pool of securities without the brokerage and other expenses associated with directly holding the same securities, investors in structured vehicles generally pay their share of the investment vehicle's administrative and other expenses. Certain structured products may be thinly traded or have a limited trading market and may have the effect of increasing the Fund's illiquidity to the extent that the Fund, at a particular point in time, may be unable to find qualified buyers for these securities.
Structured products are generally privately offered and sold, and thus, are not registered under the securities laws. Certain structured products may be thinly traded or have a limited trading market and may have the effect of increasing the Fund's illiquidity to the extent that the Fund, at a particular point in time, may be unable to find qualified buyers for these securities. In addition to the general risks associated with fixed income securities discussed herein, structured products carry additional risks including, but not limited to:

the possibility that distributions from underlying investments will not be adequate to make interest or other payments;
the quality of the underlying investments may decline in value or default;
the possibility that the security may be subordinate to other classes; and
the complex structure of the security may not be fully understood at the time of investment and may produce disputes with the issuer or unexpected investment results.

	Investments in structured notes involve risks including interest rate risk, credit risk and market risk. When the Fund's investments in structured notes are based upon the movement of one or more factors, depending on the factor used and the use of multipliers or deflators, changes in interest rates and movement of the factor may cause significant price fluctuations. Additionally, changes in the reference instrument or security may cause the interest rate on the structured note to be reduced to zero and any further changes in the reference instrument may then reduce the principal amount payable on maturity.
Warrants Risk
The Fund may invest in warrants. While the market value of a warrant tends to be more volatile than that of the securities underlying the warrant, the market value of a warrant may not necessarily change with that of the underlying security. A warrant ceases to have value if it is not exercised prior to any expiration date to which the warrant is subject.
The purchase of warrants involves a risk that the Fund could lose the purchase value of a warrant if the right to subscribe to additional shares is not exercised prior to the warrant's expiration. Also, the purchase of warrants involves the risk that the effective price paid for the warrant added to the subscription price of the related security may exceed the value of the subscribed security's market price, such as when there is no movement in the level of the underlying security.
Inflation/Deflation Risk
Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from the Fund's investments will be worth less in the future as inflation decreases the value of payments at future dates. As inflation increases, the real value of the Fund's portfolio could decline. Deflation risk is the risk that prices throughout the economy decline over time. Deflation may have an adverse effect on the creditworthiness of issuers and may make issuer default more likely, which may result in a decline in the value of the Fund's portfolio and Common Shares.
back to the top
Liquidity Risk
Certain of the Fund's investments may be illiquid (i.e., securities that cannot be disposed of within seven days in the ordinary course of business at approximately the value at which the Fund has valued the securities). Illiquid securities may trade at a discount from comparable, more liquid investments, and may be subject to wide fluctuations in market value. Also, the Fund may not be able to dispose readily of illiquid securities when that would be beneficial at a favorable time or price or at prices approximating those at which the Fund then values them. Further, the lack of an established secondary market for illiquid securities may make it more difficult to value such securities, which may negatively affect the price the Fund would receive upon disposition of such securities. See "-Valuation Risk."
Valuation Risk
When market quotations are not readily available or are deemed to be unreliable, the Fund values its investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the Board. See "Net Asset Value." Fair value pricing may require subjective determinations about the value of a security or other asset. As a result, there can be no assurance that fair value pricing will result in adjustments to the prices of securities or other assets, or that fair value pricing will reflect actual market value, and it is possible that the fair value determined for a security or other asset will be materially different from quoted or published prices, from the prices used by others for the same security or other asset and/or from the value that actually could be or is realized upon the sale of that security or other asset.
Legal and Regulatory Risk
Legal, tax and regulatory changes could occur and may adversely affect the Fund and its ability to pursue its investment strategies and/or increase the costs of implementing such strategies. New (or revised) laws or regulations may be imposed by the CFTC, the SEC, the U.S. Federal Reserve or other banking regulators, other governmental regulatory authorities or self-regulatory organizations that supervise the financial markets that could adversely affect the Fund. In particular, these agencies are empowered to promulgate a variety of new rules pursuant to recently enacted financial reform legislation in the United States. The Fund also may be adversely affected by changes in the enforcement or interpretation of existing statutes and rules by these governmental regulatory authorities or self-regulatory organizations.
Market Disruption and Geopolitical Risk
The wars with Iraq and Afghanistan and similar conflicts and geopolitical developments, their aftermath and substantial military presence in Afghanistan are likely to have a substantial effect on the U.S. and world economies and securities markets. The nature, scope and duration of the wars and the potential costs of rebuilding infrastructure cannot be predicted with any certainty. Terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on September 11, 2001 closed some of the U.S. securities markets for a four-day period and similar future events cannot be ruled out. The war and occupation, terrorism and related geopolitical risks have led, and may in the future lead, to increased short-term market volatility and may have adverse long-term effects on U.S. and world economies and markets generally. Likewise, natural and environmental disasters, such as the earthquake and tsunami in Japan in early 2011, and systemic market dislocations of the kind surrounding the insolvency of Lehman Brothers in 2008, if repeated, could be highly disruptive to economies and markets. Those events as well as other changes in foreign and domestic economic and political conditions also could have an acute effect on individual issuers or related groups of issuers.
	These risks also could adversely affect individual issuers and securities markets, interest rates, secondary trading, ratings, credit risk, inflation, deflation and other factors relating to the Fund's investments and the market value and net asset value of the Fund's Common Shares.
Portfolio Turnover Risk
The techniques and strategies contemplated by the Fund might result in a high degree of portfolio turnover. The Fund cannot accurately predict its securities portfolio turnover rate, but anticipates that its annual portfolio turnover rate will not exceed 150% under normal market conditions, although it could be materially higher under certain conditions. Higher portfolio turnover rates result in corresponding increases in brokerage commissions and other trading costs and generate short-term capital gains taxable as ordinary income.
Anti-Takeover Provisions
The Fund's Declaration of Trust (the "Declaration of Trust") includes provisions that could have the effect of inhibiting the Fund's possible conversion to open-end status and limiting the ability of other entities or persons to acquire control of the Fund or the Board. In certain circumstances, these provisions might also inhibit the ability of Common Shareholders to sell their shares at a premium over prevailing market prices. See "Anti-Takeover Provisions in the Declaration of Trust."

Stone Harbor Emerging Markets Total Income Fund
BY Business Wire — 4:00 PM ET 05/25/2017


Notification of Sources of Distribution


Statement Pursuant to Section 19(a) of the Investment Company Act
      of 1940

 NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      On May 25, 2017, the Stone Harbor Emerging Markets Total Income Fund (EDI)
      (the “Fund”), a closed-end fund, will pay a monthly
      distribution on its common stock of $0.1511 per share to shareholders of
      record at the close of business on May 15, 2017. The Fund, acting in
      accordance with an exemptive order received from the Securities and
      Exchange Commission and with approval of its Board of Trustees, adopted
      a managed distribution policy under which the Fund may utilize capital
      gains, where applicable, as part of regular monthly cash distributions
      to its shareholders. This policy gives the Fund greater flexibility to
      realize capital gains and to distribute those gains to shareholders.
    

      The following table sets forth the estimated amounts of the current
      distribution and the cumulative distributions paid this fiscal
      year-to-date from the sources indicated in the table. In addition, the
      table shows the percentages of the total distribution amount per share
      attributable to (i) net investment income, (ii) net realized short-term
      capital gain, (iii) net realized long-term capital gain and (iv) return
      of capital or other capital source. These percentages are disclosed for
      the current distribution as well as the fiscal year-to-date cumulative
      distribution amount per share for the Fund.

      __________________________________
    

1 The Fund’s fiscal year is December 1 to November 30.
      Information shown is for the period beginning December 1, 2016.


Shareholders should not draw any conclusions about the Fund’s
      investment performance from the amount of this distribution or from the
      terms of the Fund’s managed distribution policy.


The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and
      net realized capital gains, therefore, a portion of your distribution
      may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for
      example, when some or all of the money that you invested in the Fund is
      paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not
      necessarily reflect the Fund’s investment performance and should not be
      confused with ‘yield’ or ‘income’.


The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this 19(a)
      Notice are only estimates, may change over time and are not being
      provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and
      sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the
      Fund’s investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and
      may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send
      you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to
      report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.


      Presented below are return figures, based on the change in the Fund’s
      Net Asset Value per share (“NAV”), compared to the annualized
      distribution rate for this current distribution as a percentage of the
      NAV on the last day of the month prior to distribution declaration date.

      ^ Based on the Fund’s NAV as of April 30, 2017 and the May 25, 2017
      distribution.
    

      *Based on the Fund’s NAV as of April 30, 2017 and includes distributions
      through May 25, 2017.
    

      ** Cumulative Total Return is the percentage change in the Fund’s NAV
      including distributions paid and assuming reinvestment of these
      distributions for the period December 1, 2016 to April 30, 2017.
    

      ***Average Annual Total Return represents the compound average of the
      Annual NAV Total Returns for the Fund for the period from inception
      (October 25, 2012) to April 30, 2017. Annual NAV Total Return is the
      percentage change in the Fund’s NAV over a year including distributions
      paid and assuming reinvestment of these distributions.
    

      While the NAV performance may be indicative of the Fund’s investment
      performance, it does not measure the value of a shareholder’s investment
      in the Fund. The value of a shareholder’s investment in the Fund is
      determined by the Fund’s market price, which is based on the supply and
      demand for the Fund’s shares in the open market.
    

      The Fund’s Board of Trustees reviews the amount of any distributions
      made pursuant the Fund’s distribution policy and considers the income
      earned and capital gain realized by the Fund, as well as the Fund’s
      available capital. The Board of Trustees will continue to monitor the
      Fund’s distribution level, taking into consideration, among other
      things, the Fund’s net asset value and market conditions. The Fund’s
      distribution policy is subject to modification, suspension or
      termination by the Board of Trustees at any time, which could have an
      adverse effect on the market price of the Fund’s shares. The
      distribution rate should not be considered the dividend yield or total
      return on an investment in the Fund.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
