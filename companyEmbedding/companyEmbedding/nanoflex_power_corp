	Intellectual Property | Solar Technology Patents | NanoFlex Power Corporation








































            











Intellectual Property
The Next Generation of Solar





Intellectual Property
We have been quiet over the past twenty years, but we have been very busy.
NanoFlex's sponsored research programs with the University of Southern California and the University of Michigan have resulted in an extensive intellectual property portfolio covering materials, architectures, and fabrication processes for organic and inorganic flexible, thin-film photovoltaic technologies.
NanoFlex has exclusive worldwide commercial license rights to all of the patents and their attendant technologies. We believe that this positions us as the gate keeper to any efforts to develop and commercialize either cost effective and flexible thin film Gallium Arsenide modules or small molecule organic photovoltaics.
We like to believe that we hold the keys to  the future of the solar power industry.
 





Some of our foundational intellectual property  includes the following:
 



 Tandem organic solar cell architectures




 
Tandem organic solar cell architectures
Individual conventional solar cells have limited spectral coverage, voltage output, and tradeoff between absorption length and charge collection length. By stacking multiple solar cells with complementary absorption profiles, voltages of the cells can be added (at a constant current).  





 Materials for Multi-exciton generation



 
Materials for Multi-exciton generation
 In order to prepare solar cells with efficiencies higher than theoretical limits, researchers have turned to multi-junction cells, however, these cells are very expensive. An alternate approach is to collect the high energy part of the spectrum,  and double the energy collected from this part of the solar spectrum using singlet fission materials which absorb high energy light and generate two excitons for every photon absorbed, thus doubling the light collection efficiency. This approach has the potential to give a single solar cell a 45% efficiency, without increasing the cost to produce the cell.





 
 


 
 Fullerene acceptors



 
Fullerene acceptors
Fullerenes include molecules such as C60, C70, C84 and derivatives that are designed to dissolve in solvents (such as PCBM made with either C60 or C70) are the most prevalent acceptor in organic photovoltaics. Fullerenes offer better efficiency than any other acceptor molecule to date. 




 Mixed layer and nano-crystalline cells



 
Mixed layer and nano-crystalline cells
In planar  cells the thickness of a layer is limited by the distance an exciton is expected to travel before it recombines. If the layer is too thick, photons absorbed may never result in collected charge. If the layers are too thin, there is insufficient material available for absorption of the light. By mixing the donor and acceptor throughout a thicker layer, an additional donor-acceptor interface is created throughout the layer, improving photocurrent generation capability.





 
 



 Blocking layers 



 
Blocking layers
In most solar cell designs, excitons must be blocked and reflected away from the metallic (or transparent) contact so that they can be dissociated at the donor-acceptor junction. Additionally, it is desired that these layers block the wrong carrier from contacting the electrode. 



 
 Solar paints



 
Solar paints
NanoFlex plans to paint solar cells onto any substrate (needs to be smooth, but not flat). The idea is to create solar paints that can be applied quickly and easily to any surface, including, for example, mobile communications devices, electric cars, roofing materials, building siding and glass). 





 
 


 
 New materials for broad spectral sensitivity



 
New materials for broad spectral sensitivity
Current OPV materials absorb light in the visible and deep red part of the solar spectrum, but do not collect light in the near infrared (NIR). Extending efficient light collection into the NIR has the potential to increase photocurrent generation by 40%, markedly improving OPV performance.




 Transparent/semi-transparent cells



 
Transparent/semi-transparent cells
In certain applications it may be desirable to have a partially transparent solar cell. These applications include tinted windows. Instead of just absorbing or reflecting the light, the light would be absorbed and converted into energy. The unique nature of organics allows NanoFlex to tune the wavelengths absorbed to those that it does not want transmitted or that are not useful for vision, such as in the infrared region of the spectrum.





 
 



 Scalable growth technologies



 
Scalable growth technologies
A number of growth technologies have been developed for organic materials. These include vacuum thermal evaporation and organic vapor phase deposition for materials that can be sublimed or evaporated directly and gravure or ink-jet printing of dissolved materials. All of these processes are compatible with rigid planar substrates, but more importantly can be applied to flexible plastic or metal foil substrates, for roll-to-roll fabrication of OPVs. 



 
 Rapid Manufacturing Technologies





 
Rapid Manufacturing Technologies
Traditional solar cell fabrication is a time consuming and energy intensive process.  We have developed several manufacturing processes that accelerate the speed of manufacturing and/or reduce the energy use.  These include organic vapor phase deposition, roll-to-roll processes, and high speed epitaxial lift-off, among others.





 
 



  Inverted solar cells



 
Inverted solar cells
One of the most air sensitive parts of the OPV is the region between the anode and electron acceptor. This region is degraded by oxygen and water in the dark and even more so under illumination. If the OPV is prepared as an inverted cell, the air sensitive region is placed below the donor, buffer layer and cathode. Thus, the device itself provides a level of "packaging," markedly slowing environmental degradation of the device, minimizing packaging requirements for long term deployment in the field.

	Our Corporate History | NanoFlex Power Corporation






































            








NanoFlex Power Corporation
A History of Innovation 





NanoFlex's History of Success 
Our track record of success speaks for itself.
NanoFlex's founding team has twice before formed highly successful companies that have advanced transformational technologies from the basic science stage to commercialization. These predecessor companies are pioneers in organic semiconductors and digital wireless communications technologies and have generated significant revenues and substantial shareholder value by licensing the intellectual property to industry manufacturers.  
Furthermore, NanoFlex's lead researchers, Dr. Forrest and Dr. Thompson were instrumental in the invention and development of organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), which have achieved commercial success.  We believe this is an important distinction – our lead researchers fully understand how to transition technology from the laboratory into a commercial environment.




NanoFlex's Sponsored Research Efforts






  Dr. Mark Thompson began working with NanoFlex Power (predecessor companies) in October 1993, while he was at Princeton University.  In August 1995, Dr. Thompson accepted a position at the University of Southern California and the sponsored research agreement was likewise assigned to USC.  In May 1998, Dr. Stephen Forrest, who was at Princeton University at the time, began conducting research for NanoFlex.  In 2006, Dr. Forrest accepted a position at the University of Michigan and continued his research efforts there.  
Our ongoing sponsored research program continue at USC and the University of Michigan.  There is currently no ongoing research activity at Princeton University related to NanoFlex, although we maintain licensing rights to related technology previously developed there.
These sponsored research agreements provide NanoFlex Power Corporation with the exclusive worldwide license and right to sublicense any and all intellectual property resulting from the related research and development efforts at these universities.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes to those financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Report.  Certain statements in this Report constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include statements, which involve risks and uncertainties, regarding, among other things, (a) our projected revenue, profitability, and cash flows, (b) our growth strategy, (c) anticipated trends in our industry, (d) our future financing plans, and (e) our anticipated needs for, and use of, working capital. They are generally identifiable by use of the words "may," "will," "should," "anticipate," "estimate," "plan," "potential," "project," "continuing," "ongoing," "expects," "management believes," "we believe," "we intend," or the negative of these words or other variations on these words or comparable terminology. In light of these risks and uncertainties, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements contained in this filing will in fact occur. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.  The forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and, except to the extent required by federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statements are made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.  The "Company", "we," "us," and "our," refer to (i) NanoFlex Power Corporation and (ii) Global Photonic Energy Corporation.  Overview  NanoFlex Power Corporation is engaged in the development, commercialization, and licensing of advanced photovoltaic technologies that enable thin film solar products with industry-leading efficiencies, light weight, flexibility, and low total system cost. NanoFlex has the exclusive worldwide license to the intellectual property resulting from the Company's sponsored research programs, which have resulted in an extensive portfolio of issued and pending U.S. patents, plus their foreign counterparts. The patents are referred to herein as being the Company's patents or as our "IP". Building upon the sponsored research, the Company plans to work with industry partners to commercialize its technologies to target key applications where is believes products incorporating its technologies present compelling competitive advantages.  These patented and patent-pending technologies fall into two general categories  The Company currently hold exclusive rights to an extensive portfolio of issued and pending U.S. patents, plus their foreign counterparts, which cover architecture, processes and materials for flexible, thin-film organic photovoltaic ("OPV") and Gallium Arsenide ("GaAs")-based solar technologies. In addition, we have an extensive collection of patents in process. Some of our technology holdings include foundational concepts in the following areas.  ? Tandem organic solar cell  ? Fullerene acceptors  ? Blocking layers  ? New materials for visible and infrared sensitivity  ? Scalable growth technologies  ? Inverted solar cells  ? Materials for enhanced light collection via multi-exciton generation  ? Mixed layer and nanocrystalline cells  ? Solar films, coatings, or paints  ? Semi-transparent cells  ? Ultra-low cost, ultra-high efficiency, flexible thin film GaAs cells  ? Accelerated and recyclable liftoff process  ? Cold-weld bonding of GaAs solar cells to plastic substrates and metal foils  ? Micro-inverters monolithically integrated into GaAs solar cells  ? Low cost, thermo-formed plastic mini-compound parabolic concentrator arrays  Plan of Operation and Liquidity and Capital Resources  Overall Operating Plan  Our business model is oriented around licensing and sublicensing processes and technologies to large, well-positioned commercial partners who can provide manufacturing and marketing capabilities to enable rapid commercial growth. We plan to license or sublicense our intellectual property to industry partners and customers. These manufacturing partners can supply customers directly, from which we expect to receive license royalties. Additionally, these manufacturing partners can also serve as a source of solar cell supply for us to provide products to customers on its own through a "fab-less" manufacturing model, particularly in the early stages of market development.  We have made contact with major solar cell and electronics manufacturers world-wide and are finding commercial interest in both our high efficiency and OPV technologies. We are seeking to work closely with those companies interested in our technology solutions to develop proof-of-concept prototypes and processes to mitigate commercialization risks and gain early market entry and acceptance.  We have identified its high efficiency thin film solar technologies as its nearest term market opportunity. A key to reducing the risk to market entry of our high efficiency technologies by our partners is for us to demonstrate our technologies on their product designs and fabrication processes. To support this joint development, we have established our own engineering team and plan to expand this team contingent on our ability to secure sponsored development funding and/or raise the necessary capital. This team is to be tasked with serving several key functions, including working closely with our sponsored research organizations and its industry partners to integrate and customize our proprietary processes and technologies into the partner's existing product designs and fabrication processes. In conjunction with facilitating technology transfer, our engineering team will also work closely with downstream partners and customers such as military users for mobile field applications, system integrators, installers, and architects for BAPV and BIPV applications, and engineering, procurement, and construction ("EPC") companies and project developers for solar farm applications. This customer interaction allows us to better understand application specific requirements and incorporate these requirements into its product development cycle.  To support this work, our engineering team leverages the facilities and equipment at the University of Michigan on a recharge basis, which we believe is a cost effective approach to move the technologies toward commercialization. We believe that this allows our engineering team to work directly with industry partners to acquire early licenses to use our intellectual property without the need for large-scale capital investment in clean room facilities and solar cell fabrication equipment.  We are pursuing sponsored development funding to generate revenue in the near-term. Having an established technical team enables us to more effectively pursue and execute sponsored research projects from the Department of Defense ("DoD"), the Department of Energy ("DOE"), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ("NASA"), each of which has interests in businesses that can deliver ultra-lightweight, high-efficiency solar technologies for demanding applications.  Another potential revenue source is from joint development agreements ("JDAs") and license agreements with existing solar cell manufacturers, similar to the JDA with SolAero. Once we are able to initially demonstrate the efficacy of our processes and technologies on partner's products and fabrication processes, we expect to be in a position where we can sign licenses covering further joint development, IP licensing, solar cell supply, and joint marketing, as applicable. We anticipate that partnerships with one or more of the existing high efficiency solar cell manufacturers can be supported by our engineering team, and result in near-term revenue opportunities, as we have demonstrated with our current joint development partner.  As reported in the Company's Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 7, 2017, on February 2, 2017, the "Company entered into a License Agreement with SolAero. In the Agreement, the Company agreed to grant SolAero a non-exclusive worldwide license to use, sell, offer for sale, import or otherwise dispose of certain products using the Company's patented proprietary manufacturing processes relating to Gallium Arsenide-based photovoltaic cells within the space and near-space fields of use. SolAero is to pay the Company a royalty based on sales of the Licensed Products within the Licensed Field. The Agreement does not provide SolAero with the right to sublicense the Licensed Patents. The term of the Agreement runs from February 2, 2017, through the expiration date of the last expiring patent included in the Licensed Technology. However, each party may terminate the agreement upon a material breach by the other party.  There can be no assurance that our overall term operating plan will be successful or that we will be able to fulfill it as it is largely dependent on raising capital and there can be no assurance that capital can be raised nor that we will be awarded the government contracts that we are currently pursuing.  Near Term Operating Plan  Our near-term focus is on advancing our product development efforts while containing costs. We require approximately $6 million to $8 million to continue our operations over the next twelve months to support our development and commercialization activities, fund patent application and prosecution, service outstanding liabilities, and support our corporate functions. Our operating plan over the next twelve months is comprised of the following:  1. Cost cutting and containment to reduce our cash operating expenses;  2. Prioritizing and optimizing our existing IP portfolio to align it with the commercialization strategy and reduce costs;  3. Focusing research and development investments on near-term commercialization opportunities;  4. Collaborating with strategic partners to accelerate joint development and licensing of our technologies;  5. Selectively pursuing government-sponsored projects to fund product development and commercialization; and  6. Raising adequate capital (approximately $6 million to $8 million) to support our activities for at least 12 months.  We believe that we have made progress with each of the components of this operating plan and have aligned our operations and cost structure with expediting the development and commercialization of our high efficiency solar technologies. We have taken steps to reduce patent expenses, particularly related to optimizing our OPV patent portfolio. We have realigned our research and development operations with several strategic actions, including hiring Company engineers to focus on high efficiency product development and technology transfer from the University of Michigan to a commercial environment with our industry partner, establishing a new sponsored research agreement with the University of Michigan focused on research and development of high efficiency technology in support of our commercialization efforts, and temporarily suspending our OPV-related sponsored research activities to reduce near-term expenditures while we seek a development partner for OPV commercialization. We remain focused on increasing our revenue through JDAs and license agreements with industry partners and through government-sponsored research projects and we believe that we are making positive progress with these efforts.  There can be no assurance that our near term operating plan will be successful or that we will be able to fulfill it as it is largely dependent on raising capital and there can be no assurance that capital can be raised nor that we will be awarded the government contracts that we are currently pursuing.  In the event that we raise less than the required amount of capital, our focus is planned to be on prioritizing our commercialization effort to capture near-term revenue opportunities and limiting spending on general and administrative expenses and patent costs.  Results of Operations  For the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015  Revenue  Revenue was $115,400 and $119,998 for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This relates to engineering services provided under our JDA.  We do not believe that inflation or changing prices have had a material effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.  Cost of Services  Cost of services was $458,576 and $114,947 for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This increase was due to expenses associated with a full year of engineering services under our JDA during 2016 compared to only a portion of the year in 2015.  Research and Development Expenses  Research and development expenses were $1,683,464 for the year ended December 31, 2016, a 28% decrease from $2,325,539 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease is attributable to an overall reduction in expense associated with our sponsored research activity as we increased our focus on product development and commercialization. The, decrease was also due to a decrease in non-cash expenses consisting of warrants issued for services, which were $1,266,043 and $1,334,017 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Patent Application and Prosecution Fees  Patent application and prosecution fees consist of the fees due for prosecuting and maintaining the patents resulted from the research program sponsored by the Company and were $1,525,695 for the year ended December 31, 2016, a 12% decrease from $1,724,988 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The year-over-year decrease is attributable to reduced submittal and processing of patent applications resulting from efforts to optimize the patent portfolio to align it with the Company's development and commercialization strategy.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  Selling, general and administrative expenses were $2,930,222 for the year ended December 31, 2016, a 58% decrease from $7,018,803 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease is primarily attributable to a reduction in non-cash expenses associated with warrants issued to employees during the year. Non-cash expenses were $1,063,248 and $4,747,101 for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Other Expense  Other expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $582,804 as compared to $12,252,240 for the year ended December 31, 2015. These changes are primarily due to the gain (loss) on change in fair value of derivative liabilities, the timing of entering into interest bearing debt agreements and the timing of the conversion of existing debt and extinguishment of old debt.  Net Loss  The net loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $7,065,361, a 70% decrease from $23,316,519 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The change in net loss is impacted by non-cash expenses, including the loss on change in fair value of the derivative liability and an increase in interest expense offset by changes in research and development, patent application and prosecution fees, and selling, general and administrative expenses, each of which is described above.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Sources of Liquidity  As of December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2,986 and a working capital deficit of $19,246,667, as compared to cash and cash equivalents of $6,255 and a working capital deficit of $25,404,178 as of December 31, 2015. The decrease in working capital is attributable to the change in fair value of derivative liabilities.  The Company needs to raise additional capital and is in the process of raising additional funds in order to continue to finance our research and development, service existing liabilities and commercialize photonic energy conversion technologies utilizing organic semiconductor-based solar cells. We need to raise approximately $6 million $8 million in additional capital in order to continue our operations as described above and support our corporate functions. We anticipate that the additional funding can result from private sales of our equity securities. However, there can be no assurance that the additional funds will be available to us when needed, or if available, on terms that will be acceptable to us or our shareholders. If we are unable to raise sufficient funds the Company may have to cease its operations.  Analysis of Cash Flows  Net cash used in operating activities increased by $1,120,850 to $4,622,396 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $3,501,546 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The cash used in operating activities was attributable primarily to decreased net loss, loss on extinguishment of debt partially offset by gain on change in fair value of derivative liabilities.  Net cash used in investing activities was $0 and $5,842 during the years ended December 31, 2016, and 2015, respectively. This amount represents purchases of property and equipment.  Net cash provided by financing activities was $4,619,127 and $3,513,475 during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2016 this includes proceeds from sale of common shares and warrants of $663,922, proceeds from exercise of warrants of $72,205, borrowings on short-term debt of $300,000, borrowings on related party debt of $1,875,000, borrowings on convertible debt of $1,458,000, advances received from related party of $730,000, partially offset by payments on related party debt of $150,000 and advances repaid to related party of $330,000. For the year ended December 31, 2015 this includes proceeds from the sale of common shares and warrants of $136,000, proceeds from the exercise of warrants of $914,220, proceeds from short-term debt of $50,000, borrowings on related party debt of $625,000, borrowings on convertible debt of $2,106,405, advances received from related party of $212,350, partially offset by advances repaid to related party of $530,500.  Going Concern  The Company has only generated limited revenues to date. The Company has a working capital deficit of $19,246,667 and an accumulated deficit of $208,569,839 as of December 31, 2016. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on raising capital to fund ongoing operations and carry out its business plan and ultimately to attain profitable operations. Accordingly, these factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts of and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue in existence.  Critical Accounting Policies  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities, expenses, and other financial information. Actual results may differ significantly from our estimates under other assumptions and conditions. We believe that our accounting policies related to stock-based compensation, research and development, impairment of long lived assets, development stage and property plant and equipment as described below, are our "critical accounting policies" as contemplated by the SEC.  Basis of Accounting  The Company' policy is to maintain its books and prepare its combined financial statements on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of combined financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the combined financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Revenue Recognition  We recognize revenue from our services when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transactions will flow to the Company and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably. This is normally demonstrated when:  Stock-Based Compensation  We account for stock based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC 718 which requires companies to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the grant-date fair value of the award. For stock-based awards granted on or after January 1, 2006, stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. In prior years, we accounted for stock-based awards under APB No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." We account for non-employee share-based awards in accordance with FASB ASC 505-50.  Research and Development  Research and development costs are expensed in the period they are incurred in accordance with ASC 730, Research and Development unless they meet specific criteria related to technical, market and financial feasibility, as determined by management, including but not limited to the establishment of a clearly defined future market for the product, and the availability of adequate resources to complete the project. If all criteria are met, the costs are deferred and amortized over the expected useful life, or written off if a product is abandoned. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had no deferred development costs.  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  The Company reviews the carrying value of its long-lived assets annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the historical-cost carrying value of an asset may no longer be appropriate. The Company assesses recoverability of the asset by comparing the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the asset to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flows of the asset, an impairment loss is measured and recognized. An impairment loss is measured as the difference between the net book value and the fair value of the long-lived asset. Fair value is estimated based upon either discounted cash flow analysis or estimated salvage value.  Property and Equipment  Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is provided using the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes at rates based on the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives range from three to eight years.  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements:  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, financings, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons, also known as "special purpose entities" (SPEs).

NanoFlex Power Corporation and Consortium Partners Wins $6.5 Million Contract from Army Research Office
Jun 19 17
NanoFlex Power Corporation announced that it is part of a consortium that was awarded a $6.5 million contract from the Army Research Laboratory's Army Research Office to develop high power, flexible, and lightweight solar modules for portable power applications with more than double the power of current flexible solar modules within the same footprint at a competitive procurement cost on a dollars per Watt basis. The consortium consists of NanoFlex, SolAero Technologies (SolAero), the University of Michigan (UM), and the University of Wisconsin (UW). As part of the program, NanoFlex and SolAero will collaborate to incorporate the patented non-destructive epitaxial lift off (ND-ELO) process and related technologies into SolAero's fabrication process to reduce the production cost of ultra-high efficiency compound semiconductor solar cells. Invented by UM and exclusively licensed by NanoFlex, ND-ELO technology has the potential to substantially reduce production costs by enabling reuse of the expensive wafer substrate. NanoFlex will then design and integrate these ultra-high efficiency solar cells into high power, flexible, and lightweight solar module prototypes for portable Soldier power applications. Finally, UM and UW will evaluate new compound semiconductor growth processes to enable further cost reduction. The four-year contract was awarded by the U.S. Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Army Research Laboratory's Army Research Office to SolAero, with NanoFlex, UM, and UW participating as subcontractors. The project is under the U.S. Army Manufacturing Technology (ManTech) Program, which supports transition of manufacturing technologies and affordable technical capabilities to address the highest priority needs of the Warfighter through demonstration of effective, efficient and adaptable processes.

SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., June 19, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- NanoFlex Power Corporation ("NanoFlex") (OTCQB: OPVS), a developer of advanced photovoltaic technologies, today announced that it is part of a consortium that was awarded a $6.5 million contract from the Army Research Laboratory's Army Research Office to develop high power, flexible, and lightweight solar modules for portable power applications with more than double the power of current flexible solar modules within the same footprint at a competitive procurement cost on a dollars per Watt basis. The consortium consists of NanoFlex, SolAero Technologies ("SolAero"), a leading manufacturer of high efficiency solar cells, the University of Michigan ("UM"), and the University of Wisconsin ("UW").  








As part of the program, NanoFlex and SolAero will collaborate to incorporate the patented non-destructive epitaxial lift off ("ND-ELO") process and related technologies into SolAero's fabrication process to reduce the production cost of ultra-high efficiency compound semiconductor solar cells. Invented by UM and exclusively licensed by NanoFlex, ND-ELO technology has the potential to substantially reduce production costs by enabling reuse of the expensive wafer substrate. NanoFlex will then design and integrate these ultra-high efficiency solar cells into high power, flexible, and lightweight solar module prototypes for portable Soldier power applications.  Finally, UM and UW will evaluate new compound semiconductor growth processes to enable further cost reduction.  
This program addresses a critical need within the Army, with Soldiers facing a widening energy gap as they are equipped with increased electronic equipment. Currently small units lack the ability to harvest sufficient power while conducting extended operations. These high power, flexible, and lightweight solar modules can be used by Soldiers to recharge batteries and power other electronic equipment, providing the ability to operate independently at a sustained operational tempo for increased periods, over greater distances.  The thin and flexible design can be folded into a compact, lightweight package Soldiers can stow and carry into the field and interoperate with the Army's Squad Power Manager ("SPM") and Universal Battery Charger ("UBC") systems.  
"Until now, high performance compound semiconductor solar cells have not been available to the Army at reasonable prices. This program will enable the development and use of TRL-7 flexible solar module prototypes with more than twice current power performance at a competitive price to the Army.  This technology can provide an immediate and direct benefit to the warfighter, reducing physical burden, reducing forward logistics, and extending mission duration," said Dean Ledger, Chief Executive Officer of NanoFlex.  "We are also excited for the sizeable non-military applications for these products for use by non-government organizations for emergency preparedness and response and outdoor enthusiasts for recreational activities." 
The four-year contract was awarded by the U.S. Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command ("RDECOM"), Army Research Laboratory's Army Research Office to SolAero, with NanoFlex, UM, and UW participating as subcontractors.  The project is under the U.S. Army Manufacturing Technology ("ManTech") Program, which supports transition of manufacturing technologies and affordable technical capabilities to address the highest priority needs of the Warfighter through demonstration of effective, efficient and adaptable processes.  The Army's transition sponsor for this effort is Program Executive Office ("PEO") Soldier, Project Manager Soldier Warrior ("PM SWAR").  PM SWAR is responsible for the acquisition of integrated Soldier systems designed to increase Soldier's situational awareness and combat effectiveness, decrease combat load, and improve mission flexibility.

	8.02




	If
	the performance of any part of this Agreement by either Party, or of any obligation under
	this Agreement, is prevented, restricted, interfered with or delayed by reason of any
	cause beyond the reasonable control and without the fault or negligence of the Party
	liable to perform (a “

	Force Majeure Event

	”), the Party so affected
	will, upon giving written notice to the other Parties, be excused from the performance
	to the extent of the prevention, restriction, interference or delay; provided, however,
	the affected Party shall provide notice to the other Party setting forth the nature and
	anticipated duration of the delay and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid,
	minimize or remove the causes of non-performance and will continue performance with the
	utmost dispatch whenever the causes are removed.






	 






	8.03




	This
	Agreement and the rights and obligations of the Parties under this Agreement will be
	governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Delaware, without regards to its
	rules of conflicts of laws.






	 






	8.04




	Any
	dispute arising directly under the express terms of this Agreement or the grounds for
	termination thereof will be resolved as follows. First, within thirty (30) days after
	either Party identifies the existence of a dispute, senior management of both Parties
	will meet to attempt to resolve such dispute. If the senior management cannot resolve
	the dispute, the dispute will be referred to mediation. Unless the parties agree otherwise,
	the mediation will be conducted in accordance with the AAA Commercial Mediation Procedures.
	If the dispute cannot be settled at such mediation session or at any mutually agreed
	continuation thereof, either party may give the other and the mediator a written notice
	declaring the mediation process at an end. Any disputes not resolved by mediation will
	be finally resolved by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association
	(AAA) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be conducted before
	a single arbitrator appointed by the AAA. All proceedings will be in English in Wilmington,
	Delaware, USA. Judgment on the award of the arbitrators may be entered in any court having
	jurisdiction, and the parties agree to personal jurisdiction in the United States District
	Court for the District of Delaware solely for entry of such judgment.






	 






	8.05




	Either
	Party may make a written demand for formal dispute resolution. Within thirty (30) days
	after such written demand, the Parties agree to meet for one day with an impartial mediator
	to attempt to resolve such dispute.






	 






	8.06




	If
	a court of competent jurisdiction holds any provision of this Agreement to be illegal,
	unenforceable, or invalid, in whole or in part for any reason: (i) all other provisions
	hereof will remain in full force and effect and will be liberally construed in order
	to carry out the intent of the Parties as near as possible, and (ii) the Parties
	agree to use their best efforts to negotiate a provision, in replacement of the provision
	held illegal, unenforceable, or invalid, that is consistent with applicable law and accomplishes,
	as nearly as possible, the original intention of the Parties with respect thereto and
	without materially changing the economic value of the transactions contemplated hereby.

	This
	Agreement constitutes the final, complete, and exclusive statement of the terms of the
	agreement among the Parties pertaining to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes
	all prior and contemporaneous understandings or agreements of the Parties (other than
	those referenced in this Agreement). No Party has been induced to enter into this Agreement
	by, nor is any Party relying on, any representation or warranty outside those expressly
	set forth in this Agreement.






	 






	8.08




	No
	terms or conditions of this Agreement will be varied or modified by any prior or subsequent
	statement, conduct or act of any Party, except that the Parties may supplement, amend,
	or modify this Agreement by a subsequent written agreement executed by the Parties through
	their authorized representatives.






	 






	8.09




	In
	making and performing this Agreement, the Parties are acting, and intend to be treated,
	as independent entities and nothing contained in this Agreement will be construed or
	implied to create an agency, partnership, joint venture, or employer and employee relationship
	among the Parties. Except as otherwise provided herein, no Party may make any representation,
	warranty or commitment, whether express or implied, on behalf of or incur any charges
	or expenses for or in the name of any other Party. No Party will be liable for the act
	of any other Party unless such act is expressly authorized in writing by both such Parties.






	 






	8.10




	No
	waiver of a breach, failure of any condition, or any right or remedy, contained in or
	granted by the provisions of this Agreement will be effective unless it is in writing
	and signed by the Party waiving the breach, failure, right or remedy. No waiver of any
	breach, failure, right or remedy will be deemed a waiver of any other breach, failure,
	right or remedy, whether or not similar, nor will any waiver constitute a continuing
	waiver unless the writing so specifies.






	 






	8.11




	Each
	Party and its counsel have participated fully in the review and revision of this Agreement.
	Any rule of construction to the effect that ambiguities are to be resolved against the

	This
	Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, and each counterpart will be

	agreement. The Parties will accept facsimile signatures for establishing an Effective
	Date provided original signatures are provided to each Party within a reasonable time
	thereafter.

	Mutual
	Proprietary Information Agreement, dated January 12, 2015, enclosed.




	 






	SolAero
	Contact: Navid Fatemi




	 





	MUTUAL
	PROPRIETARY INFORMATION AGREEMENT





	 




	This
	Mutual Proprietary Information Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into between SolAero Technologies Corp., a Delaware
	corporation having an office at 10420 Research Road S.E., Albuquerque, New Mexico 87123 on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries
	("SolAero"), and NanoFlex Power Corporation, a Florida Corporation having an office at 17207 N. Perimeter Drive, Suite
	210, Scottsdale, Arizona 85255 ("Participant"). Collectively SolAero and Participant may be referred to as the "Parties"
	or singly as the "Party." Effective as of the date of the second signature below, the parties agree as follows:




	 




	1.            

	Scope

	. The Parties intend to pursue a business relationship regarding a technology transfer opportunity ("Project"),
	and in the course of which the parties may exchange Proprietary Information, as hereinafter defined. The Parties further desire
	to protect such Proprietary Information from unauthorized disclosure and use under the terms and conditions herein.




	 




	2.            

	Definition

	. For purposes of this Agreement, "Proprietary Information" means all information relating to a Party's
	products (including without limitation prototypes, samples, materials, plans, diagrams, and descriptions), processes, services,
	and/or business operations, whether oral or written, tangible or intangible, disclosed by one Party ("Disclosing Party")
	to the other Party ("Receiving Party"), including without limitation information gained by observation of a Party's
	processes, equipment, or facilities, as well as any information or data that evidence, record, derive from, or reveal any Proprietary
	Information.




	 




	3.            

	Designation

	. Proprietary Information shall be designated as such in writing by the Disclosing Party by appropriate confidential
	or proprietary markings. If certain information is considered and held by a Party as a trade secret, the information shall be
	marked "trade secret." If first disclosed in an oral or other intangible manner, the Disclosing Party shall: (a) contemporaneously
	identify such disclosure as being in confidence; (b) reduce such disclosure to written form; (c) mark such writing as confidential
	or proprietary; and (d) deliver such marked document to the Receiving Party within thirty (30) days after the date of first disclosure;
	provided that the information disclosed shall be treated as Proprietary Information during such 30-day confirmation period.




	 




	4.            

	Duty of Care

	. The Receiving Party shall preserve in confidence all Proprietary Information received hereunder by exercising
	at least the same degree of care used to restrict disclosure and use of the Receiving Party's own confidential and proprietary
	information, but at least a reasonable degree of care. All employees or agents of the Receiving Party involved with the Project
	must be subject to confidentiality restrictions that are at least as restrictive as those set forth in this Agreement. The Receiving
	Party shall refrain from disclosing Proprietary Information to any third party, any affiliated company, or to its employees or
	agents not involved with the Project, without prior written authorization from the Disclosing Party. Receiving Party may disclose
	Proprietary Information to any affiliate and/or subsidiary that has a need to know, and that agrees to be bound by the terms and
	conditions of this NDA.




	 




	5.            

	Limited Use

	. The Receiving Party shall use all Proprietary Information received hereunder solely in connection with the
	Project. Any other use of Proprietary Information is explicitly forbidden. Without limiting the foregoing, the Receiving Party
	shall not reverse engineer or otherwise decompile or disassemble any Proprietary Information. This restriction shall survive termination
	of this Agreement.




	 




	6.            

	Exceptions

	. This Agreement shall not restrict the disclosure or use of any information that is: (a) now, or hereafter becomes,
	through no act or failure to act on the part of the Receiving Party, generally known or available to the public; (b) already known
	by the Receiving Party as of the first disclosure hereunder, as evidenced by the Receiving Party's written records; (c) hereafter
	furnished to the Receiving Party, as a matter of right and without restriction on disclosure, by a third party not subject to
	similar confidentiality obligations; (d) approved for disclosure in writing by the Disclosing Party; or (e) independently developed
	by the Receiving Party by persons without access to and use of Proprietary Information, as evidenced by the Receiving Party's
	written records.




	 




	7.            

	Judicial
	Process

	. The Receiving Party may disclose Proprietary Information to the extent required pursuant to a final court order;
	provided that the Receiving Party: (a) promptly notifies the Disclosing Party upon its receipt of any pleading, discovery request,
	interrogatory, motion, investigative demand, subpoena, or other paper that requests or demands the disclosure of Proprietary Information;
	and (b) assists the Disclosing Party in opposing and/or limiting such request, and seeking a protective order for any court-mandated
	disclosures.

	8.           

	Protection
	of Non-Public Information

	. One or both of the Parties to this Agreement is a publicly held corporation. In connection
	therewith, the Receiving Party acknowledges that it is aware (and that its directors, officers, employees and agents who are
	apprised of the Project have been, or will be, advised) that the United States securities laws prohibit any person who has
	material non-public information concerning the matters which are the subject of this Agreement from purchasing or selling
	securities of either party (or options, rights and warrants relating thereto) or from communicating such information to any
	other person under circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such person is likely to purchase or sell such
	securities. The Receiving Party agrees that neither the Receiving Party nor its directors, officers, employees or agents will
	(i) use, nor cause any person to use, any Proprietary Information or other information in contravention of the Exchange Act
	and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, including Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 or (ii) disclose any information that
	constitutes material non-public information regarding the Disclosing Party for purposes of Regulation FD of the SEC or any
	other federal or state securities laws (it being acknowledged and agreed that the provisions of this Agreement with respect
	to such information are reasonably necessary to comply with Regulation FD and/or such other federal and state securities
	laws). The Receiving Party shall notify the Disclosing Party in writing immediately upon discovery of any use or disclosure
	of Proprietary Information or other information in violation or non-compliance with this section. The obligations set forth
	in this section shall survive termination of this Agreement.




	 




	9.          

	Unauthorized Use

	. The Receiving Party shall notify the Disclosing Party in writing immediately upon discovery of any unauthorized
	use or disclosure of Proprietary Information, and shall reasonably cooperate with the Disclosing Party to regain possession of
	the Proprietary Information and prevent any further unauthorized use or disclosure.




	 




	10.        

	No License or Warranty

	. Proprietary Information shall remain the property of the Disclosing Party. Neither this Agreement
	nor any exchange of Proprietary Information hereunder shall be construed as granting any right or license under any copyright,
	invention, patent, trade secret, or other intellectual property ("IP") right owned or controlled by the Disclosing Party.
	Proprietary Information transmitted or exchanged under this Agreement is provided "as-is," and shall not constitute
	any representation, warranty, assurance, guarantee, or inducement by the Disclosing Party with respect to the content, completeness,
	or accuracy of any information transmitted or exchanged by the Parties or to the non-infringement of any IP right owned or controlled
	by any third party. No warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose is provided hereunder for any Proprietary
	Information. A Receiving Party shall use and rely upon Proprietary Information at its sole risk and expense.




	 




	11.        

	Term

	. This Agreement shall terminate upon completion of the Project or three (3) years after Effective Date whichever is
	longer, unless earlier terminated by either Party upon thirty (30) days written notice to the other Party. The confidentiality
	obligations under this Agreement shall survive termination of this Agreement for a period of five (5) years, except for any trade
	secrets, which shall be held in confidence for so long as the trade secret is maintained by the Disclosing Party. Upon termination,
	the Receiving Party shall cease all use of the Disclosing Party's Proprietary Information. Upon the Disclosing Party's written
	request, the Receiving Party shall promptly return to the Disclosing Party (or destroy and provide a written certification of
	destruction, if so requested) all Proprietary Information disclosed hereunder.




	 




	12.        

	No Contract

	NanoFlex
	Signs its First Commercial License Agreement with






	SolAero Technologies, a Global Leader in High Efficiency Solar Cells






	 






	Scottsdale,
	AZ, (Date2017)

	– NanoFlex Power Corporation (“NanoFlex”) (OTCQB:OPVS), a developer of advanced solar technologies,
	today announced it has entered into a license agreement with SolAero Technologies Corporation, a global leader in high performance
	photovoltaics for space and terrestrial applications. For the last two years, NanoFlex and SolAero have partnered to validate
	NanoFlex’s patented, non-destructive epitaxial lift-off (“ND-ELO”) process and related technologies in SolAero's
	ultra-high efficiency solar cells.




	 




	ND-ELO
	technology has the potential to reduce compound semiconductor production costs by more than 40% by enabling reuse of the expensive
	wafer substrate. This breakthrough process technology was invented at the University of Michigan by Professor Steven Forrest’s
	research team and has been further developed by NanoFlex. NanoFlex has the exclusive worldwide rights to license, sub-license,
	and bring its own products to market using this ND-ELO technology. In addition to reduced cost, NanoFlex’s ND-ELO process
	enables very high performance solar cells in lightweight and flexible thin film form factors, providing reduced weight and improved
	design flexibility for demanding applications. These applications include not only satellites, but unmanned aerial vehicles, mobile
	military power and other high performance aerospace and defense solutions. As well, ND-ELO offers exciting potential for commercial
	solar applications where thin film, high performance solar solutions fit unique requirements on buildings or in solar farms where
	real estate availability is limited.




	 




	Under
	the terms of the non-exclusive agreement, NanoFlex and SolAero will jointly commercialize NanoFlex’s technology as part
	of SolAero’s products. NanoFlex received up-front development funding from SolAero and will receive a running royalty associated
	with space solar cells fabricated using the licensed technology.




	 




	“We
	are pleased to enter into this important strategic relationship with SolAero, a leader in the satellite power market and a company
	we have long admired. The significance of the license agreement with SolAero cannot be underestimated as it validates our breakthrough
	ND-ELO technology and sets us on a path toward commercialization with an industry leader. We believe this breakthrough will enable
	solar cells with efficiencies exceeding 30% at commercially competitive costs in demanding applications - both space and terrestrial,”
	said NanoFlex Chief Executive Officer Dean Ledger.




	 




	“We
	have worked with NanoFlex for the last two years to validate this important manufacturing process technology. With the successful
	validation of wafer recycling technology, we look toward to the commercialization of ND-ELO as a key aspect of SolAero's advanced
	solar cell manufacturing. The thin film form factor enabled by ND-ELO will expand applications for SolAero’s products in
	space and open up new opportunities in aviation and as part of terrestrial solutions,” said SolAero Chief Executive Officer
	Brad Clevenger.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

Ask away.  We have answers.



Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.
