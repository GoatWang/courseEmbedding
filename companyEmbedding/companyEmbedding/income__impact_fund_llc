Glossary




Objective
The fund's investment objectives are high current income and total return.


Highlights

Balanced equity & debt strategy focused on providing current income & total return potential while reducing US interest rates sensitivity
Diversification potential – lower historical correlations among asset classes provides opportunity for more consistent returns

Managed by specialists in several non-traditional asset classes, providing retail income-oriented investors access to institutional strategies where active professional management can potentially add value to the fund’s total return




Investment Strategy
The fund invests approximately equal proportions in 1) U.S. and foreign dividend-paying common stocks, 2) dividend-paying common Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) issued by real estate companies, 3) emerging markets sovereign debt, and 4) adjustable rate senior loans. The fund expects to invest between 40% and 70% of its managed assets in equity security holdings and between 30% and 60% of its managed assets in debt security holdings. Under normal circumstances, the fund's target weighting is approximately 50% equity and 50% debt. The fund uses leverage.

RISKSInvestment, Market, and Price Risk: Closed-end fund shares are subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of the entire principal amount that you invest.  Common shares frequently trade at a discount to their NAV.  At any point in time, your common shares may be worth less than you paid, even after considering the reinvestment of fund distributions.Common Stock Risk: Common stock returns often have experienced significant volatility.Real Estate Securities Risk: Real estate securities such as REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) may be affected by economic downturns and changes in real estate values, rents, property taxes, interest rates and tax laws, in addition to geographical concentration risks.Senior Loan Risk: Senior loans, both secured and unsecured, may not be rated by a national rating agency, are  generally not registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and generally are not listed on a securities exchange. Consequently, the amount of public information available about senior loans generally is less extensive than that available for more widely rated, registered and exchange-listed securities.  In addition, some adjustable rate loans may be unsecured or insufficiently collateralized, which increases the risk of fund losses if the loan’s issuer defaults.Credit Risk: Debt or preferred securities held by the fund may fail to make dividend or interest payments when due.  Investments in securities below investment grade credit quality are predominantly speculative and subject to greater volatility and risk of default.  Unrated securities are evaluated by fund managers using industry data and their own analysis processes that may be similar to that of a nationally recognized rating agency; however, such internal ratings are not equivalent to a national agency credit rating. Counterparty credit risk may arise if counterparties fail to meet their obligations, should the fund hold any derivative instruments for either investment exposure or hedging purposes.Foreign Investment Risk: Investments in non-U.S securities involve special risks not typically associated with domestic investments including currency risk, if not hedged - the risk that changes in exchange rates will affect the value of the fund’s investments, as well as adverse political, social and economic developments. These risks often are magnified in emerging markets.Leverage Risk: The fund’s use of leverage may cause higher volatility for the fund’s per share NAV, market price, and distributions.  Leverage typically magnifies the total return of the fund’s portfolio, whether that return is positive or negative. Leverage is intended to increase common share net income, but there is no assurance that the fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful.  Different forms of leverage, including swaps, may introduce additional credit or interest rate risk. Leverage may also increase a fund’s liquidity risk, as the fund may need to sell securities at inopportune times to stay within fund or regulatory limits.Tax Risk: The tax treatment of fund distributions may be affected by future changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation by the Internal Revenue Service or state tax authorities.Preferred Securities Risk: Preferred securities are subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company’s capital structure, and therefore are subject to greater credit risk.Interest Rate Risk: Fixed-income securities such as bonds, preferred, convertible and other debt securities will decline in value if market interest rates rise.Basis Risk: As short-term rates change, interest from floating rate loans may not increase in concert with increases in floating rate leverage, introducing basis or imperfect hedging risk.Illiquid Securities Risk: The fund may not be able to sell securities in its portfolio at the time or price the fund desires.Currency Risk: Changes in exchange rates will affect the value of the fund’s investments.
NOTES


					** The premium/discount is calculated as (most recent price/most recent NAV) -1.






†† Managed Distribution Policy

				Historical distribution sources have included net investment income, realized gains and return of capital. If a distribution includes anything other than net investment income, the fund provides a notice of the best estimate of its distribution sources at that time which may be viewed at nuveen.com/CEFdistributions. These estimates may not match the final tax characterization (for the full year’s distributions) contained in shareholders’ 1099-DIV forms after the end of the year. You should not draw any conclusions about a fund’s past or future investment performance from its current distribution rate.
			

				Distribution rates represent the latest declared regular distribution, annualized, relative to the most recent market price and NAV. Special distributions, including special capital gains distributions, are not included in the calculation.

Positively Impacting Communities Nationwide












CCM Spotlight
Residents first moved into the Coffelt-Lamoreaux Homes in 1954 marking the completion of the first public housing project in Maricopa County, Arizona.  The property’s 301 units were originally built for returning Korean war veterans and migrant/seasonal farmworkers during the Harry S. Truman administration.  It is currently listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
In 2015, the homes began a comprehensive renovation with plans of completion in 2017.  The renovation includes: a 1.4 acre park, community center with an onsite health clinic, computer learning center, children and adult educational activities, and workforce linkages.  Located just miles from downtown Phoenix, the homes are located in a low-income census tract where 95% of the population are minorities and 63% live below the poverty line.  The Coffelt-Lamoreaux Homes today serves low-income individuals, over half of which are children in households where 71% are home to single-parents.





Community Capital Management, Inc. is an investment adviser registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Any of the securities identified and described herein are current holdings and for illustrative purposes.  Their selection was based upon non-performance criteria, such as the security’s social and/or environmental attributes.  Impact figures mentioned on this website are approximate values.  Past performance does not guarantee future results.  Market conditions can vary widely over time and can result in a loss of portfolio value.

Multi.
Total Income+ Real Estate Fund:
Diversifying through a multi-manager, multi-strategy, and multi-sector investment approach.









The Bluerock Total Income+ Real Estate Fund (the “Fund”) is a public fund utilizing a multi-manager, multi-strategy, and multi-sector approach. The Fund allows individuals to invest in private, institutional real estate securities alongside some of the nation’s largest endowment and pension plans. The Total Income+ Real Estate Fund is a continuously offered, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that is operated as an interval fund.
Potential Investment Benefits:

Income
Primarily derived from investing in income producing institutional real estate investment funds.
Portfolio Diversification
To seek a combination of current income, capital preservation and long-term capital appreciation, the Fund’s portfolio is intended to be widely diversified by manager, strategy, property sector and geography. The Fund intends to pursue an 80% private/20% public real estate allocation.
Daily Net Asset Value (NAV)
The Fund’s NAV is calculated and published each day after the close of the New York Stock Exchange.
Liquidity
The Fund’s interval structure allows for the redemption at NAV of a stated portion of outstanding shares each quarter.
Capital Appreciation
Sought through the selection of investments that provide the opportunity to achieve long-term growth with low to moderate volatility.
Low Correlation
The Fund strategically invests in a combination of institutional, private and publicly traded real estate investments that may be lower correlated to the broader equity and fixed income markets.
Low Volatility
The Fund primarily invests in institutional private equity real estate which has historically experienced less volatility than the broader markets.
This is an actively managed dynamic portfolio. There is no guarantee that any investment (or this investment) will achieve its objectives, goals, generate positive returns, or avoid losses.






Access.
Total Income+ Real Estate Fund:
Access to top institutional fund managers.








Asset Allocation
Decades ago, portfolio construction was simply a matter of allocating to stocks and bonds. Today, portfolio construction suggets a need for additional types of investments often referred to as "alternatives," including assets such as real estate, and many others.

Institutional Private Equity Real Estate (iPERE)
Institutional private equity real estate (iPERE) can be described as high-quality commercial properties that are usually congregated in large investment portfolios managed professionally on behalf of third-party owners or beneficiaries.
Since the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries (NCREIF) began measuring iPERE in 1978, only four years have experienced negative returns. NPI tends to perform much like the traded REIT sector over long periods of time only with much less volatility.




           Institutional Private EquityReal Estate (iPERE)





Our Strategy
Adding real estate to a traditional investment portfolio of stocks, bonds, and treasury bills introduces a historically non-correlated asset that may reduce risk and enhance overall return. The Fund provides access to a diversified holding of large, private, real estate securities typically available only to institutions (and without the large minimum investment and long holding period normally required).
