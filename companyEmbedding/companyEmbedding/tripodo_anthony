Mr. Julio Quintana, TESCO President and Chief Executive Officer stated, "We are very excited about attracting someone of Tony's caliber to TESCO. The fact that Tony is willing to join us is but another example of the recognition in the industry of TESCO's bright future. Tony's extensive experience in transitioning and growing public service companies will serve TESCO very well as we continue to increase shareholder value."
Mr. Tripodo replaces Mr. Michael Kearney, who has chosen to leave TESCO to pursue other interests. Mr. Quintana added, "I want to personally thank Mike for the time and effort he put into moving TESCO to where we are today. TESCO has experienced excellent growth over the last two years and Mike helped make this happen. All of us at TESCO wish Mike the very best in the coming years."
Tesco Corporation is a global leader in the design, manufacture and service of technology based solutions for the upstream energy industry. The Corporation's mandate is to change the way people drill wells by delivering safer and more efficient solutions that add real value by reducing the costs of drilling for and producing oil and gas.
