                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Fitch to Rate Nissan Auto Receivables 2015-B Owner Trust; Issues Presale | Business Wire


























































      Fitch to Rate Nissan Auto Receivables 2015-B Owner Trust; Issues Presale
    





July 13, 2015 09:48 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings expects to assign the following ratings and Rating 
      Outlooks to the Nissan Auto Receivables 2015-B Owner Trust notes:
    

      --$210,000,000 class A-1 notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$370,000,000 class A-2a/A-2b notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$320,000,000 class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$100,000,000 class A-4 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Consistent Collateral Pool: The collateral composition and credit 
      quality of 2015-B are generally consistent with those of prior pools. 
      The weighted average (WA) Fair Isaac Corp. (FICO) score is 774, new 
      vehicles total 91%, Nissan brand vehicles represent nearly 89% and the 
      pool is geographically diverse.
    

      Extended-Term Loans: Loans with terms of more than 60 months total 53% 
      of the pool, which includes 73-75-month original term loans that total 
      less than 4%. This is the fifth NAROT pool to include 73-75-month loan 
      terms.
    

      Sufficient Enhancement: 2015-B incorporates a sequential-pay structure, 
      and initial hard credit enhancement (CE) totals 4.25%, consistent with 
      recent transactions. CE is sufficient to cover Fitch's 'AAAsf' stressed 
      lifetime cumulative net loss (CNL) assumption.
    

      Stable Portfolio/Securitization Performance: NMAC portfolio and 
      securitization delinquencies and losses are currently stable and were 
      within historical levels at year-end 2015 (YE2015).
    

      Stable Origination, Underwriting and Servicing: Fitch believes NMAC 
      demonstrates adequate abilities as originator, underwriter and servicer 
      to service 2015-B, as evidenced by its historical portfolio and 
      securitization performance.
    

      Evolving Wholesale Market: The U.S. wholesale vehicle market (WVM) is 
      normalizing following strong performance in recent years. Fitch expects 
      increasing used vehicle supply from off-lease vehicles and trade-ins to 
      pressure ABS recovery rates, leading to moderately higher loss rates. 
      Fitch's analysis accounts for this risk by including periods of weak WVM 
      performance in the derivation of its base case loss expectation.
    

      Integrity of Legal Structure: The legal structure of a transaction 
      should provide that a bankruptcy of NMAC would not impair the timeliness 
      of payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case. This in turn could result in potential rating actions on the 
      notes. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to all 
      classes of 2015-B to increased losses over the life of the transaction. 
      Fitch's analysis found that the notes display some sensitivity to 
      increased defaults and losses. Under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case 
      loss) scenario the notes would be unlikely to experience any downgrade. 
      However, the notes could experience downgrades of up to two rating 
      categories under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from Ernst 
      & Young LLP. The third-party due diligence focused on comparing or 
      recalculating certain information with respect to 125 loans from the 
      final data file. Fitch considered this information in its analysis, and 
      the findings did not have an impact the analysis. A copy of the ABS Due 
      Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this transaction 
      may be obtained through the link contained on the bottom of the related 
      rating action commentary.
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this 
      transaction can be found in the reports titled ' Nissan Auto Receivables 
      2015-B Owner Trust -- Appendix'. These R&W are compared to those of 
      typical R&W for the asset class as detailed in the special report 
      'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global 
      Structured Finance Transactions' dated June 12, 2015.

Fitch Affirms Four Classes of Nissan Auto Receivables 2015-B Owner Trust | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms Four Classes of Nissan Auto Receivables 2015-B Owner Trust
    





June 30, 2016 11:33 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--As part of its ongoing surveillance, Fitch Ratings affirms four 
      outstanding classes of the Nissan Auto Receivables 2015-B Owner Trust at 
      their current ratings. A full list of rating actions follows at the end 
      of this release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations are based on available credit enhancement (CE) and loss 
      performance. The collateral pool continues to perform within Fitch's 
      expectations. Based on the current structure and CE, the securities are 
      able to withstand stress scenarios consistent with the original ratings 
      and make full payments to investors in accordance with the terms of the 
      documents.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      could produce loss levels higher than the current projected base case 
      loss proxy, and impact available loss coverage and multiples levels for 
      the transaction. Lower loss coverage could impact ratings and Rating 
      Outlooks, depending on the extent of the decline in coverage.
    

      In Fitch's initial review of the transaction, the notes were found to 
      have limited sensitivity to a 1.5x and 2.5x increase of Fitch's base 
      case loss expectation. To date, the transaction has exhibited strong 
      performance with losses well within Fitch's initial expectations with 
      rising loss coverage and multiple levels. As such, a material 
      deterioration in performance would have to occur within the asset pool 
      to have potential negative impact on the outstanding ratings.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.
    

      Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:
    

      Nissan Auto Receivables Owner Trust 2015-B
    

      --Class A-2a at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-2b at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.
