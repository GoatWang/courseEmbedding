Utah Family Law Attorneys
Perhaps one of the most trying times for an individual or family is when a couple divorces.  Although basic forms can be obtained and filled out online, because of the many serious and critical issues pertaining to child custody, visitation, child support, alimony, division of debts and assets, no one should try to go through a divorce without the help of competent legal counsel.  Divorce decrees are very difficult to modify, so they should be done right the first time.
Utah Estate Planning Attorneys
Our estate planning and probate department has extensive experience in crafting wills and creating trusts, assisting in estate planning and protection, and providing representation in the appointment of personal representatives, trustees, guardians and conservators.
Witt and Associates prides itself on providing you with a qualified criminal and personal injury lawyer Utah can trust in your case. Rest assured that each of our lawyers will provide you with high-caliber representation you deserve. For queries or consultations, contact our law firm today.
Wills
You may wonder whether or not you need a will. In other words, what happens if you do not have a will? The short answer is in the "power of appointment". With a will you can appoint whom you want to be the personal representative of your estate and how you want that person to distribute any remaining personal or real assets after paying any outstanding debts or taxes. If you have minor children, you can also appoint whom you would like to be your children's guardian. Without a will all these matters may be contested and left up to the court. All decedent estates must go through probate court whether that person had a will or not. Probate can sometimes be quite expensive.
Trusts
The main benefits of transferring your assets to a trust are:

Many expenses may be tax deductible and thereby lower your tax liability each year;
Your estate will avoid having to go through probate court which will save a lot of time and money; and 
Your trust assets are not charged an estate tax before distribution to your heirs, with some limitations.

As part of your trust package we also prepare a power of attorney, a living will and a pour-over will. Finally, we make sure all your assets are actually transferred into your trust. While it is true that a person can go online and print off some do-it-yourself wills or trusts, that is not advisable. One of the greatest benefits of having Witt & Associates help you with a will or trust package is not the forms, but in providing you with personal consultation, guidance and advice in creating those very important documents.

The truth is, slip and fall injuries can cause devastating injuries and financial hardship. People have received permanent spinal cord injuries, or be constrained to a wheelchair for the rest of their lives due to a slip and fall. Sometimes these falls can be caused by objects in a walking path, a hole, or a slippery substance.Medical MalpracticeA: Most attorneys who believe a case has merit will take the case without payment up front. They will take the case on a contingency basis, which means they will receive a percentage of your award if and when you recover for your injuries. Contingency fees average between 25 and 40 percent. Most attorneys charge a smaller percentage if the case is settled before the attorney does all the work necessary to go to trial. In medical malpractice actions, contingency fees are limited to one third of the amount recovered. If you and your attorney agree to a contingency fee, the attorney must put the agreement in writing and provide you with a signed copy. Some attorneys may charge an hourly fee or a flat fee for their services.Auto AccidentsDog BitesSurveys show that there are over 4.7 million dog bites annually, and over 1,000 people are treated in emergency rooms daily because of dog bites. Many people choose to own breeds of dogs that are considered more ferocious, such as a Doberman, Rottweiler, Pitbull, Dalmation, or German Shepherd. These dogs tend to get the majority of the press, although almost any dog can inflict a serious wound, especially on a child. The most common bite area on a child is on the face.Business and Corporate LawBusiness FormationA number of attorneysâ€™ practices include business formation, transaction and litigation related services. This includes incorporation, employment and service contracts, pension and profit sharing plans, buy-sell agreements and mergers-acquisitions.Business DisputesWitt & Associates has extensive experience and expertise in most areas of the law, including Personal Injury, Criminal Justice, Family Law, Commercial Services, Business Law, Real Estate, Estate Planning and Probate, Domestic Relations, Municipal Law and General Litigation.Business TransactionsWe represent buyers, sellers, and builders, handling every legal aspect of a purchase or a sale, including: Real estate closings, Buyer and seller agreements, For sale by owner, Preparation of real estate documents, including easements, deeds, Preparation of contracts and contingency letter or agreements, and leases, Contract review, Title issues, Commercial Closings, Due Diligence for residential and commercial transactions, Residential Closings, Boundary disputes, Contract disputes, and Partition Suits.

Search results are sorted by a combination of factors to give you a set of choices in response to your search criteria. These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions. YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Sponsored LinksAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection1. Witt Law Offices491 N Bluff StSaint George, UT 84770(435) 673-8400AttorneysWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection2. Witt Law OfficesBBB Rating: A+169 W 2710 South Cir Ste 202aSaint George, UT 84790(435) 673-8400AttorneysAdoption Law AttorneysWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection3. Marshall Law OfficesBBB Rating: A+135 N 900 E Ste 5Saint George, UT 84770(435) 628-4558AttorneysCriminal Law AttorneysWebsiteBusinesses in related categories to Fire DepartmentsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection4. Siegfried & Jensen(4)5664 S Green StSalt Lake City, UT 84123(801) 203-3360Personal Injury Law AttorneysWebsiteSee Our ServicesDirectionsMore InfoOver a year ago I was involved in a Trax accident.
