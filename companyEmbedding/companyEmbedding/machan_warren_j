Paul Mitchell
From the start, the Paul Mitchell hair care collection was designed to be different from others on the market. DeJoria and Mitchell felt that there was something missing from the hair care industry: products that were more effective than the ordinary formulas sold nationally but less expensive than the luxury products used at high-end salons. Paul Mitchell hair care products were designed to fall perfectly in the middle, and today, the brand remains known for creating shampoos, conditioners and styling aids that deliver professional results at affordable prices. View Products


Aquage
Aquage is an innovative haircare line designed to nourish and protect hair. Aquage Hair Care is designed to make styling and finishing easier and more professional. They provide a streamlined product offering of shampoos, conditioners, styling, and finishing all enhanced with nutrient rich sea botanicals and invigorated with Aquage's Haircare Algaeplex®.
