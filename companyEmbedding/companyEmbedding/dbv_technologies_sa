Viaskin® Peanut




DBV’ lead product candidate, Viaskin® Peanut, is being developed for the treatment of peanut allergies in adults and children.


On September 22nd, 2014, we have announced topline results for our VIPES (Viaskin® Peanut’s Efficacy and Safety) phase IIb clinical trial of Viaskin Peanut in peanut allergic patients.





The trial met its primary endpoint at the highest explored dose (Viaskin Peanut 250 µg), achieving statistical significance (p=0.0108) in desensitizing a higher proportion of patients versus placebo after 12 months of Epicutaneous Immunotherapy (EPIT®). Patients treated with Viaskin Peanut 250 µg also showed statistically significant changes in measured serological markers while placebo patients did not exhibit material differences. The safety profile was confirmed across all active arms with no serious treatment-related adverse events reported, and patient compliance with daily Viaskin Peanut application was above 97%. The trial drop-out rate was 6.4%, below the 15% rate initially anticipated. The VIPES trial is the largest clinical trial in peanut allergy desensitization ever completed, and full results of efficacy and safety will presented at future scientific meetings. 







Viaskin® Milk




Our second product candidate, Viaskin® Milk, is being developed for children (including infants) for the treatment of milk allergy and EoE.


Proof-of-concept data from a pilot clinical trial of Viaskin® Milk was published in The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology in 2010.
In the second half of 2014, DBV Technologies intend to initiate MILES trial, a multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized Phase I/II safety and efficacy clinical trial of Viaskin® Milk in the pediatric patient population with CMPA. In the first half of 2015, with DBV Technologies assistance, the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia intends to initiate a multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial to study safety and efficacy of Viaskin® Milk in pediatric patient populations with milk-induced EoE. 










Viaskin®
Egg




We are also developing Viaskin® Egg as a treatment that we believe can reduce the clinical manifestations of hen’s egg allergy.


We recently begun pre-clinical work for
this product candidate with the goal of initiating a clinical program if these
studies are successful.

We estimate that we will receive net proceeds from the global offering of 
approximately $105.0 (€82.5) million, based on the public offering price of 
$21.64 per ADS in the U.S. offering and €34.00 per ordinary share in the French 
registered private placement, after deducting underwriting discounts and 
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, and assuming no 
exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional ordinary shares 
and ADSs. If the underwriters exercise in full their options to purchase 
additional ordinary shares and ADSs in the U.S. offering and additional 
ordinary shares in the French registered private placement, we estimate that 
we will receive net proceeds from the global offering of approximately $121.3 
(€95.2) million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and 
estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of the global offering are to increase our financial 
flexibility, create a public market for our securities in the United States 
and facilitate our access to the public equity markets. We currently expect to 
use the net proceeds from the global offering as follows:

. approximately $40.0 million to advance the development of our Viaskin Peanut 
  and Viaskin Milk product candidates;

. approximately $10.0 million to fund our earlier stage development activities, 
  including our development programs in eosinophilic esophagitis and pertusiss 
  boost vaccine;

. approximately $30.0 million to build-out our clinical and commercial 
  infrastructure in the United States; and

. approximately $20.0 million to support our growth globally by expanding 
  general, administrative and operational functions in our headquarters in 
  France.

We expect to use the remainder of any net proceeds from the global offering 
for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to in-license, acquire or invest 
in complementary technologies, products or assets. However we have no current 
plan, commitments or obligations to do so.

Based on our current operation plans and assumptions, we expect that the net 
proceeds from the global offering, combined with our current operating capital, 
will be sufficient to support the advancement of our Viaskin Peanut product 
candidate through the completion of our planned Phase III clinical trial and, 
pending the results of this trial, the submission of a BLA for this product 
candidate, as well as the advancement of our Viaskin Milk product candidate 
through the end of our planned Phase II clinical trial for this product 
candidate. However, there can be no assurance that these expectations will be 
correct.

We currently have no specific plans as to how the net proceeds from the global 
offering will be allocated beyond the uses specified above and therefore 
management will retain discretion to allocate the remainder of the net proceeds 
of the global offering among these uses.

This expected use of the net proceeds from the global offering represents our 
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. As of the date 
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular 
uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of the global 
offering or the amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth 
above. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures and the extent of 
clinical development may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, 
including the progress of our development efforts, the status of and results 
from pre-clinical studies and any ongoing clinical trials or clinical trials 
we may commence in the future, as well as any collaborations that we may enter 
into with third parties for our product candidates and any unforeseen cash 
needs. As a result, our management will retain broad discretion over the 
allocation of the net proceeds from the global offering.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from the global offering, we intend to 
invest the net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, 
including short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments.


The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and 
subject to significant and rapid technological change as researchers learn more 
about diseases and develop new technologies and treatments. Significant 
competitive factors in our industry include product efficacy and safety; quality
and breadth of an organization’s technology; skill of an organization’s 
employees and its ability to recruit and retain key employees; timing and scope 
of regulatory approvals; government reimbursement rates for, and the average 
selling price of, products; the availability of raw materials and qualified 
manufacturing capacity; manufacturing costs; intellectual property and patent 
rights and their protection; and sales and marketing capabilities.

We cannot assure you that any of our products that we successfully develop will 
be clinically superior or scientifically preferable to products developed or 
introduced by our competitors.

Our competitors may also succeed in obtaining FDA or other regulatory approvals 
for their product candidates more rapidly than we are able to do, which could 
place us at a significant competitive disadvantage or deny us marketing 
exclusivity rights. Market acceptance of our product candidates will depend on 
a number of factors, including: (1) potential advantages over existing or 
alternative therapies or tests, (2) the actual or perceived safety of similar 
classes of products, (3) the effectiveness of sales, marketing, and 
distribution capabilities, and (4) the scope of any approval provided by the 
FDA or foreign regulatory authorities.

Although we believe our product candidates possess attractive attributes, we 
cannot assure you that our product candidates will achieve regulatory or market
acceptance, or that we will be able to compete effectively in the 
biopharmaceutical drug markets. If our product candidates fail to gain 
regulatory approvals and acceptance in their intended markets, we may not 
generate meaningful revenues or achieve profitability.

There are numerous competitors on the market for the therapeutic treatment of 
allergies. Numerous structures, pharmaceutical laboratories, biotechnology 
companies, institutions, universities and other research entities are actively 
involved in the discovery, research, development and marketing of therapeutic 
responses to treat allergies. Many of our competitors have greater resources 
and experience in terms of clinical development, management, manufacturing, 
marketing and research than us.

In the case of food allergies, we are aware of several academic studies that 
are currently being conducted in major centers and hospitals worldwide. These 
studies are evaluating sublingual, subcutaneous, intranasal or other forms of 
desensitization or products using synthetic allergens, denatured allergens or 
combinations of medicines or methods, or medicines using traditional methods 
such as Chinese herbs. We are not aware of any pharmaceutical development in 
conjunction with these academic efforts at this time.

We expect studies combining other methods of immunotherapy, such as OIT, with 
anti-IgE treatments will be conducted. These types of co-administrations may 
significantly improve the safety of specific immunotherapies administered 
orally or subcutaneously, and may become significant competitors with our 
products.

To our knowledge, other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are also 
seeking to develop food allergy treatments, although many are in the discovery 
or preclinical stages. For example, Allergen Research Corporation is currently 
evaluating in Phase II clinical trials a formulation of peanut flour for oral 
administration intended for oral desensitization. We are aware of other 
companies that are working on recombinant peanut proteins capable of initiating 
an attenuated immune response of using subcutaneous administration. We are also
aware that Sanofi S.A. has entered into licensing agreements of discovery 
platforms in selected food allergies, notably with Immune Design Corp. and 
Selecta Biosciences Inc. and may pose a competitive risk to our products in 
the future.


Company Description
We are a clinical-stage specialty biopharmaceutical company focused on changing 
the field of immunotherapy by developing a novel technology platform called 
Viaskin. Our therapeutic approach is based on epicutaneous immunotherapy, or 
EPIT, our proprietary method of delivering biologically active


 compounds to 
the immune system through intact skin using Viaskin. We have generated 
significant data demonstrating that Viaskin’s mechanism of action is novel and 
differentiated, as it targets specific antigen-presenting immune cells in the 
skin, called Langerhans cells, that capture the antigen and migrate to the 
lymph node in order to activate the immune system without passage of the 
antigen into the bloodstream. We are advancing this unique technology to treat 
patients, including infants and children, suffering from severe food allergies, 
for whom safety is paramount, since the introduction of the offending allergen 
into their bloodstream can cause severe or life-threatening allergic reactions, 
such an anaphylactic shock.

Our proprietary platform is based on our epicutaneous Viaskin patch. We have 
designed and developed this technology internally, for which we have scalable 
manufacturing capabilities. Viaskin is an electrostatic patch, which offers a 
convenient, self-administered, non-invasive immunotherapy to patients. Once 
applied on intact skin, Viaskin forms a condensation chamber, which hydrates 
the skin and solubilizes the antigen allowing it to penetrate the epidermis, 
where it is captured by Langerhans cells. Based on numerous scientific 
publications and our own research, we believe this unique mechanism of action 
is safe and that it generates a strong immune response that results in 
tolerance towards the allergen. Our epicutaneous immunotherapy method allows 
us to address severe food allergies, as well as unmet medical needs in other 
immunotherapy indications.

Our lead product candidate, Viaskin Peanut, has obtained Fast Track designation 
from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, which is intended to 
expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biological 
products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or 
condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the 
disease or condition. In September 2014, we announced topline results for our 
VIPES ( Vi askin P eanut’s E fficacy and S afety) Phase IIb clinical trial of 
Viaskin Peanut in peanut allergic patients. Pending consultation with the FDA, 
we plan to initiate our Phase III clinical trial in the first quarter of 2016.

Our second product candidate, Viaskin Milk, is being developed for cow’s milk 
protein allergy, or CMPA, in the pediatric patient population. In the second 
half of 2014, we intend to initiate a 150-subject, multi-center, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, randomized Phase I/II safety and efficacy clinical trial of 
repeated doses of Viaskin Milk in patients with Immunoglobulin E, or IgE, 
mediated CMPA, which we refer to as MILES (Milk Delivered Epicutaneously Study).

We have further used our Viaskin technology platform to advance other 
innovative product development programs to address additional opportunities in 
immunology. We currently have one pre-clinical product candidate as a result of 
these product development programs, our product candidate for house dust mite 
allergy. Our other earlier stage product development programs include 
eosinophilic esophagitis, pertusiss boost vaccine and birch pollen allergy, 
none of which have resulted in a product candidate to date. We are also 
exploring earlier stage opportunities in respiratory syncytial virus vaccine, 
refractory hemophilia A, Crohn’s disease and type I diabetes. We intend to 
commercialize our food allergy product candidates by ourselves in the United 
States and certain European countries. In other geographies and indications 
outside food allergies, we will explore selective partnerships with parties 
who have relevant clinical and commercial expertise in order to maximize 
shareholder value.
