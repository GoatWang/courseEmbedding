Welcome to Alberto Pants USA
It’s all about the Pants
Pants that fit well. A simple statement, perhaps, but one that exactly adheres with what Alberto means to the well-dressed man. Whether you are looking for pants that are relaxed, comfortable, slim, or modern — regardless of style — you will find the perfect pair with Alberto.
Additionally, beautiful details are to be found including proprietary technical treatments to make our fabrics especially comfortable. Along with customers, we believe the Ceramica pant to be the most comfortable available on the market today.

From The Designer to The Customer
It takes about 40 steps to make every pair of ALBERTO pants. Each pair of trousers consists of no fewer than 36 individual components, which are assembled with great precision. Moreover, every pair gives the person who wears it that unique feeling of being custom tailored “just for me.” It’s always been like that and we will keep this tradition alive. At ALBERTO, we embrace perfectionism as a given because it is in our genes.

Logic synthesis for field-programmable gate arrays by

                           worldwide
                           Short turnaround has become critical in the design of electronic systems. Software- programmable components such as microprocessors
                              and digital signal processors have been used extensively in such systems since they allow rapid design revisions. However,
                              the inherent performance limitations of software-programmable systems mean that they are inadequate for high-performance designs.
                              Designers thus turned to gate arrays as a solution. User-programmable gate arrays (field-programmable gate arrays, FPGAs)
                              have recently emerged and are changing the way electronic systems are designed and implemented. The growing complexity of
                              the logic circuits that can be packed onto an FPGA chip means that it has become important to have automatic synthesis tools
                              that implement logic functions on these architectures. Logic Synthesis for Field-Programmable Gate Arrays describes logic
                              synthesis for both look-up table (LUT) and multiplexor-based architectures, with a balanced presentation of existing techniques
                              together with algorithms and the system developed by the authors. Audience: A useful reference for VLSI designers, developers
                              of computer-aided design tools, and anyone involved in or with FPGAs

                           The existence of electrical noise is basically due to the fact that electrical charge is not continuous but is carried in
                              discrete amounts equal to the electron charge. Electrical noise represents a fundamental limit on the performance of electronic
                              circuits and systems. With the explosive growth in the personal mobile communications market, the need for noise analysis/simulation
                              techniques for nonlinear electronic circuits and systems has been re-emphasized. Even though most of the signal processing
                              is done in the digital domain, every wireless communication device has an analog front-end which is usually the bottleneck
                              in the design of the whole system. The requirements for low-power operation and higher levels of integration create new challenges
                              in the design of the analog signal processing subsystems of these mobile communication devices. The effect of noise on the
                              performance of these inherently nonlinear analog circuits is becoming more and more significant. Analysis and Simulation of
                              Noise in Nonlinear Electronic Circuits and Systems presents analysis, simulation and characterization techniques and behavioral
                              models for noise in nonlinear electronic circuits and systems, along with practical examples. This book treats the problem

                              This book was motivated by the problems being faced with shrinking IC process feature sizes. It is well known that as process
                                 feature sizes shrink, a host of electrical problems such as cross-talk, electromigration, self-heat, etc. become important.
                                 Cross-talk is one of the major problems since it results in unpredictable design behavior. In particular, it can result in
                                 significant delay variation or signal integrity problems in a wire, depending on the state of its neighboring wire. Typical
                                 approaches to tackling the cross-talk problem attempt to fix the problem once it is created. This book introduces a framework
                                 for cross-talk-free IC design. The main foundation of the book is the use of a predetermined layout pattern on the IC, which
                                 we call a `layout fabric'. The authors characterize this fabric and show how it yields cross-talk-immune designs. Two VLSI
                                 design flows are introduced which use the fabric concept. One flow is a minimally modified standard-cell based flow. The other
                                 flow uses a network of PLAs to implement the circuit. The authors also introduce `wire removal' techniques which improve circuit
                                 wire ability and thereby reduce circuit area. The new concepts presented here will be of interest to IC designers and researchers

                              In this book, we concentrate on developing noise simulation techniques for RF circuits. The difference between our approach
                                 of performing noise analysis for RF circuits and the traditional techniques is that we first concentrate on the noise analysis
                                 for oscillators instead of non-oscillatory circuits. As a first step, we develop a new quantitative description of the dynamics
                                 of stable nonlinear oscillators in presence of deterministic perturbations. Unlike previous such attempts, this description
                                 is not limited to two-dimensional system of equations and does not make any assumptions about the type of nonlinearity. By
                                 considering stochastic perturbations in a stochastic differential calculus setting, we obtain a correct mathematical characterization
                                 of the noisy oscillator output. We present efficient numerical techniques both in time domain and in frequency domain for
                                 computing the phase noise of oscillators. This approach also determines the relative contribution of the device noise sources
                                 to phase noise, which is very useful for oscillator design

                              Addressing the rising security issues during the design stages of cyber-physical systems, this book develops a systematic
                                 approach to address security at early design stages together with all other design constraints. Cyber-attacks become more
                                 threatening as systems are becoming more connected with the surrounding environment, infrastructures, and other systems. Security
                                 mechanisms can be designed to protect against attacks and meet security requirements, but there are many challenges of applying
                                 security mechanisms to cyber-physical systems including open environments, limited resources, strict timing requirements,
                                 and large number of devices. Designed for researchers and professionals, this book is valuable for individuals working in
                                 network systems, security mechanisms, and system design. It is also suitable for advanced-level students of computer science.

                              Embedded systems are informally defined as a collection of programmable parts surrounded by ASICs and other standard components,
                                 that interact continuously with an environment through sensors and actuators. The programmable parts include micro-controllers
                                 and Digital Signal Processors (DSPs). Embedded systems are often used in life-critical situations, where reliability and safety
                                 are more important criteria than performance. Today, embedded systems are designed with an ad hoc approach that is heavily
                                 based on earlier experience with similar products and on manual design. Use of higher-level languages such as C helps structure
                                 the design somewhat, but with increasing complexity it is not sufficient. Formal verification and automatic synthesis of implementations
                                 are the surest ways to guarantee safety. Thus, the POLIS system which is a co-design environment for embedded systems is based
                                 on a formal model of computation. POLIS was initiated in 1988 as a research project at the University of California at Berkeley
                                 and, over the years, grew into a full design methodology with a software system supporting it. Hardware-Software Co-Design
                                 of Embedded Systems: The POLIS Approach is intended to give a complete overview of the POLIS system including its formal and
                                 algorithmic aspects. Hardware-Software Co-Design of Embedded Systems: The POLIS Approach will be of interest to embedded system
                                 designers (automotive electronics, consumer electronics and telecommunications), micro-controller designers, CAD developers

                              Synthesis of Finite State Machines: Functional Optimization is divided into three parts. The first part presents some preliminary
                                 definitions, theories and techniques related to the exploration of behaviors of FSMs. The second part presents an implicit
                                 algorithm for exact state minimization of incompletely specified finite state machines (ISFSMs), and an exhaustive presentation
                                 of explicit and implicit algorithms for the binate covering problem. The third part addresses the computation of permissible
                                 behaviors at a node of a network of FSMs and the related minimization problems of non-deterministic finite state machines
                                 (NDFSMs). Key themes running through the book are the exploration of behaviors contained in a non-deterministic FSM (NDFSM),
                                 and the representation of combinatorial problems arising in FSM synthesis by means of Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs)

                              Analog circuit design is often the bottleneck when designing mixed analog-digital systems. A Top-Down, Constraint-Driven Design
                                 Methodology for Analog Integrated Circuits presents a new methodology based on a top-down, constraint-driven design paradigm
                                 that provides a solution to this problem. This methodology has two principal advantages: (1) it provides a high probability
                                 for the first silicon which meets all specifications, and (2) it shortens the design cycle. A Top-Down, Constraint-Driven
                                 Design Methodology for Analog Integrated Circuits is part of an ongoing research effort at the University of California at
                                 Berkeley in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences Department. Many faculty and students, past and present, are
                                 working on this design methodology and its supporting tools. The principal goals are: (1) developing the design methodology,
                                 (2) developing and applying new tools, and (3) `proving' the methodology by undertaking `industrial strength' design examples.
                                 The work presented here is neither a beginning nor an end in the development of a complete top-down, constraint-driven design
                                 methodology, but rather a step in its development. This work is divided into three parts. Chapter 2 presents the design methodology
                                 along with foundation material. Chapters 3-8 describe supporting concepts for the methodology, from behavioral simulation
                                 and modeling to circuit module generators. Finally, Chapters 9-11 illustrate the methodology in detail by presenting the entire
                                 design cycle through three large-scale examples. These include the design of a current source D/A converter, a Sigma-Delta
                                 A/D converter, and a video driver system. Chapter 12 presents conclusions and current research topics. A Top-Down, Constraint-Driven
                                 Design Methodology for Analog Integrated Circuits will be of interest to analog and mixed-signal designers as well as CAD

Prof. Alberto Sangiovanni-Vincentelli: Phil Kaufman Award, 2001


Presentation
of the 2001 Phil Kaufman Award to
Professor Alberto Sangiovanni-Vincentelli



  


8th
November, 2001
A. Richard Newton



 It is a very special pleasure and an honor for me to present the
eighth annual Phil Kaufman Award to Professor Alberto
Sangiovanni-Vincentelliacademic, entrepreneur, businessman, and a personal
friend for more than a quarter century.
 

But where do you start to describe his career, his impact
on EDA and on the lives of so many of us in academia and in industry, on his
many students, and business leaders throughout the world? Everyone I have spoken
to about Alberto believes they know him well, and yet they only really know a
fraction of this man who works so tirelessly in all of these areas of endeavor
and many more. Tonight I will take a few moments to describe to you the Alberto
I know, and will share the insights of a few key people who have had the chance
to walk beside Alberto for a part of this amazing journey.


Ill begin at the Politecnico di Milano, one of
the most distinguished universities in  Italy, where Alberto graduated as a Dottore in Ingegneria (summa
cum laude) (Doctor of Engineering) in 1971 and served as Professore
Incaricato of Electrical Engineering from 1974-1976. At 27 years of age, he
was already making his mark as the youngest Associate Professor in the
University. I first met Alberto in 1975 when he and his young family came to 

Berkeley

 for what was to be just a six month stay as a NATO Fellow. I was a new Ph.D.
student working with Professor Don Pederson and Alberto was a Research
Associate, a guest of Professor Ernie Kuh. When Alberto arrived in 

California

, he was utterly disappointed. The first insight I will share with you about
Alberto is that quality, in all its
forms, is an essential element of everything in Albertos lifefrom his
research, to his business relationships, to the wine he drinks and the food he
eats and, most of all, to his personal relationships. Perhaps this is an
influence of his parents, of his early family lifethe only child of an
aristocratic Italian family. But having seen 

America

 on the big screen in 

Italy

with its beautiful Hollywood Villas and green, rolling hillsarriving in 

California

 only to stay at the Golden Bear Motel on 

University Avenue

 in 

Berkeley

 was a bitter disappointment, to be sure! He and his family were ready to return
home immediately. So when his six month stay was ending, at the encouragement of
the 

Berkeley

 faculty, then department chair David Sakrison invited Alberto to stay at 

Berkeley

 and even consider applying for a permanent faculty position. Not wanting to
offend the Chair, Alberto explained that his department chair in 

Italy

 really needed him back and so he had to leave. Now at 

Berkeley

, when were onto a good thing we dont give up so easily, so without
Albertos knowledge, Sakrison wrote to Albertos chair at Politecnico di
Milano asking how come Alberto couldnt stay an bit longer at 

Berkeley

 and then, by chance, Alberto bumped into his Italian boss on his way back home
at the airport in Milano. Oh, by the way, he told Alberto, I wrote back
to Sakrison saying you are welcome to stay longer at 

Berkeley

 if you like. Ugh! He was stuck, so he returned to 

Berkeley

 as a visiting Assistant Professor the following year and never left.


But Alberto was a system guy back then. Sparse matricies,
numerical analysis, linear placement for printed wiring boards, were his areas
of emphasis. He traveled in the circles of researchers like Ernie Kuh, Leon
Chua, and Charlie Desoer and knew very little about real circuits, let alone
integrated circuits, back then. It was in the late 1970s that he Alberto
caught Don Pedersons eye.


I first
became acquainted with Alberto when he was a young Assistant Professor in EECS,
says Professor Don Pederson, himself a Kaufmann winner. Alberto was eligible
for a permanent position in Circuit and Systems Theory Groups in this county, as
well as in his home country, 

Italy

. Although Alberto was not formally
skilled in electronics, it was clear to me after observing him that he had the
talent needed to move effectively into new territory, and I approached him to
join our IC group. In short order he was able to grasp the broad range of
abilities that are needed to be effective in this area and from the outset he
has been a key faculty member in our group. It is astounding that he has been
able to do so much in electronics.


I joined the
faculty at 

Berkeley

 in 1979 myself, and we immediately
became fast friends and colleagues for life. As an impetuous pair of young
faculty, we began to take on the world of CAD, and then EDA, believing we could
see a different futurea better futureand wanting to be sure it came to
pass. Now not being one who believes in a predetermined destiny, I believe that
at any given point in time, there are many possible futures that can come to
pass and the one that is eventually manifest is influenced strongly by those
that believe in it, that strive to make it happen. So my second insight for you
tonight about Alberto is that one reason he has been as successful as he has
been in his distinguished career is that once Alberto sees a future, once he believes
in a future, there is no one in this world
who works harder and with more determination that Alberto to make it come out
the way he thinks it should. No one! And he has also had the abilitythe
talent, the respect, the relationshipsto literally influence the future of
this industry more than once. As Professor Luciano Lavagno of the Politecnico di
Torino and Research Scientist at Cadence Berkeley Labs puts it, Working with
Alberto is always exciting and stimulating, because he has a great ability to
use all his experience about what is happening in EDA, design and fabrication to
look forward and predict what is going to happen, what is going to be hot, what
is going to be problematic. He then pushes towards a solution without regard to
the difficulty, to the fact that "no-one has been there before". Raw
focused energy is the key aspect, that he puts in his work and in his life.
This is truly the mark of an entrepreneur!


Albertos
academic career is unparalled. With over 500 technical publications to his name
and fourteen booksspanning the areas of EDA, control theory, systems theory,
and applied mathematics just to name a fewAlberto has educated and mentored a
generation of distinguished university faculty and industry leaders. Among his
many awards, he includes the Distinguished Teaching Award of the 

University
 of 
California

, awarded to only the top few percent
of faculty on our campus.


Early in his
graduate career at Berkeley, Professor Jacob White, one of Albertos Ph.D.
students and now a distinguished faculty member at MIT was working on the new
Waveform Relaxation (WR) method while Professor Res Saleh, one of my own
students, was working on what we called Iterated Timing Analysis (ITA)two
accurate but fast methods for simulating large digital circuits. Alberto had
been giving talks about WR in which he claimed that WR had guaranteed
convergence properties while ITA did not. As Jacob says, I tried to convince
Alberto that once you discretized the differential equations, WR had the same
convergence properties as ITA. Alberto was very patient with meat the time I
was not doing very well as a studentand he had every reason to believe that I
was simply confused. However, the very second that my argument was clear to him,
Alberto changed from being a patient listener to an enthusiastic one. The fact
that I was suggesting that what he had been presenting was wrong did not concern
him at all. He was interested in only two things: getting the right answer and
expressing his pleasure that one of his students had figured out something that
he had missed.


Of
course, Jacob continues, this incident demonstrated to me that being the
one who is right is unimportant, while getting to the right answer is important.
But for me, the idea that my advisor would be pleased that I had uncovered an
error really helped me understand what it means to be an academic. The job is
not about leading your students, the
job is about having students stand on your shoulders and see further than you
did. That is one of the most important lessons I learned from Alberto.


This is just
one of many such experiences I could quote from any one of the more than 50
Ph.D. students Alberto has guided to graduation over the past quarter
centuryanother amazing achievement.


As Gerry
Sullivan once shared with me as we walked along a stretch of beach near 

Monterey

 many years ago, I have finally
worked out why you 

Berkeley

 guys do so wellyou just work so
much harder than everyone else. In Albertos case, that should read harder,
smarter, and with an unrelenting passion to succeed in everything he embarks
upon; whether as an individual, as part of a team, or as a mentor. He will pull
you along with him; at that moment you are considering giving in, making a
compromise, Alberto will spur you on for that extra mile. And the satisfaction
you share with him at that moment of success makes it all worthwhile. Like a
runners high,it is an experience you will never forget and one you will
strive to repeat time and time again.


 No
matter what Alberto tackles, he succeeds in making an impressive set of
contributions, says Professor Bob Brayton of IBM Research and now Berkeley.
Our logic synthesis collaboration was marked by lots of excitement,
enthusiasm and fun. It was fun, since we shared the common conviction that a
firm mathematical foundation and proven results leads to better understanding
and to better algorithms. At DAC in '82, I remember sitting on a couch in the
lobby of the Las Vegas Hilton, working with Alberto on the remaining algorithmic
piece of the two-level logic optimizer ESPRESSO. When we finally got it, we were
so excitedit was far better than winning at the casino!


In 1981,
Alberto joined Jim Solomon, then at National Semiconductor, and me as we sought
for ways to get some of our early Berkeley CAD tools and ideas supported by
industry. After six months of talking with companies like Daisy Systems, Mentor
Graphics, Comsat General, Valid Logic Systems, and even the Microelectronics and
Computer Consortium (MCC) in Austin Texas, and finding no takers, Jim decided to
start a company to support and develop our ideas for commercial use as SDA
Systems and eventually Cadence Design Systems.


Ill leave it to Joe Costello, former CEO of Cadence to
describe Albertos influence on that company from the very beginning:
Alberto helped to shape Cadence (then SDA Systems) long before I was there.
He sent his students, worked the strategy, and guided the product. He agonized
when the company struggled to get off the ground. He talked to customers to get
them to work with us. He criticized, counseled, consoled. He tried to get us to
think big when we were small. He tried to get us to work with an even smaller
company, Synopsys, as it was born, but we didn't understand. He supported our
moves to merge with ECAD, Tangent, Gateway when others didn't agree. He was a
scientific advisor and a consultant. He worked with our engineering team year
after year, inspiring them, challenging them, spurring them on. He provided
insights into where we should go and who could best take us there. He pushed and
pushed and pushed to make us great. He personally created Cadence Berkeley Labs
with Patrick Scaglia. He established it in the 

US

 and abroad, thereby institutionalizing forward thinking in the company. He
worked with our leading edge product groups like Alta. But at the same time he
did not forget our roots and worked just as hard to make sure that our core
product lines and teams stayed current and competitive. But Alberto's
contribution was not limited to technology. He was every bit as present on the
business side as an investor and a board member. He engaged with just as much
enthusiasm in the board meetings as he did as a scientific advisor or as the
leader of Cadence Berkeley Labs.


As I re-read these words, they look so pathetic when I
stand them up against reality. Words are such a weak tool to encapsulate what
Alberto has meant to me personally and to Cadence. I wish that I could share
with you a video kaleidoscope of the times that we have spent together. It would
better capture some of the energy, passion, and emotion. You would better
understand the highs, the lows and the ultimate victory. But still when I run
the video in my mind and stand it up against reality, it is also too narrow, too
thin, if you weren't there to see it as it unfolded.


How can I help you to understand Alberto's contribution?
Perhaps, since you weren't there, a symbol would be best. When you think of
Cadence, remember that the a in Cadence stands for Albertowithout the
"a", without Alberto, the company would just not be the same.


Ray Bingham
summarizes Albertos ongoing contributions to Cadence as follows: Alberto
has had a profound and lasting influence on Cadence as a company and on me
personally as an individual. As Cadences Chief Technology Advisory, Alberto
provides boundless intellectual capacity and bandwidth, which I leverage when
considering various business, technology, strategic, and political issues. In
other words, he's my ultimate reality check.


Now one of
those companies that Joe mentioned was Tangent, and Aki Fujimura, now President
and COO of Simplex Solutions was a founder of Tangent. Aki recalls that:
Steve Teig and I both benefited tremendously from Alberto's insights and
guidance while we were rolling out Tangate fourteen years ago. Alberto was
instrumental in evangelizing the shift from a channels-and-rows based
semi-custom architecture to the sea-of-gates/sea-of-cells architecture that the
whole world uses today. Alberto's greatest strength is his unique blend of
technical breadth and depth, his intuition for people, and his business
savvy.


Just a few
years later, Alberto was also a key contributor to the founding team of Synopsys
and was the founding chair of the Synopsys Technical Advisory Board. As Aart De
Geus says, "Alberto has the amazing talent and drive to simultaneously
recognize break-through technology, talented people, and a business opportunity.
So often he has acted as a powerful catalyst in amplifying the work of the
people around him. I will always be grateful for his contribution in starting
the most exciting EDA company of all timewhichever one you happen to think it
is..."


Albertos
Ph. D. students, in particular Rick Rudell and Albert Wang, formed a core part
of the product team for Design Compiler, the most successful single product in
the history of the EDA industry to date, and Design Compiler was influenced very
strongly by the Berkeley work of Bob Brayton, Alberto, and their students in the
area of multi-level logic synthesis.


In 1991,
Cadence and Synopsys had grown to the point where they were beginning to compete
in the marketplace and Alberto was forced to make a choice. I can personally
attest to the fact that this was one of the most difficult choices Alberto has
ever had to make. He agonized long and hard on it and, frankly, at the time he
could have gone either way. My third insight into the man: over the years I have
learned that Alberto likes to be involved in just about everything. For two
reasons: first he, like many of us, has a very hard time saying no to
people he likes and respects. Second, when Alberto makes a commitment, you can
always count on him to see it through, no matter what it takes, and he found
himself in a situation where he had personally committed his energy to both
teamsteams that were now in an irreconcilable conflict for him. I know those
were some of the toughest days for Alberto as he worked through that situation.
To this day, I know he has a strong love for both companies.


Of all the
contributions Alberto has made to our industry, the two that he is personally
most proud of are his work in guided analog synthesisdefining a new approach
to the automated design of analog IC blocks, through the Red Book as he
likes to call itand his work on system-level design. While Alberto has
collaborated closely with many of the leading researchers in EDA and control
systems over the years, in these two areas he has truly paved the way for us
all. He really began by advocating system-level design research in earnest back
in 1988, stressing the importance of a comprehensive view of systemsnot just
the chips, the importance of software and hardware, that the methodology was key
to finding a common ground for effective system design, and that one had to
study embedded systems and their application in the real world if one was to
find a rigorous, well-founded and yet practical approach to the design and
verification of complex embedded systems. Who among us had not heard of
communication-based design, or the importance of orthogonalization of
concerns, or function-architecture decomposition? These are just a few
of the concepts Alberto has developed and evangelized for years now, and all are
finding their rightful place in our modern design systems.


But like all
of our Kaufman awardees, and like Phil himself, in the end it is as much the
person as it is about any specific technical contribution or new business
ideait is how they have inspired people throughout their careers, through
their own personal example. As Aki Fujimura said, 


What makes
Alberto great is that whether you're meeting him for business or for academic
advice, the first thing he wants to talk about with you is... you. We all know
that he genuinely cares about us as individuals and that this comes first before
anything else for him. Ray Bingham told me earlier this week that,
Albertos deep humanity as a person...as a man...exudes itself in
everything he does. That humanity gives him license to inspire and touch people
in many ways. He certainly has played an inspiring role in my own life. And our
industry is extremely fortunate to call him one of our own. I would also like
to take this opportunity to thank Alberto for his steadfast friendship and
support over these many years, through the mostly good times and the occasional
tough passage. On behalf of your many, many friends throughout the world, thank
you, Alberto.


On behalf of Mrs. Kaufman, EDAC, and all present here
tonight, I am honored to be able to present the Phil Kaufman Award to Professor
Alberto Sangiovanni-Vincentelli, a colleague, a mentor, and a friend to many of
us here tonight and around the world. As I wrote this speech, I tried to
conclude by summarizing what makes Alberto specialwhat are those essential
characteristics of this man that make him so important to us allbut I found
that I just couldnt do it. I share Joe Costellos perspective when he says
that words are such a weak tool to encapsulate what Alberto has meant to us all.
So I leave you with these few anecdotes and testimonials of the many we could
all share about this founder of our industry and leave it to you to build your
own picture of Alberto and his many contributions. But I know you all agree with
me when I say it is clear that Alberto stands as a very worthy recipient of this
prestigious award.


So please raise your glasses as we toast Alberto tonight.
Professor Kurt Keutzer speaks for all of us when he says, Through his
technical efforts Alberto has done much to define what EDA is today, but much
more than that, Alberto has set the highest standard for what it means to be a
researcher in this field.
To Alberto!

EDA pioneer Alberto Sangiovanni-Vincentelli joins UltraSoC advisory board


UltraSoC, the leading developer of on-chip monitoring and analytics IP, today announced that Alberto Sangiovanni-Vincentelli, a founding-father and driving force in both commercial and technological developments in the electronics design industry, has joined the company’s Strategic Advisory Board.
Sangiovanni-Vincentelli brings significant experience of direct relevance to UltraSoC given its target customers and vertical market applications. In the commercial world, he was a co-founder of both industry leaders in Electronic Design Automation (EDA): Cadence Design Systems in 1983 and Synopsys in 1986. He remains on the Board of Directors at Cadence and on its Governance and Strategy Committees, in addition to having held advisor roles at companies ranging from Intel and ST microelectronics to General Motors.
In academia, Professor Sangiovanni-Vincentelli has been with the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Berkeley since 1976, where he currently holds the Edgar L. and Harold H. Buttner Chair of Electrical Engineering. He received the Kaufman Award for “pioneering contributions to EDA” and the IEEE/RSE Maxwell Medal “for ground-breaking contributions that have had an exceptional impact on the development of electronics and electrical engineering or related fields”. He is the author of over 880 papers, 17 books and three patents in the areas of design tools and methodologies, large scale systems, embedded systems, hybrid systems, energy efficient buildings and innovation. He is a Fellow of the IEEE, of the ACM and a Member of the National Academy of Engineering.
“UltraSoC’s technology has a significant role to play in a broad range of electronic systems being developed now,” commented Sangiovanni-Vincentelli. “There are many advantages to embedding its technologies, and the potential system-wide gains of designing hardware with UltraSoC are important. The industry faces enormous challenges: security, safety and systemic complexity are just a few of these. The concept of analytics and intelligence that can be embedded in the fabric of any system is a game-changer: one that will help the industry rise to those challenges.”
Rupert Baines, UltraSoC CEO, commented: “We are honored to welcome Alberto to our advisory board. We look forward to tapping into his experience, his technological and commercial achievements and his pre-eminence in the development of EDA. I am confident UltraSoC will benefit greatly from his wisdom and his involvement.”
Sangiovanni-Vincentelli joins a team of distinguished technology business leaders on the UltraSoC Advisory Board: Simon Davidmann, Vijay Dube, Guillaume d’Eyssautier and Professor David May.
UltraSoC last week announced a successful £5M funding round and a line-up of new investors. Alberto Sangiovanni-Vincentelli is a member of the Investment Committee at Atlante Tech, UltraSoC’s lead investor in the round.
UltraSoC’s flagship product line is a suite of semiconductor IP that allows chip designers to integrate an intelligent analytics infrastructure into the core hardware of their devices. By monitoring and analyzing the real-world behavior of entire systems via UltraSoC’s intelligent analytics embedded in the silicon, engineers can take action to reduce system power consumption, increase performance, protect against malicious intrusions, and ensure product safety. These capabilities address applications in a broad range of market sectors, from automotive and IoT products, to at-scale computing and communications infrastructure.

Welcome to Alberto Pants USA
It’s all about the Pants
Pants that fit well. A simple statement, perhaps, but one that exactly adheres with what Alberto means to the well-dressed man. Whether you are looking for pants that are relaxed, comfortable, slim, or modern — regardless of style — you will find the perfect pair with Alberto.
Additionally, beautiful details are to be found including proprietary technical treatments to make our fabrics especially comfortable. Along with customers, we believe the Ceramica pant to be the most comfortable available on the market today.

From The Designer to The Customer
It takes about 40 steps to make every pair of ALBERTO pants. Each pair of trousers consists of no fewer than 36 individual components, which are assembled with great precision. Moreover, every pair gives the person who wears it that unique feeling of being custom tailored “just for me.” It’s always been like that and we will keep this tradition alive. At ALBERTO, we embrace perfectionism as a given because it is in our genes.

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
