Specimens - labels on product, screenshots of the App showing the use of FAN PASS on it, advertising banner showing the use of FAN PASS on it, website screenshot showing FAN PASS on it.    All in the fields described in the description.  This being ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS, etc... see classes I've posted before.    The App Screenshot alone would do it.   If we were selling candy the USPTO would want to see packaging showing the FAN PASS mark for instance.

The product has give or take 1,000,000 users being way undervalued @ under $ 1.00 each. That is a steal !!!! More realistic is 20 times that. That is just a pimple on the elephants butt, when FANPASSLIVE launches. FDBL is focused on getting all the loose ends tied up, having learned from a rapid rollout last year. We have a good existing core talent that will bring many others on board. Financing will be announced soon so all in all the future for FDBL is very bright !
