          Endy mattresses rely on gel-infused foam for temperature control. Novosbeds utilize airflow channels to let warm air out, and cool air in.
        

          Endy offers a single, one-size-fits-all model. Novosbed offers a selection of three mattress firmnesses.
        





          Both Novosbed and Endy sell online, directly to customers. Endy has partnered with a retail store in Toronto, Canada but orders are still fulfilled through Endy’s regular channels.
        

          Novosbed has an aggregate review score of 93% compared to Endy’s 89%.
        








Mattress materials

      In recent years, shopping for and buying a mattress online has become a popular option for a lot of people. With so many brands offering mattresses made with a variety of mattress materials, there is no shortage of choices. Novosbed and Endy both make foam-based mattresses, but there are significant differences that set these brands apart from each other.
    

Foam density

		  A major difference is in the foam densities used in Novosbed and Endy mattresses. Foam density relates to the quality and durability of the foam. Using lower density foam makes a mattress lighter and less expensive, but the trade-off is shorter longevity and lower durability. Memory foam density is measured as mass per unit volume (lbs/ft3); that is, how much a 1 ft x 1 ft x 1 ft cube of foam weighs (lbs). The denser the foam, the more the cube will weigh.
		

    		While both Endy and Novosbed use memory foam in the top comfort layers, they will feel and behave differently because of the difference in density. Lower density memory foam like that found in Endy mattresses typically respond faster, but will not contour and conform as much as higher density foam. Lower density foams also typically have lower amounts of motion isolation.
    	
Breathability

    		Ideally, a memory foam mattress is durable, can hold its shape, and respond to movement, but won’t become uncomfortably warm during the night. Some companies use a chemical bathe or a chemical gel spray to achieve a cooling effect, but these treatments are not very effective. The best way to control heat in a foam mattress is to improve the overall breathability and airflow. The cooling effect of gel is often temporary because without anywhere to go, the warm air eventually negates any benefit of the gel.
    	

    		While Endy opted to use the method of infusing gel into their memory foam, Novosbed designed a mattress with increased airflow. By utilizing thousands of vertical airflow channels, warm air flows freely out of the mattress instead of being trapped in the foam, keeping you from getting too warm while you sleep.
    	



Did you know?

    			A higher density doesn’t mean a firmer mattress. A soft mattress can be just as dense as a firm one. Density mostly speaks to the quality of the foam, not the firmness. Density, however, can also affect the “feel” or texture of the mattress. For example, higher density memory foam responds slower and as a result can give the mattress more contouring and "hug."
    		

Mattress construction

			Both Endy and Novosbed mattress are constructed similarly with a comfort/top layer, a middle transition layer, and a base support layer. Endy’s mattresses use 3 lb/ft3 memory foam for their top layer and 1.8 lbs/ft3 foam in their transition layer. In comparison, Novosbed utilizes 3.7 - 5 lbs/ft3 memory foam in the comfort layer, and 4 - 5 lbs/ft3 memory foam in the transition layer. Both brands use 1.8 lbs/ft3 foam for the mattress base. With these layers combined, the total height of the Endy is 10” while the Novosbed is 11”. The differences in density and height make a difference to the weight and durability of the mattresses.
		

			Endy and Novosbed both use memory foam in the top comfort layer of their mattresses, but use different materials for the transition layer. Endy mattresses use standard, low density polyfoam, whereas Novosbed uses high density memory foam. By only using memory foam in the top layer, Endy mattresses benefit less from memory foam’s properties. Essentially, Endy mattresses have 2 inches of memory foam, compared to Novosbed’s 4 -5 inches combined between the comfort and transition layers. This means Endy’s mattresses don’t have the same level of motion isolation, contouring, and pressure point relief that Novosbed mattresses do.

Mattress selection


Decision making can be difficult and stressful when there are too many options, especially when it comes to something as important as your sleep.


      When it comes to mattress shopping, finding a good fit out of an endless number of choices is a significant hurdle many people will encounter. Not only are there countless brands, but many brands offer multiple models, firmnesses, and features to choose from. Endy and Novosbed both recognize the overabundance of choice and as a result, both brands have modeled their selection to help alleviate mattress selection stress.
    

    	Endy, like many online mattress brands, limits their selection to a single choice and sells a one-size-fits-all mattress. This one model features a “medium firm” firmness that is sold as “an ideal mattress for the majority of sleepers”. The single firmness approach can be appealing for shoppers overwhelmed with the number of choices available in retail stores and online, but people have individual needs based on sleep position, body weight, and comfort preference—all of which play a large part in determining the firmness required to give you a comfortable sleep.
    

    	Novosbed has chosen to offer a selection of mattresses models that are clearly categorized. The Novosbed Soft, Medium, and Firm are all named based on how they feel. Everything else, from the features, fabrics, and visual appearance are exactly the same. The only thing a customer has to do is to choose the firmness they want.

Purchasing options

      Both Novosbed and Endy are available online to customers in the US and Canada.  By selling online, direct to customers, middlemen costs are eliminated. This results in a more affordable mattress for you without sacrifices to quality. Selling direct also enables both companies to offer consistent policies and centralized service.
    

    	Although Endy has partnered with one retail store in downtown Toronto, their current arrangement serves only as a showroom. Ordering and delivery is still handled by Endy online. Since you can’t take the mattress home with you, there is effectively no difference in buying in-store vs. online through the Endy website. Additionally, it is suggested on their website that appointments are made to prior to visiting their showroom.

Policies

      By selling direct to consumers, both Endy and Novosbed can offer centralized customer service and consistent policies. Although their respective policies share many similarities, there are a few key differences:

    

Shipping and returns

        Endy and Novosbed offer free shipping and free returns to both Canada and the USA. Novosbed also offers an optional White Glove Delivery service to customers in the USA, which includes the option to have your old mattress removed for an additional fee. Endy currently does not offer either White Glove service or mattress removal services.
      

        Even though Endy does offer exchanges, one would almost never need this service, as they only offer their mattresses in one firmness. If you don’t like the feel of your Endy mattress, the only options are to return the mattress, or exchange it for a different size while voiding your sleep trial on your new, exchanged mattress.  As long as you don’t accidentally purchase the wrong sized mattress, it seems there would be no other reason for an exchange.
      

        Both Novosbed and Endy approach returns with full hands-on service, coordinating pick up and donation of returned mattresses. Neither company re-sells returned mattresses.
      


Sleep trial

        Endy’s sleep trial gives their customers 100 nights. Customers cannot fine-tune firmness, but can return their mattress if they are not satisfied within the 100 day time frame.
      

        Novosbed’s sleep trial gives 120 nights to decide if your new mattress is right for you. It's the only sleep trial available with a Perfect Firmness Guarantee which entitles you to a free Comfort+ kit. Using Comfort+, customers can fine-tune the firmness of their Novosbed mattress to find that perfect fit. Customers are still eligible to return their mattress if they’re not completely satisfied.
      



Many online brands offer a sleep trial that allows you to try a mattress in the comfort of your home, risk free.

Novosbed third party review quotes

      "With the general feel and quality of materials being pretty close (depending on the Tempur-Pedic model, of course), I personally just think you get a better value from Novosbed because it costs so much less. The perfect firmness guarantee is also a unique innovation that should assuage any concerns from buying it online." - mattressclarity.com


      “You’ll see that both Novosbed and Tempurpedic have dense quality foams but the Novosbed is much more affordable and includes the Comfort+ option” - sleepsherpa.com



Endy third party review quotes

      “The Endy’s feel makes it a mattress that you will likely love or hate ... effectively requires sleepers to prefer a firmer sleeping surface in order to find the Endy both comfortable and supportive.” - sleepopolis.com

Highlights



          Both Endy and Novosbed use memory foam in their top comfort layers, but Endy's memory foam is lower density.
        

          Endy mattresses rely on gel-infused foam for temperature control. Novosbeds utilize airflow channels to let warm air out, and cool air in.
        

          Endy offers a single, one-size-fits-all model. Novosbed offers a selection of three mattress firmnesses.
        





          Both Novosbed and Endy sell online, directly to customers. Endy has partnered with a retail store in Toronto, Canada but orders are still fulfilled through Endy’s regular channels.
        

          Novosbed has an aggregate review score of 93% compared to Endy’s 89%.
        








Mattress materials

      In recent years, shopping for and buying a mattress online has become a popular option for a lot of people. With so many brands offering mattresses made with a variety of mattress materials, there is no shortage of choices. Novosbed and Endy both make foam-based mattresses, but there are significant differences that set these brands apart from each other.
    

Foam density

		  A major difference is in the foam densities used in Novosbed and Endy mattresses. Foam density relates to the quality and durability of the foam. Using lower density foam makes a mattress lighter and less expensive, but the trade-off is shorter longevity and lower durability. Memory foam density is measured as mass per unit volume (lbs/ft3); that is, how much a 1 ft x 1 ft x 1 ft cube of foam weighs (lbs). The denser the foam, the more the cube will weigh.
		

    		While both Endy and Novosbed use memory foam in the top comfort layers, they will feel and behave differently because of the difference in density. Lower density memory foam like that found in Endy mattresses typically respond faster, but will not contour and conform as much as higher density foam. Lower density foams also typically have lower amounts of motion isolation.
    	
Breathability

    		Ideally, a memory foam mattress is durable, can hold its shape, and respond to movement, but won’t become uncomfortably warm during the night. Some companies use a chemical bathe or a chemical gel spray to achieve a cooling effect, but these treatments are not very effective. The best way to control heat in a foam mattress is to improve the overall breathability and airflow. The cooling effect of gel is often temporary because without anywhere to go, the warm air eventually negates any benefit of the gel.
    	

    		While Endy opted to use the method of infusing gel into their memory foam, Novosbed designed a mattress with increased airflow. By utilizing thousands of vertical airflow channels, warm air flows freely out of the mattress instead of being trapped in the foam, keeping you from getting too warm while you sleep.
    	



Did you know?

    			A higher density doesn’t mean a firmer mattress. A soft mattress can be just as dense as a firm one. Density mostly speaks to the quality of the foam, not the firmness. Density, however, can also affect the “feel” or texture of the mattress. For example, higher density memory foam responds slower and as a result can give the mattress more contouring and "hug."
    		

Mattress construction

			Both Endy and Novosbed mattress are constructed similarly with a comfort/top layer, a middle transition layer, and a base support layer. Endy’s mattresses use 3 lb/ft3 memory foam for their top layer and 1.8 lbs/ft3 foam in their transition layer. In comparison, Novosbed utilizes 3.7 - 5 lbs/ft3 memory foam in the comfort layer, and 4 - 5 lbs/ft3 memory foam in the transition layer. Both brands use 1.8 lbs/ft3 foam for the mattress base. With these layers combined, the total height of the Endy is 10” while the Novosbed is 11”. The differences in density and height make a difference to the weight and durability of the mattresses.
		

			Endy and Novosbed both use memory foam in the top comfort layer of their mattresses, but use different materials for the transition layer. Endy mattresses use standard, low density polyfoam, whereas Novosbed uses high density memory foam. By only using memory foam in the top layer, Endy mattresses benefit less from memory foam’s properties. Essentially, Endy mattresses have 2 inches of memory foam, compared to Novosbed’s 4 -5 inches combined between the comfort and transition layers. This means Endy’s mattresses don’t have the same level of motion isolation, contouring, and pressure point relief that Novosbed mattresses do.

Mattress selection


Decision making can be difficult and stressful when there are too many options, especially when it comes to something as important as your sleep.


      When it comes to mattress shopping, finding a good fit out of an endless number of choices is a significant hurdle many people will encounter. Not only are there countless brands, but many brands offer multiple models, firmnesses, and features to choose from. Endy and Novosbed both recognize the overabundance of choice and as a result, both brands have modeled their selection to help alleviate mattress selection stress.
    

    	Endy, like many online mattress brands, limits their selection to a single choice and sells a one-size-fits-all mattress. This one model features a “medium firm” firmness that is sold as “an ideal mattress for the majority of sleepers”. The single firmness approach can be appealing for shoppers overwhelmed with the number of choices available in retail stores and online, but people have individual needs based on sleep position, body weight, and comfort preference—all of which play a large part in determining the firmness required to give you a comfortable sleep.
    

    	Novosbed has chosen to offer a selection of mattresses models that are clearly categorized. The Novosbed Soft, Medium, and Firm are all named based on how they feel. Everything else, from the features, fabrics, and visual appearance are exactly the same. The only thing a customer has to do is to choose the firmness they want.

Purchasing options

      Both Novosbed and Endy are available online to customers in the US and Canada.  By selling online, direct to customers, middlemen costs are eliminated. This results in a more affordable mattress for you without sacrifices to quality. Selling direct also enables both companies to offer consistent policies and centralized service.
    

    	Although Endy has partnered with one retail store in downtown Toronto, their current arrangement serves only as a showroom. Ordering and delivery is still handled by Endy online. Since you can’t take the mattress home with you, there is effectively no difference in buying in-store vs. online through the Endy website. Additionally, it is suggested on their website that appointments are made to prior to visiting their showroom.

Policies

      By selling direct to consumers, both Endy and Novosbed can offer centralized customer service and consistent policies. Although their respective policies share many similarities, there are a few key differences:

    

Shipping and returns

        Endy and Novosbed offer free shipping and free returns to both Canada and the USA. Novosbed also offers an optional White Glove Delivery service to customers in the USA, which includes the option to have your old mattress removed for an additional fee. Endy currently does not offer either White Glove service or mattress removal services.
      

        Even though Endy does offer exchanges, one would almost never need this service, as they only offer their mattresses in one firmness. If you don’t like the feel of your Endy mattress, the only options are to return the mattress, or exchange it for a different size while voiding your sleep trial on your new, exchanged mattress.  As long as you don’t accidentally purchase the wrong sized mattress, it seems there would be no other reason for an exchange.
      

        Both Novosbed and Endy approach returns with full hands-on service, coordinating pick up and donation of returned mattresses. Neither company re-sells returned mattresses.
      


Sleep trial

        Endy’s sleep trial gives their customers 100 nights. Customers cannot fine-tune firmness, but can return their mattress if they are not satisfied within the 100 day time frame.
      

        Novosbed’s sleep trial gives 120 nights to decide if your new mattress is right for you. It's the only sleep trial available with a Perfect Firmness Guarantee which entitles you to a free Comfort+ kit. Using Comfort+, customers can fine-tune the firmness of their Novosbed mattress to find that perfect fit. Customers are still eligible to return their mattress if they’re not completely satisfied.
      



Many online brands offer a sleep trial that allows you to try a mattress in the comfort of your home, risk free.

A 120 night trial. Only better.
In 2009 we invented the 120 night trial and changed the way people bought mattresses. This year we invented Comfort+, and we've changed it again.






How our sleep trial works.

     It's simple – Take up to 120 nights to try your Novosbed. Request a free Comfort+ kit if you need firmness adjustment. Return for a full refund if you don't love it.
    

Sleep trial timeline






1

Start your trial.

Love at first night

        Your trial starts the day you receive your Novosbed. Most will love it immediately, but it's also normal for some to need a little more time to break-in their new mattress.
      

        This period is usually short but can take a bit longer depending on factors like weight distribution and amount of time spent in bed. So give it a minimum of 60 nights to be sure.
      










2

Fine-tune the firmness.




Find comfort in Comfort+

         If you're not completely in love with your Novosbed after 30 nights, you might need its firmness fine-tuned. Let us know and we can send you a free Comfort+ kit to make your mattress firmer or softer.
      

        Once installed, give yourself a bit of time to get a feel for your Comfort+ adjusted mattress.
      
What is Comfort+?







3

Take your time.

120 nights to decide

        With one of the longest sleep trials available, you get the breathing room to enjoy a more comfortable, unrushed trial experience. So take your time and think things over.
      

        If you do decide to return, we'll be sad to see you go but arrangements will be made to have the mattress picked up and you'll receive a full refund.
      








What is Comfort+?






Comfort+ is a uniquely designed, patent-pending system that integrates into the Novosbed for those that need their mattress firmness fine-tuned without a loose, bulky topper. It's elegant, easy to install, completely free, and available exclusively on Novosbed mattresses.
Offered in a firming option if you feel that your Novosbed needs a bit more support, or a softening option if you would like a little more plushness. We guarantee your comfort, so if you're not happy with the feel of your Novosbed even with Comfort+ installed, you can still return it for a full refund.
