Hybrids have changed the game for all player types. Unlike hybrids, long irons are extremely unforgiving and difficult to launch high shots. Hybrids are also extremely versatile from a variety of lies and shot conditions. Our selection of used or pre-owned hybrids will give you all the options you need to fill that long approach gap in your game. Join the hybrid revolution and don’t be left behind!

We worked with aerodynamics experts at Boeing to reach a completely new threshold of club speed. We made this a high head speed design with low drag, and we did it by pinpointing the size and placement of our re-engineered Speed Step to save weight and add more speed. That’s how XR 16 sets the standard in aerodynamics for fast speed and more distance.

This driver is extremely forgiving, and that’s what happens when you develop a larger shape for MOI with a bigger footprint, and put in a Center of Gravity that’s lower and deeper. All this forgiveness leads to more speed at every impact location, which can add more distance for all golfers.


[mk_padding_divider size=”90″][mk_padding_divider size=”80″][mk_fancy_title color=”#218dca” size=”20″ font_weight=”bold” txt_transform=”uppercase” letter_spacing=”1″ margin_bottom=”0″ font_family=”none” align=”center”]Even More Ball Speed With A Faster Face[/mk_fancy_title]
	

We’ve stepped up our game with next generation R•MOTO Face Technology that’s up to 19% thinner and the body is lighter too, which leads to more ball speed across the face. We’ve taken this saved weight and redistributed it in the clubhead for even more MOI. When you combine the faster face with the extreme forgiveness in this driver, you can pick up a lot of ball speed, whether you hit it dead center, off the heel, or off the toe. Doesn’t matter.

For the XR 16 Fairway Wood, we’ve made huge leaps in our industry-leading technology that’s helped us become the #1 Fairway Wood in Golf. And we came away with a design that’s bigger, hotter, and more forgiving with our lightest crown for even more ball speed and distance.

The head shape is bigger, and we’ve built in an awesome combination of our highest MOI, low Center of Gravity, and highest COR in a fairway wood. The forgiveness from our lightest crown ever allows us to move the weight where we want it. This fairway wood looks easy to hit because it IS easy hit, and it’s highly versatile with a cambered sole for the shots that you want to play. It’s longer and more playable from all lies.

We’ve taken our industry-leading Forged Hyper Speed Face Cup and made it hotter and thinner for even more speed and a large sweet spot. Is that something you might be interested in? We thought so.

We’ve improved the aerodynamics on this head shape to create even more head speed for you to go along with all that ball speed. By now you probably get that this fairway wood is designed for ultimate ball speed.

History[edit]
Callaway Golf Company was founded by former Burlington Industries textile president, Ely Callaway Jr. Callaway was raised in Lagrange, GA and was a graduate from Emory University. Callaway became very successful in the textile industry and was very fond of playing golf. At games, Callaway would use clubs by Hickory Sticks. The clubs were constructed of hickory-shafts with a steel core. At that time, Hickory Sticks was owned by Richard Parente, Dick De La Cruz and Tony Manzoni. As Hickory Sticks started running low on funds, they sought investors to help the company and approached Callaway. At the time, he had just sold his vineyards for a $9 million profit. Then in 1982, he bought half of Hickory Sticks, the company was renamed to Callaway Hickory Stick USA. In 1983, he became president and moved the company to Carlsbad, California where he sold clubs out of his Cadillac. In 1984, Callaway bought the rest of the company for $400,000. The company eventually changed to its present name in 1988.[5]
In 1985, the company hired Bruce Parker as head of sales, who later became the company's Chief Merchant and through his tenure with Callaway Golf as head of sales was responsible for sales in excess of $3.0 billion. As a key member of management, Parker was involved in all major decisions during the company's growth.
In 1986, Callaway hired a billiard cue designer, Richard C. Helmstetter, as a consultant. Helmstetter later became chief club designer that same year and introduced computer-controlled manufacturing machines. With his help and the help of Glenn Schmidt, the company's master tool maker, the company developed the original Big Bertha driver using large-volume (190cc) steel clubhead. The Big Bertha driver grew to 290 cc in 1997.[6]
In 1996, the company hired Roger Cleveland as chief club designer and in 2002, launched the Callaway Golf Forged Wedges. These wedges were constructed from carbon steel and a face with modified U grooves.[7]
In that same year, Callaway announced the development of a new golf ball, under the leadership of Chuck Yash, the former head of Taylormade Golf. Callaway Golf spent three years developing its new golf ball and a state-of-the-art production facility. The company’s entry into the market represented a $170 million investment in the research and development of the ball, construction of the 225,000-square-foot (20,900 m2) production facility, and development and purchase of special manufacturing equipment. Callaway’s manufacturing facility and its equipment were designed specifically for the unique production requirements for the new ball.
Callaway Golf Ball Company engineers, recruited from Du Pont and Boeing, used aerodynamic computer programs (first used by Boeing and General Electric) to evaluate more than 300 dimple patterns and more than 1,000 variations of ball cores, boundary layers, and cover materials to create the new Rule 35 ball. Callaway engineers designed only two models of the Rule 35 ball—choosing to develop a "complete-performance" ball rather than separate balls developed for spin, control, distance, and durability. Ely Callaway explained the company’s product development objectives as follows: "We have combined all of the performance benefits into one ball so players no longer need to sacrifice control for distance, or feel, or durability. Each Rule 35 ball contains a unique synergy of distance, control, spin, feel and durability characteristics. This eliminates confusion and guesswork in trying to identify the golf ball that is right for each individual golfer."[8]
In 1997, Odyssey Sports was acquired, expanding Callaway's line of putters.[3] This eventually led to the release of the Odyssey White Hot putter line in 2000.
Ely Callaway resigned as CEO and President in 1996 stepping aside for Donald H. Dye to take over as CEO and President, but Callaway continued to be an integral part of the company as Chairman of the Board and as President and CEO of Callaway Golf Ball Company and in a promotional role for all of Callaway's products. He later returned in 1998 to reassume his position as President and CEO of Callaway Golf Company but died of pancreatic cancer on July 5, 2001 which left the position to Ron Drapeau.[9]
In 2003, Ron Drapeau, announced the intended purchase of Top-Flite Golf, as well as its Ben Hogan Golf division, soon after it filed for Chapter 11. Following competition from Adidas the acquisition would eventually cost Callaway Golf $169 million.[4]
In 2003, Callaway Golf Staff Professional Annika Sorenstam announced that she would wear shoes from the new Callaway Golf(R) footwear collection."I'm always looking to use the best golf equipment, and that extends to my choice of shoes," said Sorenstam.[10]
On November 8, 2004, Callaway Golf named Chairman and Chief Executive William C. Baker President and COO, as Patrice Hutin resigned from his positions.[11]
April 4th, 2012, Callaway sold the Top-Flite brand to Dick's Sporting Goods, citing declining sales. [12]
Timeline[edit]
1984 -Ely Callaway buys a stake in Hickory Stick, a small clubmaker in Temecula, Calif. that makes wedges equipped with a unique shaft that features a steel core and wooden veneer in an attempt to combine the performance of a modern steel shaft with the appearance of a hickory shaft. The company name is changed to Callaway Hickory Stick.
1986 -Callaway buys out his partners and takes sole ownership of the company, which he renames Callaway Golf.
1988 -Callaway Golf introduces the S2H2 iron. It features a significantly shorter hosel than conventional irons; the weight saved from making the hosel shorter is relocated low in the clubhead to increase forgiveness and ease of launch.
1991 -The Big Bertha driver debuts and becomes an instant hit among golfers. Big Bertha’s unique shape, large size and “wide body” configuration give it a high degree of forgiveness that increases distance and accuracy of off-center hits.
1992 -Callaway Golf goes public In February 1992 on the New York Stock Exchange, trading under the symbol ELY, with a market capitalization of $250 million.
1994 -Callaway introduces Big Bertha irons which incorporates two key innovations: a thin, flexible clubface and 360-degree undercut around the perimeter of the cavity, which promote increased distance and forgiveness.

2000 -Callaway introduces its first golf ball, Rule 35, in two models, Red and Blue. Rule 35 Red has a firmer feel, Rule 35 Blue has a softer feel.

History[edit]
Callaway Golf Company was founded by former Burlington Industries textile president, Ely Callaway Jr. Callaway was raised in Lagrange, GA and was a graduate from Emory University. Callaway became very successful in the textile industry and was very fond of playing golf. At games, Callaway would use clubs by Hickory Sticks. The clubs were constructed of hickory-shafts with a steel core. At that time, Hickory Sticks was owned by Richard Parente, Dick De La Cruz and Tony Manzoni. As Hickory Sticks started running low on funds, they sought investors to help the company and approached Callaway. At the time, he had just sold his vineyards for a $9 million profit. Then in 1982, he bought half of Hickory Sticks, the company was renamed to Callaway Hickory Stick USA. In 1983, he became president and moved the company to Carlsbad, California where he sold clubs out of his Cadillac. In 1984, Callaway bought the rest of the company for $400,000. The company eventually changed to its present name in 1988.[5]
In 1985, the company hired Bruce Parker as head of sales, who later became the company's Chief Merchant and through his tenure with Callaway Golf as head of sales was responsible for sales in excess of $3.0 billion. As a key member of management, Parker was involved in all major decisions during the company's growth.
In 1986, Callaway hired a billiard cue designer, Richard C. Helmstetter, as a consultant. Helmstetter later became chief club designer that same year and introduced computer-controlled manufacturing machines. With his help and the help of Glenn Schmidt, the company's master tool maker, the company developed the original Big Bertha driver using large-volume (190cc) steel clubhead. The Big Bertha driver grew to 290 cc in 1997.[6]
In 1996, the company hired Roger Cleveland as chief club designer and in 2002, launched the Callaway Golf Forged Wedges. These wedges were constructed from carbon steel and a face with modified U grooves.[7]
In that same year, Callaway announced the development of a new golf ball, under the leadership of Chuck Yash, the former head of Taylormade Golf. Callaway Golf spent three years developing its new golf ball and a state-of-the-art production facility. The company’s entry into the market represented a $170 million investment in the research and development of the ball, construction of the 225,000-square-foot (20,900 m2) production facility, and development and purchase of special manufacturing equipment. Callaway’s manufacturing facility and its equipment were designed specifically for the unique production requirements for the new ball.
Callaway Golf Ball Company engineers, recruited from Du Pont and Boeing, used aerodynamic computer programs (first used by Boeing and General Electric) to evaluate more than 300 dimple patterns and more than 1,000 variations of ball cores, boundary layers, and cover materials to create the new Rule 35 ball. Callaway engineers designed only two models of the Rule 35 ball—choosing to develop a "complete-performance" ball rather than separate balls developed for spin, control, distance, and durability. Ely Callaway explained the company’s product development objectives as follows: "We have combined all of the performance benefits into one ball so players no longer need to sacrifice control for distance, or feel, or durability. Each Rule 35 ball contains a unique synergy of distance, control, spin, feel and durability characteristics. This eliminates confusion and guesswork in trying to identify the golf ball that is right for each individual golfer."[8]
In 1997, Odyssey Sports was acquired, expanding Callaway's line of putters.[3] This eventually led to the release of the Odyssey White Hot putter line in 2000.
Ely Callaway resigned as CEO and President in 1996 stepping aside for Donald H. Dye to take over as CEO and President, but Callaway continued to be an integral part of the company as Chairman of the Board and as President and CEO of Callaway Golf Ball Company and in a promotional role for all of Callaway's products. He later returned in 1998 to reassume his position as President and CEO of Callaway Golf Company but died of pancreatic cancer on July 5, 2001 which left the position to Ron Drapeau.[9]
In 2003, Ron Drapeau, announced the intended purchase of Top-Flite Golf, as well as its Ben Hogan Golf division, soon after it filed for Chapter 11. Following competition from Adidas the acquisition would eventually cost Callaway Golf $169 million.[4]
In 2003, Callaway Golf Staff Professional Annika Sorenstam announced that she would wear shoes from the new Callaway Golf(R) footwear collection."I'm always looking to use the best golf equipment, and that extends to my choice of shoes," said Sorenstam.[10]
On November 8, 2004, Callaway Golf named Chairman and Chief Executive William C. Baker President and COO, as Patrice Hutin resigned from his positions.[11]
April 4th, 2012, Callaway sold the Top-Flite brand to Dick's Sporting Goods, citing declining sales. [12]
Timeline[edit]
1984 -Ely Callaway buys a stake in Hickory Stick, a small clubmaker in Temecula, Calif. that makes wedges equipped with a unique shaft that features a steel core and wooden veneer in an attempt to combine the performance of a modern steel shaft with the appearance of a hickory shaft. The company name is changed to Callaway Hickory Stick.
1986 -Callaway buys out his partners and takes sole ownership of the company, which he renames Callaway Golf.
1988 -Callaway Golf introduces the S2H2 iron. It features a significantly shorter hosel than conventional irons; the weight saved from making the hosel shorter is relocated low in the clubhead to increase forgiveness and ease of launch.
1991 -The Big Bertha driver debuts and becomes an instant hit among golfers. Big Bertha’s unique shape, large size and “wide body” configuration give it a high degree of forgiveness that increases distance and accuracy of off-center hits.
1992 -Callaway Golf goes public In February 1992 on the New York Stock Exchange, trading under the symbol ELY, with a market capitalization of $250 million.
1994 -Callaway introduces Big Bertha irons which incorporates two key innovations: a thin, flexible clubface and 360-degree undercut around the perimeter of the cavity, which promote increased distance and forgiveness.
1995 -Callaway Tour Staff professional Annika Sorenstam wins the U.S. Women’s Open.
1996 -Callaway Tour Staff professional Annika Sorenstam wins the U.S. Women’s Open for the second time. -Renowned golf instructor David Leadbetter joins the Callaway Teaching Staff. -Wedge designer Roger Cleveland leaves the Cleveland golf company to join Callaway.
1997 -Callaway Golf acquires the Odyssey brand from Tommy Armour Golf and quickly turns it into the world’s number one brand of putters.
2000 -Callaway introduces its first golf ball, Rule 35, in two models, Red and Blue. Rule 35 Red has a firmer feel, Rule 35 Blue has a softer feel. Whereas golf balls are traditionally sold in sleeves of three and boxes of 12, Rule 35 is offered in sleeves of five and boxes of 15. -Arnold Palmer joins the Callaway Golf Tour Staff.
2001 -Callaway Tour Staff professional Annika Sorenstam wins the Kraft Nabisco Championship.

History[edit]
Callaway Golf Company was founded by former Burlington Industries textile president, Ely Callaway Jr. Callaway was raised in Lagrange, GA and was a graduate from Emory University. Callaway became very successful in the textile industry and was very fond of playing golf. At games, Callaway would use clubs by Hickory Sticks. The clubs were constructed of hickory-shafts with a steel core. At that time, Hickory Sticks was owned by Richard Parente, Dick De La Cruz and Tony Manzoni. As Hickory Sticks started running low on funds, they sought investors to help the company and approached Callaway. At the time, he had just sold his vineyards for a $9 million profit. Then in 1982, he bought half of Hickory Sticks, the company was renamed to Callaway Hickory Stick USA. In 1983, he became president and moved the company to Carlsbad, California where he sold clubs out of his Cadillac. In 1984, Callaway bought the rest of the company for $400,000. The company eventually changed to its present name in 1988.[5]
In 1985, the company hired Bruce Parker as head of sales, who later became the company's Chief Merchant and through his tenure with Callaway Golf as head of sales was responsible for sales in excess of $3.0 billion. As a key member of management, Parker was involved in all major decisions during the company's growth.
In 1986, Callaway hired a billiard cue designer, Richard C. Helmstetter, as a consultant. Helmstetter later became chief club designer that same year and introduced computer-controlled manufacturing machines. With his help and the help of Glenn Schmidt, the company's master tool maker, the company developed the original Big Bertha driver using large-volume (190cc) steel clubhead. The Big Bertha driver grew to 290 cc in 1997.[6]
In 1996, the company hired Roger Cleveland as chief club designer and in 2002, launched the Callaway Golf Forged Wedges. These wedges were constructed from carbon steel and a face with modified U grooves.[7]
In that same year, Callaway announced the development of a new golf ball, under the leadership of Chuck Yash, the former head of Taylormade Golf. Callaway Golf spent three years developing its new golf ball and a state-of-the-art production facility. The company’s entry into the market represented a $170 million investment in the research and development of the ball, construction of the 225,000-square-foot (20,900 m2) production facility, and development and purchase of special manufacturing equipment. Callaway’s manufacturing facility and its equipment were designed specifically for the unique production requirements for the new ball.
Callaway Golf Ball Company engineers, recruited from Du Pont and Boeing, used aerodynamic computer programs (first used by Boeing and General Electric) to evaluate more than 300 dimple patterns and more than 1,000 variations of ball cores, boundary layers, and cover materials to create the new Rule 35 ball. Callaway engineers designed only two models of the Rule 35 ball—choosing to develop a "complete-performance" ball rather than separate balls developed for spin, control, distance, and durability. Ely Callaway explained the company’s product development objectives as follows: "We have combined all of the performance benefits into one ball so players no longer need to sacrifice control for distance, or feel, or durability. Each Rule 35 ball contains a unique synergy of distance, control, spin, feel and durability characteristics. This eliminates confusion and guesswork in trying to identify the golf ball that is right for each individual golfer."[8]
In 1997, Odyssey Sports was acquired, expanding Callaway's line of putters.[3] This eventually led to the release of the Odyssey White Hot putter line in 2000.
Ely Callaway resigned as CEO and President in 1996 stepping aside for Donald H. Dye to take over as CEO and President, but Callaway continued to be an integral part of the company as Chairman of the Board and as President and CEO of Callaway Golf Ball Company and in a promotional role for all of Callaway's products. He later returned in 1998 to reassume his position as President and CEO of Callaway Golf Company but died of pancreatic cancer on July 5, 2001 which left the position to Ron Drapeau.[9]
In 2003, Ron Drapeau, announced the intended purchase of Top-Flite Golf, as well as its Ben Hogan Golf division, soon after it filed for Chapter 11. Following competition from Adidas the acquisition would eventually cost Callaway Golf $169 million.[4]
In 2003, Callaway Golf Staff Professional Annika Sorenstam announced that she would wear shoes from the new Callaway Golf(R) footwear collection."I'm always looking to use the best golf equipment, and that extends to my choice of shoes," said Sorenstam.[10]
On November 8, 2004, Callaway Golf named Chairman and Chief Executive William C. Baker President and COO, as Patrice Hutin resigned from his positions.[11]
April 4th, 2012, Callaway sold the Top-Flite brand to Dick's Sporting Goods, citing declining sales. [12]
Timeline[edit]
1984 -Ely Callaway buys a stake in Hickory Stick, a small clubmaker in Temecula, Calif. that makes wedges equipped with a unique shaft that features a steel core and wooden veneer in an attempt to combine the performance of a modern steel shaft with the appearance of a hickory shaft. The company name is changed to Callaway Hickory Stick.
1986 -Callaway buys out his partners and takes sole ownership of the company, which he renames Callaway Golf.
1988 -Callaway Golf introduces the S2H2 iron. It features a significantly shorter hosel than conventional irons; the weight saved from making the hosel shorter is relocated low in the clubhead to increase forgiveness and ease of launch.
1991 -The Big Bertha driver debuts and becomes an instant hit among golfers. Big Bertha’s unique shape, large size and “wide body” configuration give it a high degree of forgiveness that increases distance and accuracy of off-center hits.
1992 -Callaway Golf goes public In February 1992 on the New York Stock Exchange, trading under the symbol ELY, with a market capitalization of $250 million.
1994 -Callaway introduces Big Bertha irons which incorporates two key innovations: a thin, flexible clubface and 360-degree undercut around the perimeter of the cavity, which promote increased distance and forgiveness.
1995 -Callaway Tour Staff professional Annika Sorenstam wins the U.S. Women’s Open.
1996 -Callaway Tour Staff professional Annika Sorenstam wins the U.S. Women’s Open for the second time. -Renowned golf instructor David Leadbetter joins the Callaway Teaching Staff. -Wedge designer Roger Cleveland leaves the Cleveland golf company to join Callaway.
1997 -Callaway Golf acquires the Odyssey brand from Tommy Armour Golf and quickly turns it into the world’s number one brand of putters.
2000 -Callaway introduces its first golf ball, Rule 35, in two models, Red and Blue. Rule 35 Red has a firmer feel, Rule 35 Blue has a softer feel. Whereas golf balls are traditionally sold in sleeves of three and boxes of 12, Rule 35 is offered in sleeves of five and boxes of 15. -Arnold Palmer joins the Callaway Golf Tour Staff.
2001 -Callaway Tour Staff professional Annika Sorenstam wins the Kraft Nabisco Championship.

History[edit]
Callaway Golf Company was founded by former Burlington Industries textile president, Ely Callaway Jr. Callaway was raised in Lagrange, GA and was a graduate from Emory University. Callaway became very successful in the textile industry and was very fond of playing golf. At games, Callaway would use clubs by Hickory Sticks. The clubs were constructed of hickory-shafts with a steel core. At that time, Hickory Sticks was owned by Richard Parente, Dick De La Cruz and Tony Manzoni. As Hickory Sticks started running low on funds, they sought investors to help the company and approached Callaway. At the time, he had just sold his vineyards for a $9 million profit. Then in 1982, he bought half of Hickory Sticks, the company was renamed to Callaway Hickory Stick USA. In 1983, he became president and moved the company to Carlsbad, California where he sold clubs out of his Cadillac. In 1984, Callaway bought the rest of the company for $400,000. The company eventually changed to its present name in 1988.[5]
In 1985, the company hired Bruce Parker as head of sales, who later became the company's Chief Merchant and through his tenure with Callaway Golf as head of sales was responsible for sales in excess of $3.0 billion. As a key member of management, Parker was involved in all major decisions during the company's growth.
In 1986, Callaway hired a billiard cue designer, Richard C. Helmstetter, as a consultant. Helmstetter later became chief club designer that same year and introduced computer-controlled manufacturing machines. With his help and the help of Glenn Schmidt, the company's master tool maker, the company developed the original Big Bertha driver using large-volume (190cc) steel clubhead. The Big Bertha driver grew to 290 cc in 1997.[6]
In 1996, the company hired Roger Cleveland as chief club designer and in 2002, launched the Callaway Golf Forged Wedges. These wedges were constructed from carbon steel and a face with modified U grooves.[7]
In that same year, Callaway announced the development of a new golf ball, under the leadership of Chuck Yash, the former head of Taylormade Golf. Callaway Golf spent three years developing its new golf ball and a state-of-the-art production facility. The company’s entry into the market represented a $170 million investment in the research and development of the ball, construction of the 225,000-square-foot (20,900 m2) production facility, and development and purchase of special manufacturing equipment. Callaway’s manufacturing facility and its equipment were designed specifically for the unique production requirements for the new ball.
Callaway Golf Ball Company engineers, recruited from Du Pont and Boeing, used aerodynamic computer programs (first used by Boeing and General Electric) to evaluate more than 300 dimple patterns and more than 1,000 variations of ball cores, boundary layers, and cover materials to create the new Rule 35 ball. Callaway engineers designed only two models of the Rule 35 ball—choosing to develop a "complete-performance" ball rather than separate balls developed for spin, control, distance, and durability. Ely Callaway explained the company’s product development objectives as follows: "We have combined all of the performance benefits into one ball so players no longer need to sacrifice control for distance, or feel, or durability. Each Rule 35 ball contains a unique synergy of distance, control, spin, feel and durability characteristics. This eliminates confusion and guesswork in trying to identify the golf ball that is right for each individual golfer."[8]
In 1997, Odyssey Sports was acquired, expanding Callaway's line of putters.[3] This eventually led to the release of the Odyssey White Hot putter line in 2000.
Ely Callaway resigned as CEO and President in 1996 stepping aside for Donald H. Dye to take over as CEO and President, but Callaway continued to be an integral part of the company as Chairman of the Board and as President and CEO of Callaway Golf Ball Company and in a promotional role for all of Callaway's products. He later returned in 1998 to reassume his position as President and CEO of Callaway Golf Company but died of pancreatic cancer on July 5, 2001 which left the position to Ron Drapeau.[9]
In 2003, Ron Drapeau, announced the intended purchase of Top-Flite Golf, as well as its Ben Hogan Golf division, soon after it filed for Chapter 11. Following competition from Adidas the acquisition would eventually cost Callaway Golf $169 million.[4]
In 2003, Callaway Golf Staff Professional Annika Sorenstam announced that she would wear shoes from the new Callaway Golf(R) footwear collection."I'm always looking to use the best golf equipment, and that extends to my choice of shoes," said Sorenstam.[10]
On November 8, 2004, Callaway Golf named Chairman and Chief Executive William C. Baker President and COO, as Patrice Hutin resigned from his positions.[11]
April 4th, 2012, Callaway sold the Top-Flite brand to Dick's Sporting Goods, citing declining sales. [12]
Timeline[edit]
1984 -Ely Callaway buys a stake in Hickory Stick, a small clubmaker in Temecula, Calif. that makes wedges equipped with a unique shaft that features a steel core and wooden veneer in an attempt to combine the performance of a modern steel shaft with the appearance of a hickory shaft. The company name is changed to Callaway Hickory Stick.
1986 -Callaway buys out his partners and takes sole ownership of the company, which he renames Callaway Golf.
1988 -Callaway Golf introduces the S2H2 iron. It features a significantly shorter hosel than conventional irons; the weight saved from making the hosel shorter is relocated low in the clubhead to increase forgiveness and ease of launch.
1991 -The Big Bertha driver debuts and becomes an instant hit among golfers. Big Bertha’s unique shape, large size and “wide body” configuration give it a high degree of forgiveness that increases distance and accuracy of off-center hits.
1992 -Callaway Golf goes public In February 1992 on the New York Stock Exchange, trading under the symbol ELY, with a market capitalization of $250 million.
1994 -Callaway introduces Big Bertha irons which incorporates two key innovations: a thin, flexible clubface and 360-degree undercut around the perimeter of the cavity, which promote increased distance and forgiveness.

2000 -Callaway introduces its first golf ball, Rule 35, in two models, Red and Blue. Rule 35 Red has a firmer feel, Rule 35 Blue has a softer feel.

Callaway Golf Co is Among the Companies in the Leisure Products Industry With the Highest P/E Ratio (ELY, MPX, PII, MAT, HAS)



Written on Wed, 07/12/2017 - 1:10am
 By David Diaz
Below are the three companies in the Leisure Products industry with the highest price to earnings (P/E) ratios.  P/E is an important valuation tool when comparing companies in the same industry. A higher P/E ratio means that investors are paying more for each unit of net income, so the stock is more expensive compared to one with a lower P/E ratio.Callaway Golf Co ranks highest with a a P/E ratio of 55.13.  Following is Marine Products with a a P/E ratio of 32.56.  Polaris Inds ranks third highest with a a P/E ratio of 30.49.Mattel Inc follows with a a P/E ratio of 25.06, and Hasbro Inc rounds out the top five with a a P/E ratio of 24.32.SmarTrend recommended that subscribers consider buying shares of Hasbro Inc on January 5th, 2017 as our technology indicated a new Uptrend was in progress when shares hit $81.75. Since that recommendation, shares of Hasbro Inc have risen 37.2%.  We continue to monitor Hasbro Inc for any potential shift so investors can protect gains and will alert SmarTrend subscribers immediately.

This advanced multi-component golf ball features a large dual core with a soft center, soft Fusablend cover and spherically tiled 302 octahedral dimple design.
Player Benefits

Engineered for performance and soft feel

The Titleist NXT Tour S golf ball delivers the same high-performance characteristics as NXT Tour with significantly softer feel. This golf ball features a proprietary soft compression, highly resilient core, and, like NXT Tour, utilizes a soft Fusablend cover and a spherically tiled, 302 octahedral dimple design. Available in white and high optic yellow.
Player Benefits

The aerodynamics package on NXT Tour S now has deeper dimple depths to slightly lower the trajectory for maximized distance.


















Cover system
The new Fusablend cover is softer to enhance feel around the green and provide excellent shot stopping control.


















Core
The new core is the softest ever created for NXT Tour S, providing noticeably softer feel and very low spin on your long game shots for great distance.

Golfers will see and feel the innovation behind NXT Tour and NXT Tour S golf balls.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.

Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
