Quantum Energy Inc.
QUANTUM ENERGY, INC. is a solutions-based energy infrastructure holding company focused on deploying modern and efficient energy processing technologies within underserved markets in the dynamic shale regions of North America. Quantum management has identified unique energy infrastructure and business model opportunities to enhance the long- term energy comparative advantage gained by the recent developments in the North American Oil & Gas Industry.
Currently, Quantum and its partners have identified the USA / Canadian Bakken / Three Forks / Torquay formation and its surrounding areas as a market location that will benefit from the build-out of energy processing centers to support local area stakeholders with quality solutions, value- added processing, products and services. Quantum management has determined that it can achieve a competitive advantage by combining improved modular engineering technologies, appropriate scale and mutually beneficial stakeholder / venture partnerships that will generate positive returns to our shareholders.
Quantum plans to build a modern modular and technologically efficient, environmentally compliant 40,000 bpd finished product Energy Processing Center in Stoughton, SK. The site location is adjacent to a Crescent Point Energy gas capturing plant within the Viewfield crude oil production region. Quantum has established a Canadian subsidiary, Dominion Energy Processing Group, Inc. (DEPGI), to plan, develop, construct and operate the Stoughton facility www.dominionenergyca.com.
