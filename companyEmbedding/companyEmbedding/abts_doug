Description



        		Application
				
				

        2,2′-Azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) is a peroxidase substrate suitable for use in ELISA procedures. This substrate produces a soluble end product that is green in color and can be read spectrophotometrically at 405 nm. The reaction may be stopped with 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Recommended for ELISA (microwell) procedures, not recommended for membrane applications.
        

        ABTS (C18H16N4O6S4-(NH4)2) is a peroxidase substrate for ELISA.

        		General description
				
				

        2,2′-azino-di-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonic acid) or ABTS acts a substrate for HRP (horseradish peroxidase) conjugate during enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). It is the most sensitive, and stable substrate when compared to three other substrates namely, 5-aminosalicylic acid (5AS), O-phenylenediamine (OPD), O-tolidine (OT). It also produces the best visual results, where it gives a bluish-green color. ELISA using ABTS is a highly sensitive, specific and reproducible technique.

Early life and education[edit]
Abts was born in 1967 in Kiel, Germany,[1] to a teacher in a primary school and a gynecologist.[3] Between 1989-1995 Abts attended the Hochschule der Künste Berlin.[1] She has been living in London since 1995,[4] and maintains a studio in Clerkenwell, which she has occupied since first coming to London on a grant.[3] It was only by 2002 that she was able to live solely from her paintings.[3]
Work[edit]
Starting each of her works without a preconceived idea, knowing only the size of the canvas and her materials,[5] Abts works in acrylic and oil, often building up her designs from repetitive geometrical elements. Her style can be classified as abstract, but also in opposition to Germany’s Neo-Expressionist figurative painting.[6] None of her paintings are representational. There are no references to nature, the world or any other theme. The abstraction in her paintings is supported by the lack of detail and an overall retro feel. The paintings do not follow the traditional rules of abstract art though. They involve complex shapes that are layered and woven in different ways with added highlights, shadows and sense of depth.[7]
Abts used to work on canvasses of all sizes.[3] Since the early 2000s, all of Abts’ paintings are 48 x 38 centimeters and the titles of her paintings are derived from a dictionary of German first names. She has said that this is the size and style that works for her.[8] Each work takes on a color scheme that is rich and somewhat neutral. The colors are not obviously vibrant and work with each other’s tones within each work of art.[6] Abts creates a 3D effect by continually and meticulously layering and working up each painting. The works are thickly painted, almost over-painted, which gives a hint of something created by trial and error. It seems as though the layers of paint could be covering up something underneath the finished product. “Abts approaches each canvas without preconception, building up layers of paint until a form crystallizes.”[9] Abts takes a long time to produce her works, and she is not prolific.[10] She also has begun to translate her paintings into prints, particularly with the acclaimed Crown Point Press in San Francisco, California.[11]
Recognition[edit]
Abts is the winner of the 2006 Turner Prize, awarded by the Tate, London.[8] The Tate Gallery praised "her rigorous and consistent approach to painting" and added "Through her intimate and compelling canvases she builds on and enriches the language of abstract painting."[12] The other artists on the shortlist in 2006 were Rebecca Warren, Phil Collins (artist), and Mark Titchner.[1] Abts was the first female painter to win the award.

Early life and education[edit]
Abts was born in 1967 in Kiel, Germany,[1] to a teacher in a primary school and a gynecologist.[3] Between 1989-1995 Abts attended the Hochschule der Künste Berlin.[1] She has been living in London since 1995,[4] and maintains a studio in Clerkenwell, which she has occupied since first coming to London on a grant.[3] It was only by 2002 that she was able to live solely from her paintings.[3]
Work[edit]
Starting each of her works without a preconceived idea, knowing only the size of the canvas and her materials,[5] Abts works in acrylic and oil, often building up her designs from repetitive geometrical elements. Her style can be classified as abstract, but also in opposition to Germany’s Neo-Expressionist figurative painting.[6] None of her paintings are representational. There are no references to nature, the world or any other theme. The abstraction in her paintings is supported by the lack of detail and an overall retro feel. The paintings do not follow the traditional rules of abstract art though. They involve complex shapes that are layered and woven in different ways with added highlights, shadows and sense of depth.[7]
Abts used to work on canvasses of all sizes.[3] Since the early 2000s, all of Abts’ paintings are 48 x 38 centimeters and the titles of her paintings are derived from a dictionary of German first names. She has said that this is the size and style that works for her.[8] Each work takes on a color scheme that is rich and somewhat neutral. The colors are not obviously vibrant and work with each other’s tones within each work of art.[6] Abts creates a 3D effect by continually and meticulously layering and working up each painting. The works are thickly painted, almost over-painted, which gives a hint of something created by trial and error. It seems as though the layers of paint could be covering up something underneath the finished product. “Abts approaches each canvas without preconception, building up layers of paint until a form crystallizes.”[9] Abts takes a long time to produce her works, and she is not prolific.[10] She also has begun to translate her paintings into prints, particularly with the acclaimed Crown Point Press in San Francisco, California.[11]
Recognition[edit]
Abts is the winner of the 2006 Turner Prize, awarded by the Tate, London.[8] The Tate Gallery praised "her rigorous and consistent approach to painting" and added "Through her intimate and compelling canvases she builds on and enriches the language of abstract painting."[12] The other artists on the shortlist in 2006 were Rebecca Warren, Phil Collins (artist), and Mark Titchner.[1] Abts was the first female painter to win the award.

Abts used to work on canvasses of all sizes.[3] Since the early 2000s, all of Abts’ paintings are 48 x 38 centimeters and the titles of her paintings are derived from a dictionary of German first names. She has said that this is the size and style that works for her.[8] Each work takes on a color scheme that is rich and somewhat neutral. The colors are not obviously vibrant and work with each other’s tones within each work of art.[6] Abts creates a 3D effect by continually and meticulously layering and working up each painting. The works are thickly painted, almost over-painted, which gives a hint of something created by trial and error. It seems as though the layers of paint could be covering up something underneath the finished product. “Abts approaches each canvas without preconception, building up layers of paint until a form crystallizes.”[9] Abts takes a long time to produce her works, and she is not prolific.[10] She also has begun to translate her paintings into prints, particularly with the acclaimed Crown Point Press in San Francisco, California.[11]
Recognition[edit]
Abts is the winner of the 2006 Turner Prize, awarded by the Tate, London.[8] The Tate Gallery praised "her rigorous and consistent approach to painting" and added "Through her intimate and compelling canvases she builds on and enriches the language of abstract painting."[12] The other artists on the shortlist in 2006 were Rebecca Warren, Phil Collins (artist), and Mark Titchner.[1] Abts was the first female painter to win the award.

Early life and education[edit]
Abts was born in 1967 in Kiel, Germany,[1] to a teacher in a primary school and a gynecologist.[3] Between 1989-1995 Abts attended the Hochschule der Künste Berlin.[1] She has been living in London since 1995,[4] and maintains a studio in Clerkenwell, which she has occupied since first coming to London on a grant.[3] It was only by 2002 that she was able to live solely from her paintings.[3]
Work[edit]
Starting each of her works without a preconceived idea, knowing only the size of the canvas and her materials,[5] Abts works in acrylic and oil, often building up her designs from repetitive geometrical elements. Her style can be classified as abstract, but also in opposition to Germany’s Neo-Expressionist figurative painting.[6] None of her paintings are representational. There are no references to nature, the world or any other theme. The abstraction in her paintings is supported by the lack of detail and an overall retro feel. The paintings do not follow the traditional rules of abstract art though. They involve complex shapes that are layered and woven in different ways with added highlights, shadows and sense of depth.[7]
Abts used to work on canvasses of all sizes.[3] Since the early 2000s, all of Abts’ paintings are 48 x 38 centimeters and the titles of her paintings are derived from a dictionary of German first names. She has said that this is the size and style that works for her.[8] Each work takes on a color scheme that is rich and somewhat neutral. The colors are not obviously vibrant and work with each other’s tones within each work of art.[6] Abts creates a 3D effect by continually and meticulously layering and working up each painting. The works are thickly painted, almost over-painted, which gives a hint of something created by trial and error. It seems as though the layers of paint could be covering up something underneath the finished product. “Abts approaches each canvas without preconception, building up layers of paint until a form crystallizes.”[9] Abts takes a long time to produce her works, and she is not prolific.[10] She also has begun to translate her paintings into prints, particularly with the acclaimed Crown Point Press in San Francisco, California.[11]
Recognition[edit]
Abts is the winner of the 2006 Turner Prize, awarded by the Tate, London.[8] The Tate Gallery praised "her rigorous and consistent approach to painting" and added "Through her intimate and compelling canvases she builds on and enriches the language of abstract painting."[12] The other artists on the shortlist in 2006 were Rebecca Warren, Phil Collins (artist), and Mark Titchner.[1] Abts was the first female painter to win the award.

In biochemistry, 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) or ABTS is chemical compound used to observe the reaction kinetics of specific enzymes. A common use for it is in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect for binding of molecules to each other.
It is commonly used as a substrate with hydrogen peroxide for a peroxidase enzyme (such as horseradish peroxidase) or alone with blue multicopper oxidase enzymes (such as laccase or bilirubin oxidase). Its use allows the reaction kinetics of peroxidases themselves to be followed. In this way it also can be used to indirectly follow the reaction kinetics of any hydrogen peroxide-producing enzyme, or to simply quantify the amount of hydrogen peroxide in a sample.
The formal reduction potentials for ABTS are high enough for it to act as an electron donor for the reduction of oxo species such as molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide, particularly at the less-extreme pH values encountered in biological catalysis. Under these conditions, the sulfonate groups are fully deprotonated and the mediator exists as a dianion..

ABTS–· + e– → ABTS2– E°′ = 0.67 V vs SHE
ABTS + e– → ABTS–· E°′ = 1.08 V vs SHE[1]

This compound is chosen because the enzyme facilitates the reaction with hydrogen peroxide, turning it into a green and soluble end-product. Its new absorbance maximum of 420 nm light (ε = 3.6 × 104 M–1 cm–1)[2] can easily be followed with a spectrophotometer, a common laboratory instrument. It is sometimes used as part of a glucose estimating reagent when finding glucose concentrations of solutions such as blood serum.
ABTS is also frequently used by the food industry and agricultural researchers to measure the antioxidant capacities of foods.[3] In this assay, ABTS is converted to its radical cation by addition of sodium persulfate. This radical cation is blue in color and absorbs light at 734 nm.[4] The ABTS radical cation is reactive towards most antioxidants including phenolics, thiols and Vitamin C.[5] During this reaction, the blue ABTS radical cation is converted back to its colorless neutral form. The reaction may be monitored spectrophotometrically. This assay is often referred to as the Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) assay. The reactivity of the various antioxidants tested are compared to that of Trolox, which is a water-soluble analog of vitamin E.[6]
Applications for Functional Food Analysis[edit]
Based on the special chemical properties of formed free radicals, ABTS assay has been used to determine the antioxidant capacity of food products. For example, polyphenol compounds, which widely exist in fruit, can quench free radicals inside human body, thus prevent oxidative damage by free radicals. The antioxidant potency of plant extract or food product has been measured by ABTS assay. One example with detailed method is the antioxidant activity analysis of Hibiscus products.[7]

                                            Background



                                            ABTS ELISA Peroxidase Substrate (2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid)) is a chromogenic substrate use to visualize reactivity of certain enzymes, particularly in immunosorbent assays.  ABTS ELISA Peroxidase Substrate is commonly used with peroxidases, but is ammenable to many other enzymes.  In the presence of active enzyme, the substrate becomes a soluble green product detectable at 405nm.
