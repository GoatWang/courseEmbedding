What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

Certification Coaching Organization,LLC (CCO) is owned and managed by Laureen Jandroep, CPC, CPC-I, COC, CMSCS, CHCI, CPPM, CDEO, CPMA who is also the founder and CEO. The mission of CCO is to help new and seasoned medical coders, billers and practice managers with their certification education – first to get certified then to maintain certification.
This is done via articles, videos and practice questions many of which are freely available through out the site. Some are paid products like our popular Coding Certification Review Blitz and CEU On Demand Classes and Physician Based Coding Course. We have a new discussion board where aspiring coders can ask their questions about getting certified and one where certified coders can discuss ways they’ve maintained their CEUs for their respective credential.
About Laureen Jandroep, BSOT, CPC, CPC-I, COC, CMSCS, CHCI, CPPM, CDEO, CPMA, CPB, CEMC
CCO Founder and CEO

Laureen has over 29 years in the healthcare field. She graduated as an Occupational Therapist in 1986 and before long was running a successful therapy practice which did over 1.6 million in billing per year with a less than .06% rejection rate. Once Medicare changed how rehab companies were reimbursed this business was closed and Laureen eventually started a new company dedicated to teaching Medical Billing and Coding. This business was eventually sold and is now run by the AAPC as part of their online course offerings.
Currently Laureen runs CCO (CCO) an online medical coding and healthcare business training firm with an emphasis on helping others obtain their professional certifications through the AAPC.
She founded the Southern Jersey Chapter of the AAPC and also served on the AAPC National Advisory board from 2003 – 2006 in addition to being a consulting editor for several “Coding Alert” publications for the Coding Institute.
Laureen lives in southern New Jersey with her husband of 20+ years Anthony and four young children. They are active foster parents and spend most of their free time these days just being parents which they love.
Laureen is a Subject Matter Expert (SME) and Coach for the Following CCO Courses

She first learned about medical coding while working in a medical records department at a resort town hospital near where she was raised. Through the years she has held several jobs in the medical field from, CNA, EMT, Pharmacy technician and Medial Records Abstractor and Analyst.  Outside of the medical field she has worked as a Real Estate agent, and owned her own on-line retail business. The medical field has always been where she felt the most comfortable.
After high school Alicia was accepted into a nursing program at a local university in Missouri. She started the program but did not complete it due to a sudden illness. During that time she got married and started a family. With intentions to always go back and finish her nursing degree she got the opportunity to work in medical coding instead.  She joined the AAPC and became certified as a CPC® in 2011, a CPC-I® in 2013 and a CRC® in 2015.
Alicia lived in West Texas but has moved back to Missouri where her husband is attending Concordia Seminary. While in Texas she taught medical coding, billing and medical law and ethics at a private college. During her time in Texas she also did contract work in HCC Risk Adjustment and discovered she really enjoyed ICD work. Because she loves to learn Alicia is working towards her Masters in Health Care Administration with an emphasis on education.

What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
