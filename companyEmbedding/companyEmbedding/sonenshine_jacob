Jacob P. Sonenshine







Jacob's Bio
 


 For PBS Newshour, Jacob Sonenshine researched and helped produced news reports on topics including political campaign financing and Chinese investment in Kenya. The then summer 2015 intern also did the English-translation voiceover of a speech by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
 
Before that internship at PBS' New York City headquarters, Jacob covered campus politics and budget issues for the City College of New York’s newspaper, The Campus. He broke the story on a controversial effort to transform The Sophie Davis School of Biomedicine into a full-fledged medical school by siphoning funds from other college accounts. 
 
At City College, Jacob also hosted, produced and ran his own sports radio show at. Formerly an NCAA baseball player, Jacob was named to the student-athlete academic honor roll in 2015. He was also invited to the National Society for Leadership and Success. 
 
He now reports for The Envoy, the student newspaper at New York City's Hunter College, where he currently studies. 
Peers and colleagues ask why Jacob does not simply pursue finance, government or politics, subjects he religiously studies, instead of journalism. The answer: He loves and prefers grappling with and excavating the fundamental facts that underlie those and other topics. 
 
Jacob aims to someday work for The Wall Street Journal, New York Times, CNN and MSNBC and eventually to anchor network news.
