Please, stand by, we're about to begin. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Finisar Corporation Announces Third Quarter Results Conference Call. Just a quick reminder, today's call is being recorded.
And now, at this time, I will turn things over to Jerry Rawls, Executive Chairman.
Jerry S. Rawls - Executive Chairman
Thank you, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate you're taking the time to listen to our conference call today. A replay of this call should appear on our website within eight hours. An audio replay will be available for two weeks by calling area code 888-203-1112 for domestic, or area code 719-457-0820 for international and then enter the ID number 3629508.
I need to remind all of you that any forward-looking statements in today's discussion are subject to risks and uncertainties which are discussed at length in our Annual and Quarterly SEC filings. Actual events and results can differ materially from any forward-looking statements.
In addition, the company undertakes no obligations to update any forward-looking information presented. In addition, unless otherwise indicated, all results discussed are on a non-GAAP basis. A complete reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results may be found in our earnings press release and in the Investor Relations section of our website.
We have prepared some slides for today's earnings call. You can view them by connecting to the Investor Relations page of our website at finisar.com. Click on Investors, then scroll down and click on Webcast Archives, you'll see a listing for today's third quarter 2015 earnings call.
Revenues for our just completed third fiscal quarter were $306.3 million, an increase of $9.3 million over the prior quarter. Revenue growth was primarily driven by the demand for 40 gigabit and 100 gigabit transceivers for datacom applications as well as transceivers for fourth generation wireless base station installations.
And now with that, I'll let Kurt review the rest of the numbers. Kurt?
Kurt Adzema - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Jerry. Datacom revenue increased by $18.5 million or 8.5% compared to the preceding quarter. Telecom revenue decreased by $9.2 million or 11.3%, compared to the preceding quarter, primarily due to the impact of one month of the annual telecom price reduction that typically takes effect on January 1 and a decrease in demand for transceivers for telecom applications driven by sluggish carrier CapEx levels.
In the third quarter, we had one 10% or greater customer. Our top 10 customers represented 56.1% of total revenues compared to 55.8% in the preceding quarter. Non-GAAP gross margins decreased to 30% from 31.1% in the preceding quarter, primarily driven by the impact of one month of the telecom price reduction and the impact of substantial yield loss for a new optical engine product for supercomputing applications that we started to ramp into production during the quarter.
Non-GAAP operating expenses decreased $2.2 million to $65.1 million from $67.3 million in the preceding quarter. Non-GAAP operating income increased $1.9 million to $26.9 million or 8.8% of revenues compared to $25 million or 8.4% in the preceding quarter primarily as the result of higher revenue and lower operating expenses. Non-GAAP income was $26.7 million or $0.25 per diluted share compared to $23.5 million or $0.23 in the preceding quarter.

Average diluted shares for non-GAAP purposes totaled 106 million. For non-GAAP purposes, the interest expense for our $258 million of 0.5% convertible notes was approximately $323,000 in the third quarter. This interest expense is the only impact of these converts in our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share as no shares are added to the fully diluted share count.
Third quarter capital expenditures totaled $31.7 million. This was less than our prior forecast of approximately $40 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $35 million in the fourth quarter primarily driven by the continued construction of the second building on our new Wuxi, China factory. We expect the second building to be completed by the end of the fourth quarter and we expect to have all remaining volume manufacturing move from Shanghai to Wuxi and requalified with the customers by the end of our second quarter of fiscal 2016. We will continue to perform R&D and NPI manufacturing work in Shanghai as well as some corporate functions.
Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased $11.4 million to $488.9 million at the end of the third quarter. Non-GAAP taxes are estimated at 6% for the fourth quarter and 6% to 7% for fiscal 2016. Weighted average fully diluted shares for the fiscal fourth quarter are expected to be approximately 107 million for non-GAAP purposes.
There are a number of non-cash or infrequently occurring charges and benefits which we exclude from non-GAAP results. These totaled $25 million last quarter. To include all these items as required under GAAP we generated net income of $1.7 million or $0.02 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $11.4 million or $0.11 per diluted share in the preceding quarter.
That concludes my comments and I'll turn it over to Eitan.
Eitan Gertel - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Kurt. We expect revenues for our fourth quarter will be in the range of $310 million to $330 million. Please note that the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 will have 14 weeks compared to 13 weeks in prior quarter. However, the positive benefit of revenues for extra week in the quarter will be partially offset by the impact of the Chinese New Year which occurred in February.
We expect non-GAAP gross margins to be approximately 30% primarily due to the impact of full three months of the annual telecom price reductions. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to increase primarily due to the extra week relative to the prior quarter. Non-GAAP operating margins are expected to be approximately 8% to 9%.
Non-GAAP earning per diluted share are expected to be in the range of $0.22 per share to $0.28 per share. As a reminder, our first quarter of fiscal 2016 will once again have 13 weeks relative to 14 weeks in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.
We continue to believe in the long-term growth prospects of the company. Finisar revenue is driven primarily by growth in the worldwide demand for bandwidth with ever increasing distribution and use of video, images and digital information.
In addition, Finisar continues to benefit from growth in cloud services, which drive networking hardware upgrades of existing data centers and build outs of new hyperscale data centers.
And now with that, I am going to turn back over the call to Matt, to open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. And at this time we will take a question from Joseph Wolf with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Joseph Wolf - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Thanks, guys. Question about the guidance, the range implies a broad range of revenues, very little on the margin side. Is there a large order in there that you are factoring into that guidance or is there some sort of mix that I am not seeing on the margin side of the guidance?

Kurt Adzema - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Well, again the guidance is reflective of the fact that – the revenue guidance is reflective of the fact that we'll have the one extra week offset by the impact of Chinese New Year. The gross margin guidance was reflective of the fact that we will have 14 weeks of expenses as well as we'll have the full three months of the telecom price reduction.
Joseph Wolf - Barclays Capital, Inc.
So there could be some variability in the mix that's the kind of impact is?
Kurt Adzema - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Well there is always variability of mix.
Joseph Wolf - Barclays Capital, Inc.
But it's not one big contract out there that's providing us with that big range?
Kurt Adzema - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
No, we typically provide a range about that wide. We've widened it up a little bit this quarter just to reflect the fact that we've got 14 weeks instead of 13 weeks.
Joseph Wolf - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay, understood. I wanted to go in a little bit more detail into the 40 gig side, it sounds like the hyperscale data centers are still doing well and I was hoping if you could talk to us a little bit about the pricing dynamic and the competitive forces going on in that market in terms of other players given the growth prospects there?
Jerry S. Rawls - Executive Chairman
Well as you point out that market is still going strong, there are an awful lot of 40 gig transceivers in the QSFP form factor that are being consumed by a number of the big cloud services operators, and it's competitive market. It's like all the markets that we participate in, it has a number of competitors and it's all about performance, it's all about economics. So, I don't know how to describe it much differently than that.
Joseph Wolf - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Is there similar pricing pressure to the telecom side of the business right now?
Jerry S. Rawls - Executive Chairman
Well, the telecom pricing pressure comes mostly at the end of a calendar year where we have negotiations with the big equipment companies for prices that go for a yearly – for 12 months. There are a few exceptions to that, but for the most part, we negotiate sort of 12-month agreements in the telecom business, so, that's behind us now.
Joseph Wolf - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
At this time, we'll take a question from James Kisner with Jefferies LLC.
James M. Kisner - Jefferies LLC
Hi, guys, thanks for taking my question. So, just wanted to start with the gross margin impact from the yield loss, would you mind – could you quantify that a little bit for us and does your guidance for the coming quarter assume that yield loss? And I guess relatedly, like maybe you could talk about the revenues associated with this opportunity, if they're coming in next quarter or did you see any this quarter, how big is it, et cetera?
Kurt Adzema - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Well I'd say the impact this quarter of that yield loss was probably about 75 basis points. In terms of the – and certainly we're working on improving that yield, but as of today we haven't made as much progress as we'd like. So, I think we will continue to be challenged this quarter, but hopefully by the time we get into Q1 we'll start to see some of the benefits. In terms of the revenue opportunity, I think the revenue opportunity right now is still relatively small versus our overall business but certainly it's a business that we hope once we improve the yield that we'll be able to ramp and sell a lot more but it's still a pretty small part of our business even though it's having a big impact on our gross margins.
James M. Kisner - Jefferies LLC
Great. Okay. I'd love to hear a little bit – we just heard about 40 gig, 100 gig strength in datacom, is it fair to say that it is driven by the ramp of CFP2, is that becoming a more substantial revenue contributor, I guess I'm assuming it's a lot bigger than the VCSEL-based 100-gig. Could you give us any kind of texture on whether or not CFP2 is contributing? Perhaps you can tell us kind of the rough proportion of 100 gig revenues coming from CFP2?

Jerry S. Rawls - Executive Chairman
Let's see, our cross-over for CFP2 to CFP is – we're not quite there but we're almost there, and we had substantial growth in CFP2 but we also had – we had a very good quarter for the CFPs.
James M. Kisner - Jefferies LLC
That's interesting. Are you seeing any – and I assume the CFP2s are going to systems that are not with your largest datacom customer, are you seeing the CPEC (13:42) module out there, any kind of competition from that?
Jerry S. Rawls - Executive Chairman
I don't really have a lot of good data on that one. Just – we don't see much of it but I know that they are being sold and I couldn't comment on the volumes, I couldn't comment on the impact if there is an impact on our business. I just don't know.
James M. Kisner - Jefferies LLC
Okay. Last question, just telecom, obviously it's a very challenging environment for everybody here, so you are not alone. But any thoughts on the outlook for the year, 14% year-over-year decline, I mean is that how we should think about telecom sort of through this year or is there a reason to think that telecom could get significantly better? Thanks.
Eitan Gertel - Chief Executive Officer & Director
I mean the way we're guiding telecom for next quarter, we say it is pretty much flat with this quarter and maybe with the 14 weeks, it's slightly up, but no significant change quarter-over-quarter. There are some new products that have come into the market right now from us, and as they ramp through the year we should see an improvement. But most improvement like we were talking before, what will be the driver for telecom will be the metro, but it still has few quarters to go before it becomes meaningful for the revenue in that segment.
James M. Kisner - Jefferies LLC
All right. Thanks, guys, I'll pass it. I appreciate it.
Operator
At this time we will take a question from Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets.
Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thank you. Gentlemen, you made some really strong improvement in operating expenses reductions during the quarter and then I am trying to get a sense of what part of that is actual changes that you've taken out in OpEx or is it really rather expenses moving from quarter-to-quarter.
Kurt Adzema - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Well, I think there are several factors. Certainly we are focused on trying to keep OpEx relatively flat given the kind of gross margins so that we can improve our operating margins so there is certainly a lot of focus on that. We did benefit some this quarter based on the continuing strengthening of the dollar, so I think that's part of it and we did have some expenses that we thought we'd spend this quarter on R&D project materials that got pushed into next quarter. So, I'd say it's a combination of all three of those things.
Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay, that's helpful. And, gentlemen, on the gross margin, recognizing the telecom price reductions, the mix in the volume, are you also starting to see intensifying competition on 40 gig and potentially 100 gig and so there is some preemptive not – thought to kind of maintain your market share in these two transport speed implied in the gross margin?
Kurt Adzema - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
So, I think as Jerry mentioned, 40 gig and I assume you're talking Ethernet side, datacom side, so 40 gig and 100 gig continues to be a very competitive space and obviously we're working hard to maintain our margins despite any pricing pressure that we see.
Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Lastly, as it relates to competition and industry structure, Jerry, now that you've had a chance to look at the (16:57) on JDSU, what are your thoughts in terms of consolidation and you're more interested, less interested as to say your thoughts on just going at it alone or offsetting some price competition with greater scale?

Jerry S. Rawls - Executive Chairman
Well, we continue to believe that consolidation is important in our industry and it would be attractive to achieve consolidation. But with respect to JDSU or any other company I don't think we have any particular comments to make.

At this time, we will take a question from Kent Schofield with Goldman Sachs.
Kent S. Schofield - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great, thank you. Just one from me, around the web scale, guys, and I guess in particular kind of the Web 2.0, guys, can you just talk a little bit structurally about your visibility there. And then just kind of the activity that you are seeing on the go forward as we look at some of the CapEx estimates going forward they are slowing some but just want to get a sense for how you are thinking about that and how your visibility has evolved over time?
Jerry S. Rawls - Executive Chairman
Well, one of the frustrations of that Web 2.0 sector is that all of the revenue that goes into it, at least from our end is sort of dependent upon construction projects. And the construction projects have many facets. There is physical structure, there is electrical distribution, there is air conditioning, there is the wiring, there is all of the hardware that goes in. And if any one of those runs late, then the whole project runs late and you get – and our optics after you got all the stuff in place get plugged in and now you connect everything.
So, forecasting has been a challenge because our customers in these construction projects have been challenged with having predictable schedules. And so I – the business is strong, the market has still a lot of demand, percentage growth may be slower in the future than it has been in the past, I've read predictions like that, but the absolute magnitude of the growth is greater than it has been in the past and or we expect it to be. So, it's a big market becoming a much bigger market, so we are still paying a lot of attention there and we just wish that there was a little less volatility if that's the right word in the shipment patterns that we have with the big Web 2.0 operators.
Kent S. Schofield - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Thank you, Jerry, for the color.
Operator
And at this time we will take a question from Subu Subrahmanyan with Juda Group.
Subu Subrahmanyan - The Juda Group
Thank you. I have two questions. First on the 13 weeks versus 14 weeks, I know you had mentioned that there is some benefit in the 14 weeks partially offset by Chinese New Year. If we look out to July and if you just look historically if you return back to a 13-week quarter, has that traditionally meant kind of a revenue decline or less of an increase, how has that worked out historically and how do you expect it to play out this year?
Kurt Adzema - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Well, Subu, we changed our fiscal year two years ago in fiscal 2013 and so for most fiscal years we have 13 weeks in every quarter and it's only once every four years to five years that the fourth quarter will have 14 weeks. So we've never had this experience before but as you think about Q1 given the fact that Q1 will have 13 weeks and Q4 will have 14 weeks, then I would expect revenues would decline just based on the pure number of weeks in the quarter.
Subu Subrahmanyan - The Juda Group
And is it linear, Kurt, I mean 13 weeks and 14 weeks, this is 7% difference, should we think about that or is it not that linear?
Kurt Adzema - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Well again I think in this quarter you've got the benefit of 14 weeks and some partial offset as the result of Chinese New Year, so you have to take that delta and then apply it and then if there was a 13-week-to-13-week basis, certainly we would expect some level of growth going from Q4 to Q1. So once you've adjusted for 13 weeks versus 14 weeks you should layer in a little bit of growth.

Subu Subrahmanyan - The Juda Group
Understood. And then gross margin, I think you mentioned that the impact of the low yield was about 75 basis points, you have some ongoing impacts. So if I look past April you don't have the telco price reductions going into July. The CapEx starts to level off, hopefully the yield issues which still continue to impact this quarter start to lighten, how should we think about gross margin trend line past the April quarter?
Kurt Adzema - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
I would say, we obviously don't provide guidance. But typically first quarter gross margin is higher than fourth quarter gross margin. So hopefully that pattern continues.
Subu Subrahmanyan - The Juda Group
And then how should we think about the impact of, if the yield issues are fixed and the CapEx declines, just those two factors, what kind of a swing factor do those create on gross margin?
Kurt Adzema - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
It's hard to break that down because obviously if the yield improves then we're also shipping more units and so, some of that offsets each other. But certainly, we've seen in the past again, we can look at this historically meaningful improvement in the first quarter gross margin over the fourth quarter.
Subu Subrahmanyan - The Juda Group
Understood. And final question on telco, Jerry, Eitan, this quarter the level of telco revenues is the lowest revenue in five years since you started breaking it out and I know, I understand the carrier CapEx challenges, and still waiting for metro, but how do you think about this business in terms of investing in telco, given it continues to decline as a percentage of revenue and hitting kind of multiyear lows at a time where the market is not healthy but for your competitors it's not as challenging as it seems for you as well?
Eitan Gertel - Chief Executive Officer & Director
I think currently, Subu, we're investing in the more strategic products that we think is going to have the growth. And obviously in the product that's not going to give us the return on investment we're reducing the level of R&D. So, obviously we have big investments going in coherent and some level of ROADMs and other things and SFP+. So, we choose our products and we try to match what we expect from the growth and what we expect the best return to be.
Subu Subrahmanyan - The Juda Group
I understand, just we've been in that $80 million to $90 million for a long time now, we're closing, probably closer to $70 million, I'm just wondering from a run rate perspective as things get better, should this be 30% of revenues or I mean 40%, is it a $100 million run rate, just trying to understand given the steep declines we've seen in telecom, what the real run rate of this business is as you start getting back to some growth areas?
Eitan Gertel - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, I think if you look at the long-term, I'm still hoping that this thing will be coming back to the $100 million level. I can't tell you exactly when that will happen, it's actually it's all the ramp-up of new product, it's the impact of all the upgrades in the metro and actually some of the telecom products spreading and going into non-telecom application with telecom type product. So, all those combined together should help grow the revenue. But on the long-term, I expect that to be in the $100 million level.
Subu Subrahmanyan - The Juda Group
Okay, go ahead. Thank you.
Operator
And at this time we will hear from Simon Leopold with Raymond James.
Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Thank you very much. I wanted to just check on this, just keep our lives simple, in terms of the OpEx trend with the extra week, you're suggesting April would be around $70 million-ish, $69 million, $70 million and then July operating expenses should be similar to the January level, is that the way we should think about it?

Kurt Adzema - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
I would say operating expenses, most of it is variable. So, as you looked at that I would say you're probably going to increase about $3.5 million or so this quarter and then that $3.5 million would go back down the following quarter but then there is obviously kind of a normal growth rate of operating expenses and the third quarter we just finished, we were at a pretty historically low level given some of the push out in the project material on the R&D side. So I'd say there will be some growth in fiscal Q1 versus fiscal Q3.
Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. Thank you. And then you talked about the web scale, guys, I haven't heard much mention of submarine exposure and I know a number of the OEMs, your customers on the systems side have been taking about submarine opportunities both literally under ocean or opportunities at landing sites. I am wondering if you could give us some sense of how big an opportunity that is for your business and what the growth trends are?
Eitan Gertel - Chief Executive Officer & Director
I think, Simon, the answer to that is I don't know, because a lot of the equipment that goes in the edge of the submarine line is the regular equipment we sell to other telco applications. So we know there are some submarine lines looking at equipment from us but we don't know how much of it is going to either one of the applications. Some of them are starting to look at the high data rate coherence and things like that but there is still time to go for that to be meaningful, but the rest of it I wouldn't know how to break it down.
Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
And does that fall in your telco or your datacom segment?
Eitan Gertel - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, I think majority of it is in the telco side but again I don't have the visibility to that.
Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay, and then several quarters back, the increased exposure to China and China backhaul affected your gross margin. I am just wondering where those projects are in light of what looks like flattening CapEx in calendar 2015 in China as China Mobile slows and maybe Telecom and Unicom ramp. Can you talk a little bit about the dynamic of China and how that affects your business?
Eitan Gertel - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, the backhaul equipment which we talked at wireless, we talked about China, was slightly up this quarter, not much, and we predict it to be slightly up again but not in any significance, so the level is flat to slightly up over the prior quarter and the quarter looking forward. And the margin impact of those is the same as it was before, it's below our corporate average.
Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay, and then you've talked about long-term targets, particularly the gross margin trending towards the mid-30% range, I just want to do a check on how you feel about those targets and whether we should think about trending towards the mid-30%s over a period of a couple years or whether you feel like you can exit fiscal 2016 significantly higher, just want to get an idea what kind of slope we should think about towards the longer-term targets.
Kurt Adzema - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Well, certainly we've got a ways to go, given our guidance in Q4 of approximately 30% but we're certainly aiming to get back to the mid-30%s, but I think we've got a couple of years to get there. So we should see some improvement from the 30% range in FY 2016 we hope. Obviously, it depends on revenue growth and mix, but we've got a couple of years where we need to continue to prove it to get to where we really want it to be.

Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Great. Thank you for taking my questions.
Operator
And at this time, we'll take a question from Patrick Newton with Stifel.
Patrick M. Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Yes, thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to dive a little bit into the OpEx side, in your prepared remarks you talk about significantly decreasing operating expenses but then during this kind of Q&A you talked about that January is at historically low levels, given some push-outs of R&D projects. So should we think about Finisar as being in a period or perhaps exiting a period where they've invested aggressively in R&D and we should start to see that line item growth be below the revenue growth rate, that you're in somewhat of a harvest mode, or conversely should we tend to think that OpEx should relatively pace the revenue growth rate over an intermediate term period?
Kurt Adzema - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
We're hoping to keep operating expenses relatively flat so that we get some leverage to that extent and our goal is to ultimately drive that close to 20% of revenue over time. That will obviously depend on – when we get there, will obviously depend on the pace on revenue growth. But certainly we're looking to get some level of leverage on the operating expense line realizing that some quarters are going to lumpy and some are going to be up and some are going to be down. So it's not going to necessarily be a straight-line. But we certainly are driving towards getting some operating leverage at the operating expense line.
Patrick M. Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Great, that's helpful. And then I guess, Jerry, I wanted to dig into datacom mix in the quarter and how we should think about it on a go-forward basis. You did talk about hyperscale being up a little bit, I think, wireless, you did talk about some sequential growth. Can you give us a little bit on your thoughts on enterprise business on the fiber channel storage side of the business? And then also any thoughts that you have on the transaction between Avago and Emulex and does that change the competitive landscape or impact your customer base at all?
Jerry S. Rawls - Executive Chairman
Let's see, datacom in general, I would say, the enterprise part of the business is mostly 10-gigabit Ethernet and 10-gigabit Ethernet continues to be a good product and revenues we expect for the quarter will be up a bit in that sector. It's not – the 100-gig and 40-gig have pretty specific targets but they're not really enterprise. They tend to be hyperscale or the client sides of routers, but overall enterprise seems to be doing well with moderate growth rates. The fiber channel sector, I mean it's again not a rapidly growing sector overall but one of the things that we're seeing now is much more rapid take of 16-gig fiber channel. Most of our shipments for several years now have been 8-gigabit fiber channel. And the 16-gig was sort of limited to the switch makers. But we're not starting to ship 16-gigabit fiber channel to a number of the equipment suppliers of the storage arrays and Host Bus Adapters, et cetera. So we expect that 16-gig will be greater than 8-gig shipments here probably within the next year.
Patrick M. Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Any comments on of Avago, Emulex?
Jerry S. Rawls - Executive Chairman
Oh, Avago, Emulex. I don't have – I don't really have a view of that one. Emulex has been a good customer of ours for a long time. On the other hand, now we – Avago is a competitor in that datacom space, and so my guess is that is there is going to be some decisions that have to be made there. But in general, any customer, any one of the equipment companies wants to have at least two sources of supply even if one is internal. So I would expect that we will still have an ongoing relationship with Emulex.

Patrick M. Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Okay, great. Thank you for taking my questions, good luck.

At this time, we'll move to Troy Jensen with Piper.
Troy D. Jensen - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
Hey, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter gentlemen. A quick one for Jerry. One of your competitors in datacom had a problem with the 40-gig components in the quarter. So, I was wondering if you saw a benefit in either the January quarter revenues or the April quarter guidance due to share gains at this Web 2.0 company.
Jerry S. Rawls - Executive Chairman
We think so but nobody told us exactly, that's been a – there is an element of security and maybe you can even say secrecy that goes with some of the Web 2.0 competitors, I mean the competitor – guys that are in the Web 2.0 business building out these data centers and they're trying to protect information about their business and their activities. So, it's always that we have very specific information about why is our business going up or why was our business going down. In this case, it was going up, so.
Troy D. Jensen - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
All right, that's fair. Maybe a follow up for Eitan. All right, sorry to interrupt. Then a follow up for Eitan, can you just give an update on how the samples of the 100G coherent CFP2 modules have been received and just also, on the timing, when you think that ramps?
Eitan Gertel - Chief Executive Officer & Director
I would say we're shipping samples to customers. Customers who have received our sample have very good response, they are very happy with our performance. In some cases, they're surprised of the performance, but it's early days, it's really at alpha stage. And as far as the program versus our schedule, I would say, plus-minus couple of weeks we're on schedule. So, we expect to continue with the program and continue with our ramp, it's a significant product program from us and again we're excited about the performance, the level we can achieve from this module.
Troy D. Jensen - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
All right, perfect. Good luck, gentlemen.

At this time, we'll move to Jorge Rivas with Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.
Jorge E. Rivas - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So, a complicated question but I will ask it anyway because your datacom mix is higher it's ever been. So, if we were to exclude the impact from the yield loss from the optical engine and it sounds like the impact on the mix from the wireless transceivers it's been the same the past couple of quarters. This would suggest that your rest of the business gross margins are not even close to what you did about a year ago which was about 37%.
So, I wonder if you can walk me through what's going on in the rest of the business, are you seeing more pricing pressure in datacom or is it just that telecom given the lower base of revenues you're experiencing probably one-time pretty low gross margins for this quarter and we would eventually expect that to go back where it was once telecom picked up, if you can just walk through what's going on with the gross margin, it would be great.
Jerry S. Rawls - Executive Chairman
Well, the biggest change over that period when our gross margins have gone from 37% to 30% has been in the 100-gig Ethernet. If you recall, if we go back year and a half ago, we had virtually – I don't know, if we didn't have 100% of the market, we had 85% or 90% of the market, we were an early entry, we had a CFP 100-gig LR4 device that that was fully functional. It contained an IC set that we designed here at Finisar and there was no other functional ICs in the industry. And so our sales were growing very rapidly. Our margins were exceptionally high. We were on allocation for several quarters and – but all that came to an end as merchant semiconductor companies were able to correct the errors in their chips and produce functional chips. And so then a number of competitors were empowered, they entered the market at substantially lower prices and so we had – our prices had to come down to be competitive. So that has been the largest impact on our margins over the last year, year and a half.

Jorge E. Rivas - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC
Thank you, Jerry, really appreciate it. And then just going on the business, if we split it out by speeds (38:43), has it changed from last quarter, meaning that 40-gig is the fastest growing part of the business, and 10-gig remains the largest portion of revenues?
Jerry S. Rawls - Executive Chairman
Yes.
Jorge E. Rivas - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC
It's still the same?
Jerry S. Rawls - Executive Chairman

At this time, we'll go to Ted Moreau with Barrington Research.
Ted J. Moreau - Barrington Research
Hi, great, thank you guys. Just want to follow up on this 100-gig CFP comment that you just had Jerry, given some of your competitors or many of your competitors are may be a little bit earlier competing in the CFP2 versus what they were on the CFP4 and the original CFP, can you just talk about what are going to be the dynamics of winning opportunities, is it going to be time to market, performance, price, and then how do you see a more competitive CFP2 business impacting your overall business?
Jerry S. Rawls - Executive Chairman
Let's see, CFP2 is going to be an exciting product area. It is exciting for us right now in that we are shipping everything we can build. If we could double our output, we could sell double our output. But we are increasing our capacity. Demand is strong. Equipment companies are designing blades that have CFP2 ports because they can double the density on their blades, and I think it's an exciting market. Now, the margins there will never be as high as they were with our original CFP because we have competitors and in CFP we were the only game in town. So – but the margins are quite good, I mean it's not like it's a bad product, it's a good product and we think the demand is going to be strong as equipment companies convert their boxes to having these high density blades. I mean there's still a lot of ports for CFP, there is a lot of ports even that are being shipped from the OEMs, but there's a lot of ports in the field that were shipped where blades were not fully populated and for the expansion of networks in central offices. They continue to buy CFPs and plug them in the CFP slots. So we're going to see CFP revenue for quite some time. But CFP2 is clearly growing faster.
Ted J. Moreau - Barrington Research
Okay. And how does CFP2 margins compare to corporate average?
Jerry S. Rawls - Executive Chairman
Higher.
Ted J. Moreau - Barrington Research
Okay.
Jerry S. Rawls - Executive Chairman
CFP2 is higher than the corporate average.
Ted J. Moreau - Barrington Research
Okay, great. And then, one other question. You were talking about – there was a question about consolidation in the industry and if you were to play a role in consolidation, what would you be looking for, I mean would you look to just simple gain scale, would it be to eliminate a competitor, to make it a less challenging competitive environment, would it be to pick-up a technology, what are your thought process there and...?
Jerry S. Rawls - Executive Chairman
All of the above. I mean any consolidation move could accomplish any one of those things or multiple of them. And the more of the factors that you could make a positive contribution through some acquisition, I mean, that makes it more attractive, that means there is more value there, so.
Ted J. Moreau - Barrington Research

Moving forward, we'll hear from Michael Genovese with MKM Partners.
Michael E. Genovese - MKM Partners LLC
Great. Thanks. I just have one question; you've already indicated somewhat how we should think about 1Q revenues. So, if we look beyond the current quarter, two quarters out – on the gross margins two quarters out, are you willing to say that the 4Q should mark the bottom and then we should be up in 1Q sequentially a bit?

Kurt Adzema - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Well, again we're not providing guidance for that, but, historically, Q1 has had better gross margins than Q4.
Michael E. Genovese - MKM Partners LLC
Okay, that's all I have. Thanks.
Operator
Dmitry Netis with William Blair has the next question.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC
Thank you for squeezing me in, a couple of quick ones from me. I was just wondering, the depreciation expense that was going through the gross margin due to construction of the facility in China. When does that, Kurt, begins to alleviate and is that a multi-year effect, is that a couple of quarter effect?
Kurt Adzema - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Well, I'll answer it in two ways. I think capital expenditures after this quarter should start to decline, as I mentioned, the building – the second building should be done this quarter. And so I would expect capital expenditures to start to decline as a result of that. In terms of depreciation, I expect depreciation to continue to increase because again comparing current CapEx levels with what's rolling off five years – that you spent five years ago. So depreciation will continue to increase but CapEx should come down and the rate of change of the depreciation should start to be less.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC
And how much basis points did that contribute in the quarter, that effect of depreciation expense in the gross margin?
Kurt Adzema - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Well, again, in this quarter, depreciation went up, I think, about $400,000, so.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC
Okay. All right, excellent. Thank you. And then, again, a quick one on telecom side. I know a lot of questions have been asked on that front. But I'm just curious like, the competitors – one of the major competitors there had seen their ROADM business actually snap back sequentially – I don't know if you could – were willing to talk about your ROADM business, but it sounds from the numbers that, that business had declined. So I don't know why you're not seeing exactly the positive impact of perhaps even the 100G metro deployment with AT&T. Ciena reported this morning and talked about some metro projects already in effect. I know there is Verizon metro and that's potentially where you will be playing with the Flexgrid ROADMs. What I'm trying to sort of get to is, is it different architecture on the ROADM side that will begin to give you growth in that business and you just sort of excluded at the moment from the current metro projects that are going on. If you could comment on those two major carriers deployments, that would be helpful.
Eitan Gertel - Chief Executive Officer & Director
I don't think we are excluded from any deployment. Our ROADM business, we don't break it down, but it's doing fine. It's not growing tremendously, but it's pretty flat quarter-over-quarter. And we have a significant share in the market. I don't think our share has changed in the market in any meaningful way and we actually have high expectation for the market going forward, for more ROADM playing actually in the metro project that you're talking about. So, I don't think at all we lost any step in this markets and I think our new products are playing very well. But we haven't seen growth yet and that's what we're looking for but the product line itself is working fine.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC
Okay, thank you. And if I may, and I apologize for being that specific. I recall again going back a few years, top three customers of yours were Cisco, Alcatel-Lucent, and Huawei, and Cisco is sort of hanging in there and certainly had a nice quarter and perhaps you were seeing the wind of that this quarter as well and then going into the next quarter. But what about the Alcatel-Lucents and Huaweis? I mean are you seeing other customers replacing them? Are you seeing them snapping back? How are these major customers of yours are performing at the moment? Are you happy with that performance?

Eitan Gertel - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Look, I mean, the only thing I can say, we can't talk about specific customers, we can't comment on what customer does versus others. All I can say, we have share in all of them. And when everybody wins – when everybody – when each one of them wins, I mean, we benefit from one versus the other and maybe in some different weights or ratios, but we do. But I can't comment on a specific customer versus others.

We have time for one more question in the queue. We will go to Dave Kang with B. Riley.
David Kang - B. Riley & Co. LLC
Thank you, good afternoon. First of all, regarding your datacom sales increasing 8.5%, I was wondering if you can go over the mix between 40G, 100G, and wireless.
Kurt Adzema - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
So 40G grew the most followed by wireless and then 100G.
David Kang - B. Riley & Co. LLC
Okay. I'll say wireless was number two. And what about – for your – the outlook, should we expect similar dynamics for 40G and 100G to be growing faster than wireless in the first quarter?
Kurt Adzema - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
It's always hard to tell quarter-to-quarter, but I think we think that 40G and 100G are going to be growth drivers next quarter. I'd say, we expect wireless to be slightly up, but our clarity into that business is not perfect.
David Kang - B. Riley & Co. LLC
Got it. And then moving to telecom, I was wondering – Eitan already talked about WSS but what about tunable XFP and if you can just – if you're not going to break it out specifically, can you just tell us what the rough mix is between WSS plus tunable XFP in terms of overall telecom sales?
Kurt Adzema - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Again, we're not going to break it out product-by-product. I would say, tunable XFP was slightly down in the quarter.
David Kang - B. Riley & Co. LLC
And how much is the 10G telecom, or 10G and below telecom?
Kurt Adzema - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Again, we're not going to break out the details of that, we break out telecom, we break datacom, and we'll talk directionally about every product line but we're not going to break it out.
Eitan Gertel - Chief Executive Officer & Director
We don't have any meaningful telecom below 10G anyway.
David Kang - B. Riley & Co. LLC
Okay, all right. And then did you talk about price decline, what the actual price decline was?
Kurt Adzema - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Well, we said last December, nothing has changed since then. It was at the higher end of the 10% to 15% range.
David Kang - B. Riley & Co. LLC
Got it, got it. And I was wondering if you can tell us, Emulex, what their percentage of revenue?

Good afternoon and welcome to the Finisar Corporation announces fourth quarter results conference call. Just a quick reminder, today's call is being recorded.
And now at this time, I'll turn the conference over to Mr. Jerry Rawls, Executive Chairman. Please go ahead, sir.
Jerry S. Rawls - Executive Chairman
Thank you, Shannon, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate you're taking the time to listen to our conference call today. A replay of this call should appear on our website within eight hours. An audio replay will be available for two weeks by calling area code 888-203-1112 for domestic or area code 719-457-0820 for international, and then enter the ID number 9819662.
I need to remind all of you that any forward-looking statements in today's discussion are subject to risks and uncertainties which are discussed at length in our Annual and Quarterly SEC filings. Actual events and results can differ materially from any forward-looking statements. In addition, the company undertakes no obligations to update any forward-looking information presented today.
In addition, unless otherwise indicated, all results discussed are on a non-GAAP basis. A complete reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results may be found in our earnings press release and in the Investor Relations section of our website.
We have prepared some slides for today's earnings call. You can view them by connecting to the Investor Relations page of our website at finisar.com, click on Investors. Under the heading, Latest Financial Results, you will see a listing for today's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2015 earnings call.
Revenues for our fiscal fourth quarter were $320 million, an increase of $13.8 million or 4.5% over the prior quarter. Revenue growth was primarily from the extra or 14th week in our fourth quarter, partially offset by the impact of Chinese New Year.
And with that, I'll let Kurt review the rest of the numbers. Kurt?
Kurt Adzema - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Jerry.
Datacom revenue increased by $7.6 million or 3.2% compared to the preceding quarter. Telecom revenue increased by $6.2 million or 8.6% compared to the preceding quarter. In the fourth quarter, we had one 10% or greater customer. Our top 10 customers represented 58.8% of total revenue compared to 56.1% in the preceding quarter.
Non-GAAP gross margin increased to 30.3% from 30% in the preceding quarter, primarily due to the improvement in yields for a new optical engine product for supercomputing applications. As you may recall, we started to ramp up this product in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 and it had negatively impacted gross margin during that quarter. These improvements are partially offset by the impact of the full three months' annual telecom price reduction that typically takes effect on January 1.
Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $3.1 million primarily due to the extra week of salaries in Q4 relative to Q3, higher R&D project materials associated with the qualification of new products, and higher sales and marketing expenses due to the higher revenue levels. As you may recall, in the third quarter, R&D expenses were lower than originally forecast due to the push-out of some of these project materials into Q4 and beyond.

Non-GAAP operating income increased $2 million to $28.8 million or 9% of revenue compared to $26.9 million or 8.8% of revenue in the preceding quarter as a result of the higher gross margin. Non-GAAP income was $26.9 million or $0.25 per diluted share, compared to $26.7 million or $0.25 in the preceding quarter. Average diluted shares for non-GAAP purposes totaled 107.5 million.
For non-GAAP purposes, the interest expense for our $258 million of 0.5% convertible notes was approximately $323,000 in the fourth quarter. This interest expense is the only impact of these converts in our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, as no shares are added to the fully diluted share count.
Fourth quarter capital expenditures totaled $30.1 million. This was less than our prior forecast of approximately $35 million, as the timing of some of the expenditures associated with the Wuxi building were pushed into the first quarter. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $35 million in the first quarter. Construction of the second building of our new Wuxi, China, factory is now complete, including the fit-out of the two of the four floors. However, at this time, we've decided to fit out the remaining two floors starting in the first quarter. This work will be completed by the end of fiscal 2016.
Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment increased $1.3 million to $490.2 million at the end of the fourth quarter. Non-GAAP taxes are estimated at approximately 7% in fiscal 2016. Weighted average fully diluted shares for the first fiscal quarter are expected to be approximately 108.5 million shares for non-GAAP purposes.
There are a number of non-cash or infrequently occurring charges and benefits which we exclude from our non-GAAP results. These totaled $19.5 million last quarter. If we included all these items as required under GAAP, we generated net income of $7.3 million or $0.07 per diluted share compared to net income of $1.7 million or $0.02 per diluted share in the preceding quarter.
That concludes my comments, and I'll turn it over to Eitan.
Eitan Gertel - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Kurt. We expect revenues from our first quarter to be in the range of $308 million to $328 million. As a reminder, our first quarter of fiscal 2016 will be once again a 13-week quarter relative to a 14-week quarter in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015. We expect our non-GAAP gross margins to be approximately 30.5%, primarily as a result of the benefit of increased weekly volumes, partially offsetted by the impact of increased competition.
Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $67 million to $68 million. Salaries will be lower from only having 13 weeks in this quarter. Other expenses will be pushed a bit higher by higher R&D project material, spending for new product qualification, an increase in the employer portion of payroll taxes from the annual vesting of employee RSUs which occurs in June every year, and the cost associated with our biannual sales conference. Non-GAAP operating margins are expected to be approximately 8.8% to 9.8% and non-GAAP earning per diluted share are expected to be in the range of $0.23 to $0.29 per share.
We continue to believe in the long-term growth prospects of the company. Finisar's revenue is driven primarily by the growth in worldwide demand for bandwidth with the ever increasing distribution and use of video, images and digital information. In addition, Finisar continues to benefit from the growth in cloud services, which drives networking hardware upgrades of existing data centers and the build-out of new hyperscale data centers.
And now with that, I'm going to go to turn the call back to Shannon to open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session

Operator
Yes, sir. Thank you. And our first question comes from Mr. Alex Henderson with Needham & Company.
Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC
Hey, guys. Can you give us a little bit of more granularity on some of the individual products and what segments are improving, what segments are under pressure, what you're seeing in terms of scaled-out data center builds, what's going on with the ROADM business, those type of metrics? There wasn't a whole lot about products in the discussion.
Kurt Adzema - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
I think we said both datacom and telecom grew, so I think in general, we talked about that. I think again, the strength or the growth in datacom was primarily in 10-gig and 100-gig, and we did have some fall-off in our wireless business. On the telecom side, I think we saw a little bit of growth in the WSS as well as I think tunable was a little bit of growth.
Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC
Within the wireless, I assume that's mainly CPRI [Common Public Radio Interface]. Are you expecting that to continue to come off? I assume that the RAN [Radio Access Network] builds are moderating a little bit this year from last year. Is that the right way to think about that?
Kurt Adzema - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
I think right now we think wireless in this coming quarter relative to prior quarter will be flat to slightly down given the 13 weeks versus the 14 weeks.
Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC
Okay, and just one last question on the weeks stuff. Can you give us your sense? Is it right to think of that as 2014 over 2013, that's the percentage adjustment, or is it right to think of that as some modestly lower adjustment than that when we're thinking about the top line?
Kurt Adzema - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Again, as you think about the fourth quarter, we obviously had the benefit of the 14th week, but that was partially offset by the Chinese New Year. And so if you look at the growth that we had Q3 to Q4, that was about $14 million. So when you're thinking about the next quarter, it's hard to exactly say what the impact of both those things were, but I think that's something you can use that metric.
Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC
It sounds like a 4% to 5% number is probably the right number to use in the comp?
Kurt Adzema - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
I don't think there's anything else I can say.
Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC
Okay, I'll cede the floor. Thank you.
Operator
And our next question comes from Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets.
Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thank you. If I look at it year over year, a year ago you had 13 weeks. This year you'll have 13 weeks, so the comparisons are more reasonable. And then the midpoint of that is actually a decline on a year-over-year basis. So are there particular products you're seeing more of a slowdown on a year-over-year basis?
Kurt Adzema - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
If you're comparing the forecast for this Q1, I believe, to last year's Q1, we did have a big spike in last year's Q1 because of wireless. And as we noted, wireless has been down, and we expect it to be probably flat to down a little bit again this quarter based on the 13-week to 14-week basis.
Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. And, Kurt, if we look at the wireless weakness last year, I think some of that was related to China and their ramp in 4G and the mix of products there. What are we seeing in terms of China this year as they expand their 4G networks? If you could give us some color, that would be helpful.
Eitan Gertel - Chief Executive Officer & Director
If you're talking about – Mark, you're talking about the wireless in China, the CPRI ware, so that's what we said. The majority of the wireless for us is going in China. We expect that for us to be flat to slightly down. And the rest of the year, we'll see how it evolves. We don't know exactly.

Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay, that's helpful. And lastly, as we think about just the steady state in the growth in the data centers and your opportunities there, any thoughts of recalibrating how we should be thinking about OpEx on an annual basis of sales and marketing and also R&D?
Kurt Adzema - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Again, we continue to invest heavily in R&D. I think new products are the lifeblood of the company, so we'll continue to do that. As I've said several times, I think our ultimate goal is to get OpEx to approximately 20% of revenue, but we've got a ways to go there. And that will be driven mainly by increases in revenue and some leverage on the operating expense line, but operating expenses will continue at some pace going forward.
Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay, that's helpful. Thank you and good luck.
Operator
Next question comes from Patrick Newton with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Patrick M. Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Good afternoon, Jerry, Eitan, and Kurt, and thank you for taking my questions. Jumping right in, Kurt, I guess I was a little bit surprised that you're only guiding for a gross margin increase 20 basis points sequentially coming off of the full impact of telecom pricing in the April quarter. What is driving this? Are you seeing more aggressive datacom pricing? Are there any mix assumptions that you've baked in that are impacting the margin guide? And can you elaborate a little bit, I think it was during Eitan's prepared remarks where you stated that you're seeing some increased competition. Can you elaborate on that?
Kurt Adzema - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Sure. I think again, as we said for the guide, what's driving the positive increase is the additional weekly volumes that we expect given its overall revenue is relatively flat, but we'd have 13 weeks versus 14 weeks. So you've got a higher weekly volume which helps gross margin. As Eitan alluded to, we are seeing increased competition and I think that's the offsetting factor to margins.
Patrick M. Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Has that increased in telecom versus datacom? Has that increased in a certain speed, 100G, 40G, 10G? Is that across the ROADMs, WSS? Anywhere that you can point to where it's more exacerbated?
Jerry S. Rawls - Executive Chairman
No, it's mostly in the datacom space.
Patrick M. Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
In single-mode versus multi-mode?
Jerry S. Rawls - Executive Chairman
I would say it's both single-mode and multi-mode.
Patrick M. Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Okay, that's helpful. And then can you elaborate a little bit on your 100G business? Can you help us perhaps understand the relative contribution to datacom versus telecom segments? And then could you give us an update on both kind of your product roadmap for the QSFP28 and also the coherent CFP2? I believe you were shipping samples last quarter, and I would love to get your thoughts on when we could see volume shipments of that product?
Kurt Adzema - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
To talk about 100-gig datacom, again, it's an important part of our business. It grew last quarter. I think we've said it's below 10% of revenue, but it's still a meaningful part of our revenue. And I'll let Eitan talk a little bit about 100-gig CFP2 coherent.
Eitan Gertel - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Patrick, last quarter we started shipping – demonstrating basically alpha products and we've continued ramping our shipment to customers; and as we said before, we see that being more meaningful to our revenue towards the end of the calendar year. So we continue to ship units for 100-gig application and 200-gig application in a CFP2 format.

Patrick M. Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Okay. And then just last one, if I may, is can you comment on how we should think about datacom versus telecom in the July quarter relative to the flattish sequential overall revenue guide?
Kurt Adzema - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
I think again in Q1, we'll be losing the benefit of the 14th week, but we do think that most of the growth will come from 40-gig datacom.
Patrick M. Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Thank you for taking my questions. Good luck.

Next question comes from James Kisner with Jefferies LLC.
James Martin Kisner - Jefferies LLC
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just back to this question of datacom competition, obviously Inovyte (17:59) filed today and they're obviously growing very fast in the datacom space, and I'm wondering if these are one of the guys that you're seeing from a competition from. At a higher level, in these large scaled-out data centers, how are you feeling about your market share? Do you expect to maintain that? Or might you back away from some of this business if pricing gets a bit irrational? And just could you comment more on sort of the competition and particularly in the hyperscale data centers? Thanks.
Jerry S. Rawls - Executive Chairman
The hyperscale data centers are a little bit different than enterprise in that they often will accept products that are good enough and don't necessarily have to meet all of the industry specifications, the Bell core specs, et cetera. And so that means that they will accept offerings from less than Tier 1 companies and so there is a bit more competitive pressures that go into that space and so – but nevertheless we expect to maintain our market share. We're the largest supplier in the world and we're the largest supplier into that space and our expectations are that we will be – we will absolutely be competitive and we're going to maintain our market share.
James Martin Kisner - Jefferies LLC
So just on 40-gig, it sounds like that was down sequentially. Would you attribute that to lumpiness? Is there any kind of potential that's already happening wait for effect for...
Jerry S. Rawls - Executive Chairman
It's lumpiness. We expect that 40-gig is going to be very strong next quarter. We had one particular customer who we expected to ship more to and they had predicted, but part of the lumpiness of their acceptance pattern shifted out to the next quarter.
James Martin Kisner - Jefferies LLC
Okay. And on 100-gig, it sounds like that was up sequentially. I'm wondering is that mostly driven by CFP2? I think where are we in this CFP versus CFP2 transition? Can you give us a little detail on that?
Jerry S. Rawls - Executive Chairman
It's both strength in CFP and CFP2. We still sell more CFP and there're more CFP slots out there to fill than there are CFP2. But as you might expect, more and more hardware designs are being created with CFP2 sockets. So we think over the next year or two, CFP2 is going to continue to increase and it will eventually overtake CFP, but right now, they're both alive, well and doing and strong in revenue, but still CFP is larger.
James Martin Kisner - Jefferies LLC
Okay, last one and I'll pass. Just WSS modules, that strength, is that potentially the green shoots of the metro deployments of 100-gig or just seasonality or just any kind of say long-haul versus metro? Just any kind of color on the WSS strength and whether or not you expect that to kind of continue through the year would be very helpful? Thanks.
Kurt Adzema - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
I think – again I think WSS did grow in the fourth quarter and I think our expectations are it's going to grow again in the first quarter. I don't know if Eitan wants to add some color or commentary.

Eitan Gertel - Chief Executive Officer & Director
I think the growth we've seen to-date is from existing product that we were shipping before and we start to seeing ramp from new products from a lot of our dual product lines. So we expect that to be favorable for the WSS as we move along the year.
James Martin Kisner - Jefferies LLC
All right, thanks very much.
Operator
Next question comes from Subu Subrahmanyan from The Juda Group.
Subu Subrahmanyan - The Juda Group
Thank you. My first question is just, if I try to quantify the impact of the extra week offset by Chinese New Year, I think in the past, Kurt, you had mentioned that that would be approximately a low double-digit million positive impact. Is that the right way to think about it? And would your $320 million have been essentially flat quarter-over-quarter, somewhere in the $306 million, $308 million number? And would this quarter's midpoint be up about 3%? Is that the right way to think about it?
Kurt Adzema - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
It's hard to exactly say what the impact of the 14th week and Chinese New Year, but I would say in general, if we had – without the impact of that, I think last quarter would have been relatively flat. So then you can – we obviously have already given you our forecast for Q1.
Subu Subrahmanyan - The Juda Group
Sure. And was telco a little bit better and datacom a little bit lower than expected, if you look at sort of how April played out?
Kurt Adzema - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
I think Jerry mentioned that we had some lumpiness at one 40-gig customer that was a little bit lower than expected, so I think that's true. And I also think wireless was probably a little bit lower than expected, and we saw again a little bit of strength in WSS and tunable despite the fact that we had the full three months of the telecom price reduction.
Subu Subrahmanyan - The Juda Group
Understood. And on the higher competition comment, I know you mentioned that it was both single-mode and multi-mode. Is it at the higher speeds as well as at 40-gig, 100-gig? Is it sort of across the board on speeds? Is it more 10-gig and wireless? Can you give us some sense of where that higher competition is?
Jerry S. Rawls - Executive Chairman
It's 10-gig, it's wireless and it's 40-gig as well, because remember, 40-gig is really four lanes of 10-gig, so the basic technology is still 10-gig technology. And it's not at 100-gig.
Subu Subrahmanyan - The Juda Group
Okay. Understood. And then final question on web scale. Can you talk about the web-scale players as a percent of revenue, sort of where they're trending to? And with the talk about 25-gig servers, 100-gig in the data center, when do you think that starts to become sort of a demand driver? It seems like aggregation speeds in the data center today are still mostly at 40-gig, I'm wondering 100-gig in the data center, when do you start to think of that as a real revenue driver?
Jerry S. Rawls - Executive Chairman
It will happen in the second half of this year, as we'll start seeing much more 100-gig, 4x25-gig in data centers. And I think it will be really exciting into calendar year 2016. Overall, that data center market is still the fastest growing segment in all of optics, so it is quite an opportunity.
Subu Subrahmanyan - The Juda Group
And so if I look at this quarter up kind of low single-digit percent quarter over quarter, if you ex out the timing issues, do you expect that trend line to continue, Jerry, given 100-gig opportunity going into the second half of the year?
Jerry S. Rawls - Executive Chairman
We expect that our datacom business is going to continue to grow and we expect that it's going to be the strongest part of our business, led by a hyperscale or Web 2.0 data center. But the challenge in that space is that there aren't hundreds of customers; there are a handful of customers. And each one of them has their own characteristics of forecasting, accepting delivery, et cetera. And they often are related to construction projects which have, at least historically, been pretty lumpy in terms of their stops and starts or unexpected delays.

Subu Subrahmanyan - The Juda Group
Understood, thank you very much.

Next question comes from Troy Jensen with Piper.
Troy D. Jensen - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
Hi, guys, thank you. A quick one for Eitan, and then I want to follow up with Jerry. But, Eitan, given we saw some growth in WSS and tunables, I'd just like to gauge your confidence of a telco metro optical cycle starting, whether it's beginning of next year with a little bit of build in the second half, but just your conviction on this now versus three months ago?
Eitan Gertel - Chief Executive Officer & Director
I think it's safe to say we don't change the date. I think the meaningful demand from this is beginning of next calendar year, as the deployment I don't think have started significantly right now, but it is happening. From all the public announcements you see, it's happening. And what was the other question?
Troy D. Jensen - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
Just a follow-up for Jerry then. On the datacom business, I'd be curious to know like how good is the visibility there, whether you can comment on how accurate they are for these rolling forecasts, or has the book-to-bill been above one recently? Anything you can help us out with visibility would be great.
Jerry S. Rawls - Executive Chairman
Book-to-bill is above one. Visibility in datacom, it varies some. Most of our customers, particularly enterprise customers, are we operate on just-in-time hubs. And so we have, by classic definition, no visibility. On the day they want the product, they pull it out of the hub. They send us an electronic notice, we ship them an electronic invoice, and the transaction is complete. But there was no visibility beyond the fact that they had given us a forecast and that we had inventory there available to pull.
With the Web 2.0 group, we have some inventory hubs that we provide, but much of it is on orders that are shipped based on a purchase order. So there's a little visibility there, but it varies. But overall in datacom, visibility is limited to what our customers tell us they're going to pull or they're going to take.
Troy D. Jensen - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
All right. Got it, congrats and good luck in the July quarter.
Jerry S. Rawls - Executive Chairman
Thanks.

We next move to Joseph Wolf with Barclays.
Joseph Wolf - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Thank you. I wanted go back to the data center, which I know has gotten a lot of attention. But just the comments on the 25-gig happening, I wanted to verify that that's your second half of the calendar 2016. And then could you just give us a little bit more detail? Have all the major hyperscale guys standardized on 40-gig, or do you think that some of the lumpiness is a decision that's waiting for to build out at 25-gig versus a 40-gig rollout?
Jerry S. Rawls - Executive Chairman
Most of them, almost all are taking 40-gig products. All will take 100-gig products.
Joseph Wolf - Barclays Capital, Inc.
So the lumpiness (28:55), is it just a timing issue or it's not an architecture decision?
Jerry S. Rawls - Executive Chairman
I think it's an architecture decision. It's what switches did they buy, what servers did they buy, what are the slots that they've invested in? And then what is their transition plan to transition to the next faster piece of equipment? And I think there are a number of them that are – there's been lots of publicity about Broadcom and their Tomahawk chipset and its availability in the second half of this year and systems that will actually be built and deployed with it. So that will provide 100-gig ports and multiples of 25-gig; it's 4x25-gig. So it's mostly architectural.
Joseph Wolf - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay, that's helpful. And then I guess, Kurt, I was just curious. If you look at the mix, I know there's some variability here, and you've talked about building out the second two floors in China. What's the plusses and minuses we could expect in gross margin going out for the year? What would be a best case scenario if you got some operating leverage – or gross margin leverage on some volume through the China facility at the end of fiscal 2016?

Kurt Adzema - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Forecasting margin beyond one quarter is a very difficult thing. There are just too many variables that go into it, revenue growth, product mix, increases in CapEx. So we're not comfortable doing that, so all I can provide you is our guidance for this quarter.
Joseph Wolf - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay, thank you.
Jerry S. Rawls - Executive Chairman
Having said that, we wouldn't invest all that money in that beautiful new factory in China if we didn't think it was going to help.
Kurt Adzema - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
We think it's going to help in that we think we're going to have continued increased volume and we need the space, and that's why we're building out the two additional floors.
Joseph Wolf - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Ted Moreau with Barrington Research.
Theodore Joseph Moreau - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.
Yes, thank you. I was just wondering. You guys indicated that competition for your wireless products was picking up a little bit and I know that those products had historically been lower margin products. So I'm just wondering. At what point you decided to walk away from that business in wireless? Are you anywhere near that decision? And then how aggressive can you be in terms of pricing in that product line?
Jerry S. Rawls - Executive Chairman
We're going to be in that business as long as we can make money in that business and if the day comes when prices get so low that we say it's not profitable to continue, then we'll stop, but generally we have a lot of capacity and when there's a lot of demand we can sell our capacity and get a reasonable price for it.
Theodore Joseph Moreau - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.
Okay. And then kind of getting and stay on this gross margin topic, what would it take to get gross margins up to say a 32% or 33% range? I know you don't want to give a timeframe, but can you get there based on simply volume? Do you need execution of all these cost improvements in wireless and optical engine and other products to get there, or do we need a relief of the competitive dynamics? What are going to be the big catalysts here or what could be?
Kurt Adzema - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
I think all of those factors are very important and I think they could all have a the big impact on margins both positively and negatively. So I don't think we can again really forecast beyond the current quarter, but we'll take it one quarter at a time.
Theodore Joseph Moreau - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.
I understand that, but I'm just kind of – is it possible to rate the factors or rank the factors that could potentially improve the gross margins to say at 32% or 33%?
Jerry S. Rawls - Executive Chairman
The product mix is always probably the most important factor, probably followed by volume.
Kurt Adzema - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Those I think would be the two biggest. I agree with Jerry.
Theodore Joseph Moreau - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.
And final question, are there any products that are on the horizon that you're going to introduce? I know you guys talked about all the R&D to drive new product development. Is there anything on the horizon that you feel like could give you some more favorable pricing dynamics?
Kurt Adzema - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
I think the area we're clearly investing the most in relates to 100-gig CFP2, and then I think as Eitan talked about, we expect to see more of those revenues in next calendar year.
Eitan Gertel - Chief Executive Officer & Director
But in general, I would say all the products we have, the highest gross margin come from our newer product and the big coherence is a product line. I mean, the CFP2 currently is the first product of it, so in the future, we see more and more impact of those products coming into the mix of the gross margin and they affect it positively.

Theodore Joseph Moreau - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.
Okay.
Jerry S. Rawls - Executive Chairman
But we're excited also about a whole series of products that are based on lane rates of 25 gigabits or 28 gigabits, so multiples of 25 gigabits, 4 x 25 gigabits is 100 gigabits, 12 x 25 gigabits is 300 gigabits. There's a number of products that will use the 25-gigabit technology to provide really enormous bandwidth. And our product portfolio in that area, I don't – there are a number of products that will be introduced here over the next six months to nine months.
Theodore Joseph Moreau - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.
Okay. Okay. Good luck, gentlemen. Thank you so much.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Simon Leopold with Raymond James.
Victor W. Chiu - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hi, guys. This is Victor Chiu in for Simon. I wanted to ask a little bit about operating expenses. I understand the OpEx in the next quarter will have these exceptional expenses from sales conference and the restricted stock units, but how do we think about OpEx on a normalized basis going forward?
Kurt Adzema - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Again, I think some of these expenses will definitely continue. A lot of these expenses, project material expenses that we've talked about related to qualification of the new product that's going to continue for many quarters. Some of that relates very much to the CFP2 that Eitan talked about. But also in the following second quarter, we have our annual merit increases, so I expect that to have a meaningful impact. Typically, merit increases equate to approximately $2 million on the OpEx line. So there will be some increases, but as I mentioned earlier, our ultimate goal is to get some operating leverage and ultimately reduce our OpEx to something around 20% of revenue, but that's going to take some time and some revenue growth to get there. So I've talked about in the past by early part of next fiscal year hopefully.
Victor W. Chiu - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. I wanted to ask you, how do you guys – what are you guys thinking about the 100G market for intra-data center optics and kind of your timing for how long it takes to develop in terms of timing and ramp, I guess?
Jerry S. Rawls - Executive Chairman
You're asking about intra-data centers? That means inside the data center?
Victor W. Chiu - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Yes, right, right.
Jerry S. Rawls - Executive Chairman
It's going to develop rapidly. As equipment is deployed that has 100-gig slots for optics to plug into, it will develop, it will follow those switches and those servers and that's going to happen – it's going to start in a big way in the second half of this calendar year and will go into next fiscal – or next calendar year. We expect it to be a very strong and very robust market.
Victor W. Chiu - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
When do you expect to introduce the form factors like the CLR4 or the PSM4? Is that the same timeframe?
Jerry S. Rawls - Executive Chairman
PSM4 probably is next year. That's single mode. Most of the – a lot of the offerings that we're going to have in the space will be single mode in LR4 or will be multi-mode in SR4.
Victor W. Chiu - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay.
Jerry S. Rawls - Executive Chairman
4SR, as they refer to it.
Victor W. Chiu - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And regarding the competitive piece, I just wanted to dig just a little bit more there. I guess who do you consider your key competitors inside the data center? Is it still the Oclaro, JDSU? Is Avago still one of the guys that you see when you're talking about that space also?
Jerry S. Rawls - Executive Chairman

In the data center market, the market share leaders for years have been Finisar and Avago, and that hasn't changed. But in the Web 2.0 space, there's a number of new entrants that are at least offering products there, some more successfully than others, but I still think that – but I don't think market share in the datacom space has changed.
Victor W. Chiu - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay, so it's primarily in the Web 2.0 space then, correct?
Jerry S. Rawls - Executive Chairman
Yes.
Victor W. Chiu - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Great. And lastly I just wanted to see if I could get a sense of your view around acquisitions, maybe not any specific acquisitions, although I think some people have one in mind specifically, but just trying to get a sense of your priorities, your logical priorities regarding the consolidation in the sector in general and your thoughts on consolidation?
Jerry S. Rawls - Executive Chairman
We are a modestly or moderately acquisitive company. We've done, I think since our IPO, maybe 21 acquisitions. Most of them were pretty small. Most of them were for specific technologies. And I am certain we will do more acquisitions in the future. Consolidation would be one motivation to do an acquisition, and I believe strongly in consolidation as an important part of a healthy market. But I can't predict when any consolidation transaction is likely to be available. So we're interested.
Victor W. Chiu - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay, great. Thank you.

And we move next to Richard Shannon with Craig-Hallum.
Richard Cutts Shannon - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions, a couple from me. First of all, I think you referenced gross margins doing a little better than expected due to better yields in the optical engine. I'm wondering how good those are compared to overall corporate averages and where you think that can go? And really where can the volumes go, and can we see a positive mix shift from that a quarter or two down the road?
Kurt Adzema - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
What I would say is we talked last time about how it was having about 75 basis points impact on our margin in Q3, and I think we made great strides during this quarter to make up most of that. And I think in general in terms of thinking about gross margin in the future, I wouldn't bake in any additional material improvement on the overall gross margin based on that. Certainly with all our products though, we continue to work on reducing costs and improving yields. But again this is still as of now a relatively small part of our business, but hopefully it will grow over the coming years. But we have made some good progress over the last quarter.
Richard Cutts Shannon - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC
Okay. And is this a product that we're seeing from just a single customer, or are there more than one or do you expect more than one here in the near future?
Jerry S. Rawls - Executive Chairman
Most of our revenue comes today from a couple of customers, but we have a number of them that are lined up in the wings that are either in some stage of evaluation or qualification.
Richard Cutts Shannon - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC
Okay. Is there any timeframe by which this becomes a meaningful product category for you, like a year out as an example? Any clarity you can give for this on that, Jerry?
Jerry S. Rawls - Executive Chairman
We have high hopes in this area because we think it is a pretty amazing product. To be able to supply as much bandwidth in as small a package as these optical engines do I think is a very attractive packaging alternative for anybody building a system or building a motherboard. So our expectations are that we're going to see dramatic growth in this product line over the next couple of years, maybe forever. We just think that it's a product whose time has come, and the applications for it are going to increase every year.

Richard Cutts Shannon - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC
Okay, I appreciate the detail there, Jerry. I have one follow-on question here on the topic of CFP2 coherent. How would you play out the competitive environment here? Where do you think your share will sit or your share rank? Any general thoughts as we look out a couple quarters, a year or so? How should we view that?
Eitan Gertel - Chief Executive Officer & Director
We think we have a very competitive product. We think from the best of our knowledge is we have the only product in the market that's already sampling that does 100-gig and 200-gig on the same device as it is today. So your limitation is on your DSP, not on the optics. And going forward, our plan is to get a significant market share. What that will be, time will tell, but we're treating it extremely seriously. All the components are made inside, so we are fully vertically integrated on the product. And as we come into GA, the full product is going to be manufactured in our Asian facility. So it's planned to be a significant ramp for us.
Richard Cutts Shannon - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC
Okay. Eitan, how important is it to have a 200-gig versus just 100-gig for that product category?
Eitan Gertel - Chief Executive Officer & Director
I think it's more important on the later generations than immediate. But when people are getting the product, they have both capabilities available for them day one from us. Effectively, if you can run 200-gig, your cost per bit is close to 50% than what you run on 100-gig because the cost of the hardware is the same, but I think from that point of view it's important. But the timing when people are actually utilizing the 200-gig versus the 100-gig will depend on the customers themselves. But we believe getting into the market with a product that enables it day one is a significant improvement or significant edge.
Richard Cutts Shannon - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC
Okay, great. I appreciate the detail, guys. Thank you much.
Operator
And our next question comes from Alex Henderson with Needham & Company.
Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC
I get a follow-up, great. So I'm a little confused about exactly what's going on in Wuxi. If somebody could, give us a little bit more clarity around it. It sounds like on the one hand you had a little bit less CapEx in the quarter that just occurred, that you are accelerating CapEx spend for the upcoming quarter a little bit above what you had expected before. Is that a function of you changing the rate at which you're building those new rooms out, and therefore choosing to alter the pattern of the spend in order to facilitate that, or is that going to cause – are you behind schedule or on schedule relative to the original timeline for the build completion that you had originally scheduled for the end of April?
And relative to that extra capacity, is that a reflection – should we read into it a reflection of faster transition out of Shanghai and into this building? Where are we on actually shutting down the Shanghai side of it? But could you give us some of the pings and pongs on that? It's hard for us externally to track it.
Kurt Adzema - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Sure. So let's first talk about the CapEx related to our original plan for the second Wuxi building, including fitting out the first two floors. Again, that CapEx is just lumpy, and a little bit of it got pushed into the first quarter. But that building is done now and those two floors are fitted out, and we're in the process of starting to move stuff into those floors. And I think as we've said before, that will take probably several more quarters for that to move that out. And at that time, then our Shanghai facility will be primarily just a R&D and NPI facility. So we expect that to be completed, let's say, in the next six months or so, once some of the qualifications are done.

In terms of fitting out the additional two floors, that's a decision we're making now so that it's finished by the end of next fiscal year so that we can be ready to hopefully accommodate additional volumes in fiscal 2017. And so a lot of these decisions to add facility or add capacity, you need to be thinking at least 12 months in advance, and that's what we're doing.
Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC
Okay. So just so I understand, the costs associated with this transition, we've been carrying around a lot of costs for training, bussing people back and forth between the various facilities. I assume that some of these costs that you've been carrying start to fall out as you bring up the capacity over the next couple of quarters. Is that the right way to think about it? And isn't your cost structure substantially lower here than it is in Shanghai, therefore shouldn't those two factors help you deliver an improvement in margins as we go over the next two quarters or three quarters, other things being equal?
Kurt Adzema - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
I do think we'll see some benefit once we have completely moved manufacturing out of Shanghai, which again we expect in about six months, once the qualifications are done, and so we should see some benefit from that. So I think that's important. In terms of any difference between wages in Wuxi and wages in Shanghai, I mean right now as we sit, we've already filled up our full building in Wuxi. So we've already seen some of that benefit. So that small incremental amount of stuff that still needs to get moved from Shanghai to Wuxi, will we see a little bit of benefit? Sure. But we've already seen some of that benefit because we moved a complete building and we filled up that building with workers that are in Wuxi right now.
Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC
Is it fair to say that a good part of the pressure in your margins over the last 18 months has been a result of some of this transitionary pressure and as this falls out, you should get some of that margin back that you've given up? Or is that too naive that it's a really function of product and volumes, and you actually have had competitive pressures that are altering the equation? And I guess at the end of the day, are you guys more or less or just about the same in terms of how bullish you are about your business? It sounds really muddled to us from the comments. You don't want to seem to want to commit to any meaningful trajectory on change on anything whether it's product lines or growth or cost structure. Why so muddled?
Jerry S. Rawls - Executive Chairman
I apologize for being muddled. We are optimistic about our business. We're building new factories because we think we're going to need the volumes. We expect that optics are going to continue to grow and the principal driver right now is the Web 2.0 space and then next year, it's going to be big in telecom with all of the metro build-outs. So I apologize again. We don't want to be muddled. We are optimistic. So we don't give guidance beyond the next quarter, and that's been our policy for a long time, so.
Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC
That was very helpful. Thank you, Jerry. It just helps to get defensive whether you guys are bullish or nervous. Thanks.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
