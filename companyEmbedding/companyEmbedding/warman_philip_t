It was very comforting since I'd never been in trouble before.  Well, it was until the one time my father, also an attorney, but of a different sort, was not able to go to my court date with me.  Mr. Keirnan didn't even bother to tell me that he wasn't going to show up at the beginning like I had to, even though he had always been there from the start of court before.  I sat in the court room for 2 HOURS wondering where my attorney was, and why I couldn't get an answer from him or his office as to what was going on.  Finally, my father, who was on vacation, decided to call Casey, and immediately got the answer.  He had other court appearances to make as well, and attended those first apparently since my dad wasn't around.  By the time Casey made it to the court room, 2.5 hours after the session began, the judge had gone home sick for the day.  Since my court date kept getting reset, I had to go a couple more times before it was settled.  In that time, I tried to call Mr. Keirnan in regards to my case with a question, but he could never be bothered to return MY calls, only my father's.  I guess even though I was his client, he was simply too good to talk to ME.  He chose to go through my father, and only took time to make sure I understood what was happening when my father was around.  It was all for show.  Yes, he did his job, and I have no complaints as to the results.  I just don't like the fact that I paid that much money to a man who couldn't even call me back about my case.  Now that I am getting my record sealed, I am going through the same BS with a lady in his office who handles Non-Disclosures and Expunctures all the time.  I am downright pissed off at this point, and regret ever going to this practice to begin with.  Thanks to this lady, my entire life is on hold still because she has yet to file the papers, THREE WEEKS after cashing the check for PAYMENT IN FULL.  She knows this also, so I she either does not care, or is incapable of finding out when the right time of day is to file the papers.  Not very reassuring for someone who does this kind of thing ALL THE TIME.  Technically, I could have had my record sealed two weeks ago, but she can't even call me back at the times SHE says she will call me.  I have to hunt her down basically.  I could have handled this matter MYSELF and had it all done and over with long ago, in less than the amount of time she requires to manage to get herself to the court when the right person is there.IF YOU HAVE THE NEED FOR A DEFENSE ATTORNEY, YOU'VE ALREADY GOT ENOUGH STRESS TO DEAL WITH.  DON'T ADD TO IT BY HIRING ANYONE IN THIS OFFICE, OR THIS ATTORNEY EITHER.  They obviously care only about the money the make from their job, not the people they represent!Bennett & Bennett, Houston Criminal-Defense LawyersF B. ratedIf there be any doubt in your mind about selecting Mark Bennett to defend you against a legal assault mounted by the federal, state or local judicial systems against your life, liberty or happiness---cast them aside. If you are reading this, you are very likely under such assault. Just know there is only one goal to this assault, and that is to prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law, regardless of guilt or innocence or extenuating circumstance.  It is their job. And they like it. And the only thing standing between you and a conviction is your defense attorney, upon whom your fate will utterly depend, so you had better make the right choice. I can personally attest that they don’t come any better than Mark Bennett. Period. He is the best of the best. A lawyer’s lawyer, with compassion, integrity, and a deeply intuitive situational intelligence that enables him to create highly effective strategies and tactics to win your case; he can think within the box, outside the box, and even upend the box if necessary---whatever the situation requires. Not only does he keep up with the very latest developments in federal, state, and local legal standards, practices and laws, his cutting edge commentaries and articles on a wide variety of evolving legal issues help to shape and inform the attitudes and opinions of innumerable practicing lawyers and judges, both locally and nationally. On at least one occasion while in court, he actually had to educate the judge and prosecutor of a change in the law, which as a matter of course led to yet another dismissal. This is a defense attorney that you want at your side.Terry & Thweatt, P.C. Attorneys At Lawkirkbr ratedTerry & Thweatt is a God sent firm.  I suffered severe burns to my stomach when I was eating at a fast food restaurant.  I looked up injury attorneys located in the Texas City area and came across Terry & Thweatt, so I called them but was politely informed by Irene, one of the assistants, that their office is located in Houston.  Irene continued to get information regarding my injuries and then transferred my call to one of the attorneys, Joseph Terry.    I was able to get an appointment that same day.     Terry explained the process that we would be involved in and let me know that it can be a long process.  Attorney Joseph Terry was patient and answered all my questions + all my girlfriend’s questions and concerns.  I decided to give them a try and man am I glad that I did.  This firm is by far the most professional and friendly business that I have had to deal with.  Not only are they friendly over the phone but in person too.  I know that I am not the easiest person to deal with but Irene was persistent, friendly and professional throughout the whole case unlike other places that are only friendly the first time that you come in to sign the contract.  I am very happy with the outcome of my case and the services that Terry & Thweatt provided me with.  I highly recommend Terry & Thweatt, especially Joseph Terry to anyone that needs a lawyer for injuries that they suffer because he is so knowledgeable and efficient.  THANK YOU Joseph Terry and Irene!Cogdell, DanSecret N. ratedMr. Akers and the Cogdell Law Firm represented me when I was charged with felony theft. I was accused of stealing a bag which contained items belonging to off-duty police officers. A felony conviction of this nature would have prevented me from practicing my chosen career. Due to the gravity of the charges against me, I knew that I needed immediate, proven and effective representation. Mr. Akers began gathering information about my case as soon as we ended our telephone conversation and was up to speed for our first meeting. He laid out the best case scenario as well as worst case scenario and his recommended plan to resolve the charges against me. Cordt and his firm kept me appraised to every step that occurred with my case. They were able to reschedule hearings for me when I was absolutely unable to travel to Harris County for them. Cordt was available to me whenever I needed to get into contact with him. When the prosecution would not budge, Cordt had informed me that he had already been preparing for trial, in case that was the route I chose to take. Ultimately Cordt was able to get the charges against me dismissed, for which I am truly grateful. Requiring a criminal defense attorney means you are already in a stressful and worrying situation. I recommend Cordt Akers to lift some weight off of your shoulders and to guide you through the legal system, returning a favorable outcome.  H. Brad Parker P. C.N R. ratedI hired Mr. H. Brad Parker seven years ago for bankruptcy and he and his office took the time to understand the specifics of my case.  The law office of H Brad Parker helped me save my home from foreclosure and fought the creditors that tried to bring additional financial ruin to me.  My case was not an easy one and not once did Mr. Parker shun away from the obstacles.  He was always ready to fight my case and find a way bring justice.  In fact, when my case was discharged some creditors surfaced and tried to falsely collect on a debt.  Once again, Mr. Parker was immediately on the case and working toward a favorable result for me.Mr. Parker went the extra mile for my case.  He is sincere in his approach and truly cared about the impact of a negative judgment in my case.  He seeks justice and is concerned about my future as it relates to my case.  My only regret is that I did not find Mr. Parker years earlier when I needed a family lawyer.  For any person seeking an honest, sincere, expert lawyer look no further.  Mr. Parker’s approach may be different than other lawyers but it is a breath of fresh air.  You are not a number when a client at H Brad Parker offices but part of your case legal team.My experience has been so wonderful with the offices of H Brad Parker that I would not consider hiring any other lawyer in the Houston area for my legal needs.Terry & Thweatt, P.C. Attorneys At Lawrjd757 ratedI just want to thank the staff...I just want to thank the staff and attorneys at the Law Firm of Terry & Thweatt, P.C. My wife and I were involved in a personal injury case that required the assistance of legal professional s. We retained the services of Terry & Thweatt via a professional reference. We were very pleased with the professionalism and expertise demonstrated by this law firm. We were represented by Counsel Joseph Terry. The legal assistance provided by Mr. Terry was instrumental in obtaining results that far exceeded our expectations. The demeanor and attitude of Mr. Terry and his staff demonstrates that this law firm does what many other law firms repeatedly fail to do: Put the client’s interest first!

Thank you again and keep up the great work!RS, Houston TXNossa Law Office P.C.Dn F. ratedResidency My wife stayed in the US on an expired visa when I met her (2011). We met fell in love and got married 3 years later (April 2014) and to make things easier and to have someone representing us we hired Mr. Nossa. He took care of everything for us. He is very knowledgable about immigration laws. We initially were going to hire another lawyer but he was asking for $1200 for some waiver that according to Mr. Nossa was not necessary. The initial lawyer was hesitant about my wife's status and about the waiver that was "needed", he just seemed unsure. Of course, we didn't want to give him extra money that was not going to help. We met Pablo and he was so certain about of case. He knew exactly what was needed and made us feel so confident. We trusted him since day one. He told us we had a good shot at this, he send our paperwork July 16, 2014 and was approved October 14, 2014. My wife received her Resident card October 22. The whole process took 3 months. The exact time Mr. Nossa told us on day 1. What else can we say about him. He is an outstanding lawyer. Don't hesitate any longer, hire him. Anne E. Kennedy, Attorney At LawAmber V. ratedI hired Anne back in 2011, when I needed an attorney that didn't play games, like the one that i fired before her. Anne definitely does not play games. She has been very straight forward through every process we been theough. Her staff are great as well, and remeber you by name when you call. She has known my case inside out, every time I have needed her. I love that she is very blunt, even in the court room. Back in 2011, she went to question my ex about contradicting order he file pro se at a prior court hearing. He was only wanting to pay $50 for 2 children. She questioned him about his lifestyle and asked if he was a made-man! The judge found him intensionally underemployed. Recently we went to mediation, I walked out with WAY more than a judge would grant in trial and didn't budge on some issues that needed addressed. Thanks to Ms Kennedy and her knowledge of my case and how the family court system works! She didn't play games then either when the opposing parties were trying to.Law Office of Kunal PatelMike B. ratedInitially I went to a CPA that I thought was the best in the business based on his numerous online reviews. I went in and the CPA sold me on his BS of having "secret solutions" that no one else had to "fight the IRS". He put the fear of God in me about the IRS and I ended up paying him several thousand $$ to represent me for an audit. The CPA didn't send the IRS my documents in time and the auditor prepared a report disallowing my business expenses. I was shocked when I got a bill for $30,000 from the IRS in the mail! I came across Mr. Patel's website and gave him a call to set up an appointment. I liked that he had prior experience working at the IRS. He filed an audit reconsideration for me and resolved the issues that the CPA screwed up. I ended up with a bill for a little over $1,000 for some expenses that were disallowed (my fault). Mr. Patel was also able have my penalties abated from the audit. I'm in the process of filing a complaint against the CPA to get my $$ back. ThanksS J Whitaker Law OfficeC. S. ratedIn 2012 I worked with her on a car accident case. she was on the ball and made me feel confident in her abilities. we had a fee agreement. she stated she collects 33.3% percent of recovered funds. That's pretty much the standard so I agreed. I got the first check , she took her fee. then I got the final amount a second check...to which she added in the first. and then took another 33% from larger sum. Basically lets say I go $15 and she took her $5. then I get another $15 for a total of $30...instead of taking the remaining 33% from the new money she added it all together and took 33% from 30. so instead of taking the next $5 which was rightfully hers she tried to take $10 ..which when you do the math IS NOT 33% of the total recovery. I told her this is double dipping. you cant take fees from every check I get then add it all back up without accounting for the money you have taken AND then charge me AGAIN. I was deeply saddened and disappointed by this sheisty behavior.Did You Know?Types of AttorneysThe legal profession is vast, with each attorney having his or her specialties. Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations. Here are some common reasons people begin seeking legal representation or advice:You Know Your Limitations
If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, you need assistance. You may need a third party to help you navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. It's essential you fully understand the terms of any legally binding documentation or activity you become a part of. If you are not an expert in a given field, you'll want to hire an attorney who is.A lawyer may find legal implications or opportunities you might miss. If you find yourself in a civil or criminal matter, a proper attorney ensures you don't receive a harsh punishment for a small mistake.You're Facing an Important Event/Decision
When making decisions critical to your financial stability or personal life, you may want a lawyer with expertise in your situation to make sure you do everything you can to arrive at the proper resolution. This is especially true when you become involved in a criminal case and your freedom is on the line.It's not just a matter of legal knowledge; lawyer's have access to numerous resources you do not. They have staff ready to work around the clock and experts in a variety of fields to give your important issues the attention they deserve.You Can't Be Impartial
During times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you may need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way of level-headed thinking. For example, divorce lawyers can mediate a heated argument and help both partners get on with their lives.Emotional investment could be subtle. You may want to have a lawyer look over an investment opportunity that looks too good to be true or investigate the merits of a possible civil suit when you feel wronged.You're Out of Options
Many people turn to lawyers when they are in trouble. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available to assist you as you deal with your problems.Personal injury lawyers find solutions for people who can no longer work under their own power and bankruptcy attorneys prevent people from giving in to debt. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't find a solution, a lawyer may be able to offer the counsel you need.How to Choose a LawyerWhen it comes time to choose a lawyer, you should start by searching close to home. While you probably don't want the conflict of interest that comes from being represented by a family member, friends and loved ones can recommend lawyers who served them well in the past. If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you.After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online. You should check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.When you build a list of possible candidates, perform a background check on each one. See if you can find information on their history and success record. Once you find a possible lawyer, you should call to arrange a consultation so you can ask your important questions in person.By performing the necessary research and taking every available precaution, you can narrow your search to the attorney most suited to your needs.
