                                                    PR Newswire – 
                                                    9:00 AM ET 07/28/2017
                                                


NEW YORK, July 28, 2017 U.S. equities hit all-time highs during Thursday's trading session, but the major benchmarks gave up their gains in the afternoon and closed lower.

















                                                    Semiconductor stocks tumble, weighing on the tech sector
                                                


                                                    MarketWatch – 
                                                    2:06 PM ET 07/27/2017
                                                


Shares of semiconductor stocks plunged on heavy volume on Thursday, weighing on the technology sector, which in turn pressured the broader market lower. The iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF fell 2.1%, a drop that was more than twice as severe as the 0.8% decline in the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK). Among the biggest decliners in the group, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) fell 5% on the day while Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) was off 4%.

















                                                    AMD Completes Ryzen Mainstream Desktop  Lineup with the Release of Ryzen 3 processors
                                                


                                                    GlobeNewswire – 
                                                    9:00 AM ET 07/27/2017
                                                


Building off a momentous introduction of the AMD “Zen” core architecture  named “Best New Technology” by independent reviewers around the globe, AMD today released two models of its mainstream-priced, high-efficiency AMD Ryzen™ 3 desktop processor -- the AMD Ryzen™ 3 1300X and AMD Ryzen™ 3 1200 CPUs.

















                                                    AMD's stock hits 10-year high as upbeat results prompt analysts to boost targets
                                                


                                                    MarketWatch – 
                                                    4:37 PM ET 07/26/2017
                                                


Analysts remain cautious over sustainability of current pace of growth and valuation. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) rocketed Wednesday to a 10- year high, after Wall Street analysts praised the chip maker's second-quarter results but stopped short of recommending investors buy at current levels. AMD even lost at least one bullish analyst from BMO Capital, who downgraded the stock on worries about valuation and the earnings outlook longer term.

















                                                    AMD's stock soars toward 5-month high as analysts boost price targets after upbeat results

Shares of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) soared 9% in premarket trade Wednesday, putting them on track to open at a 5- month high, after the chip maker reported a surprise second-quarter profit and revenue that rose above forecasts. That prompted no less than 10 of the 31 analysts surveyed by FactSet to raise their price targets. The average target price has increased 11% to $13.78, which is 10% below where the stock is currently trading ahead of the open.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
