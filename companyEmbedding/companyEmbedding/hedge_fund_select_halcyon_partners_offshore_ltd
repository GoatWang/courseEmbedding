Goldman Sachs Adds New Funds to Hedge Fund Platform


					October 16, 2013

					 
                    Stephen Taub

Goldman Sachs





					The firm's Hedge Fund Select platform allows clients to access brand-name hedge funds with less money than is typically required. 
				



Goldman Sachs has added three funds to its Hedge Fund Select
    platform, which allows its clients to invest in well-regarded
    and in some cases brand-name hedge funds with much lower
    minimums than the underlying fund would charge.
The investment bank disclosed in separate filings Tuesday
    that it has launched Hedge Fund Select: Halcyon Partners
    Offshore, Hedge Fund Select: Dymon Asia Macro Fund and Hedge
    Fund Select: Corsair Capital Investors Flagship Fund. This
    brings to 16 the number of funds it has introduced under this
    format since last September. Other funds on the platform
    include those run by Alan Howard’s London-based
    Brevan Howard Asset Management, Barry Rosenstein’s
    New York-based Jana Partners and Paul Tudor Jones
    II’s Greenwich, Connecticut-based Tudor Investment
    Corp.
Goldman only requires Hedge Fund Select investors to plunk
    down $500,000 for each of the funds, compared with a minimum of
    $1 million to $5 million typically required by the underlying
    firms. However, there is a catch: A client must have at least
    $25 million invested with Goldman altogether.
Having Goldman’s imprimatur, however, does not
    guarantee superior performance. Many of the underlying funds
    that Goldman is offering to its clients have produced mediocre
    performance of late.
For example, the Brevan Howard Multi-Strategy Fund was down
    0.50 percent through August after rising just 4.61 percent in
    2012. The Dymon Asia Macro Fund, run by Singapore-based Dymon
    Asia Capital, lost nearly 1 percent in September and is now up
    just 5.68 percent for the first nine months. It rose less than
    1 percent last year. (To be fair, the fund was up a stellar
    20.11 percent in 2011 and 15.23 percent in 2010.)
David Chan, who last year joined Dymon Asia as chief
    executive officer, was previously the head of macro trading at
    Goldman in Asia. Firm founder Danny Yong also worked on the
    Goldman macro desk. The firm was initially seeded, in part, by
    Tudor as well as several of its partners and employees.
Greenwich, Connecticut-based Tudor Discretionary Macro Fund,
    a multi-manager fund, lost 2 percent last month and is up 8.19
    percent through the first three quarters. It gained just 2.82
    percent in the half year of its existence in 2012.
Halcyon Partners Offshore, managed by New York-based Halcyon
    Asset Management, lost 0.42 percent last month through
    September 27, putting its gains for the year at 5.68 percent.
    It rose 11.24 percent in 2012.
Perhaps the best performing fund on the Goldman platform is
    Jana Partners Qualified, one of the offerings from
    Rosenstein’s activist fund family. It rose 3.20
    percent in September and is now up 14.3 percent through the
    first three quarters of the year.

Our Services : Hedge Fund Marketing : Fund Accounting Administration : Fund Management Solutions








 

























Our value added services  consist of many different pieces. As the hedge fund manager you need to focus  your attention on the buying and selling of securities. Why are hedge fund  managers outsourcing their back-office operations? Simple, focusing on an  in-house back office diverts their attention from their core responsibilities,  namely asset accumulation and building your franchise. Your investors will  appreciate the independent third-party verification of your funds’ operating  results by our CPAs at Strategic Asset Management.  Our individualized services packages tailored  to your fund or situation are crucial to satisfying your customers.   We  greatly reduce expenses and overhead for your fund by eliminating the need for  a large administrative and operational staff.
