Home About Governance R. Scott Turicchi 

R. Scott Turicchi




















A 1985 graduate of Claremont McKenna College with a bachelor’s degree in mathematics and economics, R. Scott Turicchi spent the following 15 years in the investment banking industry, including 10 years at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation (DLJ). During his tenure at DLJ, he was responsible for corporate finance activities, including public equity offerings, high grade and high yield debt offerings, private equity placements, and mergers and acquisitions advisory services.
In March 2000, Mr. Turicchi joined one of his clients, j2 Global, Inc., as the Executive Vice President of Corporate Development. In May 2003, he was appointed CFO of the company, and in August 2005, he was elevated to Co-President. His focus is directed to all regulatory, M&A, and public company matters. j2 Global is a NASDAQ-listed provider of Internet-based messaging and communication solutions.
Mr. Turicchi serves as a board member of Green Hills Software, a private company that produces real-time operating systems. In addition, he is the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Reed Institute at his alma mater, Claremont McKenna College. He and his wife, Lannette, serve as Trustees of the John Paul II Cultural Center in Washington D.C. The Turicchis have also been involved with the North American College in Rome.
Mrs. Turicchi was active in the entertainment industry for several years before launching the non-theatrical distribution department for Dreamworks SKG. In 2000, she co-founded Captive Entertainment, a distributor of feature films and television products to the non-theatrical market. She now devotes her time to the couple’s three young girls. In addition, she has recently completed two short subject films about Pope John Paul II for the John Paul II Cultural Center and is working on a feature length documentary entitled Poland and the Papacy.
Mr. Turicchi was appointed to the Board of Governors in May 2007 and held the office of vice chairman before being elected as chairman in May 2014. He says of his involvement with Thomas Aquinas College, “It is a great honor and privilege to serve on a board that unites so many of my interests, including love of Church, knowledge, and beauty. I am deeply proud of the administration, faculty, students, and alumni for providing an example of how Catholic higher education should contribute to the overall formation of the person. I hope to be able to contribute to this vision and example.” In 2008, he and Mrs. Turicchi were inducted into the Order of St. Albert.

j2 Global Communications Expands Chief Marketing Officer Role; Names R. Scott Turicchi CFO

LOS ANGELES, Calif., May 19, 2003
 j2 Global Communications, Inc. [NASDAQ: JCOM], the provider of outsourced, value-added messaging and communications services, today announced that R. Scott Turicchi has been named chief financial officer (CFO) for the Company. Nehemia (Hemi) Zucker, who since 1997 had served as CFO, and since 2001 also as chief marketing officer (CMO), will now focus exclusively on an expanded CMO role. The CMO position has been broadened to cover oversight all of j2 Global's "customer facing" organizations (including marketing, sales, product development, project management and customer service).
			
				"Being CMO is both challenging and satisfying. As expanding the CMO position became a possibility, I discussed with our president and board of directors the need to have a new person serve as CFO who could devote full attention to the job," said Zucker. "We are fortunate to have Scott Turicchi available to fill this role. The CFO position is a natural extension of his responsibilities since 2001, as the Company's executive vice president of corporate development."
			
        "Hemi's success as CMO, during which time revenues increased from $7.2 million to $15.2 million a quarter, made consolidating the 'customer facing' organizations under the CMO a logical next step," said Scott Jarus, president of j2 Global. "Scott Turicchi has been leading the Company's corporate finance, M&A and investor relations activities since 2001. He has also been actively involved and invaluable in all aspects of our financial planning. Scott's history with the Company, his 18 years of financial experience at the highest levels of U.S. finance, and the fact that he is able to step right into the CFO role made today's management changes easy and obvious." 
			
        In addition to the appointment of Turicchi as CFO, j2 Global has appointed Greggory Kalvin as chief accounting officer. Kalvin is a certified public accountant and was a senior manager with KPMG before joining j2 Global in 1997. During his tenure at j2 Global, he has helped lead and build the Company's accounting department while serving as the Company's principal accounting officer. 
			  About j2 
        Founded in 1995, j2 Global Communications, Inc., provides outsourced, value-added messaging and communications services to more than four million customers around the world. j2 Global's network spans more than 1,000 cities in 18 countries on five continents.
