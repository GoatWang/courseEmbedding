History[edit]
Perion was formerly IncrediMail, an email company founded in 1999 by cousins Yaron and Ofer Adler.[6] Soon after its founding, they raised $3.3 million from private and institutional sources and IPOed on NASDAQ in January 2006. They listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange in 2007.[7]
Perion was managed by its original founders until August 2010, when Josef Mandelbaum was appointed CEO.[8] Mandelbaum had previously been CEO of American Greetings Interactive, the internet branch of American Greetings. In August 2011 Perion acquired the Redmond-based Smilebox for $32 million. Smilebox is an application for creating slideshows and other digital photo albums.[9][10]
In November 2011 they changed the company name to Perion, the Hebrew word for productivity. In November 2012 Perion purchased Israel-based SweetPacks (aka SweetIM) for approximately $41 million.[11][12] SweetPacks produced a variety of downloadable content for everyday use. In January 2014, they acquired Conduit’s ClientConnect business in an all-stock transaction valued at $660 million.[13]
In June 2014, Perion acquired San Francisco based GrowMobile.[14] In February 2015, Perion acquired Paris-based MakeMeReach - a social media advertising platform.[15] After their move to Holon, Perion Network incorporated CSR policies into their corporate strategy. 2% of its net profits is donated and all employees are permitted to spend up to 40 hours per year volunteering in the community.[16]
In December 2015, Perion acquired the digital advertising company Undertone for $180 million.[17][18] In January 2017, Perion announced the appointment of new CEO Doron Gerstel, effective April 2017, followed by the announcement of Josef Mandelbaum stepping down from the company.[19] Later in the year, the company's unit MakeMeReach was named as a Snapchat Partner.[20]

History[edit]
Perion was formerly IncrediMail, an email company founded in 1999 by cousins Yaron and Ofer Adler.[6] Soon after its founding, they raised $3.3 million from private and institutional sources and IPOed on NASDAQ in January 2006. They listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange in 2007.[7]
Perion was managed by its original founders until August 2010, when Josef Mandelbaum was appointed CEO.[8] Mandelbaum had previously been CEO of American Greetings Interactive, the internet branch of American Greetings. In August 2011 Perion acquired the Redmond-based Smilebox for $32 million. Smilebox is an application for creating slideshows and other digital photo albums.[9][10]
In November 2011 they changed the company name to Perion, the Hebrew word for productivity. In November 2012 Perion purchased Israel-based SweetPacks (aka SweetIM) for approximately $41 million.[11][12] SweetPacks produced a variety of downloadable content for everyday use. In January 2014, they acquired Conduit’s ClientConnect business in an all-stock transaction valued at $660 million.[13]
In June 2014, Perion acquired San Francisco based GrowMobile.[14] In February 2015, Perion acquired Paris-based MakeMeReach - a social media advertising platform.[15] After their move to Holon, Perion Network incorporated CSR policies into their corporate strategy. 2% of its net profits is donated and all employees are permitted to spend up to 40 hours per year volunteering in the community.[16]
In December 2015, Perion acquired the digital advertising company Undertone for $180 million.[17][18] In January 2017, Perion announced the appointment of new CEO Doron Gerstel, effective April 2017, followed by the announcement of Josef Mandelbaum stepping down from the company.[19] Later in the year, the company's unit MakeMeReach was named as a Snapchat Partner.[20]
Products[edit]
Undertone helps brands engage consumers through cross-screen and digital ad experiences. CodeFuel allows developers to generate revenue using search syndication.[5] MakeMeReach is a social media marketing tool to help advertisers grow demand for their brand on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram & Snapchat.

Perion was managed by its original founders until August 2010, when Josef Mandelbaum was appointed CEO.[8] Mandelbaum had previously been CEO of American Greetings Interactive, the internet branch of American Greetings. In August 2011 Perion acquired the Redmond-based Smilebox for $32 million. Smilebox is an application for creating slideshows and other digital photo albums.[9][10]
In November 2011 they changed the company name to Perion, the Hebrew word for productivity. In November 2012 Perion purchased Israel-based SweetPacks (aka SweetIM) for approximately $41 million.[11][12] SweetPacks produced a variety of downloadable content for everyday use. In January 2014, they acquired Conduit’s ClientConnect business in an all-stock transaction valued at $660 million.[13]
In June 2014, Perion acquired San Francisco based GrowMobile.[14] In February 2015, Perion acquired Paris-based MakeMeReach - a social media advertising platform.[15] After their move to Holon, Perion Network incorporated CSR policies into their corporate strategy. 2% of its net profits is donated and all employees are permitted to spend up to 40 hours per year volunteering in the community.[16]
In December 2015, Perion acquired the digital advertising company Undertone for $180 million.[17][18] In January 2017, Perion announced the appointment of new CEO Doron Gerstel, effective April 2017, followed by the announcement of Josef Mandelbaum stepping down from the company.[19] Later in the year, the company's unit MakeMeReach was named as a Snapchat Partner.[20]

Adjusted EBITDA


      Adjusted EBITDA consists of EBITDA adjusted to exclude 
      acquisition-related expenses and share-based compensation expenses, gain 
      from the reversal of acquisition related contingent consideration, 
      impairment of goodwill and of acquired intangible assets. The purpose of 
      such adjustments is to give an indication of performance exclusive of 
      non-cash charges and other items that are considered by management to be 
      outside the core operating results. This measure is among the primary 
      factors management uses in planning for and forecasting future periods. 
      Furthermore, this measure is regularly used internally to understand, 
      manage and evaluate our business and make operating decisions. We 
      believe that it is useful to investors as a consistent and comparable 
      measure of the ongoing performance of our business. Additionally, this 
      measure may differ materially from such measures used by other companies.

History[edit]
Perion was formerly IncrediMail, an email company founded in 1999 by cousins Yaron and Ofer Adler.[6] Soon after its founding, they raised $3.3 million from private and institutional sources and IPOed on NASDAQ in January 2006. They listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange in 2007.[7]
Perion was managed by its original founders until August 2010, when Josef Mandelbaum was appointed CEO.[8] Mandelbaum had previously been CEO of American Greetings Interactive, the internet branch of American Greetings. In August 2011 Perion acquired the Redmond-based Smilebox for $32 million. Smilebox is an application for creating slideshows and other digital photo albums.[9][10]
In November 2011 they changed the company name to Perion, the Hebrew word for productivity. In November 2012 Perion purchased Israel-based SweetPacks (aka SweetIM) for approximately $41 million.[11][12] SweetPacks produced a variety of downloadable content for everyday use. In January 2014, they acquired Conduit’s ClientConnect business in an all-stock transaction valued at $660 million.[13]
In June 2014, Perion acquired San Francisco based GrowMobile.[14] In February 2015, Perion acquired Paris-based MakeMeReach - a social media advertising platform.[15] After their move to Holon, Perion Network incorporated CSR policies into their corporate strategy. 2% of its net profits is donated and all employees are permitted to spend up to 40 hours per year volunteering in the community.[16]
In December 2015, Perion acquired the digital advertising company Undertone for $180 million.[17][18] In January 2017, Perion announced the appointment of new CEO Doron Gerstel, effective April 2017, followed by the announcement of Josef Mandelbaum stepping down from the company.[19] Later in the year, the company's unit MakeMeReach was named as a Snapchat Partner.[20]
Products[edit]
Undertone helps brands engage consumers through cross-screen and digital ad experiences. CodeFuel allows developers to generate revenue using search syndication.[5] MakeMeReach is a social media marketing tool to help advertisers grow demand for their brand on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram & Snapchat. The mobile and desktop apps are IncrediMail, an email program and Smilebox, a desktop and mobile app for customizing and animating photos.[21]
