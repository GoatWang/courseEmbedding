Dose escalation trial will evaluate RPL554 in approximately 400 COPD patients

LONDON, July  26, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Verona Pharma plc (AIM:VRP) (NASDAQ:VRNA) ("Verona Pharma"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative therapies for respiratory diseases, announces today that the first patients have been dosed in a Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating RPL554 as a maintenance treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ("COPD"). Verona Pharma expects to report top-line data from this trial in the second half of 2018.
RPL554 is a first-in-class, inhaled, dual inhibitor of the enzymes phosphodiesterase 3 and 4 designed to have anti-inflammatory, as well as bronchodilator properties, and is currently in development for the treatment of COPD and cystic fibrosis.
The four-week, dose-ranging trial is planned to enroll approximately 400 patients with COPD to investigate the efficacy, safety, and dose-response of nebulized RPL554 as a maintenance treatment for the disease. The primary endpoint of this double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study is improvement in lung function with RPL554 compared to placebo, as measured by FEV1, a standard measure of exhaled breath volume used to evaluate respiratory function.
The trial is being performed at a number of sites across Europe and is part of Verona Pharma's global strategic services agreement with QuintilesIMS to provide core clinical trial services for RPL554 clinical development programs, as well as provide additional insights to inform development and commercial strategy. 
"Dosing our first patients in this larger four-week Phase 2b trial is an important step forward in the evaluation of nebulized RPL554 as a novel therapy for COPD patients with significant unmet medical needs," said Jan-Anders Karlsson, PhD, CEO of Verona Pharma. "The clinical data generated to date and the mechanism of action of RPL554 makes it a promising first-in-class treatment option. We look forward to working with patients and healthcare providers across the trial sites to gather meaningful data and insights, and expect to report top-line results from this study in the second half of 2018."
In previous clinical trials in patients with COPD, RPL554 has been observed to result in statistically significant improvements in lung function as compared to placebo and has shown clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in lung function when added to two commonly used bronchodilators as compared to either bronchodilator administered as a single agent. RPL554 has also shown anti-inflammatory effects and has been well tolerated in clinical trials.
About Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease 
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive respiratory disease for which there is no cure. The condition damages the airways and the lungs, leading to cough, mucus secretion and shortness of breath, impacting a person's ability to perform daily activities. According to the World Health Organization, COPD is the third leading cause of death globally, with 210 million people worldwide suffering from the disease. Current therapies to treat COPD are aimed at reducing and controlling symptoms. Despite the wide availability of these therapies, many COPD patients continue to suffer acute periods of worsening symptoms known as exacerbations. In the U.S. alone, these exacerbations are associated with approximately 1.5 million emergency department visits, 687,000 hospitalizations, and 129,000 deaths per year. The total annual medical costs related to COPD in the U.S. were estimated to be $32 billion in 2010, and are projected to rise to $49 billion in 2020.
About Verona Pharma plc
Verona Pharma is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative therapies for the treatment of respiratory diseases with significant unmet medical needs.
Verona Pharma's product candidate, RPL554, is a first-in-class, inhaled, dual inhibitor of the enzymes phosphodiesterase 3 and 4 that acts as both a bronchodilator and an anti-inflammatory agent in a single compound. Verona Pharma is developing RPL554 for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cystic fibrosis (CF), and potentially asthma.
Forward-Looking Statements 
This press release contains forward-looking statements. All statements contained in this press release that do not relate to matters of historical fact should be considered forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements regarding the design of the Phase 2b clinical trial of RPL554, the timing of availability of top-line data for the Phase 2b clinical trial, the importance of the Phase 2b clinical trial to our development plans for RPL554, the potential of RPL554 as a promising first-in-class treatment option for COPD, and the value of the data and insights that may be gathered from the Phase 2b clinical trial.
These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations. These statements are neither promises nor guarantees, but involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from our expectations expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, the following: our limited operating history; our need for additional funding to complete development and commercialization of RPL554, which may not be available and which may force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our development or commercialization efforts; the reliance of our business on the success of RPL554, our only product candidate under development; economic, political, regulatory and other risks involved with international operations; the lengthy and expensive process of clinical drug development, which has an uncertain outcome; serious adverse, undesirable or unacceptable side effects associated with RPL554, which could adversely affect our ability to develop or commercialize RPL554; potential delays in enrolling patients, which could adversely affect our research and development efforts; we may not be successful in developing RPL554 for multiple indications; our ability to obtain approval for and commercialize RPL554 in multiple major pharmaceutical markets; misconduct or other improper activities by our employees, consultants, principal investigators, and third-party service providers; material differences between our "top-line" data and final data; our reliance on third parties, including clinical investigators, manufacturers and suppliers, and the risks related to these parties' ability to successfully develop and commercialize RPL554; and lawsuits related to patents covering RPL554 and the potential for our patents to be found invalid or unenforceable. These and other important factors under the caption "Risk Factors" in our final prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on April 28, 2017 relating to our Registration Statement on Form F-1, and our other reports filed with the SEC, could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements made in this press release. Any such forward-looking statements represent management's estimates as of the date of this press release. While we may elect to update such forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we disclaim any obligation to do so, even if subsequent events cause our views to change. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release.

              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

Beyond Tesla: 7 stocks driving the autonomous car revolution
              
              Look at these component manufacturers rather than the car companies, says Jeff Reeves.

These 7 highly taxed companies need Congress to finally act on tax reform
              
              It wasn’t Trump’s “movement” that lifted stocks late last year, says Jeff Reeves. It was the promise of lower corporate tax rates.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Dollar turns lower for the week following GDP report
              
              The U.S. dollar fell on Friday, erasing its gains for the week after a read on economic growth came in below expectations, though analysts said the beleaguered currency was potentially nearing a bottom.              
              
            

3:47 p.m. July 28, 2017






Dollar rises from 13-month low
              
              The U.S. dollar rises on Thursday, gaining against major rivals in what analysts suggest a mild consolidation following precipitous declines over recent weeks.

Verona Pharma plc Key Developments

Verona Pharma plc Doses First Patients in Phase 2b Clinical Trial of RPL554 for COPD Maintenance Treatment
Jul 26 17
Verona Pharma plc announced that the first patients have been dosed in a Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating RPL554 as a maintenance treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Verona Pharma expects to report top-line data from this trial in the second half of 2018. RPL554 is a first-in-class, inhaled, dual inhibitor of the enzymes phosphodiesterase 3 and 4 designed to have anti-inflammatory, as well as bronchodilator properties, and is currently in development for the treatment of COPD and cystic fibrosis. The four-week, dose-ranging trial is planned to enroll approximately 400 patients with COPD to investigate the efficacy, safety, and dose-response of nebulized RPL554 as a maintenance treatment for the disease. The primary endpoint of this double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study is improvement in lung function with RPL554 compared to placebo, as measured by FEV1, a standard measure of exhaled breath volume used to evaluate respiratory function. The trial is being performed at a number of sites across Europe and is part of Verona Pharma’s global strategic services agreement with QuintilesIMS to provide core clinical trial services for RPL554 clinical development programs, as well as provide additional insights to inform development and commercial strategy. In previous clinical trials in patients with COPD, RPL554 has been observed to result in statistically significant improvements in lung function as compared to placebo and has shown clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in lung function when added to two commonly used bronchodilators as compared to either bronchodilator administered as a single agent. RPL554 has also shown anti-inflammatory effects and has been well tolerated in clinical trials.

Clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company Verona Pharma PLC said on Wednesday it has dosed its first patients for the Phase 2b clinical trial testing RPL554 as a treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
The four-week dose ranging trail will enrol 400 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to investigate the efficacy, safety and dose-response of RPL554 as a maintenance treatment for the disease, with the primary endpoint being the improvement in lung function with RPL554 compared to placebo.
Verona Pharma expects to reports its results from the trial in the second half of 2018.
"Dosing our first patients in this larger four-week Phase 2b trial is an important step forward in the evaluation of nebulized RPL554 as a novel therapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients with significant unmet medical needs. The clinical data generated to date and the mechanism of action of RPL554 makes it a promising first-in-class treatment option. We look forward to working with patients and healthcare providers across the trial sites to gather meaningful data and insights, and expect to report top-line results from this study in the second half of 2018," said Chief Executive Officer Jan-Anders Karlsson.
Shares in Verona Pharma were down 1.3% at 116.00 pence on Wednesday.(c) 2017 TBREAK MEDIA. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc. (Syndigate.info)., source Middle East & North African Newspapers

					Simulators



					Simulate Inputs to aid development!

 

					2 Reasons to Use Simulators

					1) Work on software before connecting to your Sensors and Actuators.

					Don’t have all your sensors and actuators yet?

					Can’t afford to take system offline for long?

					Prove it works before connecting to the real thing.

					Want to connect sensors and actuators one piece at a time?

					With the External Port option, connect as many Digital IO sensors and actuators as you’d like
					and simulate all the rest.  
					Switches let you select pin-by-pin which Analog Inputs you want to simulate using knobs
					and which you want to use real signals from input ports.

					2) Learn to use PLCs.

					They’re a great training tool.  All IO can be simulated.

					Compatible with most Embedded PLC we sell

					With a Simulator, an Embedded Branch Main and Embedded Expansions,
					you can simulate an entire Branch System.

					Simulators can be set up to work with 5volt and 10volt analog ranges. 

 

					Simulator - top and side views

 

*Picture Shows an Embedded PLC plugged into Simulator.  Embedded PLCs sold separately

 

 

					Knobs simulate Analog Inputs
					(port f is optional)

 

					Switches simulate Digital Inputs

 

					LEDs display Digital Output state

 

					Jumper sets whether GND to +5V 
					or AV- to AV+ is used for Analog Inputs

 

					Analog Input Port Connector (optional)

 

					Switches let you pin-by-pin to use 
					Knob or signal from Analog 
					Input Port (optional)

 

					Digital Input Port Connector (optional)
					decide pin-by-pin to use Switch or wire 
					plugged into this port for Digital Input

 

					Digital Output Port Connector (optional)
					connect outputs to real hardware


 

 

					Our Embedded PLCs use 0.1” spaced headers 
					that extend from the underside of the PLCs. 
					They’re designed to mate with these Simulators,
					as well as your custom hardware

					it's got these 2 hooks  

					Ace or Branch underside  

					notice these slots 

					Ace and Branch have four of the slots shown in the image above, to the right. (two aren’t visible). 
					Twist vMount onto your Ace or Branch to attach.  Pick which of the 4 orientations works best for your project.  




					Once attached to your Ace or Branch, rest the topside on your DIN rail.
