Structure[edit]
The corporation is divided into three business units: Carbon and Chemicals, Railroad Products and Services, and Performance Chemicals. The company specialises in manufacturing carbon chemicals from coal tar. The five main chemicals that are produced are coal pitch for steel and aluminum production, carbon black for rubber vulcanization, creosote for wood treatment, and naphthalene and phthalic anhydride for plastics and polyester. Kopper's coal tar pitches are essential to manufacturing carbon anodes for aluminum smelting. Koppers also has extensive operations making creosote treated wood products, especially railroad ties and switches. Utility poles, foundations, decking materials, and wooden panneling are also produced by the company.
History[edit]
In 1943, Koppers, at the US Government's behest, built a factory in Kobuta, Pennsylvania on the left bank of the Ohio River just downriver from Beaver, to manufacture styrene-butadiene monomer, a building block used to make a form of synthetic rubber for the World War II defense effort.
In 1951, at Port Arthur, Texas, the company built a plant to manufacture the chemical monomer ethylbenzene, using as raw materials ethylene from the nearby Gulf Oil refinery, and benzene, which was a byproduct of the company's coke ovens in Pennsylvania and which was shipped down to Texas by barge. The ethylbenzene produced there was then shipped by barge back up to the Kobuta plant where it was converted to styrene monomer, and then polymerized to make expandable polystyrene. In the early 1950s, the company purchased a license to manufacture polyethylene at its Port Arthur plant. These chemical operations later were the basis for forming a new corporate entity with Sinclair Oil Corporation to form the Sinclair-Koppers Company in 1965.
In 2001, the company had to close down a wood treatment plant in Oroville, California due to contamination of the 205 acre facility, and the surrounding area. Chemicals like PCP and chromium were found to have been leaked into the local drinking water supply.
Beazer hostile takeover[edit]
In early 1988 Beazer, a British conglomerate run by one of the foremost corporate raiders of the 1980s, successfully launched a hostile takeover of Koppers for $1.81 billion ($3.8 billion today). The sale was completed on June 17, 1988.[1] A smaller, more streamlined domestic business unit of Koppers was bought back by local management in the early 2000s, and although much simpler than the once sprawling chemical and aggregate conglomerate of the early-to-mid 20th century, Koppers has once again become successful at its core businesses. In 2006 the new Beazer-free independent Koppers again went public [2].
Current business interests[edit]
Koppers operates facilities in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Denmark, Australia, China, South Africa. The coal tar processor Cindu Chemicals in the Netherlands was acquired in 2010.[1] Koppers sources coal tar from around the world for further processing by distillation into carbon chemicals. Its Monessen, Pennsylvania coke ovens have a combined annual capacity of over 360,000 tons. The company further operates coke ovens in Tangshan, People's Republic of China, and has co-located facilities near the operations of major steel makers.
Products[edit]
One of Koppers' leading products is coal tar. Asphalt sealants containing coal tar have high levels of benzo(a)pyrene and other toxic chemicals known collectively as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs.[2]

Structure[edit]
The corporation is divided into three business units: Carbon and Chemicals, Railroad Products and Services, and Performance Chemicals. The company specialises in manufacturing carbon chemicals from coal tar. The five main chemicals that are produced are coal pitch for steel and aluminum production, carbon black for rubber vulcanization, creosote for wood treatment, and naphthalene and phthalic anhydride for plastics and polyester. Kopper's coal tar pitches are essential to manufacturing carbon anodes for aluminum smelting. Koppers also has extensive operations making creosote treated wood products, especially railroad ties and switches. Utility poles, foundations, decking materials, and wooden panneling are also produced by the company.
History[edit]
In 1943, Koppers, at the US Government's behest, built a factory in Kobuta, Pennsylvania on the left bank of the Ohio River just downriver from Beaver, to manufacture styrene-butadiene monomer, a building block used to make a form of synthetic rubber for the World War II defense effort.
In 1951, at Port Arthur, Texas, the company built a plant to manufacture the chemical monomer ethylbenzene, using as raw materials ethylene from the nearby Gulf Oil refinery, and benzene, which was a byproduct of the company's coke ovens in Pennsylvania and which was shipped down to Texas by barge. The ethylbenzene produced there was then shipped by barge back up to the Kobuta plant where it was converted to styrene monomer, and then polymerized to make expandable polystyrene. In the early 1950s, the company purchased a license to manufacture polyethylene at its Port Arthur plant. These chemical operations later were the basis for forming a new corporate entity with Sinclair Oil Corporation to form the Sinclair-Koppers Company in 1965.
In 2001, the company had to close down a wood treatment plant in Oroville, California due to contamination of the 205 acre facility, and the surrounding area. Chemicals like PCP and chromium were found to have been leaked into the local drinking water supply.
Beazer hostile takeover[edit]
In early 1988 Beazer, a British conglomerate run by one of the foremost corporate raiders of the 1980s, successfully launched a hostile takeover of Koppers for $1.81 billion ($3.8 billion today). The sale was completed on June 17, 1988.[1] A smaller, more streamlined domestic business unit of Koppers was bought back by local management in the early 2000s, and although much simpler than the once sprawling chemical and aggregate conglomerate of the early-to-mid 20th century, Koppers has once again become successful at its core businesses. In 2006 the new Beazer-free independent Koppers again went public [2].
Current business interests[edit]
Koppers operates facilities in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Denmark, Australia, China, South Africa. The coal tar processor Cindu Chemicals in the Netherlands was acquired in 2010.[1] Koppers sources coal tar from around the world for further processing by distillation into carbon chemicals. Its Monessen, Pennsylvania coke ovens have a combined annual capacity of over 360,000 tons. The company further operates coke ovens in Tangshan, People's Republic of China, and has co-located facilities near the operations of major steel makers.
Products[edit]
One of Koppers' leading products is coal tar. Asphalt sealants containing coal tar have high levels of benzo(a)pyrene and other toxic chemicals known collectively as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs.[2]

These chemical operations later were the basis for forming a new corporate entity with Sinclair Oil Corporation to form the Sinclair-Koppers Company in 1965.
In 2001, the company had to close down a wood treatment plant in Oroville, California due to contamination of the 205 acre facility, and the surrounding area. Chemicals like PCP and chromium were found to have been leaked into the local drinking water supply.
Beazer hostile takeover[edit]
In early 1988 Beazer, a British conglomerate run by one of the foremost corporate raiders of the 1980s, successfully launched a hostile takeover of Koppers for $1.81 billion ($3.8 billion today). The sale was completed on June 17, 1988.[1] A smaller, more streamlined domestic business unit of Koppers was bought back by local management in the early 2000s, and although much simpler than the once sprawling chemical and aggregate conglomerate of the early-to-mid 20th century, Koppers has once again become successful at its core businesses. In 2006 the new Beazer-free independent Koppers again went public [2].
Current business interests[edit]
Koppers operates facilities in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Denmark, Australia, China, South Africa. The coal tar processor Cindu Chemicals in the Netherlands was acquired in 2010.[1] Koppers sources coal tar from around the world for further processing by distillation into carbon chemicals. Its Monessen, Pennsylvania coke ovens have a combined annual capacity of over 360,000 tons. The company further operates coke ovens in Tangshan, People's Republic of China, and has co-located facilities near the operations of major steel makers.
Products[edit]
One of Koppers' leading products is coal tar. Asphalt sealants containing coal tar have high levels of benzo(a)pyrene and other toxic chemicals known collectively as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs.[2]

Structure[edit]
The corporation is divided into three business units: Carbon and Chemicals, Railroad Products and Services, and Performance Chemicals. The company specialises in manufacturing carbon chemicals from coal tar. The five main chemicals that are produced are coal pitch for steel and aluminum production, carbon black for rubber vulcanization, creosote for wood treatment, and naphthalene and phthalic anhydride for plastics and polyester. Kopper's coal tar pitches are essential to manufacturing carbon anodes for aluminum smelting. Koppers also has extensive operations making creosote treated wood products, especially railroad ties and switches. Utility poles, foundations, decking materials, and wooden panneling are also produced by the company.
History[edit]
In 1943, Koppers, at the US Government's behest, built a factory in Kobuta, Pennsylvania on the left bank of the Ohio River just downriver from Beaver, to manufacture styrene-butadiene monomer, a building block used to make a form of synthetic rubber for the World War II defense effort.
In 1951, at Port Arthur, Texas, the company built a plant to manufacture the chemical monomer ethylbenzene, using as raw materials ethylene from the nearby Gulf Oil refinery, and benzene, which was a byproduct of the company's coke ovens in Pennsylvania and which was shipped down to Texas by barge. The ethylbenzene produced there was then shipped by barge back up to the Kobuta plant where it was converted to styrene monomer, and then polymerized to make expandable polystyrene. In the early 1950s, the company purchased a license to manufacture polyethylene at its Port Arthur plant. These chemical operations later were the basis for forming a new corporate entity with Sinclair Oil Corporation to form the Sinclair-Koppers Company in 1965.
In 2001, the company had to close down a wood treatment plant in Oroville, California due to contamination of the 205 acre facility, and the surrounding area. Chemicals like PCP and chromium were found to have been leaked into the local drinking water supply.
Beazer hostile takeover[edit]
In early 1988 Beazer, a British conglomerate run by one of the foremost corporate raiders of the 1980s, successfully launched a hostile takeover of Koppers for $1.81 billion ($3.8 billion today). The sale was completed on June 17, 1988.[1] A smaller, more streamlined domestic business unit of Koppers was bought back by local management in the early 2000s, and although much simpler than the once sprawling chemical and aggregate conglomerate of the early-to-mid 20th century, Koppers has once again become successful at its core businesses. In 2006 the new Beazer-free independent Koppers again went public [2].
Current business interests[edit]
Koppers operates facilities in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Denmark, Australia, China, South Africa. The coal tar processor Cindu Chemicals in the Netherlands was acquired in 2010.[1] Koppers sources coal tar from around the world for further processing by distillation into carbon chemicals. Its Monessen, Pennsylvania coke ovens have a combined annual capacity of over 360,000 tons. The company further operates coke ovens in Tangshan, People's Republic of China, and has co-located facilities near the operations of major steel makers.
Products[edit]
One of Koppers' leading products is coal tar. Asphalt sealants containing coal tar have high levels of benzo(a)pyrene and other toxic chemicals known collectively as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs.[2]

Structure[edit]
The corporation is divided into three business units: Carbon and Chemicals, Railroad Products and Services, and Performance Chemicals. The company specialises in manufacturing carbon chemicals from coal tar. The five main chemicals that are produced are coal pitch for steel and aluminum production, carbon black for rubber vulcanization, creosote for wood treatment, and naphthalene and phthalic anhydride for plastics and polyester. Kopper's coal tar pitches are essential to manufacturing carbon anodes for aluminum smelting. Koppers also has extensive operations making creosote treated wood products, especially railroad ties and switches. Utility poles, foundations, decking materials, and wooden panneling are also produced by the company.
History[edit]
In 1943, Koppers, at the US Government's behest, built a factory in Kobuta, Pennsylvania on the left bank of the Ohio River just downriver from Beaver, to manufacture styrene-butadiene monomer, a building block used to make a form of synthetic rubber for the World War II defense effort.
In 1951, at Port Arthur, Texas, the company built a plant to manufacture the chemical monomer ethylbenzene, using as raw materials ethylene from the nearby Gulf Oil refinery, and benzene, which was a byproduct of the company's coke ovens in Pennsylvania and which was shipped down to Texas by barge. The ethylbenzene produced there was then shipped by barge back up to the Kobuta plant where it was converted to styrene monomer, and then polymerized to make expandable polystyrene. In the early 1950s, the company purchased a license to manufacture polyethylene at its Port Arthur plant. These chemical operations later were the basis for forming a new corporate entity with Sinclair Oil Corporation to form the Sinclair-Koppers Company in 1965.
In 2001, the company had to close down a wood treatment plant in Oroville, California due to contamination of the 205 acre facility, and the surrounding area. Chemicals like PCP and chromium were found to have been leaked into the local drinking water supply.
Beazer hostile takeover[edit]
In early 1988 Beazer, a British conglomerate run by one of the foremost corporate raiders of the 1980s, successfully launched a hostile takeover of Koppers for $1.81 billion ($3.8 billion today). The sale was completed on June 17, 1988.[1] A smaller, more streamlined domestic business unit of Koppers was bought back by local management in the early 2000s, and although much simpler than the once sprawling chemical and aggregate conglomerate of the early-to-mid 20th century, Koppers has once again become successful at its core businesses. In 2006 the new Beazer-free independent Koppers again went public [2].
Current business interests[edit]
Koppers operates facilities in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Denmark, Australia, China, South Africa. The coal tar processor Cindu Chemicals in the Netherlands was acquired in 2010.[1] Koppers sources coal tar from around the world for further processing by distillation into carbon chemicals. Its Monessen, Pennsylvania coke ovens have a combined annual capacity of over 360,000 tons. The company further operates coke ovens in Tangshan, People's Republic of China, and has co-located facilities near the operations of major steel makers.
Products[edit]
One of Koppers' leading products is coal tar. Asphalt sealants containing coal tar have high levels of benzo(a)pyrene and other toxic chemicals known collectively as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs.[2]

Did you know?

Some companies sell their services as a package and offer what seems to be an irresistible price, but later they attach fees they did not initially disclose or explain.
By not fully revealing the true nature of their fees, the actual cost of their services adds up quickly and you wind up paying much more than you expected, or wanted, to pay.
Learn  how other business  formation companies  hide their fees.
At Harvard Business Services, Inc., you can rest assured there are no hidden fees. We do not conceal the additional costs you will discover with other business formation companies.



My Promise to you

If you form your Delaware Company through Harvard Business Services you will experience the fastest and friendliest way to start your business that you can imagine. We're special- ists in just this ONE thing, and we take pride in our desire and ability to do it BETTER than anyone out there. Excellence means getting it done quickly, getting it done correctly, and making you feel important, because you are!

Delaware Certificate of Good Standing

Order Your Certificate Now 
The Delaware Certificate of Good Standing is also known as a Certificate of Existence.
 
It is a letter provided by the Delaware Secretary of State that declares that a company is in good standing with the state. It specifically lists the incorporation date, good standing status for a corporation or LLC and whether taxes are current for a corporation or LLC.
 
 Order Your Certificate Now  
(If you already know you need to order a Delaware Certificate of Good Standing, please visit our Delaware Certificate of Good Standing order page. If you'd like to learn more, read on.)
 
Typically, a Certificate of Good Standing is required in order to open a corporate bank account, purchase or sell real estate, obtain a loan, obtain a Certificate of Authority to operate in another state, merge with another company and more.
 
Since the certified document verifies that a company is in good standing on the date it was issued, authorities will generally accept it as proof that the business is valid for 30-60 days after the issue date. Beyond 60 days, however, a new Certificate of Good Standing may need to be ordered.
 
Please click the buttons below to view a sample of a Delaware Certificate of Good Standing—with and without an Apostille.
 

 

Due to the time sensitivity of the Certificate, it is better to order one when you know you'll need it. If you are in a hurry, we can obtain a Certificate for you in two hours if necessary.
 
This certificate can be issued only for companies in good standing with the state of Delaware. If your company owes Delaware Franchise Taxes, they must be paid in full before we can order your Certificate of Good Standing.
 
You may email customer support, call 1-800-345-2677 or live chat with a specialist to determine if your company owes a tax balance.
 
To order a Certificate of Good Standing for your corporation or LLC, please view our pricing options, which start at $99, and then click on the yellow button below:

When Is It Due?
How Do I Calculate My Franchise Tax?

Is My Franchise Tax the Same As My Annual Registered Agent Fee?
What Do I Do After Paying My Franchise Tax?




What Is Delaware Franchise Tax?
The Franchise Tax is the fee imposed by the state of Delaware for the right or privilege to own a Delaware company. The tax has no bearing on income or company activity—it is simply required by the state of Delaware to maintain the good standing status of your company.
 
The term "Franchise Tax" does not imply that your company is a franchise business. 



When Is It Due?
The due date of your tax varies, depending on your company type.
 
The Franchise Tax for a corporation is due by March 1 of every year. If the tax is not paid on or before March 1, the state imposes a $125 late penalty, plus a monthly interest fee of 1.5 percent.
 
The Franchise Tax for a Delaware LLC is due by June 1 of every year. The limited partnership (LP) Franchise Tax is also due by June 1 of every year. If the tax is not paid on or before June 1, the state imposes a $200 late penalty, plus a monthly interest fee of 1.5 percent.
 
Corporations, LLCs and LPs are taxed in arrears, meaning the tax due by each due date is for the previous calendar year.



How Do I Calculate My Franchise Tax?
The Franchise Tax for a Delaware limited liability company (LLC) or Delaware limited partnership (LP) is a flat annual rate of $300 as of July 1, 2014.
 
The Franchise Tax for a corporation is a little more complicated. It is based on your corporation type and the number of authorized shares your company has. The total cost of the Franchise Tax is comprised of an annual report fee and the actual tax due.
 
A non-stock/non-profit company is considered exempt with the state of Delaware. This type of company does not pay the annual tax but must file and pay the annual report fee. The annual report fee is $25 per year.
 
A corporation having 5,000 authorized shares or less is considered a minimum stock corporation. The annual report fee is $50 and the tax is $175 as of July 1, 2014, for a total of $225 per year.
 
A corporation having 5,001 authorized shares or more is considered a maximum stock corporation. The annual report fee is $50 and the tax would be somewhere between $200 and $180,000 per year.
 
There are two methods to calculate a maximum stock company's Franchise Tax. They are:


The Authorized Shares Method
 
The state of Delaware uses this method to initially calculate your taxes. This method is calculated based on the number of authorized shares. The calculation is as follows:

5,000 shares or less: $175 (as of July 1, 2014)
5,001 - 10,000 shares: $250 (as of July 1, 2014)
Additional 10,000 shares or portion thereof: add $75
The maximum annual tax is $180,000

 
Don't forget to add the $50 annual report fee to the Franchise Tax after it is calculated.
 


The Assumed Par Value Capital Method
The state of Delaware allows you to pay the lower of the two calculation methods. Therefore, if you receive a bill from Delaware for tens of thousands of dollars, it may be in your best interest to try calculating your Franchise Tax with the assumed par value capital method.
 
In order to utilize this filing method, you will need to provide the company's total gross assets (as reported on the Form 1120, Schedule L) and the total number of issued shares. Many times the tax is then calculated to the minimum payment of $350 Franchise Tax plus the $50 annual report fee.
 
The calculation used for this method is more complex. Please contact our office if you would like a copy of the calculation emailed to you. We will be happy to help you with this calculation.



How Do I Pay My Franchise Tax?
We make it easy to pay your Franchise Tax online.
 
As your Registered Agent,we will send you tax reminders both by mail and email, well in advance of the due date. We offer a tax filing service for a small fee of $49 plus your Franchise Tax. We also offer an online discounted filing fee that ranges from $29 to $59, depending on when the online payment is submitted.
 
Payments can be submitted via our online Franchise Tax payment form.
 
You can also email or fax (302- 645-1280) us your LLC/LP Franchise Tax worksheet or your corporation Franchise Tax worksheet. If you would like to make your payment by phone, call us at 800-345-2677, Ext. 6904.
 
 
 




 
Do I Need to Submit Anything Else With My Payment?
Yes. Corporations must complete an annual report along with their Franchise Tax payment. This report must list the company's physical address (not a P.O. box and not your Registered Agent's address); the name and physical address of at least one director; and, if there are any officers, the name, title and physical address of one of the officers.
 
If the tax is being calculated with the assumed par value capital method, the gross assets and issued shares are also to be listed. If you decide to pay your Delaware Franchise Tax for a corporation with us over the phone, the annual report would then need to be separately submitted to us by email, fax or mail.



Is My Franchise Tax the Same As My Annual Registered Agent Fee?
The Delaware Franchise Tax and the Registered Agent Fee are two separate, unrelated fees. The annual Franchise Tax is imposed by the state of Delaware. The annual Registered Agent Fee is paid to Harvard Business Services, Inc. to act as an agent for your entity in the state .
 
Our annual Registered Agent Fee is $50 per year, and is due on the anniversary month of the formation of your company.  It is the lowest Registered Agent fee in the industry, and it is guaranteed to remain fixed at $50 per year, as long as the fee is paid on time and your company remains in good standing with the state of Delaware.

What Do I Do After Paying My Franchise Tax?
After paying Franchise Tax, many business owners require a Delaware Certificate of Good Standing.
 
A Certificate of Good Standing is a document sent directly from the Delaware Secretary of State certifying the date the company was formed in the state of Delaware, that the company is current with all Delaware taxes and that the company is in good standing.
 
This is not the same as your annual report and will not mention internal company information, such as director or officer details.
 
We can assist you in obtaining this document. To purchase a Certificate of Good Standing, please visit our Good Standing order page.
 
If you have any additional questions or concerns about the Delaware Franchise Tax, please feel free to call 1-800-345-2677, Ext. 6904 or email us.
