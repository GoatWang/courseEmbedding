Job Details
               At Connelly Partners, we practice the art of visual language. It's a language many brands don't speak well, but one that is imperative for making a customer con- nection. We process products visually and make decisions based on how it makes us feel, right in our gut, at initial glance. In fact, 90% of information transmitted to the brain is visual*, and visuals are processed 60,000X faster in the brain than text according to Eric Jensen's Brain-Based Learning. There are many brands who do a great job with their visual language especially in the Wellness space (KIND brands,David's Tea, Megafood, Quinn Popcorn,Preserve Products, Late July...). A trip to Natural Products Expo West is eye candy in terms of visual language. The very first thing we do for our clients after establishing their brand positioning is to establish their visual language. What does the brand look like? What is the feeling you want to convey and how is that portrayed through color, fonts, photography or illustration, etc? That, to me, is the most exciting part of the job and I know my fellow art directors and designers feel the same way. It's a time to establish something and take a crack at drawing shoppers in as they walk through Whole Foods and stock their newly-designed pantry with cool brands and smart ideas. We all want to buy something that makes a statement about who we are and where we want to be. The visual language starts that dialogue. Everybody wants to be something they are not. In the spirit of design and visual language, I conducted a study at Connelly Partners asking employees to visually map where they are in terms of buying and eating healthy plant foods, exercising, yoga/meditation, mental well being, relationships, etc. People who were satisfied with their current state of being were asked to mark the dots at the outside, and if they were dissatisfied, put them closer to the middle. What was staggering, was that no matter the age group, the dots always started close to center. Self assessments in their own right are incredibly revealing about human nature - we all lack the gene that allows us to be genuinely satisfied with ourselves. We look for products and new forms of exercise to achieve better wellness in an attempt to satisfy other aspects we're not satisfied with: weight, body shape, vanity, desire to live as long a life as possible.....in one shape, form or other, we aspire to be as close to perfect as we can be. That quest for perfection often leaves us unhappy and, frankly, un-well. We recognize room for improvement yet there is always something at odds with our intention: time, focus, desire, energy.....it's always something, isn't it? We all have our personal quest to bring those dots closer to the edge of the diagram, or where we think we will achieve ultimate happiness and peace. Our clothes will fit perfectly, we will be bouncing around the halls with boundless energy tossing our children up in the air joyfully like they are pancakes. All while being mentally stable, without any stress and singing our favorite Pharell tune. But what if we were to stop being so hard on ourselves and take a really positive look at where we are now. The people who were asked to take this survey are successful business people juggling beautiful families and great careers.

                                I am Kevin Rhodes 
                                and I am a
                                


                                Get to Know Me
                            












                            I'm so happy you're visiting_


                            I designed this site so you can get to know me on a personal level. My facination with experience design, some fun works, my photography, my blog, my favorite quotes, and so much more.
                        














                                Why I love design
                            

                                Design allows me to speak any language. Solving problems through type, space, and image is the most universal way to communicate. It's everything and anything.
                            








                                Why I love coffee
                            

                                When I sip coffee, I ponder the delicate process it took to get from a bean to my cup. From the growing, harvesting, processing, roasting, and brewing, it's truly miraculous.
                            








                                San Diego is my life
                            

                                My culture and personality have been greatly influenced by the warm currents of the Pacific Ocean. My biggest inspirations happen on San Diego's beautiful waterfront.
                            











                            What I offer_


                            These are the skills I'm most proud of
                        








Interface Design

                                To provide a good interface, I must understand the users needs. That is why I investigate projects systematically with stakeholders and constantly iterate designs.
                            







Front End Development

                                I believe in well organized CSS files, semantic HTML, and pixel perfection. This can only be achieved by a front-end developer who understands design.
                            









Visual Design

                                I rely heavily on graphic design to support how the user is going to interact with the product.  An aesthetically appealing site could make or break usability.
                            







Corporate Identity

                                While designing, I always adhere to corporate and brand guidelines, but at the same time, evolving and pushing limits to stay on the cutting edge.
                            











                            Let's get technical_


                            My interest in design started as a teenager, learning to code HTML in Notepad. I sharpened these by learning the fundamentals and principles of design. Core concepts such as gestalt psychology were fascinating. Over the last two years, I've shifted focus to UX Design. Whether I'm sketching, wireframing, prototyping, the field combines my love of psychology with my passion for design.

With 2016 upon us, everyone is posting their 2016 New Years Resolutions.  I strongly believe in setting goals, which is why I’m referring to this post as “goals” and not “resolutions.” […]

                                Favorite Quotes_


















                                                You can't connect the dots looking forward. You can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.
                                            

                                                - Steve Jobs / Apple Inc.
                                            






                                                We can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them.
                                            

                                                - Albert Einstein / Theoretical Physicist
                                            






                                                While ideas ultimately can be so powerful, they begin as fragile, barely formed thoughts, so easily missed, so easily compromised, so easily just squished.
                                            

                                                - Jonathan Ive / Apple Inc.
                                            






                                                You must have people believe in you. You have to be a leader. Even if you are unsure and insecure, don't show it. Go with strength, conviction, and confidence.
                                            

                                                - Calvin Klein / Calvin Klein Inc.
                                            






                                                You can please some of the people all of the time, you can please all of the people some of the time, but you can’t please all of the people all of the time.
                                            

                                                - Abraham Lincoln / 16th President U.S.A.
                                            






                                                To be creative means to be in love with life. You can be creative only if you love life enough that you want to enhance its beauty, you want to bring a little more music to it, a little more poetry to it, a little more dance to it.
                                            

                                                - Osho / Spiritual Teacher
