 Kathryn Hayley '84
A passion for putting the right people together
By Amy Trang
When Kathryn Hayley ’84 put together    her management team after being named CEO of Aon Consulting in 2006,   she was  looking for people with a bit of “magic.”
“It wasn’t about bringing somebody in to just fill   the  job, but someone who was going to take the duties to the next   level,” Hayley  says. “I want people who can motivate other people, who   people will look up to  and want to work with, learn from.”
 That’s not to say that the team   is made up of identical  people. Haley’s team members have a range of   leadership styles, from  extraverted to introverted, and a variety of   backgrounds, from financial to  technical. The common thread, though, is   that every team member wants to  achieve more for the company, Hayley   says.
“I built this team that was more cohesive, really    scrappy and excited about what to do at the firm,” she says. “We helped   each  other out, challenged each other and came to believe that we could   accomplish anything  together.”
 Those polished teamwork skills   were put to the test in  July, when Hayley was named to the integration   team that oversaw Aon’s  acquisition of human resources firm Hewitt   Associates in a $4.9 billion deal.  After she was named CEO of Aon   Hewitt Consulting, Americas, Hayley looked to  create similar dynamics   on her new leadership team.
“As part of pulling these two firms together, we   took  the same care in selecting a diverse group of people who would   work well  together as a team and build the next chapter for our firm,”   Hayley says. “We  are creating a foundation that serves our clients   better than our predecessor  firms.”
 Prior to joining Aon, Hayley   spent 21 years with  Deloitte Consulting, where she served as the   Midwest regional managing director  and helped grow Deloitte’s   operations in India. She also led the firm’s  financial services   practices in the Americas.
 Through the years,  Hayley has   acquired extensive experience building teams that devise unique    solutions to complex issues. Her teams’ successes range from developing    clearing and trading systems for exchanges that are still in use 20   years after  implementation, to replacing all the systems for a Fortune   250 firm in one day.  
 Hayley takes risks in bringing   in members who, at first  glance, might not be obvious choices. She   recalls a young, inexperienced team  member who “proved to be a good   team player and problem solver” and another who  “may not have always   made friends, but had the background and instincts to make  the (Fortune   250 firm) project a tremendous success.”
“It’s not just the technical skills and the   experience  that I look at — it’s about drive, critical thinking,   character,” Hayley says.  “I think the dynamic that a person brings to   the group is just as important as  the technical skills.”
 That approach has paid   dividends. Over the course of her  tenure as CEO of Aon Consulting, the   company’s pre-tax income grew an average  of 19 percent per year over   the last five years, and the firm has had the  highest margins in the   industry. 
 Hayley predicts that dynamic   teams will be critical to  Aon Hewitt’s continued success as the largest   human resources and human capital  consulting firm in the world.
“It’s an exciting chance to  build and create something really new,”   Hayley says. “Along with that comes  responsibility. How can we continue   to invest in ways that have a meaningful  impact for clients? How do we   continue to grow our global footprint and  continue to serve our   middle-market clients and our large clients? It’s just  full of   opportunities for us.”
