								Search Funds							





RHV has invested in 40 Search Funds since 2008. RHV has several investments in operating companies acquired by our Search Funds, and we regularly have 10 to 15  Search Funds actively seeking to acquire an operating business.
A Search Fund is a pool of capital raised to financially support the efforts of an entrepreneur, or a team of entrepreneurs, to locate a privately held company to acquire. Acquisitions are primarily financed by capital provided by the search fund investors.
RHV has the capacity to invest up to $4 million in a subsequent search fund acquisition. We have no minimum investment size, and the investment size is determined based on the Search Fund’s governing documents.
RHV can bring debt financing to the table through existing banking relationships and through HV Capital Investors, LLC, which is controlled by RHV’s investors. HVCI has a long track record of lending into the lower middle market, which includes providing loans to support search fund acquisitions.
Our Principals have a unique blend of experience that provides a basis to add value to operating companies acquired by Search Funds. That experience includes Board of Directors (public and private), owner-manager, operations, finance, information technology, banking and investment banking. RHV’s Principals are prepared to serve on the Board of Directors of the companies acquired, if requested by the search fund entrepreneur.
RHV Capital has investments in the following active Search Funds:

The relationship between Rameez Ansari and Steve Lau started more than a decade back when both were students at the University of Toronto.
They then went their separate ways — Ansari to study at Stanford and Lau at Wharton and both to work outside Canada — before returning to Canada where they became reacquainted: They have now joined forces to form Highland Creek Partners, the country’s newest search fund. The fund, so named because it’s a street name near the campus they attended, has raised seed capital from individual and institutional investors and is now seeking an acquisition, a process that could take up to two years.
“We have funding for the next two years. And we can call on capital from the group of investors for the acquisition,” said Ansari, whose website details the individual and corporate investors. John Hunkin and Paul Rogers, former senior executives at CIBC in Toronto and New York respectively, are two notable Canadian investors.
While Hunkin is a first time search fund investor, Rogers is a veteran. His firm RHV Capital has invested in 40 search funds. Rogers said the decision to invest is based on understanding the “motivations” of the entrepreneurs behind the search fund. “It is a risky thing to do and we want to ensure that they have thought through all of the pros and cons.
Next, we try to assess if they could actually run a business,” said Rogers, adding he has seen Lau in action. “He tackled a tough strategic issue with insight and precision. Rameez is a remarkable individual having been an entrepreneur in Pakistan prior to going to Stanford.” But more importantly, Rogers said, they are “both humble guys who want to continually listen and learn.”
And both want to be more than investors: they want to run a business – the second element to the search fund model. “We both have a passion for operations,” said Lau. Added Ansari: “Our aspiration is to run a company.”
Search funds raise capital a little differently from other investment funds. The capital raising occurs in two rounds with the first raise earmarked to run an office and allow Ansari and Lau to seek out an acquisition; and the latter round to fund the purchase of a business.
As is the norm with any private company there is a mark-up between the price paid by the initial investors — who have rights of first refusal when an acquisition is presented to them — and all subsequent investors.
To find the acquisition, Ansari, who worked with Boston Consulting Group, and Lau, who has worked with CPP Investment Board and TD Securities, will use two approaches: they will call on middle-men (lawyers and accountants with contacts in the private company world) and from their own research into industries they like.
The targets will be chosen because of their industry, business and financial characteristics: as well, the owner must be seeking a way to reduce his role in the company. A typical target would have $5 million — $50 million in revenue, be profitable with steady cash flows and not overly complex. “Industry growth is the key,” said Ansari, “because macro dominates micro.”
Search funds started at Stanford about four decades back but until recently, hadn’t made much of dent in Canada. Now there are at least two handfuls of such investment firms, a number of which have bought business and are now running them.
