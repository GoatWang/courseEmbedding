Formulating the Future of Cannabis


 
 
 
 
 
 



MISSIONMedPharm is a phytopharmaceutical  and intellectual property holding company that has been created to develop innovative cannabis products, using accepted pharmaceutical formulation techniques, to reliably produce identifiable and replicable dosage forms for human use. 
 
 

VISIONMedPharm will lead the industry in developing products to improve the human condition and better the lives of those who suffer from disease. It is MedPharm’s intent to position itself to have safe, reliable, proven products ready for Phase I formulations when such trials become available.
 
 

OBJECTIVEScale and implement a state-based production laboratory model to test, create and produce pharmaceutical-type cannabis, using intellectual property or proprietary formulations and methods for a variety of dosage forms.
 
 
 
 



OPERATION MODEL/SCIENCE METHODOLOGY
To provide cannabis pharmaceutical-type products using current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) that would include pre-formulation, formulation development, small scale commercial manufacturing, analytical method development and validation, routine quality control analysis, and stability studies.
To create pharmaceutical dosage forms and produce ingredients utilizing pharmaceutical technology to be used in the delivery of cannabis extracts. The goal is to provide a reliable clinical effect through the use of well-crafted and well-researched oil analytics and dosage forms.
 
 
 


MedPharm is not making specific therapeutic claims. The use of the term pharmaceutical, pharmaceutical grade, pharmaceutical dosage forms, etc. are indicative of the process by which new formulation products will be created with the intent of accurately identifying the active ingredients and the amount of each in each dosage form using best practices associated with traditional pharmacy formulations. MedPharm is seeking to take existing anecdotal evidence and through its own formulation process further identify which cannabis varieties and strains are best suited to which disease states.

Dr. Nelson began his career with Kemin in 1980 as director of research and development (R&D); however, since 1993, he has served as president of Kemin. Distinguished among the company’s many commercial and scientific advances is the fact that Kemin pioneered the process of isolating and purifying the antioxidant molecule lutein for human consumption in supplements and fortified foods. Researchers have identified lutein as playing a central role in human eye health, specifically in reducing risk of age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of adult blindness. Over 60 million people consume lutein daily through multivitamins or concentrated lutein supplements. Under his leadership at Kemin, the company has more than quadrupled in size and now employs nearly 2,000 people.

				VetRXDirect			



VetRxDirect. Caring for Pets. Supporting Vets.
At VetRxDirect we’re animal lovers and veterinary experts. And, like you, we’re always looking for ways to save time and money. That’s why our founder, a long-time, trusted Midwestern veterinarian, started VetRxDirect. He knows pet owners want an affordable, convenient way to buy pet medications. But none of the online pharmacies met his standards for quality and for honoring the foundation of the veterinary profession: the doctor-client-patient relationship.
That relationship is at the heart of VetRxDirect. We don’t take the place of your vet: Your veterinarian is always your first—and best—resource for advice. Instead, we work with your veterinarian to ensure your pet receives the right medication and care. Unlike other online pharmacies, we only fill prescriptions approved by your veterinarian.
