                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other
variations as are required or permitted by this Indenture, and may
have such letters, numbers or other marks of identification and
such legends or endorsements placed thereon as may, consistently
herewith, be determined by the officers executing such Notes, as
evidenced by their execution of the Notes. Any portion of the text
of any Note may be set forth on the reverse thereof, with an
appropriate reference thereto on the face of the Note.

 

Definitive Notes shall

any combination of these methods (with or without steel engraved
borders), all as determined by the officers executing such Notes,
as evidenced by their execution of such Notes.

 

Each Note shall be dated
the date of its authentication. The terms of the Notes are the
terms of this Indenture.

 

Section
2.02.         
Execution, Authentication and Delivery . The Notes shall be
executed on behalf of the Issuer by any of its Authorized Officers.
The signature of any such Authorized Officer on the Notes may be
manual or facsimile. Notes bearing the manual or facsimile
signature of individuals who were at any time Authorized Officers
of the Issuer shall bind the Issuer, notwithstanding that such
individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior
to the authentication and delivery of such Notes or did not hold
such offices at the date of such Notes.

 

The Indenture Trustee
shall, upon Issuer Order, authenticate and deliver for original

$350,000,000 of Class A-1 Notes, (ii) $384,000,000 of Class A-2

Section
2.03.         
Temporary Notes . Pending the preparation of Definitive
Notes pursuant to Section 2.11, the Issuer may execute, and upon
receipt of an Issuer Order the Indenture Trustee shall authenticate
and deliver, temporary Notes that are printed, lithographed,
typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, of the tenor of
the Definitive Notes in lieu of which they are issued and with such
variations not inconsistent with the terms of this Indenture as the
officers executing such Notes may determine, as evidenced by their
execution of such Notes.

 

If temporary Notes are
issued, the Issuer shall cause Definitive Notes to be prepared
without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of Definitive
Notes, the temporary Notes shall be exchangeable for Definitive
Notes upon surrender of the temporary Notes at the office or agency
of the Issuer to be maintained as provided in Section 3.02, without
charge to the related Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of
any one or more temporary Notes, the Issuer shall execute, and the
Indenture Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange
therefor, a like tenor and principal amount of Definitive Notes of
authorized denominations. Until so exchanged, the temporary Notes
shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this
Indenture as Definitive Notes.

 

Section
2.04.          Note
Register, Registration of Transfer and Exchange . The Issuer
shall cause to be kept a register (the “ Note Register
”) in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may
prescribe, the Issuer shall provide for the registration of Notes
and the registration of all transfers of Notes. The Indenture
Trustee initially shall be the “Note Registrar” for the
purpose of registering Notes and transfers of Notes as herein
provided. Upon any resignation of any Note Registrar, the Issuer
shall promptly appoint a successor or, if it elects not to make
such an appointment, assume the duties of Note
Registrar.

 

If a Person other than
the Indenture Trustee is appointed by the Issuer as Note Registrar,
the Issuer will give the Indenture Trustee prompt written notice of
the appointment of such Note Registrar and of the location, and any
change in the location, of the Note Register, and the Indenture
Trustee shall have the right to inspect the Note Register at all
reasonable times and to obtain copies thereof, and the Indenture
Trustee shall have the right to rely upon a certificate executed on
behalf of the Note Registrar by an Executive Officer thereof as to
the names and addresses of the Holders of the Notes and the
principal amounts and number of such Notes.

 

Upon surrender for
registration of transfer of any Note at the office or agency of the
Issuer to be maintained as provided in Section 3.02, provided that
the requirements of Section 8-401 of the UCC are met, the Issuer
shall execute, and the Indenture Trustee shall authenticate and the
Noteholder shall obtain from the Indenture Trustee, in the name of
the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Notes of
the same Class in any authorized denominations, of a like aggregate
principal amount.

 





11








 




 

At the option of the
Holder, Notes may be exchanged for other Notes of the same Class in
any authorized denominations, of a like aggregate principal amount,
upon surrender of the Notes to be exchanged at such office or
agency. Whenever any Notes are so surrendered for exchange,
provided that the requirements of Section 8-401 of the UCC are met
(as determined by the Issuer), the Issuer shall execute, and the
Indenture Trustee shall authenticate and the Noteholder shall
obtain from the Indenture Trustee, the Notes which the Noteholder
making the exchange is entitled to receive.

 

All Notes issued upon
any registration of transfer or exchange of Notes shall be the
valid obligations of the Issuer, evidencing the same debt, and
entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Notes
surrendered upon such registration of transfer or
exchange.

 

Every Note presented or
surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall be duly
endorsed by, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer
in form satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee duly executed by, the
Holder thereof or such Holder’s attorney duly authorized in
writing, with such signature guaranteed by an “eligible
guarantor institution” meeting the requirements of the Note
Registrar, which requirements include membership or participation
in the Securities Transfer Agent’s Medallion Program (“
STAMP ”) or such other “signature guarantee
program” as may be determined by the Note Registrar in
addition to, or in substitution for, STAMP, all in accordance with
the Exchange Act.

 

No service charge shall
be made to a Holder for any registration of transfer or exchange of
Notes, but the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee may require payment
of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge
that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer
or exchange of Notes, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 2.03
or 9.06 not involving any transfer.

 

The preceding provisions
of this Section notwithstanding, the Issuer shall not be required
to make and the Note Registrar need not register transfers or
exchanges of Notes selected for redemption or of any Note for a
period of 15 days preceding the due date for any payment with
respect to the Note.

 

Section
2.05.         
Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Notes . If (i) any
mutilated Note is surrendered to the Indenture Trustee, or the
Indenture Trustee receives evidence to its satisfaction of the
destruction, loss or theft of any Note, (ii) there is delivered to
the Indenture Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required
by it to hold the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee harmless and
(iii) the requirements of Section 8-405 of the UCC are met, then,
in the absence of notice to the Issuer, the Note Registrar or the
Indenture Trustee that such Note has been acquired by a Protected
Purchaser, the Issuer shall execute, and upon its written request
the Indenture Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in exchange
for or in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen
Note, a replacement Note of the same Class; provided, however, that
if any such destroyed, lost or stolen Note, but not a mutilated
Note, shall have become or within seven days shall be due and
payable, or shall have been called for redemption, instead of
issuing a replacement Note, the Issuer may pay such destroyed, lost
or stolen Note when so due or payable or upon the Redemption Date
without surrender thereof. If, after the delivery of such
replacement Note or payment of a destroyed, lost or stolen Note
pursuant to the proviso to the preceding sentence, a Protected
Purchaser of the original Note in lieu of which such replacement
Note was issued presents for payment such original Note, the Issuer
and the Indenture Trustee shall be entitled to recover such
replacement Note (or such payment) from the Person to whom it was
delivered or any Person taking such replacement Note from such
Person to whom such replacement Note was delivered or any assignee
of such Person, except a protected purchaser, and shall be entitled
to recover upon the security or indemnity provided therefor to the
extent of any loss, damage, cost or expense incurred by the Issuer
or the Indenture Trustee in connection therewith.

 





12








 




 

Upon the issuance of any
replacement Note under this Section, the Issuer or the Indenture
Trustee may require the payment by the Holder of such Note of a sum
sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may
be imposed in relation thereto and any other reasonable expenses
(including the fees and expenses of the Indenture Trustee or the
Note Registrar) connected therewith.

 

Every replacement Note
issued pursuant to this Section in replacement of any mutilated,
destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall constitute an original
additional contractual obligation of the Issuer, whether or not the
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall be at any time
enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of
this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other
Notes duly issued hereunder.

 

The provisions of this
Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all
other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or
payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes.

whose name any Note is registered (as of the day of determination)
as the owner of such Note for the purpose of receiving payments of
principal of and interest, if any, on such Note and for all other
purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Note be overdue, and none
of the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee or any of their respective
agents shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

Rate in any lawful manner. The Issuer may pay such defaulted
interest to the Persons who are Noteholders on a subsequent special
record date, which date shall be at least 5 Business Days prior to

any such special record date and related payment date, and, at
least 15 days before any such special record date, the Issuer shall

this Indenture requires or permits actions to be taken based upon
instructions or directions of Holders of Notes evidencing a
specified percentage of the Outstanding Amount, the Clearing Agency
shall be deemed to represent such percentage only to the extent

and/or Clearing Agency Participants owning or representing,
respectively, such required percentage of the beneficial interest
in the Notes and has delivered such instructions to the Indenture
Trustee.

 

Section
2.10.

Trustee nor the Administrator is able to locate a qualified
successor, (ii) the Administrator at its option advises the
Indenture Trustee in writing that it elects to terminate the

occurrence of an Event of Default or a Servicer Default, Owners of
Book-Entry Notes representing beneficial interests aggregating at
least a majority of the Outstanding Amount of such Notes advise the
Indenture Trustee and the Clearing Agency Participants through the
Clearing Agency, in writing that the continuation of a book-entry
system through the Clearing Agency is no longer in the best
interests of such Note Owners, then, in each case, the Indenture
Trustee shall notify all Note Owners of the related Class of Notes
through the Clearing Agency of the occurrence of any such event and
of the availability of Definitive Notes of the related Class of
Notes to Note Owners requesting the same. Upon surrender to the
Indenture Trustee of the Note or Notes representing the Book-Entry
Notes by the Clearing Agency, accompanied by registration
instructions, the Issuer shall execute and the Indenture Trustee
shall authenticate the Definitive Notes in accordance with the
instructions of the Clearing Agency. None of the Issuer, the Note
Registrar or the Indenture Trustee shall be liable for any delay in
delivery of such instructions and may conclusively rely on, and
shall be protected in relying on, such instructions. Upon the
issuance of Definitive Notes of a Class, the Indenture Trustee
shall recognize the Holders of the Definitive Notes as Noteholders
hereunder.

represented in writing to the Indenture Trustee that either (i) it
is not a Benefit Plan or any other plan subject to a law that is
substantially similar to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the
Code (“Similar Law”) and is not acting on behalf of or
investing the assets of a Benefit Plan or any other plan subject to
Similar Law or (ii) its acquisition, holding and disposition of the
Definitive Note will not give rise to a nonexempt prohibited
transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code
because it will be covered by a United States Department of Labor
prohibited transaction class exemption or by some other applicable
statutory or administrative exemption and will not cause a
nonexempt violation of any Similar Law. Any Person that acquires a
beneficial interest in a Book-Entry Note with the assets of a
Benefit Plan or any other plan subject to Similar Law shall be
deemed to make the same representations as set forth above in this

Collection Account (to be transferred to the Note Distribution
Account on the related Payment Date) an aggregate sum sufficient to

held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto, and
(unless the Paying Agent is the Indenture Trustee) shall promptly
notify the Indenture Trustee in writing of its action or failure so
to act.

 

The Issuer will cause
each Paying Agent other than the Indenture Trustee to execute and
deliver to the Indenture Trustee an instrument in which such Paying
Agent shall agree with the Indenture Trustee (and if the Indenture
Trustee acts as Paying Agent, it hereby so agrees), subject to the
provisions of this Section, that such Paying Agent will:

 

(i)          hold
all sums held by it for the payment of amounts due with respect to

any time during the continuance of any such default, upon the
written request of the Indenture Trustee, forthwith pay to the

Agent;

 

(iv)        immediately
resign as a Paying Agent and forthwith pay to the Indenture Trustee
all sums held by it in trust for the payment of Notes if at any
time it ceases to meet the standards required to be met by a Paying
Agent at the time of its appointment; and

 

(v)         comply
with all requirements of the Code with respect to the withholding
from any payments made by it on any Notes of any applicable
withholding taxes imposed thereon and with respect to any
applicable reporting requirements in connection
therewith.

 

The Issuer may at any
time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge
of this Indenture or for any other purpose, by Issuer Order direct
any Paying Agent to pay to the Indenture Trustee all sums held in
trust by such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Indenture
Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which the sums were held
by such Paying Agent; and upon such payment by any Paying Agent to
the Indenture Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all
further liability with respect to such money.

 

Subject to applicable
laws with respect to escheat of funds, any money held by the
Indenture Trustee or any Paying Agent in trust for the payment of
any amount due with respect to any Note and remaining unclaimed for
two years after such amount has become due and payable shall be
discharged from such trust and be paid to the Issuer on Issuer
Request; and the Holder of such Note shall thereafter, as an
unsecured general creditor, look only to the Issuer for payment
thereof (but only to the extent of the amounts so paid to the
Issuer), and all liability of the Indenture Trustee or such Paying
Agent with respect to such trust money shall thereupon cease;
provided, however, that the Indenture Trustee or such Paying Agent,
before being required to make any such repayment, shall at the
expense and written direction of the Issuer cause to be published
once, in a newspaper published in the English language, customarily
published on each Business Day and of general circulation in The
City of New York, notice that such money remains unclaimed and
that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than
30 days from the date of such publication, any unclaimed balance of
such money then remaining will be repaid to or for the account of
the Issuer. The Indenture Trustee shall also adopt and employ, at
the expense and written direction of the Issuer, any other
reasonable means of notification of such repayment (including, but
not limited to, mailing notice of such repayment to Holders whose
Notes have been called but have not been surrendered for redemption
or whose right to or interest in monies due and payable but not
claimed is determinable from the records of the Indenture Trustee
or of any Paying Agent, at the last address of record for each such
Holder).

 

Section
3.04.

existence, rights and franchises as a statutory trust under the
laws of the State of Delaware (unless it becomes, or any successor
Issuer hereunder is or becomes, organized under the laws of any
other State or of the United States, in which case the Issuer will
keep in full effect its existence, rights and franchises under the
laws of such other jurisdiction) and will obtain and preserve its

Protection of Owner Trust Estate . The Issuer intends the
security interest Granted pursuant to this Indenture in favor of
the Indenture Trustee on behalf of the Noteholders to be prior to

the benefit of the Indenture Trustee on behalf of the Noteholders,
a first lien on and a first priority, perfected security interest
in the Owner Trust Estate. The Issuer will from time to time
execute and deliver all such supplements and amendments hereto and

Section
3.07.         
Performance of Obligations; Servicing of Receivables
.

 

(a)          The
Issuer will not take any action and will use its best efforts not
to permit any action to be taken by others that would release any
Person from any of such Person’s material covenants or
obligations under any instrument or agreement included in the Owner
Trust Estate or that would result in the amendment, hypothecation,
subordination, termination or discharge of, or impair the validity
or effectiveness of, any such instrument or agreement, except as
expressly provided in this Indenture, the other Basic Documents or
such other instrument or agreement.

 

(b)          The
Issuer may contract with other Persons to assist it in performing
its duties under this Indenture, and any performance of such duties
by a Person identified to the Indenture Trustee in an
Officer’s Certificate of the Issuer shall be deemed to be
action taken by the Issuer. Initially, the Issuer has contracted
with the Servicer and the Administrator to assist the Issuer in
performing its duties under this Indenture.

 

(c)          The
Issuer will and will cause the Administrator to, punctually perform
and observe all of its obligations and agreements contained in this
Indenture, the other Basic Documents and in the instruments and
agreements included in the Owner Trust Estate, including but not
limited to filing or causing to be filed all UCC financing
statements and continuation statements required to be filed by the
terms of this Indenture and the other Basic Documents in accordance
with and within the time periods provided for herein and therein.
Except as otherwise expressly provided therein, the Issuer shall
not waive, amend, modify, supplement or terminate any Basic
Document or any provision thereof without the written consent of
the Indenture Trustee or the Holders of at least a majority of the
Outstanding Amount or such greater percentage as may be specified
in the particular provision.

 

(d)          If
the Issuer shall have knowledge of the occurrence of a Servicer
Default, the Issuer shall promptly provide written notice to a
Responsible Officer of the Indenture Trustee and to the
Administrator thereof, and shall specify in such notice the action,
if any, the Issuer is taking with respect of such default. If a
Servicer Default shall arise from the failure of the Servicer to
perform any of its duties or obligations under the Sale and
Servicing Agreement with respect to the Receivables, the Issuer
shall take all reasonable steps available to it to remedy such
failure. The Administrator shall, in accordance with Section
1.02(c) of the Administration Agreement, make such notice available
to each Rating Agency.

(e)          As
promptly as possible after the giving of notice of termination to
the Servicer of the Servicer’s rights and powers pursuant to
Section 7.01 of the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Indenture
Trustee shall appoint a Successor Servicer, and such Successor
Servicer shall accept its appointment by a written assumption in a
form acceptable to the Indenture Trustee. In the event that a
Successor Servicer has not been appointed and accepted its
appointment at the time when the Servicer ceases to act as
Servicer, the Indenture Trustee without further action shall
automatically be appointed the Successor Servicer. The Indenture
Trustee may resign as the Servicer by giving written notice of such
resignation to the Issuer and in such event will be released from
such duties and obligations, such release not to be effective until
the date a new servicer enters into a servicing agreement as
provided below. Upon delivery of any such notice to the Issuer, the
Issuer shall obtain a new servicer as the Successor Servicer under
the Sale and Servicing Agreement. Any Successor Servicer other than
the Indenture Trustee shall (i) be an established financial
institution having a net worth of not less than $50,000,000 and
whose regular business includes the servicing of motor vehicle
receivables and (ii) enter into a servicing agreement with the
Issuer and the Seller having substantially the same provisions as
the provisions of the Sale and Servicing Agreement applicable to
the Servicer. If within 30 days after the delivery of the notice
referred to above, the Issuer shall not have obtained such a new
servicer, the Indenture Trustee may appoint, or may petition a
court of competent jurisdiction to appoint, a Successor Servicer.
In connection with any such appointment, the Issuer may make such
arrangements for the compensation of such successor as it and such
successor shall agree, subject to the limitations set forth below
and in the Sale and Servicing Agreement, and in accordance with
Section 7.02 of the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Issuer and
the Seller shall enter into an agreement with such successor for
the servicing of the Receivables (such agreement to be in form and
substance satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee). If the Indenture
Trustee shall succeed to the Servicer’s duties as servicer of
the Receivables as provided herein, it shall do so in its
individual capacity and not in its capacity as Indenture Trustee
and, accordingly, the provisions of Article Six shall be
inapplicable (except as set forth in the proviso contained in
Section 6.01(a)) to the Indenture Trustee in its duties as the
successor to the Servicer and the servicing of the Receivables. In
case the Indenture Trustee shall become successor to the Servicer
under the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Indenture Trustee shall
be entitled to appoint as Servicer any one of its Affiliates or
agents, provided that it shall be fully liable for the actions and
omissions of such Affiliate or agent in such capacity as Successor
Servicer.

 

(f)          Upon
any termination of the Servicer’s rights and powers pursuant
to the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Issuer shall promptly
notify a Responsible Officer of the Indenture Trustee. As soon as a
Successor Servicer is appointed, the Issuer shall notify the
Indenture Trustee of such appointment, specifying in such notice
the name and address of such Successor Servicer.

properties or assets of the Issuer, including those included in the
Owner Trust Estate, unless directed to do so by the Indenture
Trustee;

 

(ii)         claim
any credit on, or make any deduction from the principal or interest
payable in respect of, the Notes (other than amounts properly
withheld from such payments under the Code or applicable state law)
or assert any claim against any present or former Noteholder by
reason of the payment of the taxes levied or assessed upon any part
of the Owner Trust Estate;

 





21








 




 

(iii)        (A)
permit the validity or effectiveness of this Indenture to be
impaired, or permit the lien created by this Indenture to be
amended, hypothecated, subordinated, terminated or discharged, or
permit any Person to be released from any covenants or obligations
with respect to the Notes under this Indenture except as may be
expressly permitted hereby, (B) permit any lien, charge, excise,
claim, security interest, mortgage or other encumbrance (other than
the lien of this Indenture) to be created on or extend to or
otherwise arise upon or burden the Owner Trust Estate or any part
thereof or any interest therein or the proceeds thereof (other than
tax liens, mechanics’ liens and other liens that arise by
operation of law, in each case on any of the Financed Vehicles and
arising solely as a result of an action or omission of the related
Obligor) or (C) permit the lien created by this Indenture not to
constitute a valid first priority (other than with respect to any
such tax, mechanics’ or other lien) security interest in the
Owner Trust Estate; or

 

(iv)        dissolve
or liquidate in whole or in part.
