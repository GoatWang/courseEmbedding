Experience Art and Design, Inc. Announces a Deal to Acquire the Revenue Generating Subsidiary of Bahamas Development Corp.Tweet

BDCI – Operating subsidiary has annualized revenues of over $2.4 million 

LAS VEGAS, NV - June 20, 2017 - InvestorsHub NewsWire - Experience Art & Design, Inc. (OTC: EXAD) and Bahamas Development Corp. (OTC: BDCI) have agreed to merge the operating subsidiary of BDCI into EXAD.  

The transaction will be completed via a Triangular Reverse Merger once the audit in completed on the financials of the subsidiary.  BDCI will offer its shareholders the opportunity to voluntary exchange their shares of BDCI for shares of EXAD.  

The current officers and Board members of BDCI, Eugene Caiazzo and Gary Brown will assume the same positions in EXAD, all current officers and Board members of EXAD shall resign.

BDCI has an operating subsidiary in the Performance Wear Sector generating $2.4 million on an annualized run rate.  BDCI recently purchased the assets of Native Outfitters with revenues of $1 million annually and is in the process of completing its purchase of the assets of Incite Brands with revenues of $1.4 annually.  

About Native Outfitters (www.NativeOutfitters.com)
 
Native™.  - Native Outfitters already has established distribution channels in the U.S. and Caribbean, as well as excellent supply chain relationships. Target sectors for Native performance apparel include the U.S. Government, Outdoor Retailers, Specialty Retailers, and many of the World’s Leading Resorts. Clients include, but are not limited to, NASA, Ron Jon, Ritz-Carlton, Marriott, The Breakers, and many other leading international hotel chains and resorts as well as an extensive list of “Exclusive Clients”.
The Native team currently services several hundred accounts; initiatives are underway to greatly expand this list. The current facility in West Palm Beach, FL has an in-house art department, and the ability to process, print, and ship over 1,300 shirts per week.

Native has an exclusive agreement with its vendor for a proprietary blend Anti-Snag SPF50+ Sun Protection fabric that automatically renews every three years.  Anti-Snag sun shirts are most popular for outdoor enthusiasts who enjoy boating fishing, and other outdoor sports. Native offers other complementary lines including camp shirts, short sleeve shirts, and a line of shorts.
BDCI’s subsidiary has obtained a loan and credit line from a major retail banking lender to fund the acquisition of Native Outfitters. The acquisition, including initial working capital, has been personally guaranteed by BDCI's President and will not result in any dilution or toxic debt to the Company.
About Incite Performance Wear (www.IncitePerformanceWear.com)
 
BDCI has not completed the final closing on the assets of Incite Brands and does not intend to until the new quarter.
 
The IPW manufacturing assets will be integrated into BDCI’s Apparel Brands and Manufacturing operations, including its recently acquired Native Outfitters Performance Apparel Company. 
The IPW acquisition allows BDCI to capitalize on significant synergies through the alignment of production operations in Incite’s manufacturing facilities. The optimization of manufacturing capacity provides strong infrastructure to support the Company’s growth. The acquisition enables BDCI to achieve enhanced purchasing leverage of raw materials and consolidation of its labor force, which greatly reduces manufacturing costs. 
During and after the integration of IPW, Incite Brands will continue to support BDCI with Sales and Marketing support. 
 
IPW is a full package cut and sew with dye sublimation printing company, that manufactures custom private-branded 100% moisture wicking polyester performance wear shirts with UPF 40 Sun Protection. The Company’s manufacturing process is very unique and unlike most apparel companies its shirts are ‘Made in the USA’. What makes the company different from others, is the way that it manufactures their performance shirts. Incite sources fabric in from its supplier mills, cuts it to size and dye sublimate prints the individual pieces of the shirt before the shirt is sewn together. This enables the company to deliver very high quality, seamless, ‘Made in the USA’ performance shirts that are competitively priced. IPW manufactures both private label and branded performance apparel for many industries that include: Fishing, Marine, Agricultural, Hospitality, Team Sports, Outdoor Activewear, Military and many Non-Profit Organizations and Charities.
