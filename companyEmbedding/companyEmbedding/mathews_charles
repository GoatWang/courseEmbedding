Mathews, P & Hunt, Charles 1838 The Trial of Bill Burn Engraving - SoldAfter P Mathews, The Trial of Bill Burn, 1838 Charles Hunt, engraver & Ackerman & Co Printer.The original painting was probably painted for Lady Lyttleton of Hagley 
Hall. Burns was found beating his donkey and the Trial of Bill Burns was the first prosecution under the 1822 Martin's 
Act for cruelty to animals. 
The prosecution was brought by Richard Martin, MP for Galway, also known
 as Humanity Dick. The case was particularly memorable as he brought the 
donkey into court. In the print, a copy of the Martin Act bill is behind the donkey's hind 
legs, suggesting that it is 'asinine'. Also, the name given to the donkey's owner, 'Bill Burn', is a play on what the 
satirist thinks should be done with Martin's law. Ackermann & Co. was a prominent British  publisher and printseller  founded by Rudolph Ackermann (1764-1834), trading as Ackermann &  Co. from 1829 to 1859.The print is framed and glazed.Dimensions of the framed print: 765mm x 618mmCondition: Very good for age. There is very slight foxing and a small water stain to the bottom margin. The frame could do with some small repairs - see photographs for detailed condition.Delivery: Delivery is free within the UK.
