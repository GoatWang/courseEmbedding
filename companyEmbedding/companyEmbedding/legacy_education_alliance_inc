"I have never met a group of people so interested in my success. I learned more in my three-day basic than in all my college education. There is no fluff, it's all meat."-Karen M.        St. Louis, MO"I actually will retire from the Army in four years, but after looking at what my pension plan was going to be I realize I can barely live on the money that we're living on now and how am I going to live on less than half of what I'm living on now and in four years? So it gave me a real sense of urgency to really take control and do things now actually before I retire."-Joseph M.      Hazelton, PA"I will recommend taking these classes to increase your level of knowledge to make educated decisions as a Real Estate Investor."-Jennifer M.        Burbank, CA"I would definitely recommend these courses to others and have done so already. I want others to change their lives for the better as I am. The education and people this program has given me has been invaluable."-Ben-Gassendi S.       Robbins, IL"I have been in the mortgage and real estate industry for over 30 years but never learned what I’m learning now."-Lucy B.          Mississauga, ON









Symposium Experience


                        Symposium Calendar
                      









We deliver our live, industry-leading elite trainings using a symposium model.
Click here for our Symposium Calendar
Eleven months out of the year, we hold a live, immersive conference at a hotel in a major city in the US. We move the event to different cities to ensure we include the major regions of the country. On average, upwards of 300 students attend each symposium.
Our symposiums provide an exciting atmosphere conducive to accelerated learning and practical instruction. Symposiums offer an unmatched selection of specialized instruction in the areas of real estate investing, financial instruments investing and entrepreneurship. (Please check our Symposium calendar for a list of the specific courses being offered at each event.)
Typically, 7 intensive classes are offered at each Symposium. Each class is led by an experienced trainer selected because of their knowledge and practical experience in their area of expertise. Students receive in-depth training with roughly 18 hours of total classroom instruction. Plenty of time is given to answering questions and one-on-one interaction with the instructors.
Special guests and noted experts are often invited to conduct additional sessions. These special trainings are held during lunch breaks, after hours and occasionally a day before the official start of the Symposium.
One of the most powerful elements of the Symposium experience is the ability for students to network, create mastermind groups and develop friendships with like-minded individuals.
Success as an investor and entrepreneur is a journey. Our goal at Legacy Education is to help you each step of the way.
