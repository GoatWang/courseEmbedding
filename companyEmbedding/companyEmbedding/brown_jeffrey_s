So far, Dr. Jeffrey Brown is a master when it comes to doing a full work up on endocrine diagnostics! He is thorough, thoroughly thorough and then some!! I've been getting results that have changed my life! He's been in practice forever and knows his stuff in a way I truly appreciate! Thank you also, to the entire office!







RECEPTIONIST RUDE ! RUDE! RUDE!RUDE! RUDE!!!!! We are looking for another doctor because of his Staff. The attitude at this office is  the worst I have ever seen. He will lose patience because of this It is sad that his staff is so ugly . Looking for new doc







"I don't understand the negative reviews. I find Dr. Brown extremely courteous and professional. He is very thorough and gives very precise prescriptions. He alters dosages based on my latest bloodwork. His staff is equally as good. I highly recommend him.







Dr. Brown is an endocrinologist. Although his office is very busy, it doesn't mean he is a great one. So far, one thing I can appreciate him is that he diagnosed me with Hypothyroidism this July. However, the drug he prescribed me isn't working great. I had a super hard time getting hold of the nurses there. I will have a follow-up visit with him by the end of September. If he is unwilling to give me another brand of drug, I will never go back to him again. It is taking me sometime to seek a great endocrinologist. If anyone knows of a great one, please let me know.







I have found my experience to be very enjoyable. Not only is Dr. Brown great with a casual and not intimidating bedside manner but his entire staff has been nothing but friendly and courteous. I fly out from San Francisco to work with him and am very pleased with my experience so far.







I was not even able to make an appointment because the person that answered the phone was so incredibly RUDE.

So far, Dr. Jeffrey Brown is a master when it comes to doing a full work up on endocrine diagnostics! He is thorough, thoroughly thorough and then some!! I've been getting results that have changed my life! He's been in practice forever and knows his stuff in a way I truly appreciate! Thank you also, to the entire office!







RECEPTIONIST RUDE ! RUDE! RUDE!RUDE! RUDE!!!!! We are looking for another doctor because of his Staff. The attitude at this office is  the worst I have ever seen. He will lose patience because of this It is sad that his staff is so ugly . Looking for new doc







"I don't understand the negative reviews. I find Dr. Brown extremely courteous and professional. He is very thorough and gives very precise prescriptions. He alters dosages based on my latest bloodwork. His staff is equally as good. I highly recommend him.







Dr. Brown is an endocrinologist. Although his office is very busy, it doesn't mean he is a great one. So far, one thing I can appreciate him is that he diagnosed me with Hypothyroidism this July. However, the drug he prescribed me isn't working great. I had a super hard time getting hold of the nurses there. I will have a follow-up visit with him by the end of September. If he is unwilling to give me another brand of drug, I will never go back to him again. It is taking me sometime to seek a great endocrinologist. If anyone knows of a great one, please let me know.







I have found my experience to be very enjoyable. Not only is Dr. Brown great with a casual and not intimidating bedside manner but his entire staff has been nothing but friendly and courteous. I fly out from San Francisco to work with him and am very pleased with my experience so far.







I was not even able to make an appointment because the person that answered the phone was so incredibly RUDE.

        Q: Brown and Jeffrey s, a West Midlands business, makes one standard product for use in the motor trBrown and Jeffrey s, a West Midlands business, makes one standard product for use in the motor trade. The product, known as the Fuel Miser, for which the business holds the patent, when fitted to the fuel system of production model cars has the effect of reducing petrol consumption. Part of the production is sold direct to a local car manufacturer, which fits the Fuel Miser as an optional extra to several of its models, and the rest of the production is sold through various retail outlets, garages, and so on. Brown and Jeffrey s assemble the Fuel Miser, but all three components are manufactured by local engineering businesses. The three components are codenamed A, B and C. One Fuel Miser consists of one of each component .The planned sales for the first seven months of the forthcoming accounting period, by channels of distribution and in terms of Fuel Miser units, are as follows:JanFebMarAprMayJuneJulyManufacturers4,0004,0004,5004,5004,5004,5004,500Retail, and so on2,0002,7003,2003,0002,7002,5002,4006,0006,7007,7007,5007,2007,0006,900The following further information is available:1 There will be inventories of finished units at 1 January of 7,000 Fuel Misers.2 The inventories of raw materials at 1 January will be:A 10,000 unitsB 16,500 unitsC 7,200 units3 The selling price of Fuel Misers is to be £10 each to the motor manufacturer and £12 each to retail outlets.4 The maximum production capacity of the business is 7,000 units a month. There is no possibility of increasing this output.5 Assembly of each Fuel Miser will take 10 minutes of direct labour. Direct labour is paid at the rate of £7.20 an hour during the month of production.6 The components are each expected to cost the following:A £2.50B £1.30C £0.807 Indirect costs are to be paid at a regular rate of £32,000 each month.8 The cash at the bank at 1 January will be £2,620.The planned sales volumes must be met and the business intends to pursue the following policies for as many months as possible, consistent with meeting the sales targets:· Finished inventories at the end of each month are to equal the following month’s total sales to retail outlets, and half the total of the following month’s sales to the motor manufacturer.· Raw materials at the end of each month are to be sufficient to cover production requirements for the following month. The production for July will be 6,800 units.· Suppliers of raw materials are to be paid during the month following purchase. The payment for January will be £21,250.· Customers will pay in the month of sale, in the case of sales to the motor manufacturer, and the month after sale, in the case of retail sales. Retail sales during December were 2,000 units at £12 each.Required: Prepare the following budgets in monthly columnar form, both in terms of money and units (where relevant), for the six months of January to June inclusive:(a) Sales budget.*(b) Finished inventories budget (valued at direct cost).†(c) Raw materials inventories budget (one budget for each component).†(d) Production budget (direct costs only).*(e) Trade receivables budget.†(f) Trade payables budget.†(g) Cash budget.†* The sales and production budgets should merely state each month’s sales or production in units and in money terms.

County Names New Director of Health and Human Services Department

November 23, 2013
Placer County has selected the head of Nevada County’s health agency to take over as Director of the Placer County Health and Human Services Department. 
Jeffrey S. Brown, Director of the Nevada County Health and Human Services Agency since 2005, was appointed to his new post by Placer County Executive Officer David Boesch in consultation with the Board of Supervisors.  
Brown will succeed Dr. Richard J. Burton, who plans to retire soon after serving as Placer County’s Public Health Officer for the past 17 years. A decade ago, Dr. Burton took over as Director of Health and Human Services while continuing to serve as Public Health Officer.
“I have no doubt that Jeff will do an outstanding job at Health and Human Services,” said Board of Supervisors Chairman Jim Holmes, a member of the panel that interviewed finalists. “Placer County used a broad recruitment process that presented us with an exceptional group of finalists. That made our final decision difficult, but ensured we would wind up with a top-notch administrator well versed in overseeing the many types of services offered by Health and Human Services.”   
“Jeff stood out, because he has a long, impressive track record of leadership, innovation and community engagement in both small and large counties. His background and leadership style make him a great match for Health and Human Services.”
Placer County will appoint a new Public Health Officer at a later date.
In his new job, Brown will oversee a department with a Fiscal Year 2013-14 budget of more than $173 million. The department provides a broad range of services to more than 60,000 clients each year. It is organized into several interrelated operating systems that employ over 700 full time professional and technical staff, and partner with local businesses and provider organizations to provide cost-effective and innovative health and social services. The department’s wide array of services includes:

Crisis and emergency services for children and adults;
Medical and dental clinics;
Public health services such as communicable disease control, emergency preparation and response; 
Child Welfare Services and other programs for children;
Adult Protective Services;
Mental health programs;
Substance abuse and treatment services;
Assistance for needy families and individuals, including financial, food and nutrition, employment, and healthcare coverage;
Restaurant inspections and other environmental health programs; and
Animal adoptions, dog and cat licensing and a variety of other animal services.

The department’s services are available throughout the county and it has offices in Auburn, Roseville, Rocklin, Lincoln and the North Lake Tahoe area. In many cases, services are offered on-site in other communities as well.
In Nevada County, Brown is responsible for an agency that oversees several departments and divisions, including Public Health, Behavioral Health, Social Services, Child Support Services, Collections, Veterans Services, and Housing and Community Development. He served as Executive Director of the Nevada County Housing Authority from 2005-2011. 
Brown has worked with Placer County on several regional initiatives, including a drive to recruit foster parents and shared funding of mental health efforts in the Tahoe-Truckee region. 
Before his arrival in Nevada County, Brown worked for 11 years with Alameda County. From 1999 to 2005, he was Director of Community Health Services in Alameda County’s Public Health Department.
Brown’s past experience also includes work with nonprofit health agencies in Guatemala, Honduras and Malawi and service as a Peace Corps volunteer in Honduras.
Brown received his bachelor’s degree in civil engineering from the University of California at Davis and master’s degrees in both public health and social welfare from the University of California at Berkeley.
He resides in the Nevada City area with his wife and two daughters. 
Brown will be paid a salary of approximately $191,000 and receive other management benefits. He will start his new job on Dec. 30.
