Portrait of Juan Enríquez Cabot at PopTech 2012


Juan Enríquez Cabot (born 1959)[1] is a Mexican-American academic, businessman, and speaker.[2] He is Managing Director of Excel Venture Management, and is a best-selling author.
Biography[edit]
Enríquez is the son of Mexican politician Antonio Enríquez Savignac. His mother was Marjorie Cabot Lewis of the Boston Cabot family.[3]
He is the founding director of the Life Sciences Project at Harvard Business School, and a fellow at Harvard's Center for International Affairs.[4] His work has been published in Harvard Business Review, Foreign Policy, Science, and The New York Times. He is the author of numerous books, including Evolving Ourselves: How Unnatural Selection and Nonrandom Mutation are Changing Life on Earth (Current-Penguin Group, 2015); Homo Evolutis: Please Meet the Next Human Species (TED, 2012); As the Future Catches You: How Genomics & Other Forces are Changing Your Life, Work, Health & Wealth (Crown Business, 2005); and The United States of America: Polarization, Fracturing, and Our Future (Random House, 2005). He works in business, science, and domestic/international politics.
Juan Enríquez is recognized as one of the world's leading authorities on the economic and political impacts of life sciences. He is currently Chairman and CEO of Biotechonomy LLC, a life sciences research and investment firm.[5]
He has published several key articles, including "Transforming Life, Transforming Business: the Life Science Revolution," co-authored with Ray Goldberg, which received a McKinsey Prize in 2000 (2nd place). He co-authored the first map of global nucleotide data flow, as well as HBS working papers on "Life Sciences in Arabic Speaking Countries," "Global Life Science Data Flows and the IT industry," "SARS, Smallpox, and Business Unusual," and "Technology, Gene Research and National Competitiveness." Harvard Business School Interactive picked Juan as one of the best teachers at HBS and showcased his work in its first set of faculty products.
The Harvard Business Review showcased his ideas as one of the breakthrough concepts in its first HBR List. Fortune profiled him as "Mr. Gene." The Van Heyst Group asked him to co-organize the life sciences summit commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the discovery of DNA. The summit "The Future of Life" was sponsored by Time. Seed picked his ideas as one of fifty that "shaped our identity, our culture, and the world as we know it."
Enríquez serves on a variety of boards including Cabot Corporation, Zipongo, ShapeUp, Synthetic Genomics, The Harvard Medical School Genetics Advisory Council, The Chairman's International Council of the Americas Society, the Visiting Committee of Harvard's David Rockefeller Center, Tufts University's EPIIC, TED's Brain Trust, Harvard Business School's PAPSAC, WGBH, and the Museum of Science (Boston).
Enríquez was part of a world discovery voyage led by J. Craig Venter, who sequenced the human genome. The multi-stage sailing voyage sampled microbial genomes throughout the world's oceans. This expedition involved a number of institutions and top scholars including The Institute for Genomic Research, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, The Explorers Club, and Prof. E. O. Wilson. It led to the discovery of an unprecedented number of new species.
Enríquez served as CEO of Mexico City's Urban Development Corporation, Coordinator General of Economic Policy and Chief of Staff for Mexico's Secretary of State, and as a member of the Peace Commission that negotiated the cease-fire in Chiapas' Zapatista rebellion.[6][7]
He is a Harvard graduate, where he earned a B.A. (1981)[8] and an MBA (1986), with honors.

Este es el texto de Juan Enríquez Cabot, editorialista de Reforma que no fue publicado el lunes:

“Respeto…”
Por Juan Enríquez Cabot
Reforma, jueves 18 de julio, 2013
Difícil encontrar en el periodismo tres gentes con métodos, usos y costumbres mas opuestas a Isabel Arvide, Julio Scherer y Ramón Alberto Garza, el cómo se conducen, que hacen, con quienes conviven, que encuentran aceptable, o no… Probablemente los horrorice verse nombrados en la misma columna, y quizás en este periódico, por lo cual les pido, de antemano, disculpas a los tres.
No estoy de acuerdo con todo lo que han hecho, escrito, o a veces sus métodos. Pero es extraordinaria su valentía, durante décadas, enfrentando y balconeando algunos de los asuntos más duros que ha vivido, y vive, el país. Por eso respeto a los tres, aun conociendo su profunda, como diría un cura, “humanidad.” Tenemos un mejor país porque, por algún milagro, los tres siguen vivos. Hay muchos que escriben, opinan, embrujan con palabras, fugas de información, o acceso al poder. Hay, por fortuna, cada vez más que denuncian, balconean, se burlan, exhiben las fallas y peripecias del poder. Pero son o bien pocos, los que tocan, año tras año, los cuatro temas más peligrosos que puede tocar la tinta: el alto mando militar, la policía federal/ procuraduría, el narco, y la vida personal y familiar del Presidente en funciones.
A su manera, a su estilo, con su propio punto de vista, aliados, fuentes, perspectiva, Arvide, Scherer y Garza se han jugado una y otra vez la vida, exponiendo, exhibiendo, explicando, denunciando hasta el filito mismo de donde se sufre un accidente, una desaparición, un asesinato. Porque lo que tocan es lo más delicado de lo que no se discute en México. Nombran, dan hechos, citas y documentos. Se meten a las cárceles y entrevistan. Denuncian cuando se tiene poder, siguen investigando y denunciando después. No quitan el dedo.
Hay pocas gentes con los pantalones y astucia para enfrentar, tocar, osar publicar lo que han hecho estos tres. No es que estén de acuerdo, que sean amigos, que escriban lo mismo. Al contrario. Muchas veces lee uno lo escrito por uno y contradice absolutamente lo escrito por otro. Pero al entrevistar a los narcos en sus casas, al acostarse o emborrachase con varios generales, al denunciar de frente a los más poderosos, meterse en los barrios más oscuros, recibir infinidad de pitazos y denuncias, cada uno, a su manera, con propio estilo, lentes y prejuicios, van dejando testigo y huella de la historia más compleja de México.
Hemos de agradecerles lo que hacen porque es cada vez más peligroso escribir, denunciar, iluminar. No muchos publicarían un libro como Mis Generales, que detalla las intimidades, recovecos, honores, cuestionamientos, usos y costumbres del poder militar. Poder que se esparce cada vez más, y que es cada vez más importante entender. Antes de este libro no había, en un lugar, tanta anécdota, transparencia, intimidad, sobre lo bueno, valiente, trágico, y corrupto de los individuos que mas mando tienen en el país.
Antes de que Scherer se metiera, en los setentas y ochentas, no había muchos que de manera sistémica y constante denunciaran, exploraran, explicaran las redes de los narcos más poderosos del país, o las peripecias de EL Señor Presidente… Ramón Alberto, nacido, por fortuna, en época anterior a las medicinas contra el síndrome de déficit de atención, usa su peripatética energía co pariendo  Reforma, Reporte Índigo, y ahora un periódico. A diario se pelea a muerte con amigos, enemigos, poderosos, y peligrosos explicando, en detalle, quien usa poder para que fin. Cada uno de los tres, deja pedacitos, migajas, pistas, realidades, y verdades que seguirán entreteniendo a historiadores durante décadas. Porque no hay mucho lugar donde encontrar gran y constante historial de denuncias contra los más altos niveles, en torno a lo más peligroso que se puede tocar en el país. Cuando algún estudiante de doctorado quiera entender lo que paso en cuartel militar, comandancia de policía, agencia de seguridad y justicia, entre los criminales más peligrosos, con y sin charola, con y sin fuero, con y sin grandes títulos, puestos y apellidos, tendrán que leer, comparar, contrastar, triangular y criticar lo escrito por estos tres y unos cuantos más.
Arvide, PRIsta a muerte, da cuenta de las reglas usos y costumbres desde muy, muy adentro del aparato. Scherer, antiPRIista, desnuda desde afuera. Ramón Alberto maneja la tecnología, bases de datos y triangulaciones de innumerables telefonazos estableciendo nuevos métodos y estilos de comunicación. Seguramente hay múltiples equivocaciones, alianzas y denuncias erróneas. Pero lo que no van a encontrar críticos son muchas fuentes adicionales que denunciaron durante décadas, porque hay temas que son mortales… Y es precisamente por eso, entendiendo que son más que humanos, con lo bello y lo trágico metido bajo la piel, que estas tres figuras tan distintas merecen respeto y admiración. Los seguiré leyendo con atención, cierto temor por sus vidas, y, espero, suficiente escepticismo paro poder triangular las complejas realidades que dibujan… 😉
