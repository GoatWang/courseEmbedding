Spot 1.9.10 Released on 14 February 2009.
This release is a bug release, fixing a collection of bugs reported over the past month. One major change is the removal of the automatic update feature. The library I was using did not work as well as I wanted and I felt it was annoying people so it has been removed. I will be re-writing this function over the next few weeks.

New Computer Line-up announced
SDR users now have four computers specifically designed and tested, component by component, for optimum performance.
A new computer designed for small operating spaces, RVs, dxpeditions, etc., is available. The Incredible Small-Form-Factor Computer has the power to run Flex-3000s and 1500s with a low power-consumption footprint.
The new "King of the Hill" is The Ultimate Op Computer. This is a crazy-powerful machine, powered by Intel's i7-3930 6-core, 12-hyperthread CPU which blows the lid off of benchmarks. Connect up to 6 monitors and know you have a machine that your son/grandson will tell his friends about!
The premium The Dx'ers Dream Computer is using the Intel i7-2600 CPU, which is the most performant versus cost processor Intel has ever produced. This dream machine will meet all of your needs for many years in the future.
A new Entry Level Computer rounds out the new line-up of SDR computers. Sporting the powerful AMD Phenom II X6 965 4-core CPU, you will comfortably drive all Flex radios at an incredible price.
All systems now use Windows 7 64 bit operating systems.
Spot 1.9.12 enters beta test
Spot version 1.9.12 is available for beta testing. This version fixes the incorrect headings and some small bugs. The main bug remaining is with alarm notifications.
Send email to K3NC if you would like to test!

Ultimate Op Computer 
Details 




This is the Ultimate, the top-of-the-line, best computer on the market period! If you must have the best, this is it guaranteed! Your teenage son will talk about this one to his friends.
 Intel's incredible i7-6950K 8-core, 16 hyperthreaded CPU running at 3.2GHz is the engine behind the muscle. This is simply the fastest consumer-based CPU that Intel sells. 32GB of fast DDR4-2400 memory means you can load this baby up and never see it slow down due to memory.If you like a quiet computer, this system will leave you breathless. The nvudia GTX-1080 video will astonish and amaze you. Using a Corsair Carbide super-quiet case and low noise fans ensures that you can hear anything right next to this system.
What makes this system perform better than other systems is the complimentary, specifically-chosen components chosen as the "best of breed" in their category.
There are very few options available for this configuration because we have already put them all in!
