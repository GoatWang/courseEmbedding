Developing Disruptive Therapeutics for the Treatment of Pancreatic Diseases 












Compelling preclinical study resultsPreclinical studies have shown that SBP-101 produces superior anti-tumor activity in human cancer cell lines compared to gemcitabine or nab-paclitaxel, alone or in combination, standard of care chemotherapy drugs used to treat pancreatic cancer.Sun BioPharma’s novel approachThe Company believes that SBP-101 will have a distinct advantage over current pancreatic cancer* therapies in that it specifically targets the exocrine pancreas and can cause ablation, or pharmaceutical resection, of the acinar cells, as well as the primary and metastatic pancreatic cancer, while leaving the insulin-producing islet cells and most non-pancreatic tissue unharmed.  Most current cancer therapies (including chemotherapy, radiation or surgery) are associated with significant side effects that further reduce the patient’s quality of life.

Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas affects approximately 337,000 people worldwide annually including nearly 45,000 in the United States, 104,000 in western Europe, 3,030 in Australia and 28,000 in Japan. It is the 4th leading cause of death from cancer in the US, and the 7th leading cause of cancer death in Europe. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) represents approximately 95% of all pancreatic cancers, with a 5-year survival rate of approximately 6%. Considering that the median overall survival for previously untreated patients with good performance status is between 8.5 months and 11.1 months with the best available treatment regimens, effective treatment for PDA remains a major unmet medical need.The diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is usually delayed because the initial clinical signs and symptoms are vague and non-specific. By the time the diagnosis is made, the cancer often is locally advanced or metastatic (usually to regional lymph nodes, liver, lung and peritoneum), and is seldom amenable to surgical resection with curative intent. The most common presenting symptoms include weight loss, epigastric and/or back pain, and jaundice. The back pain is typically dull, constant, and of visceral origin radiating to the back, in contrast to the epigastric pain which is vague and intermittent. Less common symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, and glucose intolerance.Currently, surgical resection offers the only potentially curative therapy, but since most patients have disease that is unresectable at the time of diagnosis, cure is unlikely. The prognosis for these patients is poor and most die from complications related to progression. The mainstay of treatment for metastatic disease is chemotherapy. Current chemotherapy treatment regimens vary from single agent gemcitabine and various gemcitabine combinations to the multi-drug FOLFIRINOX (leucovorin [folinic acid], fluorouracil, irinotecan and oxaliplatin) regimen, which is frequently supplemented with white blood cell (WBC) growth factors. These treatments deliver to selected patients with good performance status median survival benefits ranging from 7 weeks to 4 months versus controls of gemcitabine alone.  Clearly, more effective treatments for unresectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma are needed. SBP-101 is being proposed as a novel chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

Sun BioPharma, Inc. Announces Completion of the Fifth Patient Cohort in the Dose Escalation Phase 1A Study of SBP-101 for Pancreatic Cancer
Jun 7 17
Sun BioPharma, Inc. announced completion of the fifth patient cohort in the dose-escalation phase of the Company’s Phase 1 clinical study using SBP-101 to treat patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). Phase 1a Trial Update: After review of the fifth cohort patients by the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) it has been determined to dose the next cohort at a lower dose level in order to approach the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of SBP-101. Based on Company analysis of the safety and efficacy data from 25 patients in Cohorts 1-5, direction from the DSMB and per the approved protocol for this Phase 1a study, the next cohort of patients will consist of three patients treated at the same dose level of Cohort 4. Patients are currently being recruited for this next cohort and one patient has completed the first cycle of dosing. It is expected that this cohort of patients will be completed by August 2017. Of the 25 patients enrolled through May 15, 2017, all but one patient had received at least two prior chemotherapy regimens. In addition to assessment of safety, 20 of the 25 patients were evaluable for preliminary signals of efficacy prior to or at the eight-week conclusion of their first cycle of treatment using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (“RECIST”). Six of the 20 patients (30%) had Stable Disease (SD) and 14 of 20 (70%) had Progressive Disease (PD). It should be noted that of the 14 patients with PD, six came from Cohorts 1 and 2 and are considered to have received less than potentially therapeutic Total Cumulative Doses of SBP-101. 24 of the 25 patients had follow-up blood tests measuring the Tumor Marker CA 19-9 associated with PDA. Nine of these patients (38%) had reductions in the CA 19-9 levels, as measured at least once after the baseline assessment. Seven of the remaining 15 patients showing no reduction in CA 19-9 came from Cohorts 1 and 2. The best response outcome and survival observed was in eight patients who received Total Cumulative Doses approximately equivalent to those of Cohorts 3 and 4. As noted above, Cohort 4 is being expanded to enroll an additional 3 patients as part of the process to determine the MTD. Seven of the eight patients in this group were evaluable for preliminary signs of efficacy at eight weeks by RECIST. Three patients (38%) had Stable Disease at week eight and four patients (57%) had reductions in the CA19-9 levels, as measured at least once after the baseline assessment. Median survival in this group was 4.1 months. Six patients (75%) have exceeded 3 months of overall survival (OS), 4 have exceeded 4 months of OS and at least 2 patients have exceeded 6 months of OS, with some patients continuing to be followed for survival.

Sun BioPharma, Inc. Reports Unaudited Consolidated Earnings Results for the First Quarter Ended March 31, 2017
May 11 17
Sun BioPharma, Inc. reported unaudited consolidated earnings results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. For the quarter, the company reported operating loss of $1,994,000 compared to $975,000 a year ago. Loss before income tax benefit was $5,725,000 compared to $939,000 a year ago. Net loss was $5,573,000 compared to $824,000 a year ago. Basic and diluted net loss per share was $0.17 compared to $0.03 a year ago. Net cash used in operating activities was $1,072,000 compared to $542,000 a year ago. The net cash used in each of these periods primarily reflects the net loss for these periods, and was partially offset by the effects of changes in operating assets and liabilities. In the three months ended March 31, 2017, the net loss is also offset by non-cash charges recorded for the loss on induced debt conversion and share-based compensation.

Next Cohort of Patients Initiates Pathway to Determining Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)Summary Data of First Five Cohorts Show Efficacy SignalsMINNEAPOLIS, June  07, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sun BioPharma, Inc. (OTCQB:SNBP), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing disruptive therapeutics for the treatment of pancreatic diseases, today announced completion of the fifth patient cohort in the dose-escalation phase of the Company’s Phase 1 clinical study using SBP-101 to treat patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA).Phase 1a Trial UpdateAfter review of the fifth cohort patients by the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) it has been determined to dose the next cohort at a lower dose level in order to approach the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of SBP-101. Based on Company analysis of the safety and efficacy data from 25 patients in Cohorts 1-5, direction from the DSMB and per the approved protocol for this Phase 1a study, the next cohort of patients will consist of three patients treated at the same dose level of Cohort 4. Patients are currently being recruited for this next cohort and one patient has completed the first cycle of dosing. It is expected that this cohort of patients will be completed by August 2017.“We are encouraged by the results we are seeing in this Phase 1a study as well as  our progress in determining the MTD at this stage,” said David B. Kaysen, President and CEO of Sun BioPharma. “Determining the MTD is the goal of any Phase 1a study which will allow us to proceed with the next phase of the clinical development of SBP-101.”Review of Top-Line Interim Data“We have done a preliminary review of the patients that have been enrolled in Cohorts 1-5 of the study and are encouraged by the results we are seeing in these heavily pre-treated patients,” commented Suzanne Gagnon, M.D., Sun BioPharma’s Chief Medical Officer. “We are observing a dose-response effect on target tumor burden.”Of the 25 patients enrolled through May 15, 2017, all but one patient had received at least two prior chemotherapy regimens. In addition to assessment of safety, 20 of the 25 patients were evaluable for preliminary signals of efficacy prior to or at the eight-week conclusion of their first cycle of treatment using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (“RECIST”). Six of the 20 patients (30%) had Stable Disease (SD) and 14 of 20 (70%) had Progressive Disease (PD).

Three patients (38%) had Stable Disease at week eight and four patients (57%) had reductions in the CA19-9 levels, as measured at least once after the baseline assessment. Median survival in this group was 4.1 months. Six patients (75%) have exceeded 3 months of overall survival (OS), 4 have exceeded 4 months of OS and at least 2 patients have exceeded 6 months of OS, with some patients continuing to be followed for survival.David Kaysen commented, “Although this is a safety study, the review of this efficacy data is encouraging to all of us involved, especially when considering the stage of disease and extent of pre-treatment these patients had at the time of enrollment into the study. We are enthusiastic about moving forward to determine the MTD and to begin the next phase of the clinical trial. Again, we deeply appreciate all of the clinicians, and especially the patients, who have participated as we continue to assess SBP-101’s impact on pancreatic cancer.”About SBP-101SBP-101 is a first-in-class, proprietary, polyamine compound designed to exert therapeutic effects in a mechanism specific to the pancreas. Sun BioPharma originally licensed SBP-101 from the University of Florida in 2011. The molecule has been shown to be highly effective in preclinical human pancreatic cancer models, demonstrating superior activity to existing FDA-approved chemotherapy agents. Combination therapy potential has also been shown for pancreatic cancer. SBP-101 is expected to differ from current pancreatic cancer therapies in that it specifically targets the exocrine pancreas and has shown efficacy against primary and metastatic disease in animal models of human pancreatic cancer. Therefore management believes that SBP-101 may effectively treat both primary and metastatic pancreatic cancer, while leaving the insulin-producing islet cells and non-pancreatic tissue unharmed.About Sun BioPharmaSun BioPharma Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing disruptive therapeutics for urgent unmet medical needs. The Company’s development programs target diseases of the pancreas, including pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer; the Company’s initial product candidate is SBP-101 for the treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer. SBP-101 was invented by Raymond Bergeron, Ph.D., a Distinguished Professor Emeritus at the University of Florida. Sun BioPharma has scientific collaborations with pancreatic disease experts at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, the University of Miami, the University of Florida, the Mayo Clinic Scottsdale, the Austin Health Cancer Trials Centre in Melbourne, Australia and the Ashford Cancer Centre in Adelaide, Australia.
