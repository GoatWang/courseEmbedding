 These are the cutters that started it all and made Bush Hog a household name. From economy cutters for small tractors to heavy-duty shredding mowers for row crops and pastures, all are made in America and built to last. Decks are designed to eliminate trash build-up and water traps. Full swivel tail wheel(s) provide height adjustment, and blade pans furnish protection from field hazards.
The new Bomford Tri-Wing offers cutting widths of 4.6m or 6m, designed for operation in wide open spaces this versatile machine will transport through 3m. A sprung loaded deck, its choice of blade configurations and Bomfords unrivalled quality speak for themself.
Bush Hog's entire line of multi-spindle rotary cutters is designed for heavy crop clearing, pasture maintenance, and other big jobs that require a durable, reliable machine. With cutting widths from 8 to 15 feet, and a range of hitch types and mounting options, these machines are built to withstand extreme duty and provide superior performance and productivity with minimal maintenance for many, many years. Available in cutting widths from 12 to 20 feet, Bush Hog Flex Wings are legendary for their performance, durability and longevity. Wings float independently over uneven terrain for a uniform cutting appearance. So whether you're maintaining a rolling pasture or orchard, or clearing heavy crops or overgrown roadsides, you'll find a model that meets your needs and matches your tractor.
The Schulte 5026® Rotary Cutter has the widest cutting field available today - 26'2" - to go through material faster, scatter cuttings better, finish jobs quicker than any rival. And its 200 HP gearbox runs cool even in hot weather.
Tiger's Twin Rotary cuts roadside mowing jobs down to size quickly. Its side mounted and rear mowers can be used individually or simultaneously, providing varied mowing options. No clutch, u-joints or v-belt mean no costly breakdowns for the rugged rear mowing unit.
Innovative and productive, the series of Rhino Turbo FinishingMowers provide an extremely smooth cut and professional results in many turf mowing applications. Features include mowing widths ranging from 60" up to 100", the deepest decks in the industry for greater air movement, a unique height adjustment design that makes adjustment easier than before, a three-point hitch that is quick hitch compatible for easy hook-up, and fast blade tip speeds for a clean cut.
The Rhino FL15 Nitro was built for heavy-duty commercial, industrial and agricultural mowing. You can see this in a range of features missing from many of its competitors - including flexible wings, 5" inch diameter cutting capacity, precision American made gearboxes and drivetrain..
Versatile and powerful rotary mowing equipment is also available from other Alamo Group manufacturers, including Herder, Alamo Industrial and Terrain King.

                        About us
                    


Industrial DivisionPleasing both government and commercial users of vegetation maintenance equipment is a challenge. Our solution: aggressive R&D and innovations that improve the productivity and efficiency of our tractor- and truck-mounted mowers, as well as trimmers, shredders, sweepers, excavators, vacuum trucks, snow removal equipment and other products.Agricultural DivisionWe serve the agricultural equipment market with proven technologies, a broad product line, and some of the strongest brand names around. Innovations are especially notable in our ag-based mowers, loaders, backhoes, tillers, post hole diggers, and sod-cutting equipment —as well as our after-market parts operations.European DivisionAs a group of companies, Alamo Group Europe is already a market leader in both the industrial and agricultural fields. The reason: solid lines of conventional hedge and grass cutters, backhoes, mowers and cultivators—plus mower innovations that set new industry standards for speed and effectiveness.





                        Our History
                    


Founded in 1969, Alamo Group is a leader in the design, manufacture, distribution and service of high quality equipment for infrastructure maintenance, agriculture and other applications.

About Us   >  Alamo Industrial

  
The foundation of Alamo Industrial® began in 1969 with Alamo Group's acquisition of 
Engler Manufacturing Company, the developers of the first wide-swath flex-wing mowers
known as Terrain King®.  Next came the Slopemower®, the original hydraulic boom mower.  
In 1983, Mott® Corporation was purchased, the inventor and leading manufacturer of flail mowing equipment.  
Triumph Machinery Company®, the only United States manufacturer of hydraulic sickle-bar equipment, was 
acquired in early 1984.  These companies combined are represented in what is now known as Alamo Industrial®, 
the market leader in the right-of-way vegetation management industry and the right choice for your vegetation 
control needs.  Our longevity combined with our commitment to innovation, quality, and extensive product line 
cuts the competition down to size.




Alamo Industrial® has been here for over four decades, but more importantly we'll be here tomorrow.  Our largest customers are like you, government agencies and contractors that perform services such as highway and grounds vegetation maintenance and land-clearing.  We know that our customers aren't interested in taking risks. And only an established company like Alamo Industrial® can promise you a superior level of experience and assure our presence in the future to service your needs.




Why are we innovative?  It is simple; we listen to our customers.  That is why we take an aggressive approach to product development and expansion.  We are constantly looking for ways to make your job easier and to give you the tools you need to work more efficiently.  The joystick control on the boom mower and the BuzzBar® sawhead are just two of many novel features that Alamo Industria has pioneered.
