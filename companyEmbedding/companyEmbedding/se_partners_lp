What To Expect From Capital Product Partners LP’s (CPLP) Earnings In Next 12 Months?



Michael Canly 


            				April 28, 2017			        


 Capital Product Partners LP (NASDAQ:CPLP) may see a decline of -1.7% over the next 12 months if analysts’ estimates will turn out to be correct. However, investors must be concerned whether it’s just a hiccup or a long-term trend. I’m going to look at the latest data and analyse the future of this stock in more detail. View our latest analysis for Capital Product Partners 
Troubled times ahead?
 CPLP is covered by 8 analysts who by consensus are expecting a 26.1% increase in earnings over the next 3 years. This would see the EPS rise to $0.48 levels which would no doubt please investors who are used to an average of $0.34 over the past few years. 
 

 Capital Product Partners (NasdaqGS:CPLP) Past Future Earnings Apr 28th 17
 
                     This will project the annual earnings to levels higher than recent years. 
 In the same period we will see the revenue grow from $241 Million to $282 Million in 2019 and profit is predicted to reduce slightly from $51 Million to $50 Million in 2019, during this period margins are on track to be a respectable 18% . 
Is there any basis for growth?
 Capital Product Partners has underperformed the Energy industry over the past year. 
 Capital Product Partners’s Return on Equity of 5.6% leaves a lot to be desired and to make things worse this is below the industry average of 7.07%. These low performance levels are expected to continue unfortunately with the ROE in a few years around 5.5%.


 Capital Product Partners (NasdaqGS:CPLP) Future Perf Apr 28th 17


 Return on equity (ROE) is a measure of how much profit (net income) a company makes as a percentage of the shareholders equity. Equity is made up of funds from the original issuing of shares and any retained earnings from previous financial years. It varies considerably across sectors, for this reason it is important to asses a stocks ROE relative to its industry. Whilst it is true that the higher the ROE the better the company is performing, ROE does have a weakness. A stock with a disproportionate amount of debt can lead to a small equity base. Thus, a small amount of net income (the numerator) could still produce a high ROE off a modest equity base (the denominator). For this reason investors should always consider the debt situation in conjunction with ROE. 
Conclusion
 Capital Product Partners may have a few turbulent years in front of it but despite (or maybe because of) that it could still be offering an interesting investment opportunity. I recommend you see our latest FREE analysis to find out!

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
