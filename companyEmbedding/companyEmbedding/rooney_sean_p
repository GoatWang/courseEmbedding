Job Details
               Climatech was founded in 1972 by Mitchell Taback. Specializing in the installation and service of residential equipment, the company spent most of the 1970s filling a void of professional, quality oriented contractors in the Pittsburgh market. It was that same dedication to providing excellent service and quality workmanship that propelled Climatech into the commercial marketplace. In 2005 the company transitioned to the second generation. Brad Taback, President and CEO, has positioned Climatech to continue to move forward in the 21st Century as a leader in the markets we serve. Climatech started as, and remains today, a full service HVACR provider. We specialize in a complete range of products and services, including the design and installation of new systems, retrofits of existing systems, comprehensive maintenance programs, and unparalleled 24/7 emergency service. Our outstanding reputation in our markets comes from the dedication and commitment to excellence which is represented in all of our 150 plus employees.

If the company isn't reporting the account correctly, you can submit a dispute to the credit bureaus asking them to correct it.

If you were a grad victim you don't need to fill out a fraud package. Google it. And send it to the credit bureaus.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

Are there really companies you can pay that guarantee to raise your credit score in 2 months or less or they'll double your money back?
