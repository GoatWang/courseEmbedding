      Consistent Credit Enhancement: The cash flow distribution is a 
      sequential-pay structure. Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) is 2.75% 
      (2.50% subordination and a 0.25% reserve), unchanged from 2013-4. A 
      yield supplement account (YSA) boosts the effective WA APR, in turn 
      resulting in excess spread (XS) of 2.37% in 2014-1.
    

      Strong Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Losses on AHFC's portfolio 
      and 2010 - 2013 securitizations have stabilized and remain at 
      historically low levels, due to stronger quality originations, and 
      stable used vehicle values which have supported higher recovery rates.
    

      Stable Corporate Health: Fitch rates AHFC 'F1' and its parent Honda 
      'F1/A' with a Stable Rating Outlook. AHFC has recorded positive 
      corporate financial results in recent years, while the overall health of 
      Honda has remained strong.
    

      Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: AHFC demonstrates 
      adequate capabilities as originator, underwriter, and servicer, as 
      evidenced by historical portfolio and securitization delinquency and 
      loss performance.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of AHFC would not impair the timeliness of 
      payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case and could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch 
      evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to all classes of 
      2014-1 to increased losses over the life of the transaction. Fitch's 
      analysis found that the notes display limited sensitivity to increased 
      defaults and losses, showing no expected impact on the rating of the 
      notes under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario. The notes 
      could experience a downgrade of one rating category under Fitch's severe 
      (2.5x base case loss) scenario.
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      accompanying presale report, available at 'www.fitchratings.com'

Fitch Affirms Honda Auto Receivables 2014-1 Owner Trust | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms Honda Auto Receivables 2014-1 Owner Trust
    





February 17, 2015 05:11 PM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--As part of its ongoing surveillance, Fitch Ratings affirms three classes 
      of the Honda Auto Receivables 2014-1 Owner Trust transaction as follows:
    

      --Class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The ratings are based on available credit enhancement and loss 
      performance. The collateral pool continues to perform within Fitch's 
      expectations. Under the credit enhancement structure, the securities are 
      able to withstand stress scenarios consistent with the current ratings 
      and make full payments to investors in accordance with the terms of the 
      documents.
    

      The ratings reflect the quality of Honda Motor Co., Ltd retail auto loan 
      originations, the strength of its servicing capabilities, and the sound 
      financial and legal structure of the transaction.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      could produce loss levels higher than the current projected base case 
      loss proxy and impact available loss coverage and multiples levels for 
      the transaction. Lower loss coverage could impact ratings and Rating 
      Outlooks, depending on the extent of the decline in coverage.
    

      In Fitch's initial review of the transaction, the notes were found to 
      have limited sensitivity to a 1.5x and 2.5x increase of Fitch's base 
      case loss expectation. To date, the transaction has exhibited strong 
      performance with losses well within Fitch's initial expectations with 
      rising loss coverage and multiple levels. As such, a material 
      deterioration in performance would have to occur within the asset pool 
      to have potential negative impact on the outstanding ratings.
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representation and Warranties (R&W) of this 
      transaction can be found in 'Honda Auto Receivables 2014-1 Owner Trust - 
      Appendix'. These R&W are compared to those of typical R&W for the asset 
      class as detailed in the special report 'Representations, Warranties, 
      and Enforcement Mechanisms in the Global Structured Finance 
      Transactions' dated October 31, 2014.

Third-Party Auto Sites Continue to Lag Behind Manufacturer Sites in Overall Look and Feel


 






TrueCar Ranks Highest among Third-Party Automotive Websites, Followed by CARFAX and Cars.comNew York: 24 March 2016 — Third-party automotive websites are improving satisfaction by capturing the attention of car shoppers through increased use of the visual Web and its streamlined approach to site navigation, according to the J.D. Power 2016 Third-Party Automotive Website Evaluation Study,SM released today.The study, now in its fourth year, measures the usefulness of automotive third-party websites during the new- and used-vehicle shopping process by examining four key measures (in order of importance): information/content; appearance; navigation; and speed. Satisfaction is measured on a 1,000-point scale.While the impact of appearance on third-party auto website satisfaction has increased at a steady pace to 24% in 2016 from 21% in 2013, there exists a significant 83-point gap in satisfaction between third-party sites and manufacturer (OEM[1]) sites (742 vs. 825, respectively).  Appearance is the highest-scoring measure for auto manufacturer sites and second lowest for third-party sites.“The common bond among top-performing third-party auto sites is a heavy reliance on the ‘visual Web,’ with its very streamlined, easy-to-use site navigation features,” said Arianne Walker, senior director of marketing analytics at J.D. Power. “Expectations continue to increase not only because auto manufacturers have such visually stimulating sites but because websites in many categories have focused on enhancing visual aesthetics and easy navigation. If third-party sites want to maintain and increase their usage among shoppers, they need to consider the impact appearance has on satisfaction and continually work to improve the look and feel of the website to keep up with the ever changing expectations of shoppers.”Following are the key findings of the 2016 study:Visual Web Influences Site Preference: The study finds that the highest-scoring third-party auto websites employ heavy use of visual Web design elements such as edge-to-edge imagery, cleaner spacing and aesthetically pleasing call-to-action colors.Expert Reviews Must Cover the Basics: Content is king when it comes to satisfying shoppers on third-party sites, which includes ratings and reviews. Shoppers indicate the most important content to cover in an expert review is safety (38%), performance (24%) and functionality (11%).Satisfaction Drives Loyalty and Advocacy: The study finds that 83% of highly satisfied shoppers (overall satisfaction scores of 901 or higher) using third-party websites say they “definitely will” return to the website in the future, and 81% say they “definitely will” recommend the site, while only 3% of displeased shoppers (scores of 500 or less) say they “definitely will” return and only 2% say they “definitely will” recommend.Study RankingsIn 2016, overall satisfaction with automotive third-party websites averages 751. TrueCar ranks highest (795), followed by CARFAX (793) and Cars.com (775).The 2016 Third-Party Automotive Website Evaluation Study is based on evaluations from more than 5,000 new- and used-vehicle shoppers who indicate they will be in the market for a vehicle within the next 24 months. The study was fielded in January 2016.Websites evaluated in the study were selected based on meeting the following criteria: must be an automotive third-party site; have the ability for consumers to shop for both new and used vehicles; and be among the most frequently visited sites based on behavioral data.Media Relations ContactsJohn Tews; Troy, Mich.; (248) 680-6218; media.relations@jdpa.comFor more information about the 2016 Third-Party Automotive Website Evaluation Study, visit http://www.jdpower.com/resource/us-third-party-automotive-website-evaluation-studySee the online Press Release at http://www.jdpower.com/press-releases/2016-third-party-automotive-website-evaluation-studyAbout J.D.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
