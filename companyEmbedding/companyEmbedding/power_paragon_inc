L3 Power Paragon is a worldwide leader in the engineering, development, manufacture and integration of power conversion and distribution systems for defense, governmental and advanced industrial applications. The company’s power conversion, power conditioning and power protection solutions can be found in a wide range of demanding military and commercial environments around the world. Power technology systems from L3 Power Paragon are virtually the “service standard” for the United States Navy and many international navies. L3 Power Paragon also provides innovative airborne products to solve difficult power problems. The company’s power conversion equipment delivers reliable AC or DC power to a variety of output loads with power demands of up to 15 kVA. These devices can be found in many military and commercial fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. 
 
Medium-Voltage Motor Drive (MVMD) 
              The new MVMD's unit supports U.S. Navy high-speed generator and propulsion motors. The MVMD's modular design achieves greater efficiencies in a smaller, lighter package compatible with space and weight restrictions on surface combatant ships.
 
 


Static Automatic Bus Transfer (SABT) Switches - 50A - 400A Voltage, 3-Phase, 440 VAC or 120 VAC
                The SABT automatically transfers critical loads from a normal power source to an alternate power source in less than ¼ cycle in the event of interruption or abnormal conditions. L3 Power Paragon's SABT has been developed to protect mission-critical power loads on naval ships, submarines and other defense applications. As such, the SABT is compatible with MIL-STD-1399 and STANAG 1008.
 


Multi-Class SABT
              The MC-SABT automatically transfers critical loads from a normal power source to an alternate power source in the event of interruption or abnormal conditions. The MC-SABT was developed to protect mission critical power loads on naval ships, submarines, and other defense applications. As such, the MC-SABT is compatible with MIL-STD-1399 and STANAG 1008. Designed using silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR) power-switching elements, the MC-SABT transfers the critical load between power sources in less than 1/4 cycle upon loss of sourceâ€”more than 10 times faster than traditional electromechanical switchesâ€”appearing seamless to even the most sophisticated loads. Transfer is programmable from 1 ms to 3.5 seconds. 


Advanced Degaussing System (ADS)
                L3 Power Paragon's ADS provides controlled current to independent degaussing coils installed in the hull of a ship. The ADS provides the precise current required to generate a composite magnetic field that counteracts the effects of the ship on the earth’s magnetic field.

 
 
 
Air-Cooled Frequency Converters (ACFC) 60 Hz- 400 Hz
                L3 Power Paragon's ACFC represents the next leap forward in refined, stable and reliable power delivery to central and distributed 400 Hz systems such as weapons, fire control, ECM, sonar and avionics. Our ACFCs comply with MIL-STD-1399 requirements for Type II power and STANAG 1008, Edition 8 and are compatible with existing shipboard data busses. The ACFC family includes units with ratings of  75 kW, 100 kW, 125 kW, 150 kW, 175 kW, and NS 288 kW.

 
 
Fault Isolation Switches (FIU) 400 Hz
                With increasing growth in the sophistication of military and government electronic systems, the need to protect power distribution networks against high-current overloads and fault loads is critical for mission success. L3 Power Paragon's FIU is a unique and innovative device designed to limit the negative effects of fault loads, thereby increasing the flexibility and survivability of any power delivery system.
 


Static Transfer Switch (STS) 
                The L3 Power Paragon Static Transfer Switch is a world-recognized, fault-tolerant switch that is engineered to meet the online reliability requirements of high-speed, high-volume switches throughout the industry.

Transfers the critical load between power sources in less than ¼ cycle upon loss of primary power
Accomplishes rapid transfer without cross-connecting power sources (allows for transfer between dissimilar sources)
Precision digital sense and control circuits that do not require calibration adjustments 
Dedicated logic ensures fast and predictable operation at all times
Modular construction maximizes reliability and maintainability, separating power electronics from bypass system (front panel access allows safe load testing)

 
Series STS – High-Speed Digital Static Transfer Switch (STS-SP-208Y-150/150 Wall Mount)
                This 150-amp STS automatically transfers critical loads from a primary power source to an alternate power source in the event of interruption or abnormal conditions.
 
 


Static Transfer Switch – Static Neutral Switching
                Now, commercial and military air traffic control centers around the world can have ultra high-speed digital static transfer switches that meet the most demanding power protection standards.
 
 


Static Transfer Switch – Intelligent (STS-I)
                STS-1 automatically transfers critical loads from a primary power source to an alternate power source in the event of an interruption or abnormal conditions.
 
 
 
Transformers
                L3 Power Magnetics (PM) specializes in the manufacturing of transformers. Located in Gardena, California, L3 PM is a division of L3 Power Paragon, Inc. The L3 Power Magnetics name is synonymous with quality. From a product’s design through its installation, company engineers work closely with customers to develop magnetic solutions that will meet the application’s exact requirements.
