A large variety crabapple that will pollinate my other apples as well as produce quickly for wildlife.

BEST ANSWER: From what I can tell, it is listed as "good" for a rating as disease resistant.  I got one because it is said every orchard should have one of them.  I have had a bit of trouble on the sturdiness, so had to stake the tree due to winds.

What kind of peat to use for mulch?

BEST ANSWER: Peat is really meant to be used as a soil amendment. Straw or wood chips allow more air and water through, and are better choirces for your crabapple.

big a** crabapple
This is only the second year and while it had a couple of blooms I am not allowing it to set fruit yet. The thing that classifies an apple as a crabapple vs an apple is the size of the fruit. Crabapples are less than 2 inches in diameter and this one just makes the cut off as it is just about 2" in diameter. So it is big enough to eat fresh or use in pies, cobblers and so on. It is supposed to be exceptionally tasty so stay tuned till next year when it might give me.a.small crop

Great Value!
The year-old Chestnut Crabapple was shipped well and easy to plant.  Two years later, it is thriving and has not required intensive maintenance. I would recommend this product and this company to anyone interested in adding fruit trees to their landscaping.

Great tree & great price!
I received this tree, healthy and sturdy and planted it and it put on blooms when it was planted just 3 weeks and I decided to take the blooms off this year, so the tree could get really established, before it had to feed the fruit.  So far, I'm well pleased all around.

2017-The Chestnut crabapple survived the winter, some nights it dropped to -20/25 degrees and we are at 8000 feet in the mountains west of Denver. The snow melt was early this year, mid May, that was when the tree started to bud and is very green with lots lots of new growth-mid July.

Surviving Las Vegas
I purchased two trees last year. They are doing amazing. Lots of new branches and growth. Just waiting to see if it'll be two or three years before the produce apples. This is pretty impressive as it gets very hot here and can go below freezing as well.

Great pricing and excellence in shopping
The apple tree arrive as indicated and there n great shape. It did well over winter and had the deer not pruned it for me, I am sure it would have produced fruit this year.  These guys are great.

Very nice start.
I planted this last year and it is doing very well.  The year before I had planted a Honey Crisp and got this one for cross pollination.  The poor little Honey Crisp has been getting eaten alive by grasshoppers, no matter how I spray, but I noticed that the crabapple was left pretty much alone.  I'm glad this is a self-pollinator, I don't think the Honey Crisp is going to make it.  Very pleased with this one.

Only survivor of a record drought and heatwave
I ordered three trees and one blackberry from Stark's last year. Within a week of planting, a 2-month record-breaking heatwave and drought  arrived and crushed our mountain region of Northeast Arizona. Regardless of watering, protective cooling mulch and daily care, the Mimosa and Beach Plum and Blackberry plants died of heat shock. I thought the Chestnut Crabapple was a goner as well, but it managed to hold onto life. It amazed me!This spring after a severe pruning back of the old leader, it has sent up two new lateral, healthy baby branches.  :) I'm hoping for the best. I mourn the loss of the other trees/brambles and the very hard-earned money that bought them. Not expecting a replacement.  C'est la vie.

It is too early to rate the trees, because they have not borne fruit. They are emerging from their first winter, and appear to be growing well.

Didn't survive the winter
Looked great last summer and into the fall but did not survive the winter in zone 5. Was planted in clay. Maybe the roots were too wet? Not sure what happened.

I don't think my farm is destined to have Crabapples
I ordered a Whitney and it died, you replaced it.  I then planted both trees, they started off well, about mid summer the leaves on both turned brown and fell off.  They did not come back in the spring!  So I gave up!

About Fruit Trees



Plant fruit trees to get your favorite fruits fresh from your own backyard. Fruit trees can be planted any time of year as long as the soil is not frozen and the temperatures have not reached their peak heat. Many fruit trees are deciduous, so they lose their leaves and become dormant through the winter. Tender fruit trees, like citrus and tropical trees, can be planted in pots and brought indoors for winter protection. You can grow a wide range of fruit trees in containers, which is convenient if you can’t dedicate your yard space to growing fruit trees. Most fruit trees require another compatible variety for cross-pollination and fruit production; however, to save room and still get fruit, choose self-pollinating fruit trees. Some trees fruit within a year, while most bear fruit 2 to 4 years after planting. It takes time for the roots to get settled, but, once you taste that first piece of home-grown fruit picked perfectly ripe from the tree, it will be well worth the wait. Growing your own fruit trees has sustainable environmental benefits like filtering the air, reducing soil erosion, and attracting beneficials like bees. Choose from our wide selection of trees for the perfect addition to your fruit garden.Disease-Resistant — Grow healthier trees with minimal sprayingHeirloom — Add historical significance and diversity to your orchardIndoor — Grow fresh fruit inside your own homeMulti-Grafted — The convenience of cross-pollinating varieties on one treeStark Picks — Our easy-to-grow fruit trees

Buyer's Guide

Buyer's Guide
To ensure your growing success and satisfaction, there are a few things to consider when you buy a fruit tree.Mature Tree SizeMake sure you pick the right size tree for your available space.Dwarf Fruit Trees are perfect when space is limited; they provide an abundance of full-size fruit that can be picked without using a ladder.Semi-Dwarf Fruit Trees are medium-sized and very productive; they give you maximum fruit yield per square foot.Standard Fruit Trees are a good choice if you have plenty of space or want a multi-purpose fruit & shade tree.Proper PollinationPollination is vital to the successful production of fruit trees. Often, inadequate pollination is the reason why trees produce poorly or don’t bear fruit at all. To create the best pollination environment for your tree, make sure that you check our descriptions to see which pollinating varieties our experts recommend. Some trees are self-pollinating, which is ideal if you don’t have growing space for a second variety. If you have room, we always recommend planting another compatible variety for optimum fruit production.Zone CompatibilityYour climate plays an important role in whether a tree will produce fruit or even survive. Before ordering a fruit tree, make sure its recommended hardiness zone range includes your area.

Buyer's Guide

Buyer's Guide
To ensure your growing success and satisfaction, there are a few things to consider when you buy an apple tree.Zone CompatibilityYour climate plays an important role in whether an apple tree will be successful. Make sure the hardiness zone range of the tree you choose includes your area.Most of our apple trees grow well in zones 5-8Cold-Hardy Apple Trees can thrive in cooler, northern zones 3 & 4Heat-Tolerant Apple Trees are perfect for warm southern zones 9 & 10Proper PollinationPollination by a different apple variety is key to the success of most apple trees. Often, its absence is why trees produce poorly or don’t bear fruit. Be sure to check the description of your selection to see which pollinators our experts suggest. We do grow some Self-Pollinating Apple Trees, but we still recommend planting a second apple variety in your yard for optimum fruit production. As a note, we generally recommend planting a Golden Delicious Apple Tree within close proximity of any apple tree, because it is an excellent pollinator variety.Mature Tree SizeMake sure you pick the right size apple tree for your available space.Columnar Apple Trees mature to be about 8-10' tall, but only 18-24" wide. This makes them perfect for growing in containers on balconies and patios.Dwarf Apple Trees mature to be about 8-10' tall and wide. Even though they are smaller, they produce an abundance of full-size apples.Semi-Dwarf Apple Trees mature to be about 12-15' tall and wide. They offer maximum apple yield per square foot.Standard Apple Trees mature to be about 15-25' tall and 20' wide. They are perfect if you have a large space or want a multi-purpose apple & shade tree.

I planted a different variety of sweet cherry 2 years ago, but we unfortunately had a harsh winter and it didn't survive.  After doing some reseach, I discovered that sour cherries are better for the Eastern Colorado climate, but the locoal extention specifically mentioned that Stella Cherry Trees do alright in Urban areas of Eastern Colorado. Since I wanted a sweet cherry tree I decided I would take my chances on this variety.

I planted this tree at my previous home and it was a vigorous grower.  I am sorry I didn't stay long enough to enjoy the fruit.  Decided to buy again and plant at my new home.  I planted a cherry tree from a local store and it died after about 3 months.

Self pollinating, sweet. I have been told sweet cherries don't do well here on the Colorado front range. Stella seems to be the only one that might make it and produce once in a while.

Sweet cherries; do you have to say more? Coupled with Stark's long history of proven arbory, it's a sure fire hit.

I planted a different variety of sweet cherry 2 years ago, but we unfortunately had a harsh winter and it didn't survive.  After doing some reseach, I discovered that sour cherries are better for the Eastern Colorado climate, but the locoal extention specifically mentioned that Stella Cherry Trees do alright in Urban areas of Eastern Colorado. Since I wanted a sweet cherry tree I decided I would take my chances on this variety.

I planted this tree at my previous home and it was a vigorous grower.  I am sorry I didn't stay long enough to enjoy the fruit.  Decided to buy again and plant at my new home.  I planted a cherry tree from a local store and it died after about 3 months.

Self pollinating, sweet. I have been told sweet cherries don't do well here on the Colorado front range. Stella seems to be the only one that might make it and produce once in a while.

is the stella cherry a good pollinator for the bing cherry tree & do they need to bud out at the same time to pollinate?



Steve



                            on Aug 8, 2016
                        








BEST ANSWER: Thank you for your question. Yes, Stella is a fine pollinator for Bing. The trees do indeed need to at least have overlapping bud times, or else the pollen can't be properly transferred.

I planted a Stella cherry tree several years ago. Had cherries the next two years but the birds got all of them. They turn dark like I imagined them turning but they are not sweet at all. Am I picking them too soon?

BEST ANSWER: My Stella is not yet old enough to produce fruit so I cannot speak to this specific variety, but I would suggest that most any fruit will go from tart, to sweet, to mild as it hangs longer on the tree.As for your bird problem, try this trick.  Just when the fruit starts to go from green to red, hand a bunch of old CD's or DVD's by wire around the tree, shiny-side out.  I do this on my Montmorency and it seems to be very effective at keeping the birds away.  But do not put them on too soon or leave them on too long. You don't want the birds to get used to them and loose their fear.

More than likely in a rush to get them before the birds.Tree could also not be fully developed putting more energy into groth rather than fruit.To help it make shure it gets water, fertilizer and pruning when needed.

                            on Aug 6, 2016
                        








BEST ANSWER: You might be able to keep the Stella Cherry in a pot provided you do a lot of pruning but if you are wanting this tree to be fruitful it needs to be outdoors where it can receive at least 400 chill hours. Most fruit trees require some contact with cold temperatures and the Stella is no different. That being said I would forego the pot and plant directly in the ground-assuming you have a space for it.

Planting in the deep south, will this plant do well?

                            on Feb 9, 2017
                        








BEST ANSWER: The Stella cherry tree requires at least 400 chill hours in order to bear fruit.Chill hours are calculated on the number of hours the trees environment is below 45 degrees and above 32 degrees. Since you mentioned the deep south you may need to consider a cherry tree which requires 200 chill hours and depending upon how far south you are speaking of may still not be ideal. You will have to do the calculations to be certain.

How many years for a Stella cherry tree to get 20 ft high?



Tom D



                            on May 19, 2017
                        








BEST ANSWER: Much of the growth on a STANDARD will depend upon the amount of sun, rain and nutrients it receives, and how good the soil is, but Stella can grow 2-3' per year - that means it can reach 20' in about 7 years. A dwarf or semi-dwarf will grow closer to 12" to 2' per year.

Great for North Texas
I'm happy with this variety, it has fruited fast and with the low chill hours (relatively) we get here in Dallas I think it's a winner. Of the other 6 or so varieties I bought, only one other even flowered and didn't produce fruit.So I kept Stella! Others may work out if you give them a longer establishment time or have different chill hours or better soil. Mine is terrible clay.

Off to a good start
My Stella Sweet Cherry is growing extremely well and will allow selective pruning for a well shaped tree.  Not bearing yet. Maybe next year. The only challenge is the Japanese beetle infestation.  But the tree will bear before the beetles arrive in July.

High Hopes!
I grew Stella once before here in Minneapolis, but had to sacrifice it for a home improvement. The new one arrived 3 months ago in Stark's usual expert packaging. I planted it within days. It took beautifully. It has several healthy branches covered with heavy foliage. I realized that it is outside of its zone 5 tolerance, but the last one seemed to really thrive until it met the Bobcat at nearly 15'. It's intended to be the pollinator for the 2 Kristin I also planted this spring. I planted the semi-dwarf in a protected area, so I have high hopes for loads of sweet cherries in zone 4!

Still waiting for it to produce fruit
We bought this 2 years ago (2014), and we are still waiting.   It was suppose to already be a somewhat established tree, but apparently was not as old originally as we thought.  Nursed it through an attack of Japanese beetles and ants last year... had a =few= blooms on it FINALLY his year and hoping to see some fruit come summer.

Died within a year
The tree died within 6 months after I planted it. This was my first purchase so I am unsure about the warranty.

Beautiful tree
Got this last year, planted it, put a fence around it to keep the deer away.  Getting a plant by mail is sometimes difficult because of the stress to the plant, but this tree is now 7 or 8 feet tall and very healthy.  Can't wait for fruit to appear.

1 year later
When i got this tree a year ago, it was pretty much a 3 foot stick with roots. It is now over 8 feet tall and starting to branch out beautifully. I'm in Wisconsin, it survived the winter and shot up like a weed this spring. Looking forward to fruit hopefully next year!

Stella Cherry really Stellar!
I ordered two of these Stella Cherry trees last year.  They are both doing wonderfully with many blossoms and it looks like many setting this year.  We truly enjoyed the scent of the blossoms in our back yard this spring and can't wait to collect our harvest this year.

What A Fabulous Tree!  Thank You!  Be Sure To Order A Stella Now!
Ever since I planted the Stella sweet cherry tree that I purchased from Stark Brother's Nursery last June (2016), the tree has done incredibly well.  Even when exposed to the cold Michigan winter, it didn't seem to faze the Stella at all. To date, the tree has attained a height of 45", and is adorned with lots of healthy green leaves.  In fact, I can't wait to see what the tree does next year!  If you're searching for a nice standard Stella sweet cherry tree, Stark Brother's Nursery will be your source.  Don't hesitate!  Order one now!

Very satisfied with warranty promise
We needed to take out 5 native trees near power lines 2 yrs ago and ordered 5 fruit trees from Stark Bro's with which to honor those taken. Four of the five did great and when I called this Spring for a replacement for the sweet cherry tree that needed replaced I had prompt response honoring the warranty. The warranty tree is thriving!

This tree arrived promptly and was in good condition with a moderate root system attached. So far, it is doing well, it is a year old and in danger from deer damage every night so it is surrounded with chicken wire to protect it. Looking forward to eating cherries in a few years! I would recommend this to a friend.

Stella Cherry
My Stella Sweet Cherry survived the winter and put out leaves this spring. Then this past week the leaves began to die. We have had above average rainfall this season and all the other trees look great, so I can't figure out what happened.

Stella Sweet Cherry
This was a lovely tree, and arrived in very nice shape.  I sited and planted it well, and it came out of dormancy in very good shape.  Unfortunately, the deer have not been kind to it, and I've struggled to find an effective way to limit their access.   They've got nothing but time and can be particularly persistent.  Regardless, you sent me a very nice tree and I'm trying to figure out a way to allow it to survive.

Purchased 4 Stella Cherry trees , two last spring and two two springs ago. All are growing like crazy, are these really semi-dwarfs?!!! Its too early to reap cherries yet, but if their output is as good as the tree growth, I should be in the cherries in a couple more years.

Cherry Trees

About Cherry Trees



A cherry tree will bear abundant crops of mouthwatering cherries, and serve as a beautiful standout in any landscape during spring’s cherry blossom season. Plant a cherry tree and grow a wonderful fruit that people have been enjoying for generations. Within our selection of cherry trees you will find:Sour Cherry Trees, which produce tangy pie cherries that are ideal for cooking and baking. These tart cherries are perfect for any number of recipes, including pies, cobblers and juices. Sweet Cherry Trees produce the familiar sweet cherries and are exceptionally delicious when picked fresh and popped in your mouth like candy. These cherries make great fresh or dried snacks. Within our cherry tree selection, you will also find Heirloom Cherry Trees — antique cherry varieties that have withstood the tests of time.

Buyer's Guide

Buyer's Guide
To ensure your growing success and satisfaction, there are a few things to consider when you buy a cherry tree.Zone CompatibilityYour climate plays an important role in whether a cherry tree will be successful. Make sure the hardiness zone range of the tree you choose includes your area.Proper PollinationMost of the cherries we grow are self-pollinating cherry trees, but we still recommend planting another cherry variety in your yard for optimum fruit production. For cherry trees that do require pollination by a different variety, be sure to check the description of your tree to see which pollinators our experts recommend. Often, the absence of proper pollination is why trees produce poorly or don’t bear fruit. Mature Tree SizePick the right size tree for your available space. When our cherry trees mature, they will be one of these sizes:Dwarf Cherry Trees — mature to be about 8-14' tall and wide. Even though they are smaller, they produce an abundance of full-size fruit.Semi-Dwarf Cherry Trees —  mature to be about 12-18' tall and wide. They offer maximum fruit yield per square foot.Standard Cherry Trees mature to be about 18-25' tall and wide. They are perfect if you have a large space or want a multi-purpose cherry & shade tree.Tree DevelopmentCherry Trees do not develop in the same way as other fruit trees, and they do not look like them early on. When you receive one of our young, bare-root cherry trees, it may not have any branches, causing it to resemble a whip. These “whips” have less growth for the roots to support, creating a better balance for the tree and allowing its roots to become more established during the first year. This successful early transplanting will encourage strong, healthy development for future growing seasons.Soil DrainageIf you select a sweet cherry tree, make sure your cherry tree’s root system will have adequate drainage. If your soil is heavy and holds water, it could cause complications. Be sure to choose your planting site wisely. Learn how to Plan Ahead for Rainy Weather.

I planted a different variety of sweet cherry 2 years ago, but we unfortunately had a harsh winter and it didn't survive.  After doing some reseach, I discovered that sour cherries are better for the Eastern Colorado climate, but the locoal extention specifically mentioned that Stella Cherry Trees do alright in Urban areas of Eastern Colorado. Since I wanted a sweet cherry tree I decided I would take my chances on this variety.

I planted this tree at my previous home and it was a vigorous grower.  I am sorry I didn't stay long enough to enjoy the fruit.  Decided to buy again and plant at my new home.  I planted a cherry tree from a local store and it died after about 3 months.

is the stella cherry a good pollinator for the bing cherry tree & do they need to bud out at the same time to pollinate?

                            on Aug 8, 2016
                        








BEST ANSWER: Thank you for your question. Yes, Stella is a fine pollinator for Bing. The trees do indeed need to at least have overlapping bud times, or else the pollen can't be properly transferred.

I planted a Stella cherry tree several years ago. Had cherries the next two years but the birds got all of them. They turn dark like I imagined them turning but they are not sweet at all. Am I picking them too soon?

BEST ANSWER: My Stella is not yet old enough to produce fruit so I cannot speak to this specific variety, but I would suggest that most any fruit will go from tart, to sweet, to mild as it hangs longer on the tree.As for your bird problem, try this trick.  Just when the fruit starts to go from green to red, hand a bunch of old CD's or DVD's by wire around the tree, shiny-side out.  I do this on my Montmorency and it seems to be very effective at keeping the birds away.  But do not put them on too soon or leave them on too long. You don't want the birds to get used to them and loose their fear.

More than likely in a rush to get them before the birds.Tree could also not be fully developed putting more energy into groth rather than fruit.To help it make shure it gets water, fertilizer and pruning when needed.

Can I keep this cherry tree inside or potted?

                            on Aug 6, 2016
                        








BEST ANSWER: You might be able to keep the Stella Cherry in a pot provided you do a lot of pruning but if you are wanting this tree to be fruitful it needs to be outdoors where it can receive at least 400 chill hours. Most fruit trees require some contact with cold temperatures and the Stella is no different. That being said I would forego the pot and plant directly in the ground-assuming you have a space for it.

Planting in the deep south, will this plant do well?



Nancy M



                            on Feb 9, 2017
                        








BEST ANSWER: The Stella cherry tree requires at least 400 chill hours in order to bear fruit.Chill hours are calculated on the number of hours the trees environment is below 45 degrees and above 32 degrees. Since you mentioned the deep south you may need to consider a cherry tree which requires 200 chill hours and depending upon how far south you are speaking of may still not be ideal. You will have to do the calculations to be certain.

How many years for a Stella cherry tree to get 20 ft high?



Tom D



                            on May 19, 2017
                        








BEST ANSWER: Much of the growth on a STANDARD will depend upon the amount of sun, rain and nutrients it receives, and how good the soil is, but Stella can grow 2-3' per year - that means it can reach 20' in about 7 years. A dwarf or semi-dwarf will grow closer to 12" to 2' per year.

            Hi Haylee ... Stella should come along soon. If you have crape myrtles in the area that start leafing out and your Stella is still dormant, do a scratch test: //www.starkbros.com/growing-guide/article/how-to-do-a-scratch-test If that test determines they are no longer living, and in need of replacement, please contact our Customer Support Team at 800.325.4180. They'd be happy to help.

BEST ANSWER: Stella is a late bloomer and will wake up soon, presuming the temperature where you live doesn't go back into a deep freeze.

How much yield (in bushels) will my standard Stella Sweet Cherry tree bear at maturity?



John B



                            on Dec 30, 2016
                        








BEST ANSWER: Cherry trees generally produce quarts vs. bushels, except standard-size trees. Here are the approximate yields for sweet cherry trees: Dwarf: 15???20 quarts; Semi-Dwarf: 30???50 quarts; Standard: 60???75 quarts (~3 bushels).

BEST ANSWER: Thank you for your question. Either Stella or Blackgold?? would be good choices  - they are both late-bloomers and suitable for your growing zone.

What is a good pollinator for Stella?

                            on Oct 10, 2016
                        








BEST ANSWER: Thank you for your question.You don't need another variety for pollination with this variety. You would get fruit with only one plant, but adding a pollinator will give you bigger fruit, and more of it.

Great for North Texas
I'm happy with this variety, it has fruited fast and with the low chill hours (relatively) we get here in Dallas I think it's a winner. Of the other 6 or so varieties I bought, only one other even flowered and didn't produce fruit.So I kept Stella! Others may work out if you give them a longer establishment time or have different chill hours or better soil. Mine is terrible clay.

Hardy tree in 7b
I planted this little guy last year, and a bunch of stupid beetles started eating all the leaves! When winter hit I just knew the tree wouldn't make it, but alas, here it is spring, and the tree is fuller and healthier than ever! So happy with the purchase!

Off to a good start
My Stella Sweet Cherry is growing extremely well and will allow selective pruning for a well shaped tree.  Not bearing yet. Maybe next year. The only challenge is the Japanese beetle infestation.  But the tree will bear before the beetles arrive in July.

High Hopes!
I grew Stella once before here in Minneapolis, but had to sacrifice it for a home improvement. The new one arrived 3 months ago in Stark's usual expert packaging. I planted it within days. It took beautifully. It has several healthy branches covered with heavy foliage. I realized that it is outside of its zone 5 tolerance, but the last one seemed to really thrive until it met the Bobcat at nearly 15'. It's intended to be the pollinator for the 2 Kristin I also planted this spring. I planted the semi-dwarf in a protected area, so I have high hopes for loads of sweet cherries in zone 4!

Still waiting for it to produce fruit
We bought this 2 years ago (2014), and we are still waiting.   It was suppose to already be a somewhat established tree, but apparently was not as old originally as we thought.  Nursed it through an attack of Japanese beetles and ants last year... had a =few= blooms on it FINALLY his year and hoping to see some fruit come summer.

Got this last year, planted it, put a fence around it to keep the deer away.  Getting a plant by mail is sometimes difficult because of the stress to the plant, but this tree is now 7 or 8 feet tall and very healthy.  Can't wait for fruit to appear.

What A Fabulous Tree!  Thank You!  Be Sure To Order A Stella Now!
Ever since I planted the Stella sweet cherry tree that I purchased from Stark Brother's Nursery last June (2016), the tree has done incredibly well.  Even when exposed to the cold Michigan winter, it didn't seem to faze the Stella at all. To date, the tree has attained a height of 45", and is adorned with lots of healthy green leaves.  In fact, I can't wait to see what the tree does next year!  If you're searching for a nice standard Stella sweet cherry tree, Stark Brother's Nursery will be your source.  Don't hesitate!  Order one now!

Very satisfied with warranty promise
We needed to take out 5 native trees near power lines 2 yrs ago and ordered 5 fruit trees from Stark Bro's with which to honor those taken. Four of the five did great and when I called this Spring for a replacement for the sweet cherry tree that needed replaced I had prompt response honoring the warranty. The warranty tree is thriving!

This tree arrived promptly and was in good condition with a moderate root system attached. So far, it is doing well, it is a year old and in danger from deer damage every night so it is surrounded with chicken wire to protect it. Looking forward to eating cherries in a few years! I would recommend this to a friend.

My Stella Sweet Cherry survived the winter and put out leaves this spring. Then this past week the leaves began to die. We have had above average rainfall this season and all the other trees look great, so I can't figure out what happened.

Stella Sweet Cherry
This was a lovely tree, and arrived in very nice shape.  I sited and planted it well, and it came out of dormancy in very good shape.  Unfortunately, the deer have not been kind to it, and I've struggled to find an effective way to limit their access.   They've got nothing but time and can be particularly persistent.  Regardless, you sent me a very nice tree and I'm trying to figure out a way to allow it to survive.

Stella Sweey Chery
Purchased 4 Stella Cherry trees , two last spring and two two springs ago. All are growing like crazy, are these really semi-dwarfs?!!! Its too early to reap cherries yet, but if their output is as good as the tree growth, I should be in the cherries in a couple more years.

Didn't survive
This tree did not survive the Summer. I planted it right away as I have all my other trees and it is dead.
