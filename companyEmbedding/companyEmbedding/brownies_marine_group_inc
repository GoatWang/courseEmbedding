  Welcome to $BWMG!!! (new construction of this page initiated on 23-Nov-2016 by BWMG, other moderators please contribute)                BWMG About Brownie's Marine Group, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, Trebor Industries, Inc., d/b/a Brownie's Third Lung, based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida designs, tests, manufactures and distributes recreational hookah diving, yacht based scuba air compressor and Nitrox Generation Systems, and scuba and water safety products. The Company sells its products both on a wholesale and retail basis and is comprised of three highly specialized dive product groups. The Company is an industry leading manufacturing and distribution company that serves middle income boat owners, higher income yacht owners, recreational divers, military operators and public safety personnel. The Company holds more than ten patents and enjoys a robust product development and intellectual property program that has yielded several proprietary products. Many of these products and innovations have become the "standard" for the marine industry.

SCUBA Tankfill/NitroxMaker Systems Every aspect of a new Yacht build or a re-fit requires detailed planning and preparation to be successful in meeting the diving goals of modern boat buyers. Today's diving systems are an integral part of a yacht's design and require the same attention to ehanced technology and expertise as every other aspect of a sophisticated project. * All "VS" battery-powered units include Brownie's Variable Speed technology (Patent pending), the system senses the divers breathing pattern and adjust the compressor speed to meet the demand accurately, resulting in far superior diving performance and battery resource managment over traditional "constant-run/constant-speed systems". BWMG Patents Brownie's Marine Group has dedicated years of research and development in order to create the best products in the diving industry. Our patented technoloy offers a wide variety of diving systems and accessories that makes diving an easy and more joyable diving experience. Here are a few of the Patents BWMG hold CLICK the link to see more than a dozen listed http://www.browniesmarinegroup.com/about-us/our-patents  BWMG Catalog:  http://www.browniedive.com/pdf/thirdlung/surface_supplied_air/VS_minicatalog_web.pdf  Brownie's Third Lung factory headquarters is located in Fort Lauderdale/Pompano, Florida - a very wet location. All of southern Florida is covered with a network of lakes, ponds, canals, spillways and other various bodies of water. All too often, we were witness to drowning of motorists and passengers inside vehicles submerged in shallow water. In many instances, rescue personnel and by-standers actually witnessed accidents taking place, have gallantly jumped into the water to attempt rescue; only to be frustrated with their inability to breath hold long enough to extract the victim(s). Their only recourse is to wait for the dive team to arrive with breathing gear to extract the victims. With each passing minute the chances of survival decrease dramatically.  Brownie's Third Lung has been a leading manufacturer of surface supplied air diving compressors and specialized tankfill compressors for over 34 years. The Brownie's Public Safety product line was formed in 2000 to help address the growing needs of the ALL public safety dive markets, not just our own backyard. We modified products and technology from our other applications specifically to address the needs of a First Responder Public Safety Officer.    BWMG Management Team Robert M. Carmichael has been the President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer of Brownie's Marine Group, Inc. (Formerly United Companies Corp. and Brownie's Third Lung). since April 16, 2004. From March 23, 2004 to April 16, 2004, Mr. Carmichael served as an Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Brownie's Marine Group, Inc. Prior to the share exchange transaction between United and Trebor Industries, Mr. Carmichael operated Trebor Industries, a subsidiary of United Companies Corp. as its President since 1986. Mr. Carmichael is the holder or Co-holder of numerous patents that are used by Trebor Industries and several other major companies in the diving industry. He serves as the Chairman of Brownie's Marine Group, Inc.

From the BlogSubscribe NowBrownie’s Marine Group Products Featured in The Biggest Boating Store In The U.S.: The West Marine Superstore That Opened Up This Week
Posted on November 17, 2011  //  FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., November 17th, 2011 — For many years Brownie’s Marine Group, Inc. (OTCBB:BWMG), a leading developer, manufacturer and distributor of highly specialized dive and safety products has had a great collaboration with several West Marine Stores, especially throughout Florida. This collaboration expanded effectively with the soft opening of the biggest boating store in the U.S., the new West Marine Superstore located at 2401 S. Andrews Ave., Fort Lauderdale, FL 33316 earlier this week.
To celebrate the opening West Marine is offering coupons worth $15 off your next purchase of $100 or more (certain conditions apply). To receive a coupon go to this link: West Marine Superstore Coupon.
In further and related news, Brownie’s CEO, Mr. Robert Carmichael, recently had the chance to visit with several other West Marine stores along his route from the two recent Annapolis Boat Shows at which Brownie’s Marine Group exhibited, including stores located outside Florida. It is expected that Brownie’s Marine Group representations will soon open up in these too in foreseeable future.
Mr. Carmichael intentionally made the trip to the two Annapolis Boat Shows by car so he could bring with him full load of the incredibly well received new Brownie’s VS Thing Lung Systems and so that he could visit with new potential dealerships on the way back to Fort Lauderdale.  These visits proved promising for soon to come point of sales of Brownie’s Marine Group products. Incidentally the full load of the VS Third Lung systems sold out at the Annapolis Boat Shows.
Interested readers who wish to know more should contact Robert Carmichael  on email, robert@browniesmarinegroup.com or call Brownie’s Marine Group, Inc. +1 954 462 5570 ext 202

Posted on November 17, 2011  //  FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., November 15th, 2011 — Building on previous years’ collaboration Brownie’s Marine Group, Inc. (OTCBB:BWMG), a leading developer, manufacturer and distributor of highly specialized dive and safety product and Triton Submarines a leading manufacturer and developer of submarines teamed up as strategic partners at the recent Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show (FLIPS) where the new 3300/3 Triton Submarine was introduced and the Brownie’s VS was showcased.

Interest for the unexplored realm of the world below the surface is rapidly growing and these two products present some of the best avenues available for doing so. The VS is the new revolutionary all battery-powered surface supplied air diving system that Brownie’s has spent three years developing. This is the ultimate diving system particularly suited for the family and recreational diving. The system vastly surpasses every performance compared with other battery-powered systems on the market and comes at a price point often lower than systems it is often compared to.

The Triton 3300/3 met its first introduction at the FLIBS this year (Image above shows the 3300/2 Triton). It has been specially designed to be able to take 3 passengers in utmost comfort to a depth of just about 3300 feet. The special design makes for essentially panoramic view from comfortable sitting position in air conditioned climate at pressure equal to the pressure we have at the surface, thus eliminating any need for decompression. The submarine comes with easy maneuvering handled with a joy stick and touch-screen controls and its size and dimensions have been specially designed by probably the most experienced submarine team to be able to be usable with private yachts. The special design also allows for entry and exit of passengers resting on the surface, where as many other designs require the submarine to be hoisted up onto the deck of a vessel, an operation that takes a considerable amount of extra time and expense.
The visitors at the Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show showed great interest in both products and several Brownie’s VS were sold and several highly interested potential clients signed up for upcoming demonstrations of the Triton submarine.

Posted on September 27, 2011  //  Last Sunday, another test dive on the VS Third Lung – the new battery powered variable speed Third Lung Hookah diving system – was performed. 

Blake put together a small video from that particular dive that he has shared with us and that is posted below. The dive was 1 hour and 53 minutes in length plus the time the VS was running during the set up before the dive and the unit was running on our standard batteries.
What is particularly well worth noticing in this particular video is the capability of the unit to handle somewhat rough waters and not least exactly just how easy it is to remove the batteries. Remember the battery removal and replacement requires no tools.
Enjoy!

Posted on November 24, 2010  //  While DEMA, the annual dive trade show, was at full blast in Las Vegas, the Fort Lauderdale Police Dive Team was testing out a few of the new Brownie’s Marine Group products. Thursday November 18th the Fort Lauderdale Police Dive Team convened near Las Olas Boulevard at the little marina on the Intracostal to test out the Brownie’s VS Third Lung – the battery powered Variable Speed hookah diving system that was released on the market earlier this year.
Se Video at the bottom of this post.
The Fort Lauderdale Police Dive Team Convened On The Intracostal
The system was modified just a little in that an AGA full face mask was hooked up so that the police could use their communication thorough out the dives. In other words this event provided us with a perfect test for the performance of the breathing performance with the VS system and a full face mask. Needless to say the test results were flawless and the system performed perfectly.

Often times the assignments for the Police Dive Team encompass search and rescue operations (as well as unfortunately also search and recover assignments). Surface supplied air dive systems are a perfect way of doing this and with an electrical system that actually can perform to real dive levels, the Brownie’s Marine Group’s VS Third Lung is the perfect match.
Fort Lauderdale Police Dive Team Tests Out The Brownie's VS
Also the Fort Lauderdale Police Dive Team tested the Brownie’s Marine Group Egressor systems. The Egressor systems are the specially developed mini-scuba systems which utilizes the patented Brownie’s Cummerbelt along with a small scuba bottle and regulator set up. The mini-scuba system is the perfect extension of the system. Not only do these bring you redundancy and means of back up air supply, but they can also extend the versatility and flexibility to meet unforeseen and complicated tasks. 
For Lauderdale Police Dive Team Overlooking The Test Of The Brownie's Marine Group Equipment
The police dive team also tested the H2Ov package which consists of high definition Contour video camera with underwater housing that Brownie’s Marine Group distributes with great success. This is a tiny little package especially compared to previous typical underwater video systems and it delivers superb quality footage even with limited light or visibility available. The H2Ov underwater video package has proven super popular at the recent tradeshow DEMA and at the Fort Lauderdale Boat Show FLIBS.
The H2Ov package is a great accompanying gear for your dives, whether you dive for leisure or for work and provides great fun for all your other video fun, you know, for when you go parachuting, skiing, car racing, boating or simply just hang out with your friends and/or family.
A Full Face Mask Was Added To The Brownie's Third Lung System 
Returning From Successful Mission
Could this be the future choice for Public Safety divers? We like to think so.

Posted on November 18, 2010  //  Yesterday the annual dive industry trade show opened up in Las Vegas and Brownie’s Marine Group is there with our own booth – booth number 4430, located between the Scubapro and the Aqualung booths.
Brownie's Marine Group's Booth At Dema
It has been several years since Brownie’s Marine Group attended the tradeshow with a booth, but with so many new innovative products in our line this year, we felt it would be worth while and get us the chance to show these to dive professionals from all our the world.
DEMA is the biggest dive trade only show and it draws dive professionals from all over the world who come to present their products, services, resorts, locations or to source new products for them to sell at home.
Entrance To The 2010 DEMA Tradeshow
For DEMA Brownie’s Marine Group has chosen to showcase particularly the VS Third Lung which represents such a unique product that utilizes superior technology and offers such advantages to divers as a complement or as an alternative to conventional scuba diving. Fully battery powered this product is not only much quieter than other hookah dive type products, but also green. And with its ingenious design and technology, it offers real dive performance as exemplified by the many world records Brownie’s Marine Group has set with it in earlier months of this year.
The VS At DEMA 2010 Draws Lots Of Attention
Three years in the making this product was no accident, but the result of thorough hard work and determination, exploring many different avenues of solution in order to find just the right combination that made this product become such an advancement over any previous systems in existence.
Also showcased is the H2Ov package that consists of the super popular Contour High Definition video camera and the specially made underwater housing for it. Depth rated to 400 feet you can bring this camera on most of your dives and return with great video footage for you to enjoy at your leisure at any time later on and to share with your friends and family. Footage can be shot in quality up to 1080p or you can set quality to lower settings and thereby extend the length of video you can record on your memory card. The system comes standard with a 2GB memory card.
The H2Ov video package is so compact that bringing it along your dives is no trouble at all. In fact the Brownie’s Marine Group dive team, with each member having their on camera, always brings their cameras on all their dives since we acquired these earlier this summer.  So pretty much all our the Brownie’s Marine Group videos that we have produced since this summer that you may see on our blog, on our Facebook pages or on our Youtube video channel have been shot with this system.
Our video cameras and their housing before we acquired this were not only analogue but also excessively large, bulky, heavy and expensive. Bringing the heavy and certainly not very streamlined equipment on any dive used to be a feat and not something we always care for. But with the small and compact solution the system is a thrill to bring along and awards us with fun footage that makes it possible to re-experience the dive later again and again.
We believe it is only a matter of time before all divers will want to have a video system like this one and we are pleased to have signed an exclusive distribution agreement for the system for the entire USA east of Mississippi. Previously underwater housing systems were extremely expensive, but now with a Best Guaranteed Price of only US$ 679.00 that includes the Contour video camera and the H2Ov underwater housing this system should be within reach of everybody.
If you are not at DEMA, you can buy this system directly from our factory or online from our website or via our dealers.
We will also be showing our very special Tooka™ off at the trade show. This licensed only product is the perfect solution for resorts all over the world whereby visitors, tourists and guests can easily enjoy a dive experience  – even if they hold no scuba certification.
The Tooka™ is a specially developed product from Brownie’s Marine Group that we believe will reach a strong interest and showing it off at DEMA seems to be the perfect place for it.
If you are a resort operator, snorkel boat operator or even an active dive store operator then you may want to check our the Tooka™ and the business opportunity it presents.
If you are attending DEMA, be sure to stop by booth 4430 to visit and chat with us. We would love to hear your story and get the chance to give you a little insight to ours and our products.
Revisit us again soon for more updates on the show, pictures and more.

Posted on November 7, 2010  //  The electrical Variable Speed Third Lung (the VS) continually proves itself superior to all other existing electrical hookah diving systems out there by its versatility and performance.
During the past summer a test dive was made on one of the models we have and the numbers from the dive were super impressive. In fact a distance of 5.1 miles was covered by a diver using two Halcyon underwater propulsion vehicles. The diver entered the waters ½ mile off of Bahia Mar and exited 2 hours and 15-minutes later just off of Commercial Boulevard. That’s just about 5.1 miles in distance measured by GPS device.
The dive itself did not show off too many wonders from the ocean realm, but here is a small video from the dive nevertheless:

Posted on November 6, 2010  //  Nautica International, Inc showcased one of their consoles for their RIB tenders with a built in Brownie’s VS (Variable Speed) at the recent Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show (FLIBS). 
Brownie’s Marine Group has long had a great working relationship with Nautica International, Inc who makes some of the best RIB tenders in the world. 
Recently, in collaboration between Nautica International Inc and Brownie’s Marine Group one of the new Brownie’s Marine Group VS dive systems was built into a customers beautiful brand new tender (you can see the video here). We wanted to show this option to all other tender owners to show them just how great a solution this is and the benefits you get from a very little extra investment.
Joey Demonstrates The VS Built Into Boat Console
Building in a Brownies VS is a great idea whereby you immediately turn in your tender into the perfect little dive boat on which you always will have your dives system readily available. The built in unit uses the exact same technology that Brownie’s Marine Group has perfected for the free floating VS unit, but you actually can have a lot of different options to best suit your specific needs and your boats power system. Also our built in systems can be made to almost any size boats from the very small to the rather large private yachts and we can fit it to pretty much any power system that is available on the boat.
An extension to a built in dive system that is very much worth considering is the Brownie’s E-Reel™. With the E-Reel™ your hose is always readily available nicely stored and ready to be pulled out for your dive, hull inspection or what ever task you are about to do. Following your dive a flick of a switch and the hose recoils back electrically into its storage position.

The console can viewed after the boat show at the Nautica International Inc Showroom located at 1500 S. 66th Avenue, Pembroke Pines, FL 33023

Posted on October 17, 2011  //  
PRESS RELEASE
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., October 17th, 2011 — Brownie’s Marine Group, Inc. (OTCBB:BWMG), a leading developer, manufacturer and distributor of highly specialized dive and safety products, announced today that it had entered into joint venture arrangement with Pompano Dive Center (“PDC”) in Pompano Beach, Florida.
The joint venture will place Brownie’s unique and highly innovative dive systems in one of the most active boating and diving communities in the country. The Pompano Dive Center will also act as a training and demonstration site for Brownie’s products; PDC also offers complete SCUBAPRO and HALCYON product display and service. Alongside the retail store, PDC owns and operates several dive boats in Pompano Beach, Florida at the Sands Harbor Marina on the Intracoastal Waterway at the intersection with Atlantic Boulevard and within view of the beach. A classroom for training divers on Brownie’s dive systems enhances the value of the PDC joint venture for Brownies and diving enthusiasts.
Robert Carmichael, CEO, stated: “We are enthusiastic about the potential of adding another great exposure point and the first full-time experience center to our vertically integrated plan. The new battery powered ‘VS’ dive system is causing many boating enthusiasts to embrace hookah diving as their primary dive method. The outstanding performance and convenience of the VS dive system is making hookah diving mainstream. We believe that the VS will provide a boost to the more mature SCUBA industry by bringing in new divers. The relationship with PDC will provide in-water instruction and demonstration dives. The adage ‘OTIWATO’ (One Test Is Worth a Thousand Opinions) rings particularly true as we witness snorkelers and veteran scuba divers alike, return from their first VS experience, they are amazed at the sensation of minimal gear, incredible performance, and great mobility.”
Mr. Carmichael continued: “To further increase our sales force skill, the Pompano Dive Center will serve as the training and demonstration site for Brownie’s Marine Group dealers and distributors globally. Here we will invite new and current dealers to test our groundbreaking technology as we shape the new sports category of recreational hookah diving. In a sense, this is a coming home for Brownies. Brownie’s originated as a company in Pompano Beach in 1969. It is fitting that a new chapter for our company begins here.”
Jeremy Jarosky, Pompano Dive Center CEO stated: “I would like to echo Robert’s enthusiasm, as we have long admired the commitment to quality at Brownies Marine Group. We are proud to be a part of the Brownie’s Team and look forward to adding significant visibility to diving and the underwater world and making it more accessible to everyone.”

Posted on July 11, 2011  //  A review of the number of unique visitors to our website www.browniesmarinegroup.com gives rise to great encouragement for our business (confirmed by our busy phone lines and emails ticking in).
“Looking at the numbers of unique visitors for this year including the month of June compared with the numbers of last year, we have an increase of more than 108%”, says Mikkel Pitzner, who works with Abby Del Valle who handles most of the website set up and content administration at Brownie’s Marine Group. “The percentage increase in unique visitors should also be compared with the fact that last year saw an increase in the website’s traffic in excess of 300%. So we have really been fortunate to receive a huge increase in the amount of interest shown us”.

And the Brownie’s Marine Group factory in Fort Lauderdale is indeed busy, scrambling hard to keep back orders to a minimum and trying to keep up with the surge and the many customers who wish to make use of the warm weather to go diving.
Interest is high for both some of the more seasoned Brownie’s Marine Group products, such as the conventional gas powered Brownie’s Third lung, but also there is a great interest and orders for the various patent pending Battery Powered Variable Speed models (the VS Third Lung) models that are the newest creations developed, engineered and launched by Brownie’s Marine Group. Indeed, even the more expensive NitroxMakers as well as various boat installations are being ordered and delivered (more on these in upcoming blog post).  
“It is wonderful to see some of the hard work that everybody at the factory is putting in paying off and we are very appreciative of the patronage and support from our customers”, concludes Mikkel Pitzner.

Posted on April 27, 2011  //  I am getting married. In less than a week from now actually. My friend and CEO of Brownie’s Marine Group, Robert Carmichael, has substituted the typical gaudy bachelor party for me with a real treat much more to my likings.
So as I am writing these beginning words to this blog post right now we are sitting on the Jetblue plane out of Fort Lauderdale and bound for Nassau in the Bahamas. Here we will meet up with the beautiful private yacht called Mine Games.
But wait – it gets even better.
Mine Games Aft With triton Submarine
Mine Games holds on its aft deck a Triton submarine and right now special invitees are gathering here in the Bahamas to try out the submarine and I have been invited to go for a dive in the Triton Submarine too.
So in other words I am about to go for my deepest dive yet – to a thousand feet below the surface. Well that’s the depth rating for this particular submarine, but builder Triton actually already has another version that has a depth rating tripling that.
It is a chance of a lifetime so although it is not without some apprehension in my body and mental mindset, I am eager to experience it and see with my own eyes what’s down there.
The apprehension is simply whether this will freak me out – you know, like as in claustrophobia.  I don’t believe that I suffer from claustrophobia but I can get my mind into a spin sometimes and have certainly had my thought during cave dives in particular and Hey, I saw Das Boot – several times.
But when I start to get nervous by the mere thought of being enclosed in a small submarine going deep under the surface and thoughts on chickening out creeps up on me, I start saying to myself that fear is only temporary while regret will be forever. And it works.
We arrive at beautiful Bahamas after a short 30 minutes flight and take a taxi to one of the harbors where we are picked up by the Mine Games tender – a nice 37 foot Intrepid boat with triple 300 HP Yamahas.
And a short boatride out of the marina to the awaiting Mine Games resting at anchor about a mile off the shore.
The CNN Reporter Having Just Completed His Triton Submarine Dive
On board already are most of the Triton guys and also some other guests including CNN who is filming and interviewing.
Yesterday saw visits from Fox News and I believe the Discovery Channel also picked up the story. Also present sitting at the outdoors table towards the aft of the yacht are a few persons with eyes glued to their laptops updating the websites, Youtube channels and not least posting and following the twitter of the story as it develops. I believe the hashtag for those in the know with twitter is #race2innerspace or #racetoinnerspace.
And no, we are not talking about my story of my upcoming wedding and my bachelor party day today (i.e. yesterday) being picked up by the news media, but the fact that not only do the Triton Submarine company have submarines for the 1000 feet and 3000 feet range, but they are actually aiming for realizing a submarine that will take passengers all the way to the deepest part of any ocean in the world – the Mariana Trench located in the western North Pacific Ocean . As you may know the depths here reaches approximately 36,000 feet.
Map Of The Mariana Trench
So in other words the race in now on.
As those who follow us on our facebook page may have picked up, in one of my recent posts, Sir Richard Branson of Virgin has set his heart on getting to the deep with his efforts that you can read more about on their Virgin Oceanic website. If you do not already follow us on Facebook, please visit our page there and click “like it”.

Don Walsh And Jacques Piccard in the bathyscaphe Trieste












But as mentioned he now has competition from Triton Submarines who will try to get there first. Last time and to my knowledge the only time someone ever went there was about 50 years ago in a tethered submarine called Trieste.
This was in 1960, January 23rd when Jacques Piccard and Don Walsh paid a visit in The Bathyscaphe Trieste pictured here to the deepest part named The Challenger Deep named after the British survey ship Challenger II, which discovered this deepest location in 1951.
Getting to 36,000 feet and come back alive is no small feat and is underlined by the fact that no such undertaking has taken place since the Trieste event in 1960. In fact the depth is deeper than the tallest mountain (Mount Everest) is high and actually if you placed Mount Everest at the same location it would still be covered by over a mile of water.
But the guys at Triton Submarines are genuine submariners with years of experience in the highly specialized industry.
Bruce Jones who is the CEO of Triton Submarine has more than 20 years in and a long history and experience to draw from from his work with US Submarines which includes the also work with underwater habitats and resorts. Flanked also by another submarine veteran Patrick Lahey as the President of Triton Submarines, who I believe have an even longer experience in submarines, Triton Submarines may just be the ones able to pull off the feat. In fact according to Triton Submarines’s brochure each member of the full time management and staff at the company averages 26.7 years of dedicated civil submarine and submersible experience. Including part time staff the group collectively represents more than 331 years of experience.
It is said that less than 3% of the seafloor has been explored and that even space has been explored to much greater extent. So much opportunities may still lie ahead for discoveries and with advances in technology and in submarines we may just see these depths being reached and explored in the foreseeable future.
Meanwhile the submarine dive that I am venturing out on may not go quite to these astronomical depths, but will nevertheless be going deeper than any dive I have ever done before and it will come with one extra very noticeable benefit: No need for decompression. The inside of the submarine is at 1 ATA, that is there is only one atmosphere inside the cockpit which is the same pressure that you have on land at sea-level and therefore you will have no need for decompression. Usually when you dive (i.e. without a submarine) then your are exposed to a rising pressure for each increment you dive further towards the depth. At 10 meters (33ft) the pressure is twice of that on the surface.
When under pressure your body uptakes nitrogen from your breathing gas (which for shallow dives may be just air) and your body may become supersaturated with it for deeper and longer dives and said nitrogen will need to be released when you exit your dive. Exiting your dive or simply going from deep to shallower at too great a speed and this nitrogen release becomes too swift and could cause the nitrogen to be released in bubble form which could be really hazardous or even fatal. Thus under normal scuba diving you would have to exit your dive by going shallower and shallower in a timely fashion which would often entail stopping at certain intervals for a given time. We call these stops decompression stops or deco stops for short. For very deep dives these stops become unavoidable and time consuming. In fact our friends at Global Underwater Explorers who on fairly regular basis are exploring and mapping the Wakulla caves near High Spring in Florida at an average depth of about 300 feet typically have to endure 14 hours of decompression time before they can exit the water again.
And this is just one issue with “conventional” diving. Other issues include gas mixes, managing all the gear you need to bring with you, stress factors etc., the elements including temperature effects of being in water and so on.
With the submarine you really have none of these issues. You are completely dry, in only one atmosphere, breathe just about regular air (submarines generally speaking utilizes rebreathing systems to ensuring breatheable air). And did I mention Stress? Physical and metal stress, which in a submarine is reduced or even non-existent. 
The Triton Submarine submarine, I discovered, is just about the friendliest submarine dive experience I could imagine. You sit comfortably in the cockpit which is inside a huge acyclic sphere and have great views almost all around you, including not least toward the bottom (something that is often not the case with many if not most submarines), but which is kind of important as this may be exactly what you want to go  and look at and study. Also you can sit and talk with your captain so that you can discuss what you are seeing. So anyways, all my fears of enclosure and images of implosion or being stuck or whatever came to shame. The experience was in one word AWESOME.
I will bring you soon more on this matter and not least images for you to enjoy. So do come back and check up on us when these are available. Also may I suggest that you sign up for our newsletter so that we can let you know whenever we have cool stuff to share with you. But let me end here with a teaser photo for you.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Introductory Statements  Information included or incorporated by reference in this filing may contain forward-looking statements. This information may involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from the future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements, which involve assumptions and describe our future plans, strategies and expectations, are generally identifiable by use of the words "may," "will," "should," "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "believe," "intend" or "project" or the negative of these words or other variations on these words or comparable terminology.  Overview  Brownie's Marine Group, Inc., a Florida corporation (referred to herein as "BWMG", "the Company", "we" or "Brownie's"), does business through its wholly owned subsidiary, Trebor Industries, Inc., d/b/a Brownie's Third Lung, a Florida corporation. The Company designs, tests, manufactures and distributes recreational hookah diving, yacht based scuba air compressor and nitrox generation systems, and scuba and water safety products. BWMG sells its products both on a wholesale and retail basis, and does so from its headquarters and manufacturing facility in Pompano Beach, Florida. The Company's common stock is quoted on the OTC Markets (Pink) under the symbol "BWMG". The Company's website is www.browniesmarinegroup.com. Information contained on the website is not part of this report.  Mr. Robert Carmichael, our Chief Executive Officer, has operated Trebor as its President since 1986. Since April 16, 2004, Mr. Carmichael has served as President, Acting Principal Accounting Officer and Acting Chief Financial Officer of the Company. From March 23, 2004 to April 16, 2004, Mr. Carmichael served as the Company's Executive Vice-President and Chief Operating Officer. The Company was organized under the laws of the State of Nevada and effective October 22, 2015, the Company reincorporated to the State of Florida pursuant to a plan of conversion, effective October 22, 2015.  The Company's diving and marine based products are generally marketed under the Brownie's Third Lung, Brownie's Tankfill, and Brownie's Public Safety trade names.  Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2017, as Compared to the Three Months Ended March 31, 2016  Net revenues. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, we had net revenues of $446,240 as compared to net revenues of $391,373 for the three months ended March 31, 2016, an increase of $54,867 or 14% The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in Tankfill and Nitrox sales to related parties, which increased from $110,012 to $158,423 between the periods. Sales of our hookah systems and related products to non-related parties remained relatively flat between periods. This change in sales and customer mix is not believed to be attributable to any particular sales trend or competitive pressures but rather normal fluctuations in market demand.  Cost of net revenues. Cost of net revenues declined during the first quarter 2017 compared to the first quarter 2016 representing, 56% of total net revenues compared to 86% for the prior year. This decline reflects the company's cost cutting efforts implemented in 2016 including a 34% reduction in direct factory labor costs and modified raw materials purchasing procedures further reducing direct manufacturing costs. Due to technical advances, we are now purchasing less expensive and high quality and efficient motors. Furthermore, we have also implemented "blanket purchase order" procedures. Despite the fact we operating in a seasonal industry, we are committing to strategic, larger purchase orders, which enables us to purchase at a discount, while increasing inventory. We are also purchasing certain materials from new vendors under better terms. The main product categories of our business, Brownie's Third Lung and Brownie's Tankfill, are seasonal in nature. The peak season for Brownie's Third Lung's products is the second and third quarters of the year. The peak season for Brownie's Tankfill's products is the fourth and first quarters of the year. Since the seasons complement one another, we are able to shift cross-trained factory and warehouse personnel between the two product categories as needed. Thus, the Company is able to avoid the down time normally associated with seasonal business.  Gross profit. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, we had a gross profit of $196,219 as compared to gross profit of $56,434 for the three months ended March 31, 2016, an increase of $139,785. This increase resulted from the 14% increase in total net revenues coupled with the reduction in cost of revenues as described above.  Operating expenses. Operating expenses remained relatively constant for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period of the preceding year. Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $151,334 and $152,806 for the three months ending March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This nominal decline, despite the 14% increase in net revenues between the periods, reflects the results of the Company's cost cutting efforts initiated in 2016.  Other (income) expense, net. Other (income) expense, net totaled $6,732 in expense and ($112,409) in income for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Other income expense for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was comprised of $990 in other income including $311 in interest income and $7,722 in interest expense. Other (income) expense for the three months ended March 31, 2016 was comprised transactions that are generally of a non-recurring nature. The three months ended March 31, 2016 included income of $93,838 resulting from the settlement of a convertible debenture and associated interest, $14,970 royalty payments, $13,870 reflecting an insurance audit adjustment and miscellaneous income amounts totaling $2,437.  Net Income. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, we had net income of $37,590 as compared to net income of $14,685 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. It should be noted that the net income for the first three months of 2016 was attributable to the $93,838 recognized on the settlement of a convertible note and related accrued interest. Absent this settlement transaction, we would have had a net loss during the first quarter 2016 of $79,153.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  As of March 31, 2017, the Company had cash and current assets (primarily consisting of inventory) of $1,049,406 and current liabilities of $834,207 or a current ratio of 1.26 to 1. This represents a working capital surplus of $215,199. This compares to working capital of $102,985 at December 31, 2016.  Net cash used in operating activities totaled $11,352 and $2,251 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net cash used in operating activities in the first quarter of 2017 included an increase in inventory of $88,931, a reduction in customers' deposits of $18,786 and an increase in accounts receivable of $11,116. The decline of $63,930 in royalties payable-related parties reflects the settlement of the $63,303 obligation through the issuance of 4,587,190 shares of our restricted common stock in March 2017, which did not require cash. These uses of cash were offset, in part, by a reduction in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $42,982, a reduction in accounts receivable-related parties of $12,634, an increase in accounts payable of $6,561 and depreciation and amortization of $8,801.  Net cash used in operating activities for the first quarter 2016 primarily reflected the non-cash gain on the collection of debt of $93,938 being offset by an increase in accounts payable of $48,655, a reduction in accounts receivable of $29,216 and depreciation and amortization expense recognized of $8,979.  The condensed unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business for the twelve-month period following the date of these financial statements. Although we had net income for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 and for the three months ending March 31, 2017, we have otherwise incurred annual losses since 2009, and expect we may have more losses in future periods.  The Company is behind on payments due for matured convertible debentures and certain vendor payables. The Company is handling delinquencies on a case by case basis. However, there can be no assurance that cooperation the Company has received thus far will continue. We currently do not have any product liability insurance and are a defendant in a wrongful death lawsuit and Trebor subject to a default judgment. In the event that we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification, product liabilities relating to defective products could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial conditions, which could force us to curtail or cease our business operations.  The Company does not expect that existing cash flow will be sufficient to fund presently anticipated operations. This raises substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern during the twelve- month period following the date of the financial statements included herein. The Company will need to raise additional funds and is currently exploring alternative sources of financing. We have issued a number of convertible debentures as an interim measure to finance our working capital needs. We have historically paid for some legal and consulting services with restricted stock to maximize working capital and intend to continue this practice in the future when possible. We have implemented some cost saving measures and will continue to explore more to reduce operating expenses.  If we fail to raise additional funds when needed, or do not have sufficient cash flows from sales, we may be required to scale back or cease operations, liquidate our assets and possibly seek bankruptcy protection. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  Certain Business Risks  The Company is subject to various risks, which may materially harm its business, financial condition and results of operations. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this report before deciding to purchase the Company's common stock. These are not the only risks and uncertainties that the Company faces. If any of these risks or uncertainties actually occurs, the Company's business, financial condition or operating results could be materially harmed. In that case, the trading price of the Company's common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment.  Our ability to continue as a going concern is in substantial doubt absent obtaining adequate new debt or equity financing and achieving sufficient sales levels.  Although we had net income of $37,590 and $230,026 (inclusive of $234,678 attributable to the cancellation of debt) for the three months ending March 31, 2017 and year ended December 31, 2016, respectively, we anticipate that losses may occur in the foreseeable future. Additionally, the Company has negative cash flows from operations, is behind on payments due for matured convertible debentures, and certain vendor payables. The Company is working out all matters of delinquency on a case by case basis. However, there can be no assurance that cooperation the Company has received thus far will continue. This raises a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our continued existence is dependent upon generating working capital and obtaining adequate new debt or equity financing. Because of our historical operational losses, we may not have working capital to permit us to remain in business during the twelve month period following the date of the financial statements included herein, without improvements in our cash flow from operations or new financing. Working capital limitations continue to impinge on our day-to-day operations, thus contributing to continued operating losses.  The optional conversion features of a series of convertible debentures issued by the Company could require the Company to issue a substantial number of shares of common stock, which will cause dilution to the Company's stockholders and a potentially negative effect on our stock price.  Since October 4, 2010 the Company has issued convertible debentures to several lenders and other third parties. At March 31, 2017, the outstanding principal balance of these debentures was $312,743. The debentures convert under various conversion formulas, many of which may be at a significant discount to market price of our common stock. The conversion of any of the debentures will result in the issuance of a significant number of shares of our common stock, which will cause dilution to our existing shareholders. Furthermore, the conversion at a significant discount to the market price of our common stock may have a negative effect on our stock price.  Our common stock may be affected by limited trading volume and may fluctuate significantly.  Our common stock is traded on the Over-the-Counter Markets. There is a limited public market for our common stock and there can be no assurance that an active trading market for our common stock will develop. As a result, this could adversely affect our shareholders' ability to sell our common stock in short time periods, or possibly at all. Thinly traded common stock can be more volatile than common stock traded in an active public market. Our common stock has experienced, and is likely to experience in the future, significant price and volume fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock without regard to our operating performance. In addition, we believe that factors such as quarterly fluctuations in our financial results and changes in the overall economy or the condition of the financial markets could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially.  Our company is a voluntary filer with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in the event that we cease reporting under the Exchange Act, investors would have limited information available to them about the company.  While we are subject to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, we do not have a class of securities registered under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. To the extent that our duty to file Exchange Act reports has automatically suspended under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as a voluntary filer, we may elect to cease reporting under the Exchange Act at such time, which would limit the information available to investors and shareholders about the company.  Our common stock is deemed to be "penny stock," which may make it more difficult for investors to sell their shares due to suitability requirements.  Our common stock is deemed to be "penny stock" as that term is defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ system, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system). Our common stock is covered by an SEC rule that imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell such securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors, which are generally institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000, or individuals with net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse.  Broker/dealers dealing in penny stocks are required to provide potential investors with a document disclosing the risks of penny stocks. Moreover, broker/dealers are required to determine whether an investment in a penny stock is a suitable investment for a prospective investor. These requirements may reduce the potential market for our common stock by reducing the number of potential investors. This may make it more difficult for investors in our common stock to sell shares to third parties or to otherwise dispose of them. This could cause our stock price to decline.  We depend on the services of our Chief Executive Officer.  Our success largely depends on the efforts and abilities of Robert M. Carmichael, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Carmichael has been instrumental in securing our existing financing arrangements. Mr. Carmichael is primarily responsible for the development of our technology and the design of our products. The loss of the services of Mr. Carmichael could materially harm our business because of the cost and time necessary to recruit and train a replacement. Such a loss would also divert management attention away from operational issues. We do not presently maintain a key-man life insurance policy on Mr. Carmichael.  We require additional personnel and could fail to attract or retain key personnel.  We are currently utilizing the services of professional consultants in the absence of a Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operations Officer. The loss of the services of these consultants prior to our ability to attract and retain a Chief Financial Officer or Chief Operations Officer may have a material adverse effect upon us. Also, there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our existing personnel or attract additional qualified associates in the future.  Our failure to obtain intellectual property and enforce protection would have a material adverse effect on our business.  Our success depends in part on our ability, and the ability of our patent and trademark licensors, entities owned and controlled by Robert M. Carmichael, our President and Chief Executive Officer, to obtain and defend our intellectual property, including patent protection for our products and processes, preserve our trade secrets, defend and enforce our rights against infringement and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties, both in the United States and in other countries. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual proprietary rights, existing copyright, trademark and trade secret laws afford only limited protection.  Our industry is characterized by frequent intellectual property litigation based on allegations of infringement of intellectual property rights. Although we are not aware of any intellectual property claims against us, we may be a party to litigation in the future.  We may be unable to manage growth.  Successful implementation of our business strategy requires us to manage our growth. Growth could place an increasing strain on our management and financial resources. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially harmed, and our stock price may decline.  Reliance on vendors and manufacturers.  We deal with suppliers on an order-by order basis and have no long-term purchase contracts or other contractual assurances of continued supply or pricing. In addition, we have no long-term contracts with our manufacturing sources and compete with other companies for production facility capacity. Historically, we have purchased enough inventories of products or their substitutes to satisfy demand. However, unanticipated failure of any manufacturer or supplier to meet our requirements or our inability to build or obtain substitutes could force us to curtail or cease operations.  Dependence on consumer spending.  The success of the our business depends largely upon a number of factors related to consumer spending, including current and future economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment, business conditions, tax rates, and interest rates. In times of economic uncertainty, consumers tend to defer expenditures for discretionary items, which affect demand for our products. Any significant deterioration in overall economic conditions that diminishes consumer confidence or discretionary income can reduce our sales and adversely affect our financial results. The impact of weakening consumer credit markets; layoffs; corporate restructurings; higher fuel prices; declines in the value of investments and residential real estate; and increases in federal and state taxation can all negatively affect our results. There can be no assurance that in this type of environment consumer spending will not decline beyond current levels, thereby adversely affecting our growth, net sales and profitability or that our business will not be adversely affected by continuing or future downturns in the economy, boating industry, or dive industry. If declines in consumer spending on recreational marine accessories and dive gear are other than temporary, we could be forced to curtail operations.  Government regulations may impact us.  The SCUBA industry is self-regulating; therefore, Brownie's is not subject to government industry specific regulation. Nevertheless, Brownie's strives to be a leader in promoting safe diving practices within the industry and is at the forefront of self-regulation through responsible diving practices. Brownie's is subject to all regulations applicable to "for profit" companies as well as all trade and general commerce governmental regulation. All required federal and state permits, licenses, and bonds to operate its facility have been obtained. There can be no assurance that our operations will not be subject to more restrictive regulations in the future, which could force us to curtail or cease operations.  Bad weather conditions could have an adverse effect on operating results.  Our business is significantly impacted by weather patterns. Unseasonably cool weather, extraordinary amounts of rainfall, or unseasonably rough surf, may decrease boat use and diving, thereby decreasing sales. Accordingly, our results of operations for any prior period may not be indicative of results of any future period.  Investors should not rely on an investment in our stock for the payment of cash dividends.  We have not paid any cash dividends on our capital stock and we do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the future. Investors should not make an investment in our common stock if they require dividend income. Any return on an investment in our common stock will be as a result of any appreciation, if any, in our stock price.  The manufacture and distribution of recreational diving equipment could result in product liability claims and we currently lack product liability insurance.  We, like any other retailer, distributor and manufacturer of products that are designed for recreational sporting purposes, face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results in injury. Such claims may include, among other things, that our products are designed and/or manufactured improperly or fail to include adequate instructions as to proper use and/or side effects, if any. We do not anticipate obtaining contractual indemnification from parties-supplying raw materials, manufacturing our products or marketing our products. In any event, any such indemnification if obtained will be limited by our terms and, as a practical matter, to the credit worthiness of the indemnifying party. We currently do not have any product liability insurance and are a defendant in a wrongful death lawsuit. In the event that we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification, product liabilities relating to defective products could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial conditions, which could force us to curtail or cease our business operations.  If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results. As a result, current and potential shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our stock.  Our management has previously determined that we did not maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting. For a detailed description of these material weaknesses and our remediation efforts and plans, see "Part II - Item 9A - Controls and Procedures." If the result of our remediation of the identified material weaknesses is not successful, or if additional material weaknesses are identified in our internal control over financial reporting, our management will be unable to report favorably as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and/or our disclosure controls and procedures, and we could be required to further implement expensive and time-consuming remedial measures and potentially lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which could have an adverse effect on our stock price and potentially subject us to litigation.  We currently have no independent directors, which poses a risk for us from a corporate governance perspective.  Robert Carmichael, our only executive officer, also serves as our only director. Our director and executive officer is required to make interested party decisions, such as the approval of related party transactions, his level of his compensation, and oversight of our accounting function. Our director and executive officer also exercise substantial control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the nomination of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions. Due to our lack of independent directors, we have not implemented various corporate governance measures, the absence of which may cause stockholders to have more limited protections against transactions implemented by our board of directors, conflicts of interest and similar matters. Stockholders should bear in mind our current lack of corporate governance measures in formulating their investment decisions.  Jun 19, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.
