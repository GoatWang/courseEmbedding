Introducing Glucose Health® Daily Blood Sugar Maintenance!
Glucose Health® Daily Blood Sugar Maintenance is a new and great-tasting sweet tea mix - but with an important difference!  Some clinical studies indicate the essential ingredients in Glucose Health® may help you maintain healthy blood sugar, triglycerides and cholesterol plus regular digestive health!
If you have been buying those expensive dairy shakes in a can to help keep your blood sugar balanced or to reduce those after-meal sugar spikes - like Glucerna Advance, Boost Glucose Control or Enterex Diabetic - consider Glucose Health® instead - the 60-Day container is so economical!
Glucose Health® is available exclusively at Walmart.com click here or at your local Walmart pharmacy in the "Diabetic Supplies" aisle.
Insulin resistance is the first indication of a potential future with health complications related to pre-diabetes and Type-2 diabetes. Insulin is a hormone which enables the cells in your body to absorb blood glucose. Insulin resistance occurs when higher than normal levels of glucose begin to accumulate in the blood.  Insulin resistance is associated with elevated levels of triglycerides and lower levels of HDL ("good" cholesterol).  Insulin resistance is an opportunity - if discovered - because it is reversible with changes to certain lifestyle factors.  Insulin resistance often progresses to pre-diabetes.  Today, more than 86 million persons are estimated to be prediabetic.  Pre-diabetes is also reversible with only modest changes in lifestyle.  Current research indicates pre-diabetes will generally progress to a diagnosis of Type-2 diabetes within 10 years if left un-managed.  Once a diagnosis of Type-2 diabetes is made, the management of cholesterol (lipid targets) becomes essential - in addition to managing blood sugar. The fact is persons with Type-2 diabetes have risk of major coronary events similar to that of (non-diabetic) individuals with already established coronary heart disease.  The bottom line - taking action today, can mean a more healthy future.

Glucose Health® the results don't start...until you do!
 



 







 You Decide! 
  
 Certain clinical studies indicate the nine (9) essential ingredients in Glucose Health® Daily Blood Sugar Maintenance may have important impacts on blood sugar, triglycerides and cholesterol plus regular digestive health.

 Take Control! 
  
 A healthy body mass index (BMI); our ethnicity and family medical history; more physical activity & lower stress; and good nutrition - these factors largely determine our risk for pre and Type-2 diabetes.

Glucose Health, Inc. Announces New Natural Product for Type-2 Diabetes Market | Business Wire


























































      Glucose Health, Inc. Announces New Natural Product for Type-2 Diabetes 
      Market
    





May 21, 2015 08:15 AM Eastern Daylight Time



BENTONVILLE, Ark.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Glucose Health, Inc. (OTCQB: GLUC) (the “Company”) today announced 
      completion of the first production run of Glucose Health™ Natural Blood 
      Sugar Maintenance – an innovative new product targeting the Type-2 
      Diabetes consumer market segment.
    

      Glucose Health™ is of particular interest to 86 million Americans – the 
      latest Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate of 
      persons who will develop Type-2 Diabetes in their lifetime.1 Glucose 
      Health™ is a superior product to the established national brands often 
      recommended by pharmacists, doctors and dieticians today, for four 
      compelling reasons:
    

      1. Glucose Health™ is a “good source of fiber” – fiber is well 
      established as supporting glycemic health.
    

      2. In addition to fiber, Glucose Health™ contains five additional 
      natural compounds – compounds certain peer-reviewed clinical studies 
      indicate have important impacts on glucose, insulin, triglycerides and 
      cholesterol.
    

      3. The proprietary Glucose Health™ formula combining fiber with five 
      beneficial natural compounds is not available from any other 
      manufacturer targeting the Type-2 diabetes consumer market segment.
    

      4. Glucose Health™ is offered in a delicious Blueberry Tea Mix, which 
      dissolves perfectly with 8-12 ounces of water and is 100% non-dairy.
    

      Glucose Health, CEO Murray Fleming commented:
    

      “Glucose Health™ is a product with a competitive edge in a growing 
      market segment. With Glucose Health™ product inventory available 
      beginning today, we now look forward to updating our shareholders and 
      other interested investors regarding our sales initiatives. We expect 
      our first sales related update the week of June 22, 2015, followed by 
      our periodic Securities and Exchange Commission filing on August 14, 
      2015.”
    

      About Glucose Health, Inc. (OTCQB: GLUC)
    

      Glucose Health, Inc. dietary products engage the large and growing 
      market of consumers aware of the seriousness of Type 2 diabetes and 
      proactively seeking natural blood sugar health solutions. The CDC 
      currently estimates 2 in 5 adults – 86 million Americans – will develop 
      Type 2 diabetes in their lifetime. Glucose Health, Inc. dietary products 
      are marketed to pharmacists, doctors and dieticians and via the 
      Company’s informative product website www.glucosehealth.com.

Glucose Health, Inc. Announces New Natural Product For Type-2 Diabetes Market






Business Wire




May 21, 2015 8:15 AM EDT













 




























































  Glucose Health, Inc. (OTCQB: GLUC) (the "Company") today announced completion of the first production run of Glucose Health™ Natural Blood Sugar Maintenance - an innovative new product targeting the Type-2 Diabetes consumer market segment.  Glucose Health™ is of particular interest to 86 million Americans - the latest Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate of persons who will develop Type-2 Diabetes in their lifetime. 1 Glucose Health™ is a superior product to the established national brands often recommended by pharmacists, doctors and dieticians today, for four compelling reasons:  1. Glucose Health™ is a "good source of fiber" - fiber is well established as supporting glycemic health.  2. In addition to fiber, Glucose Health™ contains five additional natural compounds - compounds certain peer-reviewed clinical studies indicate have important impacts on glucose, insulin, triglycerides and cholesterol.  3.

Style Scores:



NA Value | NA Growth | NA Momentum | NA VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score

Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.

The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

About Us
 
 
 
 

















 












Our History
Glucose Health, Inc. first conceived of a dietary supplement targeted to the large and growing market of proactive consumers interested in healthy blood sugar, triglycerides and cholesterol and regular digestive health in 2014.  A proprietary formula consisting of nine (9) essential ingredients, including extracts of green and white teas, extracts of cinnamon tree bark, chromium GTF (Glucose Tolerance Factor), soluble dietary fiber, was developed for the Company by Dr. Chandrasekhar Mallangi.  For 25 years Dr. Mallangi, now retired, managed the Nestle USA nutrition product development team responsible for household names such as Carnation Instant Breakfast.™ The formula created by Dr. Mallangi was initially conceived and marketed as a direct to consumer product and sold online via Amazon.com and at the Company's website. In addition to direct to consumer sales, Glucose Health® is now distributed via channel sales, through national & regional pharmacy retailers.







Our Market
The compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of the dietary supplement industry is 5.1% and total annual sales of dietary supplements now exceed $19 billion.2  The first study to comprehensively investigate and measure why one in two (50.1%) adult American consumers now chose to use dietary supplements, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, concluded the four most prevalent motivations were to “improve overall health,” to “maintain (good) health,” to “prevent health problems” and to “supplement the diet.”1 The National Diabetes Statistics Report, 2014, published by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), estimates more than 29 million Americans have diabetes - and fully one in three - more than 86 million Americans - have pre-diabetic symptoms (elevated fasting glucose and/or A1C levels).2  Type 2 diabetes touches virtually every American family and accordingly, the target market for Glucose Health, Inc. natural dietary supplement products are proactive consumers (i) interested in Type 2 diabetes and (ii) whose purchasing motivation is to maintain good health.   







Our Strategy
Glucose Health® sweet tea mix is the first product in its market segment to provide a pleasant-tasting and convenient powdered sweet tea mix alternative to the dairy-shake offerings of its principal competitors, Glucerna Advance, Boost Glucose Control and Enterex Diabetic. Glucose Health® Daily Blood Sugar Maintenance sweet tea mix is priced aggressively to its competitors, but at the same time includes essential ingredients demonstrated in certain clinical studies to have important relationships to blood sugar, triglycerides and cholesterol. Please visit our product site www.glucosehealth.com for citations. Glucose Health® sweet tea mix is also being developed in differentiated formats, including; "On the Go" stick packs for consumers interested in convenience and mobility; larger bulk containers for value-seeking consumers; and in various flavors including blueberry sweet tea mix, peach-mango sweet tea mix and pomegranate tea mix.
