The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.

Electrostatic Corona Separator
Electrostatic separators are for separation of metals and non-metals that cannot be separated by conventional magnetic separators such as: eddy-current separators, wind separators, or heavy-fluid separators. This unit is designed for separation of fine grain materials ranging from 0.1mm to 5 mm.





Eddy Current Rotary Kiln Dryer
The ECCD eddy current continuous dryer combines the age-old theory of eddy currents with the most advanced technology and materials resulting in an innovative thermal-energy generator for the 21st century. This system does not generate CO2 making it eco-friendly. Further, the drum generates heat on its own so no noise or dust is released into the environment. The line of magnetic force permeates the insulation material and causes the metal drum to generate and exceptional high thermally efficient...





Eddy Current Separator
Eddy current separators are useful for separation of aluminum, brass, copper, magnesium and other highly conductive but not necessarily magnetic attractive materials. This system uses a high-energy permanent magnet inside a high-speed drum. As high conductive materials pass over the drum and through the magnetic field an eddy current occurs repelling the materials respective to their conductivity pushing them a distance determined by Fleming’s left hand law. Applications include aluminum waste...





Magnetic Strainer
MS/SMS magnetic strainers are ideal for removing iron content, including fine iron powders and abrasive powders including some stainless steels, from foods, chemicals, paints, printing inks, lubricants, cutting oils, clay, pigments, dyes sugar, dissolved pulp used paper and other high concentration and high viscosity liquids. A variety of flanged are available as well as One-Touch-Release and Sanitary versions.





Twin-pole permanent magnet Separator
The TRMX works similar to, but is more powerful than, the EN or ENS magnetic separators. By placing two drums with magnetic poles opposite each other this generates a wide magnetic field that is also very strong, insuring accurate separation of certain types of scrap iron for which magnetic separation has traditionally been difficult.





Stainless Steel Separator
The HGMP stainless steel separator is specifically designed to generate the high-intensity magnetic force needed to remove weak magnetic materials such as stainless nails, bolts, and nuts, as well as flakes of stainless steel from food products, powdered materials, wood chips and similar products.





Electromagnet Drum Separator
The EDS electromagnet drum separator is typically used to recover scrap iron from bulk waste or in conjunction with a recycling shredder. The large drum is required because it is a course separation device and usually deals with medium to large pieces of scrap iron or ferrous metals.





Dry, Self-Cooled Suspension Electromagnet Separator
Magnetization strength degrades with heat, so after several hours of operation the relative strength of pulley type systems is reduced. The HUF-S is designed specifically to overcome these issues. HUF-S is a dry, self-cooled suspension type magnetic separator utilizing a patented hybridization method cooling system. Previously, oil-cooling and force air systems were implemented to reduce this heating effect. The HUF-S system avoids the pitfalls of oil-cooled systems or forced air-cooling systems...





Magnet Drum Sweeper
RS magnet drum sweeper is useful for collecting small bits of scrap metal, powder and magnetic attractive materials. Typical applications include, collecting screws and nails from traffic areas, collection of scrap at job sites and recovery of powders and scrap in production areas.





Electromagnetic MagHammerTM Impact Vibrator
SIC electromagnetic impact vibrator or MagHammer™ is a high impact force, low frequency impact vibrator for the free-flow of powder and bulk solids. This vibrator an internal piston driven by a pair of electromagnetic coils providing a strong impact force on the face of vibrator which is transferred to the mounting surface. This impact is similar to a slug hammer impact, without the damage to the bin or silo, in that is frees materials that are clogged or sticking to the sides of a bin or silo....
