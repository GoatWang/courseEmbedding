Econ – Robert received his training with Ernst & Young and has more than 35 years experience in US expatriate tax preparation. As one of the world’s leading experts in US expatriate taxation, he consults regularly with the IRS general counsel’s office in resolving complex practical tax return issues arising from on-going changes to the expatriate tax compliance regime. Robert has written extensively on US tax laws for several publications in the UK. He has on several occasions been a guest speaker for the American Chamber of Commerce in London. He is also a professional lute player.Daniel E Jaffe, BSc (Hons) Econ – Daniel read Economics at the London School of Economic and Political Science, graduating with First Class Honours, and began his career at the London branch of the Rothschild family investment bank. He is the first contact for all new clients joining Jaffe & Co, and is an expert on issues relating to Passive Foreign Investment Companies and "delinquent" filers. He has published writing on US tax in the FOCUS expat community magazine and given seminars on US expat tax at the London HQs of several blue-chip tech companies. In his spare time he enjoys cycling and playing squash. ​Our historyFor more than 30 years, American Tax International has been providing comprehensive tax preparation and compliance services for American expatriates living in the UK, throughout Europe, and around the world. As a boutique firm, we offer a comprehensive US/UK tax preparation service. In light of recent developments in both the US and UK taxation regimes affecting expatriates, we believe we are in a unique position to provide our clients with the highest possible level of service while helping them understand and comply with today’s complex multi-national tax issues.The firm was founded in 1981 by Robert E. Meunier, B. Econ, after completing his training with Ernst and Young. At Ernst and Young Robert became a senior tax manager in the expatriate department where he was recognised for his outstanding ability and contribution to the firm. Seeing the opportunity to provide a more personal service at a reasonable cost, in the early 1980s he formed American Tax International, Inc. with offices in Delaware and London.Over the years the firm continued to grow and established a strong clientèle ranging from artists, writers, academics to entrepreneurs, lawyers and financiers in the UK and throughout Europe.In late 1999, American Tax International Inc., merged with Jaffe & Co to form one of the leading US expatriate accounting firms outside of the Big Four. Operating from its premises in the historic Church End district of Finchley, North London, the firm continues to provide state-of-the-art tax preparation services at a fraction of the cost of our major competitors, while producing the same exact product of the Big Four firms. We are proud of the personal service we are able to provide to our clients. We feel that the size of our current client base is a reflection of the level of services provided.
