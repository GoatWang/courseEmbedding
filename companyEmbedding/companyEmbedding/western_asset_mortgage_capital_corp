Western Asset Mortgage Capital Corp. | Investment Strategy











  
			














 







Our Manager's investment philosophy, which developed from a singular focus in fixed-income asset management over a variety of credit cycles and market conditions, is to provide clients with diversified, tightly controlled, long-term value-oriented portfolios. Through rigorous analysis of all sectors of the fixed-income market, our Manager seeks to identify assets with the greatest risk-adjusted total value potential. In making investment decisions on our behalf, our Manager incorporates its views on the economic environment and the outlook for the mortgage markets. We expect to benefit from the breadth and depth of our Manager’s overall investment philosophy, which focuses on a macroeconomic analysis as well as an in-depth analysis of individual assets and their relative value.
We rely on our Manager's expertise in asset allocation and identifying attractive assets within our investment strategy. Although our core investment strategy is focused on Agency RMBS, Agency CMBS and Residential and Commercial Whole Loans , our Manager’s expertise in related investment disciplines such as Non-Agency RMBS, Non-Agency CMBS, ABS, and GSE risk sharing securities provides our Manager with both (1) valuable investment insights to our Agency securities investment selection and strategy and (2) flexibility to invest in assets other than Agency RMBS and CMBS opportunistically as market conditions warrant.
Team-Based Investment Approach

               	Our investment process is based on a collaborative team approach utilizing a combination of bottom-up research and top-down macroeconomic analysis. This approach begins with the development of a global investment outlook that includes forecasting economic growth, interest rates, inflation and credit spreads. Strategies are then driven by the difference between our interpretation of market fundamentals and what has been generally priced into securities in the market. Using a disciplined investment approach, our Manager sets targets for asset allocation, duration and credit quality for each sector of the fixed-income market. This view is then carefully laid against expectations already priced into the markets in order to arrive at an investment strategy and portfolio structure.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Western Asset Mortgage Capital Corporation To Report Second Quarter 2017 Financial Results






Western Asset Mortgage Capital About To Put More Money In Your Pocket (WMC)













Western Asset Mortgage Capital Corporation Declares Second Quarter Dividend Of $0.31 Per Share


Jun 20, 2017 4:15 PM EDT









Western Asset Mortgage Capital Named Top Dividend Stock With Insider Buying and 11.74% Yield (WMC)
In this series, we look through the most recent Dividend Channel ''DividendRank'' report, and then we cherry pick only those companies that have experienced insider buying within the past six months. The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both.

Jun 20, 2017 4:07 PM EDT









WMC Crosses Above Average Analyst Target
In recent trading, shares of Western Asset Mortgage Capital Corp have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $10.33, changing hands for $10.37/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level.

Western Asset Mortgage Capital Corp. | Investment Strategy











  
			














 







Our Manager's investment philosophy, which developed from a singular focus in fixed-income asset management over a variety of credit cycles and market conditions, is to provide clients with diversified, tightly controlled, long-term value-oriented portfolios. Through rigorous analysis of all sectors of the fixed-income market, our Manager seeks to identify assets with the greatest risk-adjusted total value potential. In making investment decisions on our behalf, our Manager incorporates its views on the economic environment and the outlook for the mortgage markets. We expect to benefit from the breadth and depth of our Manager’s overall investment philosophy, which focuses on a macroeconomic analysis as well as an in-depth analysis of individual assets and their relative value.
We rely on our Manager's expertise in asset allocation and identifying attractive assets within our investment strategy. Although our core investment strategy is focused on Agency RMBS, Agency CMBS and Residential and Commercial Whole Loans , our Manager’s expertise in related investment disciplines such as Non-Agency RMBS, Non-Agency CMBS, ABS, and GSE risk sharing securities provides our Manager with both (1) valuable investment insights to our Agency securities investment selection and strategy and (2) flexibility to invest in assets other than Agency RMBS and CMBS opportunistically as market conditions warrant.
Team-Based Investment Approach

               	Our investment process is based on a collaborative team approach utilizing a combination of bottom-up research and top-down macroeconomic analysis. This approach begins with the development of a global investment outlook that includes forecasting economic growth, interest rates, inflation and credit spreads. Strategies are then driven by the difference between our interpretation of market fundamentals and what has been generally priced into securities in the market. Using a disciplined investment approach, our Manager sets targets for asset allocation, duration and credit quality for each sector of the fixed-income market. This view is then carefully laid against expectations already priced into the markets in order to arrive at an investment strategy and portfolio structure.
