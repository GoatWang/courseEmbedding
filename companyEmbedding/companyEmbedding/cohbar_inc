CohBar, Inc. Announces Private Placement Offering






GlobeNewswire



Jun 23, 2017 9:00 AM EDT













 


















































 MENLO PARK, Calif., June 23, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CohBar, Inc. (OTCQX:CWBR) (TSXV:COB.U) ("CohBar" or the "Company"), a preclinical stage biotechnology company focused on developing mitochondria based therapeutics (MBTs) to treat age-related diseases, announced today that it intends to complete a non-brokered private placement offering (the "Offering") of up to 3,333,334 units ("Units") at a price of US$1.50 per unit for gross proceeds of up to US$5,000,000. Each unit will consist of one share of the Company's common stock and one common stock purchase warrant (each a "Warrant").  Each Warrant will entitle the holder to purchase one share of common stock at a price of US$2.25 per share at any time prior to June 30, 2020. The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the Offering primarily to advance its lead drug candidates and for general corporate purposes. Closing of the Offering is subject to the approval of the TSX Venture Exchange.  There can be no assurance that the Offering will be completed, whether in whole or in part.  The Offering is being made pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), solely to "accredited investors" (as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act) and in Canada pursuant to exemptions from the prospectus requirements of applicable Canadian securities laws. The securities offered in the Offering will not be or have not been registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any state of the United States, and may not be offered or sold in the U.S. absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. Under the terms of the Offering the Company will agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to file and have declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission a registration statement on Form S-1 for purposes of registering the resale of the shares of common stock issued with the Units and the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants.

CohBar Advances First-in-Class Mitochondria Based Therapeutic to IND-Enabling Activities

Menlo Park, California – September 30, 2016 – CohBar, Inc. (OTCQX: CWBR and TSXV: COB.U), an innovative biotechnology company focused on developing mitochondria based therapeutics (MBTs) for age-related diseases, today announced the selection of two analogs from the company’s MOTS-c program for advancement into IND-enabling activities. The drug candidates, CB4209 and CB4211, have demonstrated significant therapeutic potential in pre-clinical models for the treatment of obesity, with additional confirmatory studies planned to determine therapeutic potential for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and as a potential add-on to other drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
“We see this milestone as an important step in demonstrating the enormous potential of mitochondria based therapeutics for the treatment of metabolic disorders underlying age-related diseases. Our extensive preclinical studies with our internally developed MOTS-c analogs continue to validate their novel mechanisms of action for metabolic regulation and protection,” said Simon Allen, CohBar’s CEO. “Our MBT studies demonstrated significantly greater weight loss together with more selective reduction of fat mass versus lean mass in head-to-head comparison to a market-leading obesity drug. We also observed improvements in triglyceride levels with MBT treatment, as well as favorable effects on liver enzyme markers associated with fatty liver disease and NASH.”
MOTS-c belongs to a novel class of peptides derived from the mitochondrial genome. Until recently, scientists believed the mitochondrial genome contained only 37 genes and, as a result, it had been relatively unexplored as a focus of drug discovery efforts. Research by CohBar founders and their academic collaborators revealed that the mitochondrial genome has dozens of potential new genes that encode peptides.  In preclinical models of age-related diseases, a number of these peptides have shown potential disease-modifying effects including metabolic, neuro-protective, cyto-protective and anti-inflammatory effects. CohBar’s efforts are focused on developing MOTS-c and its expanding portfolio of mitochondrial-derived peptides into mitochondria based therapeutics (MBTs).
CohBar is initiating IND-enabling activities and confirmatory studies for both of these first-in-class MOTS-c analog drug candidates, with the goal of initiating human clinical studies in early 2018.
CohBar will host a conference call and WebEx for investors on October 13, 2016 to provide additional details on the Company’s preclinical studies and the potential of these MBTs to address the unmet medical needs and market opportunities in obesity, NASH and type 2 diabetes (details provided below).
Obesity
Obesity is now recognized as the most prevalent metabolic disease world-wide, reaching epidemic proportions in both developed and developing countries and affecting all age groups.  More than one-third of the U.S. adult population, and over 40% of U.S. age groups between 45 and 75, have obesity.  The prevalence of class III, or morbid, obesity (body mass index ≥40) has increased dramatically in several countries and currently affects 6% of adults in the US, with an estimated increase of 130% over the next two decades. Obesity is a major risk factor for age-related diseases such as heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer.
Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH)
NASH is a serious chronic liver disease characterized by inflammation and excessive fat accumulation in the liver that can lead to progressive fibrosis, cirrhosis, liver failure and cancer. It most often occurs in persons who are middle-aged and overweight or obese, and ranks as one of the major causes of cirrhosis in America. NASH is estimated to affect as many as 15 million people in the US. There are currently no approved therapies for the treatment of NASH.
Conference Call and WebEx Information:
Date: October 13, 2016
Time: 1:30 p.m. (PST)
Audio, Dial-in U.S. and Canada: (888) 634-7543
